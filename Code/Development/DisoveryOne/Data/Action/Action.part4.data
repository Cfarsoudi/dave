                         "COMMANDO"
          BLACK SCREEN. One word explodes towards us with cold
          brutality: COMMANDO. It FADES... leaves us in darkness.
          And we HEAR a growing ROAR... a frightening RUMBLE.

                         FADE IN

          EXT. SUBURBAN CUL-DE-SAC - DAY 1

          TIGHT ON the churning compactor of a garbage truck.
          The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we SEE the truck, battered
          and olive-grey. A bored garbage man with a kerchief
          over his mouth hangs on the back of the truck as it
          moves along the street.

          INT. BEDROOM - CLOSE ON THE BED - DAY 2

          As LAWSON awakes with a start. He's late 30's, a little
          worn. He shakes his WIFE.

                         LAWSON
          What's that?

                         WIFE

                         (BARELY AWAKE)
          Unnn...sounds like...

                         (STIFLING YAWN)
          .the garbage men.

                         LAWSON
          On Tuesday?

                         WIFE

                         (YAWNING)
          Maybe they changed the
          schedule...
          Lawson listens to the noise as it APPROACHES, finally
          throws his feet into his bedroom slippers.

                         LAWSON
          Shit.

          INT. LAWSON'S HOUSE - PANTRY 3

          He runs into the pantry, dragging several ungainly
          plastic trash bags.

                         A85

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         2

          EXT. LAWSON'S HOUSE - DAY 4

          The truck SOUND is CLOSER now. We can SEE it at the
          end of the long driveway.
          Lawson flings the green plastic bags into two battered
          and half-full metal cans, starts running down the
          driveway.

                         LAWSON

                         (SHOUTING)
          Wait a minute, wait a minute!

          END OF DRIVEWAY - DAY 5
           The truck stops at the bottom of the driveway. Lawson
          stumbles his way towards it, smiles.

                          LAWSON
          I was afraid you'd miss me --

                         REVERSE ANGLE 6
          COOKE -- The man behind the truck -- pulls an Ingram
          submachine gun INTO VIEW. At the same moment, the cab
          of the garbage truck is kicked open and DIAZ, the
          driver, leans out, similarly armed.

                         COOKE
          Don't worry-we won't.
          And they cut Lawson down, the bullets raking across his
          body and the cans.

                         LONG SHOT 7
          Lawson falls back, spread-eagled. The garbage cans,
          pierced and leaking, roll TOWARD THE CAMERA, blocking
          our view just as Cooke moves close to administer a
          coup de grace.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. AUTOMOBILE DEALERSHIP - DAY 8

          FORRESTAL grins INTO THE CAMERA.

          You ain't seen nothin' yet.

          8 Cont.
          CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW us that Forrestal is just now
          closing the trunk of a big new Cadillac. He's showing
          it to Diaz, who nods and makes noncommital NOISES as
          Forrestal continues the hype.

                         FORRESTAL
          (as trunk closes)
          Hear that sound? American
          workmanship. You think the
          Japanese invented that? Bullshit
          We did...sure, we lost it for a
          while-but we got 'it back.
          Diaz gets into the car.

                         FORRESTAL
          Sure, get in...comfy, right? I
          know what you're gonna say...
          it's cloth. But take it from
          me-you don't want leather, it's
          hot, it cracks, it's trouble.
          And look at the head room.. .you're
          not gonna have a problem...
          Diaz starts the engine.

                         FORRESTAL
          Go ahead, start it up. Hear that?
          That's power-that's performance
          .that's -- Jesus Christ --
          Forrestal has said this last because Diaz has thrown
          the car into reverse, knocking down a big display.

                         FORRESTAL
          Hey!

                         ANOTHER ANGLE 9
          Diaz slams the car into forward, hits the accelerator
          and ROARS across the display room floor.
          The car SLAMS into Forrestal, flinging his body across
          the hood. The car continues on, CRASHES through the
          outside window and disappears down the street.

          Dangling working lights illuminate the night. The
          tuna fleet is in.

          DOCK - CLOSE ON BENNETT
          mid-thirties, well muscled, BENNETT helps another
          worker wrestle a net of fish into a hold, then he
          wipes his brow and shouts over the. noise.

                         BENNETT
          That's all for me, Les.
          Les nods. Bennett steps off the boat, crosses over
          another boat and steps onto his boat.

                         12

                         BENNETT'S BOAT
          Bennett starts his boat, revs the throttle, then pulls
          away from the other boats. The wind whips his hair
          as he cruises out into the night.

          The boat moves away from us, then WHOOM, the boat
          EXPLODES into a fireball, sending debris high into
          the air.

          EXT. DOCK AREA - NIGHT 14

          A man comes out of the shadows on the dock and watches
          the explosion, the fiery lights splashing onto his
          face. It's Cooke - the "garbage man."

          EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY

          MAIN TITLES BEGIN...and along with them we HEAR MUSIC.
          The CAMERA SKIMS OVER snow-capped peaks, pine trees
          twinkling dew in the morning light.
          Then we SEE it: An 80's version of a log cabin...with
          crisp, clean lines...energy efficient and snug.

                         A85

                         ANOTHER ANGLE 16
          as a giant FIGURE descends from the mountains behind
          the house balancing a giant log on his right shoulder
          and carrying a chain saw in his left hand.
          This is COLONEL JOHN ALEXANDER MATRIX. He's in his
          mid-thirties ...a man of raw power and vitality...and
          something else: Joy. Joy, and a sense of calm.
          Matrix reaches a shed behind the cabin. He puts down
          the log and chain saw, then picks up firewood and begins
          to SPLIT it with awesome single swipes of an axe.

                         INTERCUT:

          LOW ANGLE - HOUSE 17
          as a shadow comes stealthily alongside the house and
          begins to slowly and cautiously advance on Matrix.

                         INTERCUT:

          MATRIX AND APPROACHING PERSON 18
          Matrix doesn't turn or otherwise seem to see the other
          person...but he reacts to little things:

          EXT. HOUSE - SERIES OF SHOTS AND SOUNDS - DAY 19-


                         23

          C. SOME PEBBLES
          roll away.

          D. A GATE
          responds with a faint creak while:

          E. THE AXEHEAD
          reflects a dull, indistinct figure approaching
          Matrix from behind.
          None of the above escapes matrix's eye...and then, at
          the last possible second, he WHIRLS and confronts:

                         A85

          NEW ANGLE 24 s
          Matrix sweeps up the intruder-his eleven-year-old
          daughter, JENNY. She laughs as he tickles her.

                         JENNY
          Dad... Dad... put me down.
          She tickles him back on his neck and ribs...he laughs,
          puts her down.

                         MATRIX
          I surrender, I surrender.
          He raises his hands, open, trusting. Instantly she
          attacks again, then runs like hell as he pursues her,

          MUSIC CONTINUES.

          EXT. ROADSIDE ICE CREAM STAND - DAY 25

          Matrix's Blazer is parked here. Father and daughter
          sit across from each other-she has a cone, he has a
          dish. He uses his spoon to steal some of her flavor
          and jimmies...he gets away with this twice before she
          pokes him on the nose with the cone. He wipes ice cream
          from his face.

          EXT. CABIN STREAM AREA - DAY 26

          Matrix and Jenny are trout fishing in a beautiful
          stream. A deer tentatively approaches and matrix and
          Jenny take food from a knapsack and hold it out for
          the deer. The deer comes closer, takes the food from
          them, then licks their hands.

                         MATRIX 26-A

          and he pretends she's knocked him over.

          crosses the stream, as they head back to the cabin.

          INT. CABIN - DAY 27

          Matrix goes to open the refrigerator in his cabin a
          stops. Taped to the door is a cutout of a heart:
          Jenny is peeking at Matrix from around the corner of the
          kitchen. He sees her, he smiles, and they meet and hug.

          MUSIC AND TITLES END.

          INT. HOUSE DINING ROOM - LATER - DAY 28

          Matrix sits at the table as Jenny serves lunch. The
          view through the expansive picture window is breathtaking.
          Matrix leafs through some of Jenny's rock'n'roll
          magazines.

                         MATRIX
          When I was a boy and rock and
          roll came to East Germany, the
          communists said it was subversive...

                         (SLIGHT SMILE)
          .They were right...

                         (BITES INTO

          .What's in this?

                         JENNY
          You don't want to know.
          Suddenly Matrix gets an odd look on his face ...he stands,
          cocks his head.

                         JENNY
          What's wrong?
          He shushes her, puts his hand up to block the sun as he
          peers through the picture window. Now Jenny -- and the
          audience -- can SEE what matrix's keen senses have
          already heard-an approaching aircraft.

          MATRIX'S P.O.V. - HELICOPTER 29
          with U.S. Army markings, coming towards the house...
          then veering off for a landing.

                         TWO SHOT 30

                         JENNY
          You said you wouldn't go away
          again. You said you were through --

                         MATRIX

           Promise.

                         THE COPTER 31
          It lands. Three men get out.
          GENERAL FRANKLIN KIRBY is in the lead. He's in his early
          50's, fit, energetic -- and, as we can SEE -- the pilot
          of the craft. He's wearing rugged Army Class "C's."
          The two young soldiers with him are HARRIS and JACKSON.
          They wear BDU's and carry carbines. At a look from
          Kirby they fan out, and watch the cabin.

                         KIRBY 32
          Kirby approaches the cabin.

                         KIRBY

                         (CALLING OUT)
          John, come on out. It's Kirby.

                         MATRIX
           (o.s.)
          I know.
          Startled, Kirby whirls to see Matrix standing behind him.

                         KIRBY
          Silent and smooth...just like
          always.
          He smiles and he and Matrix come together and shake hands.

                         MATRIX
          I better be. You taught me.
          He affectionately squeezes Kirby's shoulder.
          Jenny comes out of the cabin toward the two men.

                         KIRBY
          I need to talk to your dad, Jenny.

                         JENNY
          No way, Jose.
          Matrix gives her a sharp look and Jenny grudgingly goes
          back inside. Kirby and Matrix begin to walk as clouds
          billow high above the mountaintops around them.

          Syrians, the South Africans, the
          Russians-or a terrorist group.

          They're gonna find you.
          Matrix looks toward the cabin. Jenny is watching him
          through a window. Matrix turns back to Kirby and they
          begin walking back to the cabin.

          MATRIX - LATER 37
          watches the chopper lift off and fly away. Jenny,
          subdued, comes out of the cabin.

                         JENNY
          Is it bad?

          Then it can't be bad.
          She smiles.
          An intense look comes over Matrix's face, then
          -- In a BLUR, he sweeps up Jenny in his arms just
          before machine gun fire BLASTS the cabin. The VOLLEY
          OF FIRING SHATTERS the windows and RIPS OPEN Harris'
          chest, his blood SPLATTERING against the cabin.
          .Matrix, still clutching Jenny, DIVES through the door
          into the cabin and HITS the floor. Jackson CATCHES
          a round in the shoulder, SPINS to the ground, then
          crawls through the door after Matrix.
          The three of them lie on the cabin floor as the FIRING
          CONTINUES to BLAST AWAY at Harris' body, the rounds
          SMACKING into the side of the cabin.
          Then the firing stops. Silence.

          Jenny goes into her bedroom and Matrix goes out the

          EXT. CABIN - DAY 38

          He races to the shed, unlocks it, goes inside to a
          high-tech cabinet and opens it.
          Inside is an H&K assault rifle, two big banana clips of
          ammunition and a Baretta JS pistol. Matrix pulls
          the weapons out and readies them.

          Jackson peers out the window, sees nothing, then edges
          back to the floor. Two hands WHIP a garotte around his
          neck and CHOKE the struggling Jackson to death.

                         JENNY 40
          hears a THUMP and sticks her head out from under her
          bed to look, but sees nothing. Suddenly, footsteps
          approach her bedroom door. She pulls her head back
          under the bed just as two boots enter her bedroom.
          A knife is attached to one of the boots.

          Matrix puts the pistol in his waistband and SLAMS
          home a clip in the rifle. He RACES out of the shed,
          RUSHES to the cabin and OPENS the backdoor.
          Jackson, garotte still around his neck, falls lifelessly
          through the door STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERA.
          Matrix ducks as Jackson GLANCES off him and CRUMPLES
          to the ground.

          Matrix, H&K rifle held ready, silently enters, then
          moves carefully through the cabin. He peers into the den
          and sees Diaz, one of the men who killed Matrix's men,
          sitting in a chair, looking at Jenny's

                         QÏ¿½91
          Matrix steps forward and points his rifle directly at
          Diaz.

                         MATRIX
          Where is she?
          Diaz smiles and puts his feet up on a table.

                         DIAZ
          Mellow out, man. We can't talk
          business with you waving guns
          in people's faces.
          Matrix puts the rifle against Diaz's forehead and COCKS
          the trigger. The smile vanishes from Diaz's face.

                         DIAZ
          She's safe, Major. Whether
          she stays that way.is up to
          you. My people got some
          business with you...
          Matrix hears a NOISE outside, glances out the window
          and sees two vehicles RACING away from the house.

                         DIAZ
          .and if you want your kid
          back, you gotta cooperate.
          Right?

          Matrix levels the H&K and BLASTS Diaz in the chest.
          Diaz and the chair are JERKED violently backward.

          Matrix JUMPS out of the cabin and RACES to the BLAZER,
          its hood up. He checks the engine.
          Torn wires stick up, the distributor cap is disconnected
          and broken.

          He looks down the mountain and sees the vehicles winding
          along the mountain roads.
          Matrix slams the Blazer's hood...gets inside...puts his
          weapons on the seat...then releases the brake. Then,
          one hand on the wheel, the other on the door frame, he
          begins to push the car.
          He steers it not towards the dirt road, but towards the
          shoulder where a steep incline leads downward. Since
          the Blazer is pointed the wrong way, Matrix is pushing
          it uphill-the effort is incredible... the veins on his
          neck stand out...with a SCREAM, he puts everything he's
          got into it... and finally it begins to roll downwards.
          Matrix leaps in. Snaps on the driver's shoulder belt...
          reaches over and wraps the passenger belt around his
          body as well.
          The Blazer rolls over the edge.

          Matrix fights to control the wheel. A low-hanging

          It takes another curve. CAMERA PANS UP, and we SEE the
          Blazer, coming closer and closer by this direct route.

                         THE BLAZER 47
          It barrels down the mountainside, out of control,
          smashing through trees, bounding off rocks, dropping
          like a stone.

          INT. BLAZER 48

          Matrix is taking a terrible beating. But he's almost
          down to the road...ahead of the black vehicle!

          WIDE ANGLE - WINDING ROAD 49
          The two vehicles narrowly miss each other-the dark
          car almost spins out.

                         THE BLAZER 50
          It careens past the other car, slams into a huge boulder
          -- flips -- ROLLS OVER AND OVER.

          The wrecked Blazer is BURNING, then suddenly EXPLODES.
          The CAMERA HOLDS ON this, what looks like Matrix's
          funeral pyre.
          Then we SEE movement and SEE a bloodied and injured
          Matrix crawling away from the intense fire.
          He stops and looks back at the destroyed Blazer.

                         WIDER ANGLE 53
          A large group of armed soldiers start to surround
          Matrix.
          He stands up, cut, bleeding. The lead man approaches
          to frisk him.

                         MATRIX 54
          Matrix ELBOWS him in the stomach, DRIVES his fist into
          the man's Adam's apple, PULLS HIM DOWN, CRACKS the man's
          vertebrae, grabs the dead man's rifle and SLAMS the butt
          against the face on the man closing on him. The man's
          jaw SHATTERS.
          But three more men are immediately on Matrix and they
          wrestle him to the ground. He forces his way up again, the
          three men still all over him.
          Matrix's eyes suddenly WIDEN as he looks at two boots with
          an attached knife, then up at the man standing in them.
          It's Bennett, the man we saw die!

          You can get close to Velasquez,
          you will kill him...We've gone
          to alot of trouble to find you.
          We faked Bennett's death so
          Kirby would get nervous and lead
          us to you. And now that I have
          you, you'll do what I tell you.

                         MATRIX
          And if I don't?
          Arius looks at Matrix for a beat, then Arius nods to
          Bennett.
          Bennett opens a sliding door to a closet and matrix sees
          Jenny.
          She is gagged and tied tightly to a chair. She is
          shaking from fear and her eyes are wet with tears.
          Matrix LUNGES up from the table, but his hands and feet
          are chained to the table and he is STOPPED.
          Bennett wheels Jenny out of the closet over to Arius.
          Arius begins to finger her hair.

                         ARIUS

          can't move.
          Arius fingers the shirt collar around her neck.

                         ARIUS

          Soldiers are searching around and inside the cabin.
          One of the Soldiers approaches Kirby.

          They eye each other, then Sully shuts the door and
          Matrix watches the limo drive off.
          Henriques and Sully flank Matrix and they enter the
          terminal.

          INT. TERMINAL - DAY 62

          The three of them pass through the terminal. Matrix
          looks toward two police officers that are right next to

          INT. PLANE - DAY 64

          Henriques and Matrix enter the plane. A STEWARDESS
          smiles at them and examines their tickets.

                         STEWARDESS
          First class, seats seven A and B.
          They are the last passengers to be seated. They walk
          down the aisle, Matrix takes the window seat and
          Henriques the aisle seat.
          A NOISE attracts Matrix's attention and he watches the
          door to the entrance tunnel CLOSE. The Stewardesses
          prepare for the takeoff as the plane's engines begin
          to RUMBLE.
          Matrix edgily looks around the plane.
          The Stewardess approaches him.

                         STEWARDESS
          You must fasten your seat belt,
          Sir.
          Matrix looks out the window and sees Sully looking right
          back at him through the waiting room window.
          Matrix turns to the Stewardess.

                         MATRIX
          Could I have a blanket and
          pillow?

          The plane is beginning to move.
          Matrix begins to arrange the blanket and pillow. As soon
          as the Stewardess moves off, Matrix DELIVERS an
          incredibly SUDDEN BLOW to Henriques' temple. WHAP!
          Henriques' eyes roll back in his head, blood trickles
          out of his mouth, his body goes limp and he falls
          against Matrix.
          It's happened so quickly none of the other passengers
          have noticed it.
          Matrix throws the blanket over Henriques' body, looks
          around, then quickly FORCES Henriques' neck down
          toward his chest.

          CRACK.
          Matrix stands and opens the overhead luggage rack. He
          picks up the blanket covered body and puts it in the
          overhead rack. The 2ND STEWARDESS comes by.

                         2ND STEWARDESS
          Sir, can I help you with that?

                         MATRIX
          It's no problem.
          He smiles at her and she smiles back. He closes the
          luggage compartment door and turns to the Stewardess.

          Cates moves into the doorway, casually glances at
          Matrix watching the bar, then Cates moves out of
          Matrix's view. He removes the walkie-talkie from
          his belt and speaks into it.

          Sully is in conversation with the Latin man, unaware

          Cindy sneaks a look outside and sees Biggs and his

          Biggs confidently walks along the top level, the

          He exits from the bar and moves toward Matrix. Cindy
          waits, biting her lip, wondering if she's done the
          wrong thing.
          Sully, still talking to the Latin, looks up and finally
          notices Cindy. He moves through the dancers toward her.

          Matrix anxiously glances at his watch, then looks up
          toward the bar. Cindy comes out into the doorway
          where he can see her. She glances behind him, then
          helplessly looks right at him.
          Matrix, noticing her glance behind him, turns around.
          Five security guards are now approaching him.

          Matrix, seeing him run, turns back to the guards
          advancing on him and SMASHES the lead guard (Biggs)
          right in the face.
          Biggs is BLASTED backward into the other guards,
          KNOCKING two of them down.
          Matrix sees Sully running and then looks where's he's
          headed.

                         MATRIX

          NO!!!
          He jumps over the railing, LEAPS across an open chasm,
          DROPS eight feet toward a stairway, then RUSHES upward.
          Sully gets in the phone booth and quickly drops in a
          quarter. In the b.g., Matrix is RACING right toward
          the booth!
          Sully tries to dial as fast as he can. His face starts
          to CONTORT as he sees Matrix getting CLOSER and CLOSER.
          Sully's face is wet with sweat.
          Sully pulls out his gun and FIRES through the windowpane
          at the steadily looming Matrix. He misses. He won't
          get another chance.
          Matrix PICKS UP THE ENTIRE PHONE BOOTH, RIPS it from
          the wall and SMASHES it against the railing.
          People all over the Galleria begin to SCREAM.
          The Latin man dashes out of the bar with his gun drawn.
          Two real Los Angeles POLICE OFFICERS, racing up the
          escalator with their guns drawn, see the Latin.
          Cindy drops to the ground as the Officers aim at him.

                         OFFICER
          Freeze!!
          The Latin SHOOTS away at the Officers, BLASTING one in
          the chest and KNOCKING him rolling and tumbling backwards
          down the escalator.
          The other Officer FIRES AWAY at the Latin, hitting him
          twice. The Latin SLAMS agains the railing, the briefcase
          bursting open.

          The Latin, blood oozing out his stomach and eyes
          drifting in his head, reaches over the railing to grasp
          futilely at the money. He reaches too far.

                         SHOOTING UP 119
          The Latin drops over the third floor railing, falling
          right through the drifting bills and CRASHES to the
          floor.

          MATRIX AND SULLY 120
          Matrix tries to force open the broken phone booth door
          to get at Sully, but the bloodied Sully crawls out the
          other way through a broken window pane, hangs from the
          railing and drops to the stairwell below.
          People continue to SCREAM and hug the floor.
          Sully turns around and BLASTS a shot at Matrix above.
          It misses.
          He RACES down the stairwell, stepping on the huddled
          bodies.
          A security guard RUSHES him and Sully BLASTS him dead.
          Matrix, running along the third level, sees Sully jump
          off the stairwell and get into a glass elevator. It
          starts to descend.
          Matrix looks desperately around, looks at one of the
          giant decorative banners spanning the ceiling, jumps
          onto the railing and tears loose the banner's end.
          The LAPD cop kneels and aims his gun at Matrix and
          prepared to fire.
          Cindy is running right at the cop.

                         CINDY
          Don't! d!
          Matrix JUMPS, hanging onto the banner.
          Cindy KNOCKS the cop's aim away. The gun FIRES,
          missing Matrix.

          THROUGH THE GLASS into the elevator with Sully.
          The cop comes up from the ground and looks at Cindy.
          She looks back at him uncertainly. He starts to bring
          the gun toward her and she moves quickly to a door
          marked "Stairwell" and disappears.

          The elevator reaches the parking garage and the doors

          Gun in hand, Sully crawls dazedly out of the destroyed
          car. Matrix approaches, kicks the gun out of Sully's
          hand and picks the gun up.
          Matrix empties Sully's pockets and finds his wallet
          and a motel key. He picks Sully up, an ankle in each
          hand, so that he's holding Sully upside down. He
          begins walking with him.

          Where is she, Sully?

          Fuck you...
          Matrix is approaching the Sunbeam as Cindy is getting
          out. He swings Sully by the heels and BEATS Sully's
          head against the fender, leaving another dent in the
          already beat-up car.

                         CINDY
          That's my car, Matrix!!
          Matrix continues to carry Sully upside down.

          Sully tries to thrash about as the blood rushing to
          his face starts to redden it.
          Matrix lets go with his right arm. Sully's head
          drops a foot, Matrix's left arm drops a little, then
          adjusts to the new weight.

                         SULLY

          He SHAKES Sully, moving him like a fish on a line.

          I don't know, but Cooke knows. I

          to meet him.

          Matrix uses his right hand to take something from
          his pocket and he dangles it in front of Sully.
          It's Sully's motel key.

                         MATRIX
          Because I already know where.
          Fear starts to show in Sully's face for the first time
          as he STARES at the key. He tried to grab at the key, X
          but Matrix pulls it out of his reach.

          Cooke listens a beat to the running shower.

                         COOKE
          Who're you?
          Cindy looks him up and down, then slouches toward the
          crack so her breasts push at her blouse. She smiles.

                         CINDY
          Room service...
          Cooke looks back through the door at her. Matrix, at
          the inside edge of the door,is holding_his gun,
          ready to fire. Matrix can only see Cindy.

                         COOKE
          Open the door.
          Cindy unlocks the chain and opens the door.

                         COOKE
          Move out of the way.
          Cindy moves away from the door. Matrix tenses, ready
          to attack. Cooke looks into the room at the rumpled
          bed, suitcase and fast food containers.
          The shower SOUNDS continue to echo from the bathroom.
          Cooke cautiously enters the doorway. WHAM!
          Matrix SLAMS the gun against the brawny Cooke's head.
          Cooke crashes back against the wall, but doesn't go
          down. He grabs Matrix's gun hand by the wrist and
          the two of them STRUGGLE for the gun.
          BLAM! BLAM! The gun FIRES into the ceiling as they
          wrestle around the room. They BREAK a table and CRASH
          into a chest of drawers.

          Cindy moves to help Matrix. BLAM! The gun FIRES again,
          SHATTERING the lamp near Cindy, making her duck for
          cover.
          Cooke slowly FORCES the gun toward Matrix's face. The
          barrel gets CLOSER... CLOSER... then almost points right
          at Matrix.
          With a sudden SURGE of power, Matrix lifts Cooke off
          the ground, pushes him toward the wall and the two of
          them CRASH RIGHT THROUGH THE DOOR into the adjoining
          room.

                         ADJOINING ROOM
          A twenty-year-old couple in bed look up in shock as
          Matrix and Cooke bounce off their bed and SLAM against
          the wall.
          BLAM! The gun FIRES, SHATTERING the mirror above the
          young couple and they SCRAMBLE to safety on the floor
          on the other side of the bed.
          Matrix and Cooke come off the wall and SLAM onto the
          floor, the gun coming out of Matrix's hand. Cooke
          picks it up before Matrix can reach it.
          Cooke points the gun right at Matrix's face, pulls back
          the trigger, then smiles.

                         COOKE
          Fuck you, asshole.
          He pulls the trigger. CLICK. No more bullets in the
          bun. The blood drains from Cooke's face.
          Matrix looks at him.

                         MATRIX
          Fuck you, asshole...
          He BLASTS Cooke in the jaw and Cooke goes backward
          through the broken door and falls to the floor.

          Matrix races back through the broken door, starts toward
          Cooke, then stops cold. Cooke has fallen on the broken,
          sharp table leg and the leg goes into his back and
          comes out of his chest.

          Cooke looks blankly back at him.

                         MATRIX
          Cooke... Cooke!!
          Cooke's eyes go cold and still. He's dead. Cindy
          approaches and swallows as she looks down at his body,
          the stake coming out of his chest.
          Matrix starts emptying Cooke's pockets. There's a wallet
          containing only cash. Matrix tosses it to the floor.
          He brings out a lighter and a package of cigarettes,
          examines the lighter, then tosses both objects to the
          floor.
          He pulls out two keys on a key chain. They're car keys.
          Matrix leaps to his feet.

          EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT 144

          Matrix and Cindy exit from the room and go out to the
          parking lot. Matrix looks at the six cars parked there,
          then he breaks a key off the chain and hands it to Cindy.

          Try the trunks.
          They split up. Matrix tries the car door key into a
          Pontiac. It won't open. Cindy goes to the trunk of
          a Honda. It won't open.
          Matrix races to a Ford. The door won't open. Cindy
          races to a Cadillac. She opens the trunk!
          Matrix races over to her and looks into the trunk. It's
          empty. He uses the door key and opens the Cadillac's
          door.

          INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT 145

          Matrix looks desperately around the inside of the
          Cadillac. Nothing. He opens the glove compartment
          and looks inside. Nothing.

          He pulls the paper out and looks at it.

          INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          Thirty guerilla soldiers are working in the same
          warehouse that Arius and Bennett had walked through
          earlier. Trucks, tanks, jeeps, bazookas, machine guns,
          mortars, etc. are spread around the darkened room.

                         149

          EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          Matrix removes a ground level, wire mesh grille from
          the warehouse's outside wall, then he crawls through
          and Cindy replaces the grille.

          INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 150

          Matrix crawls along the warehouse floor in the darkened
          room. He goes under a jeep, then pauses to survey the
          room.

                         151

          MATRIX'S P.O.V.
          The soldiers move weapons, metal containers and wooden
          crates from the trucks to the jeeps. A soldier's feet
          walk right in front of Matrix, the soldier unloads a
          crate onto the jeep above Matrix, then the feet move
          away.

                         152

                         MATRIX
          Matrix crawls away from the jeeps, moves low through
          the shadows, goes into a corridor and sees a door ajar.

                         153

          MATRIX'S P.O.V.
          A soldier, Vega, is looking at some charts on a table.

                         154

                         CORRIDOR

          rest of the room. As the door moves, it CREAKS on
          its hinge.

                         ROOM
          Vega looks up from the charts and sees the door is open
          more then it was. He pauses, then starts walking toward
          the door.

                         156

                         CORRIDOR
          Matrix starts to move away from the door, then stops.
          He hears FOOTSTEPS and CONVERSATION approaching the
          other end of the corridor. He's trapped!

          Vega is two feet away from the inside of the door.

                         CORRIDOR 158
          Matrix desperately grabs the door handle and pushes
          the door forward.

                         ROOM 159
          Matrix SLAMS his fist into Vega's stomach, then quickly
          MOVES into the room, puts a choke hold around Vega
          with his left arm, then carefully closes the door with
          his right.
          As soon as the door closes, the FOOTSTEPS and
          CONVERSATION pass right by the door outside in the
          corridor.
          Matrix pulls Vega toward the back of the room, SMASHES
          his Adam's apple, opens a closet,,drops the dead Vega
          inside, then closes the door.
          He moves to the door leading outside the warehouse,
          opens it and Cindy enters. They begin to whisper.

                         MATRIX
          I saw all the equipment,
          but there's no plane.

          What about your daughter?
          Matrix shakes his head.

          Arius and Bennett aren't
          here. She's wherever
          they are.
          Matrix looks at Cindy in desperation for a beat, then
          they begin to look around the room.
          The room is designed as the aircraft control room. There
          are aerial charts on the tables and the walls. There are
          photos of several military planes and a civilian
          amphibious plane. There are copies of weather reports
          situated around the room and there is a VHF radio.

                         COORDINATES
          Matrix notes a set of military map coordinates
          penciled onto the side of a chart. They read,
          8734-5245; 8142-5938; 7565-5474. A "Scale line" is
          drawn under the coordinates.

                         161

                         MATRIX
          He studies the coordinates, then picks up a drafting
          compass and pen. He puts three dots, which
          corresponds to the three sets of coordinates onto a
          coasted chart of Southern California.

                         162

                         CHART
          Matrix sets the width of the legs of the drafting
          compass, then puts the point of one of the compass legs
          onto one of the three dots and draws a circle.

                         164

          MATRIX AND CINDY
          FOOTSTEPS and CONVERSATION approach the door. Matrix
          stops drawing and freezes. Cindy looks toward the
          door. The FOOTSTEPS reach the door, then continue
          right by it.

                         165

                         MATRIX
          Matrix uses the compass to draw a second circle.

          One of these plane's an
          amphibian. Maybe they're
          using it to fly there.
          Matrix comes over and looks at the photo of the
          amphibian.

                         CINDY
          Let me see that invoice.
          Matrix takes it out of his pocket, shows it to her

          She sees, "250 gallons of Type 4 aircraft fuel."

           Matrix and Cindy glance at each other as FOOTSTEPS go
          by outside.
          They continue to whisper.

                         CINDY
          Type four fuel is amphibian
          and two hundred fifty gallons
          is what it would take to
          fly that plane to the island

          with a thick steel grille.
          They pass some street construction equipment
          (steamroller, caterpillar, forklift, flashing warning

          The camera is in the store shooting out through

          we SEE IT.
          Matrix is atop a steamroller that is ROLLING right AT

          THE CAMERA.
          The steamroller CRASHES into the front of the store
          and the GLASS SHATTERS INWARD and the steel grille
          BUCKLES AND CRACKS APART under the roller.
          Matrix jumps off the steamroller as the alarm starts to

          Along the first aisle, he grabs a snorkel, mask and
          flippers and tosses them into the cart, then grabs
          a deflated and compressed rubber raft and paddle and
          tosses them in, too.
          He takes the cart and SHOVES it down the aisle, the
          cart coming to a rolling crash among the debris at
          the front of the store. Cindy takes the cart and
          quickly rolls it out of the store.
          Matrix moves to the next aisle, takes another
          shopping cart and moves down the aisle. He grabs
          O.D. fatigue pants, an assault-extraction survival
          vest, a camouflage sweater, black survival boots,
          and combat knives.
          He gives the cart a shove and it rolls crazily down
          the aisle into the debris. Cindy quickly rolls the
          cart outside.
          Matrix moves to the counter and starts feverisl-rly
          moving his hands along the underside looking for
          something.

          Behind him, a wall containing innocuous sporting

          assault shotgun with folding stock, a Steyr 223

          the aisle with it, then carefully pushes it so it
          rolls by itself the rest of the way to Cindy.

                         MATRIX
          Get the car.

          A guerrilla GUARD is in the small shack reading an
          aircraft manual.
          His feet are on the edge of the desk and he casually
          pushes his chair to tilt backwards.
          Matrix silently enters the shack and looks around.
          The guard's back is to Matrix.

          GUARD AND MATRIX 208
          The guard is TILTING his chair back and forth; Matrix
          is standing right behind him.
          The guard tilts his chair backward, Matrix circles
          his forearm around the man's neck and SLAMS him
          backward OUT OF FRAME to the floor.
          With his left hand, Matrix takes a ring of keys off of
          the wall.

          Cindy, the inflatable raft at her feet, is waiting at
          the plane as Matrix, carrying two duffel bags of
          equipment, approaches her. She takes the key ring
          from him, opens the door of the plane and Matrix
          begins to load the duffel bags inside.

          INT. GRAUMAN GOOSE - NIGHT 210

          Cindy sits in the pilot's seat and stares at the
          controls as Matrix gets in the passenger seat.

                         MATRIX
          What's wrong?

                         CINDY
          This isn't a plane... it's a

          moored in the water. Just before they CRASH into them,
          Cindy pulls the seaplane up.

          Matrix, looking shaken for the first time, glances

          look at the steamroller and the smashed front of the

          General Kirby moves away from the police and approaches

          Why'd you decide to get a
          pilot's license?

                         CINDY
          My father was an Air Force
          pilot. That's why I becarle a
          stewardess. But after a
          while, I got tired of serving
          food' and drinks. I wanted
          to fly the plane myself.

                         (PAUSING)
          I guess what I've really

          flights out of LAX avoid it
          like the plague.

          Can you get under the radar?

                         CINDY
          Not marine radar, but if we
          get close enough to the water,
          the high seas effect might
          camouflage us.

          Try it...
          Cindy dives the seaplane downward.

     
          Cindy continues to pilot the seaplane just above the
          water. She reaches down to the back of her knee, feels
          it and grimaces.
          Matrix leans over, moves her hand and looks at what
          caused her to crimace. A nasty looking cut is starting
          to bleed.

          She expertly wraps the gauze around her leg and ties it.

          EXT. GRASSY PLATEAU - DAY 349

          Matrix RACES through the gates he blew up earlier,
          passes the shell of the blown up transport truck, leaves
          the road and RUNS over grassy knolls and sand dunes.

                         JEEP 350
          Up ahead in the distance, Bennett RACES the jeep toward
          the dock.

          CLOSE ON MATRIX 351
          Matrix's wound is bleeding badly and he begins to
          STRUGGLE to RUN for the first time.

          MATRIX'S P.O.V. 352
          Bennett, now dragging Jenny along, has left the jeep and
          is running along the dock. They stop at Arius' war boat,
          Bennett cuts the moorings with his knife, then he
          FORCES Jenny into the boat.

                         DOCK 353
          Matrix nears the dock as Bennett tries to start the
          engines.
          The engines start to kick over, then stop.
          Matrix RACES onto the foot of the dock.
          Bennett desperately tries the engines again. They start!
          Matrix RACES toward the end of the dock.

                         WAR BOAT 354
          Bennett edges the war boat away from the dock, then
          BLASTS the engines and RACES the boat away...

                         DOCK 355
          .just as Matrix reaches the end of the dock.

          MATRIX'S P.O.V. 356
          Matrix watches the boat RACE away with Jenny.

          CLOSE ON MATRIX 357
          Matrix has lost her. Bennett's got her...

          WIDER FAVORING MATRIX 358
          Suddenly, he hears a NOISE and he looks to the side.

                         SEAPLANE 359
          Cindy is RACING her seaplane toward the dock!

                         DOCK 360
          Cindy slows the seaplane as she passes the dock and
          Matrix grabs onto a ladder.

                         SEAPLANE 361
          with Matrix hanging onto the ladder, Cindy BLASTS the
          throttle and RACES after Bennett's boat.

                         MATRIX 362
          As the seaplane starts to GO FASTER, Matrix holds onto
          the ladder and looks at Bennett's boat up ahead.

          MATRIX'S P.O.V. 363
          Bennett's boat is about FORTY YARDS ahead of the
          seaplane.

          INT. SEAPLANE - DAY 364

          Cindy PUSHES the throttle FASTER. She watches as the
          seaplane starts to slowly overtake the boat.

          EXT. SEAPLANE - DAY 365

          The seaplane is SKIMMING and SKIPPING over the water.

                         MATRIX 366
          The wind and spray SLAP against Matrix as he watches
          the seaplane closing the gap on the boat.
          He climbs from the ladder onto the wing of the plane,
          the propellers only about five feet away from him.
          He CRAWLS along the wing of the plane, the wind
          WHIPPING at him.

          INT. SEAPLANE - DAY 367

          Cindy glances out toward Matrix on the wing, then she
          GRIPS the controls FIRMLY to try to lessen the plane's
          bouncing.

          EXT. OCEAN - DAY 368

          The seaplane closes to about FIFTEEN YARDS from the boat.

          EXT. BENNETT'S BOAT - DAY 369

          Bennett looks behind him and sees the seaplane COMING

          AFTER HIM.
          Trying to steer with one hand, Bennett turns toward the
          seaplane as the boat bounces and FIRES WILDLY at Matrix
          on the wing. SLAM? BLAM!

          EXT.'SEAPLANE - DAY 370

          The bullets WHISTLE by Matrix. He continues crawling
          along the wing until he reaches the very end. He pulls
          his gun from his holster and aims it toward the boat.

          MATRIX'S P.O.V. 371
          Matrix tries to aim the gun through the sight, but the
          bouncing of the seaplane, the bouncing of the boat, and
          Jenny's nearness to Bennett makes a shot too risky.

                         A85

          Cindy PUSHES the throttle even FASTER.

          EXT. OCEAN - DAY 374

          The seaplane starts to PULL EVEN with Bennett's boat.

          EXT. BENNETT'S BOAT - DAY 375

          Bennett looks to the side and sees Cindy in the cockpit
          almost even with him. Starting to panic, he FIRES
          WILDLY as he tries to steer the bouncing boat. BLAM!

          BLAM! BLAM'.

          EXT. SEAPLANE -- DAY 376

          A buttet BLASTS into the seaplane body and a second
          bullet BLASTS into just underneath the cockpit side
          window.

          INT. SEAPLANE - DAY 377

          The third bullet SHATTERS the cockpit window and
          EXPLODES into the cockpit near Cindy's head.
          Cindy doesn't flinch a bit, and edges the seaplane
          ahead of the boat.

          EXT. BOAT -- DAY 378

          Cindy has positioned the seaplane so that the wing
          Matrix is on is directly over the boat. Bennett sees
          the underside of the wing above and FIRES into the
          bottom of it, hoping to hit Matrix. SLAM! SLAM!

          EXT. WING - DAY 379

          Bullet holes RIP through the wing inches from Matrix's
          head.

          EXT. BOAT - DAY 380

          Matrix DIVES off the wing right into the boat directly
          on top of Bennett!!
          They CRASH into Jenny and HIT the floor of the boat.

          Matrix grabs Bennett's gun hand and they wrestle for
          the gun. BLAM!
          A shot BLASTS into the fuel tank at the stern of the
          boat.
          WHOOM! There's a small EXPLOSION and the rear of the
          boat erupts in FLAMES.
          Jenny DIVES toward the front of the boat for cover.
          The steering wheel, unattended, shifts WILDLY back and
          forth.

          EXT. OCEAN - DAY 381

          The boat is bouncing CRAZILY toward a deserted rocky
          beach.

          INSERT - SIGN 382
          A large sign on the beach reads "DANGER - U.S. COAST

          GUARD GUNNERY RANGE."

          EXT. OCEAN - DAY 383

          Cindy, in the seaplane, watches as both the seaplane
          and burning boat SPEED RIGHT TOWARD the increasingly
          LOOMING beach up ahead.
          At the last minute, Cindy SWERVES the seaplane to the
          right, away from the beach.

          EXT. BOAT - DAY 384

          The burning boat continues to RACE DIRECTLY AT THE

          RAPIDLY APPROACHING ROCKY BEACH!
          Matrix SAVAGELY TWISTS Bennett's wrist hand that holds
          the gun.

                         BENNETT

          AAAHHH ! 1
          He drops the gun on the floor of the boat.
          The boat is JUST ABOUT TO HIT THE BEACH!
          Matrix SMASHES Bennett's face with his fist, KNOCKING
          him down onto the floor near Jenny.

          Matrix runs to the opposite side of the boat, and

          handgun from its holster.
          BOOM! BOOM! Some more artillery shells EXPLODE, kicking
          up sand not too far away.
          Bennett, his knife against Jenny, is on one side of the

          With his free hand, Matrix STABS at Bennett and Bennett
          grabs Matrix's wrist.
          They are locked hand in hand, staring death into each
          other's eyes.

          Jenny, watching the fight, notices Matrix's gun on the
          beach near her and hesitates to pick it up.

          MATRIX AND BENNETT 400
          Suddenly Matrix falls backward to the ground, pulling
          Bennett with him and FLIPS Bennett over him HARD to
          the sand.
          Matrix jumps up quickly to finish Bennett. Bennett
          quickly THROWS SAND in matrix's eyes.
          Matrix, blinded, stumbles badly.
          Bennett immediately grabs Matrix's knife hand around
          the wrist, then SINKS his own knife into Matrix's
          side.

                         MATRIX

          AAAHHH!
          Matrix's eyes go glassy, then he drops his knife.
          Bennett lets Matrix's wrist go, looks at Matrix's
          glassy eyes for a beat, then he pulls his knife out of
          Matrix's side.
          Matrix STAGGERS for a beat, then STUMBLES a few steps
          and drops to one knee against the front outside hull of
          the boat.
          Bennett slowly approaches Matrix from behind, casually
          feeling the blade of his knife.
          He looks at Matrix's wide, unprotected back and Bennett
          smiles.
          Bennett pulls the knife back with his arm, preparing to
          plunge it into Matrix's back.

          MATRIX AND BENNETT 402

                         BENNETT
          Fuck you, asshole...
          He PLUNGES the knife down toward Matrix's back.
          Matrix moves LIKE LIGHTNING to the side. The knife
          misses him and GETS STUCK in the hull of the boat.
          Matrix turns toward Bennett.

                         MATRIX
          (shaking his head)
          No...
          Bennett tries desperately to get his knife unstuck from
          the boat hull, but he can't. Fear FLOODS his eyes.
          Matrix moves close to Bennett.

                         MATRIX
          Fuck YOU, asshole...
          He DRIVES his knife into Bennett's throat so hard the
          knife goes through Bennett's neck and comes out the
          other side.
          Still holding the knife, Matrix then DRIVES the knife
          into the hull of the boat.
          The knife STICKS into the hull, holding Bennett's neck
          there like a thumbtack holds a note on a bulletin board.
          BOOM? Suddenly there is another, larger EXPLOSION in
          the fiery back of the boat and the whole boat EXPLODES
          into FLAMES, leaving Bennett lost in the fireball.

          MATRIX AND JENNY 403
          Matrix limps away from the flames, Jenny rushes into
          his arms and he holds her close. She's crying.
          She shows him she was holding his gun.

                         JENNY
          I wanted to shoot...but I
          couldn't, I just couldn't.
          Matrix looks at her.
          Cont.

                         A85

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         96
           403 Cont.

                         MATRIX
          You know something? I'm glad
          you couldn't.
          He takes the gun from her and tosses it past the burning
          boat into the ocean.

          MATRIX'S P.O.V. 404
          He sees two Army helicopters approaching from the air
          and Cindy bringing her seaplane to the beach.

          EXT. BEACH 405

          Matrix lies down, his head in Jenny's lap, and tries
          to still his bleeding.
          The two copters land. Kirby gets out of one and two
          medical corpsmen with a stretcher get out of the other.
          The corpsmen bring the stretcher to Matrix and gently
          ease him onto it. They start to carry him as Jenny
          walks alongside.

                         KIRBY
          I just saw what's left of Arius'
          estate... You're the best I've
          ever known, John... I've saved a
          place for you if you want to
          join up with me again.
          Matrix notices as Cindy joins Jenny standing next to
          him. Matrix looks at the two of them, then up at
          Kirby.

                         MATRIX
          This was the last one...
          The corpsmen carry Matrix into the copter and Jenny
          joins him inside.
          Kirby and Cindy watch him from outside the chopper.

                         KIRBY
          What about your identities...
          Don't you need two more?

                         MATRIX
          No...

          Why not?
          Matrix looks at Cindy.

                         MATRIX
          Two might not be enough...
          The chopper wings have started and the chopper is
          preparing to liftoff.
          Matrix and Cindy are looking at each other.
          The chopper starts to liftoff.
          Cindy suddenly RUNS to the chopper and JUMPS in the door
          as it lifts off.
          Matrix puts his arm around her, then he looks back
          toward Kirby.
          Matrix holds up three fingers and smiles.

          EXT. OCEAN - DAY 406

          Kirby waves good-bye as the chopper rises high above
          the beach and flies out over the ocean.

                         FADE OUT

                         THE END

          OVER BLACK:
                         
          In the darkness, we hear the solitary sound of a HEARTBEAT,
          resounding like a drum.
                         
           NARRATOR (V.O)
           In between the years when the
           oceans drank Atlantis and the rise
           of the Sons of Aryas, there was an
           age undreamed of, when shining
           kingdoms lay spread across the
           world like blue mantles under the
           stars. Hither came Conan, the
           Cimmerian: a thief, a slayer, a
           king born of battle.
                         
          Muffled sounds, as if underwater, echo: CLANGING swords, the
          guttural CRIES of combat.
                         
                         UNBORN BABY
                         
          Eyes closed, floating at peace within red glow of the womb.
                         
          Suddenly, a flash of steel, as a sword pierces the womb, its
          tip not an inch from the baby's head.
                         
          As the sword is ripped out, light streams in from outside, we
          travel with it, into the DIN of BATTLE.
                         
                         
          EXT. CIMMERIA - MUDDY FIELD - DAY
                         
          A blonde-haired, armored AESIR RAIDER withdraws the bloody
          sword from the stomach of ISLENE, a wild-maned Cimmerian
          beauty, many months pregnant, now clutching her bloody
          stomach.
                         
          Across a muddy battlefield, the air a maelstrom of falling
          snowflakes and embers from trees aflame, the powerfully built
          CORIN rallies his fellow CIMMERIANS, until he spots Islene.
                         
                          CORIN
           Islene!!!
                         
          Wielding a broadsword, runes etched into its surface, Corin
          cuts a bloody path through his enemies, his eyes never
          leaving Islene.
                         
          The Aesir standing over Islene LAUGHS as she claws at the
          earth behind her, trying to pull herself away.
                         
                          AESIR
           Now, now little whore. Did I get
           you or your little one?
           2.
                         
                         
          Islene's hand reaches back once again -- and it finds a
          fallen warrior's SWORD. In one fluid motion she swings the
          sword around her body and drives it into the gap in the
          Aesir's armor -- at his groin.
                         
                          ISLENE
           I'd ask you the same.
                         
          The Aesir HOWLS in agony, raising his sword to deliver the
          killing blow -- when another sword pierces his chest. The
          Aesir falls, revealing Corin standing behind him.
                         
          Corin throws aside his horned helmet, and falls to his knees
          beside Islene, checking her wound. When he pulls his hands
          back they are coated in blood.
                         
          Their eyes meet. Torment. Loss. They both know. She pulls a
          knife from the folds of her pelts, puts it in his hand.
                         
                          ISLENE (CONT'D)
           Take your child.
                         
                          CORIN
           I cannot.
                         
          Islene looks to her naked belly. The baby inside presses
          against its womb, a visible impression on her flesh.
                         
                          ISLENE
           There is no time, husband. I would
           see my child's face.
                         
          Islene's eyes flutter as she struggles. Corin lowers the
          knife. Islene's eyes lock with Corin's as he puts the knife
          to use. Never once does she scream.
                         
          A moment later, Corin lifts the crying, blood-covered BOY up
          through the falling snowflakes to Islene's lap.
                         
                          ISLENE (CONT'D)
           A boy. He will be strong. A warrior
           with no equal.
                         
                          CORIN
           Do not speak, love.
                         
                          ISLENE
           You have never been able to still
           my tongue, and you will not this
           day. He will be wild, Corin. You
           must temper him.
                         
          She shares one kiss with her child, its first taste not of
          mother's milk, but of her blood.
           3.

          EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          A small Cimmerian village lies in a heavily forested valley,
          a redoubt from the icy mountains surrounding it.
                         
          Round wooden huts surround a stone-lined pit, where young
          CIMMERIAN BOYS, ages 12-15 stand. Pollen drifts through the
          air, giving it an ethereal haze.
                         
          At the center of the pit URAN, an elder Cimmerian warrior
          speaks.
                         
                          URAN
           A Cimmerian warrior is like any
           other man. A Cimmerian warrior
           feels hunger. He feels cold. Like
           other men he may lie and cheat.
           (stares the boys down)
           But when a Cimmerian warrior
           hungers, he hungers only for the
           blood of his enemy. When he feels
           cold, it is the cold steel of his
           sword. When he lies, he lies in
           wait for his enemy. And when he
           cheats, he cheats death itself!
                         
          Uran stops at the end of the line, where a boy stands a good
          two heads smaller than the rest. He is no more than eight,
          but his face is as stoic, driven.
                         
                          URAN (CONT'D)
           Conan! You are too young to be
           here. Withdraw.
                         
          CONAN, determined, doesn't move an inch. The LARGEST TEEN
          menacingly steps up to the smaller boy.
                         
                          LARGEST TEEN
           He said leave, motherless whelp.
           4.
                         
                         
          The hulking teen goes to shove Conan, but Conan pulls his arm
          towards him, lashing out with his other hand, punching the
          teen in the throat.
                         
          The large boy goes down hard, hands and knees, gasping for
          air.
                         
          A smattering of LAUGHS erupt from the boys, quickly silenced
          by Uran's stare. Uran hands out RIVER STONES to each boy,
          ending with Conan. The boys know what to do: they put the
          large stones in their mouths.
                         
                          URAN
           In the black crag in the high pass
           stands a wooden training sword. The
           one who claims it, with stone still
           in his mouth, will have earned the
           right to train with the warriors.
                         
          The boys look at each other, sizing up the competition.
                         
                          URAN (CONT'D)
           Well? What are you waiting for?!
                         
          And off they run. They knock each other down, punching the
          other's stomachs, each trying to force the other to expel
          their stones. One or two succeed.
                         
          Most of the remaining boys run for the trail that winds high
          into the mountains. But a few head right for the sheer cliff
          face.
                         
          Conan follows the ones headed to the cliff.
                         
                         CLIFF FACE
                         
          And when the Cimmerian boys climb, it is a sight to behold.
          They find cracks we can barely see and scale the smooth rock
          face as though it were a ladder.
                         
          The hulking teen reaches for the same handhold as Conan,
          trying to knock him off. Conan swings with one hand and finds
          another path. In moments he is ahead.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - DAY
                         
          Conan is in the lead as he crests the cliff top, the bigger
          boys right behind him.
                         
          They race through the forest, heading uphill --
                         
          When Conan spots movement ahead. He pauses --
           5.
                         
                         
          And the largest teen elbows past Conan, into the lead. The
          boy runs two paces more and suddenly flies off his feet, an
          AXE lodged squarely in his forehead.
                         
          All the boys stop. Out of the dense forest come
                         
          FOUR PICTISH SAVAGES
                         
          Covered with fearsome war paint and armed with dual hand
          axes, the rotting heads of their enemies are slung at their
          waist.
                         
          The boys spit out the rocks in their mouths and YELL. They
          turn and run in the opposite direction.
                         
          Only Conan doesn't move, even as another boy pulls at him.
                         
                          CIMMERIAN BOY
           Conan! Run!
                         
          But Conan simply pulls the axe from his large boy's skull. He
          turns to face the Picts, his eyes burning.
                         
          The Picts LAUGH and CHARGE CONAN.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         LATER
                         
          Corin arrives with Uran and other armed CIMMERIAN WARRIORS.
          They get a brief glimpse of a single PICT, escaping in the
          other direction. One of the Cimmerians takes off in pursuit.
          Corin desperately searches for his son.
                         
                          CORIN
           Conan? Conan?!
                         
          Conan steps forward from out of a thicket, his body covered
          in Pict blood. Three PICTS lie massacred, the bodies hacked
          to pieces.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           What have you done, boy?
                         
          Conan walks past the other stunned Cimmerians, up to his
          father. Conan SPITS OUT the bloody stone from his mouth.
                         
                          CONAN
           They killed one. I killed three. I
           am a warrior now.
                         
          Uran and the other Cimmerian men exchange worried glances.
          Looking at the carved up bodies of the Picts, they are
          aghast. Conan looks confused. Why aren't they happy?
           6.
                         
                         
                          CORIN
           A warrior? What you have done a
           jackal would do. Never a warrior.
                         
                          CONAN
           They would have done the same --
                         
                          CORIN
           As I said, jackals.
                          (TO URAN)
           He is not ready. I will forge him
           myself.
                         
                          CUT TO:

          Conan is tested under Corin's watchful eye:
                         
          - Forced to sleep in the snow, while his father keeps warm
          inside.
                         
          - A heavy boulder on his shoulder blades while he balances on
          wet river rocks.
                         
          - Climbing a cliff face, his bare hands leaving blood behind
          on the jagged rocks.
                         
                         
          INT. CIMMERIAN FORGE - DAY
                         
          Flames reflect in the blue eyes of Conan as he works the
          bellows of the forge. Sparks buzz like angry fireflies as he
          stokes the blaze.
                         
          Corin sharpens a sword, perfecting it. Conan cannot take his
          eyes off it, stepping away from the bellows.
                         
                          CORIN
           Stoke your fire, boy.
                         
          Conan slams the bellows closed, anger rising.
                         
                          CONAN
           "Stoke your fire, chop your wood."
           I have slept where wolves dare not.
           I have balanced a thousand river
           stones. When will you teach me the
           sword?
                         
          Corin stares his son in the eyes. Judging.
           7.
                         
                         
                          CORIN
           Think you're ready? Then tell me:
           what is a sword's purpose?
                         
                          CONAN
           To slay ones enemies.
                         
                          CORIN
           No. That is what it does. Its
           purpose is why you use it.
                         
          He tosses Conan two lumps of ore.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           Tell me, which makes the best
           sword?
                         
          Conan takes the two lumps, testing them. He hands his father
          back one.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           The stronger ore, eh? Then we shall
           make a sword of it, and tomorrow
           you will show me what brute
           strength yields.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. FIELD - DUSK
                         
          With a setting sun silhouetting the two, Conan attacks Corin.
          Conan attacks with fury. Corin defends with grace. Until the
          boy overextends and Corin slashes down a counterattack that
          SHATTERS CONAN'S SWORD.
                         
          Corin simply turns and walks away, leaving Conan to puzzle
          what happened.
                         
          Corin lowers his sword and walks away, leaving Conan to
          puzzle what happened.
                         
                         
          INT. CORIN'S FORGE - NIGHT
                         
          Conan works the bellows, putting his back into it. Corin
          places both ores in the furnace where they begin to melt.
                         
                          CONAN
           Why did it break?
           8.
                         
                         
                          CORIN
           Because it had no life.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Sparks fly as Corin pounds on the glowing edge of the sword
          with hammer. Corin nods at Conan, who sprinkles the glowing
          blade with ash.
                         
           CORIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           The strongest blade isn't made of
           the hardest steel, boy. The hardest
           ore is what a man will die for. It
           is strong and unyielding. It
           neither cowers nor concedes. But
           without the softer ore, it can be
           shattered like glass.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Steam rises as Corin lowers the blade into a freezing slack
          tub, only to place it right back into the flames.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           The softer ore is what a man lives
           for. It is flexible and lasting. It
           survives, even against the greatest
           of foes. But too much of the soft
           ore, the blade will not cut deep
           enough when it must.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Corin fashions the blade's hilt, engraving the guard and
          pommel. It is a work of art.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           A sword must be tempered, the two
           ores united through fire and ice.
           Through its suffering the sword
           comes to hold both life and death.
                         
          Corin hands Conan the sword.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           Now tell me, what is this sword's
           purpose?
                         
          Conan furrows his brow, trying to puzzle the answer. He
          can't. Corin's disappointment shows. He takes the sword from
          Conan's hands.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           This one is not ready yet.
           9.
                         
                         
          Blood rushes to Conan's face but he says nothing. He rushes
          out.
                         
                         
          EXT. MOUNTAIN LAKE - DAY
                         
          Frustrated, Conan slashes through a field of reeds, cutting
          everything within reach of him, expending his rage.
                         
          Behind him something moves in the forest. We catch just a
          glimpse of the PICT, the same one that escaped Conan in the
          earlier scene.
                         
          Conan's instincts cause him to spin around -- but then
          there's nothing there.
                         
                         
          INT. CIMMERIAN SCOUT POST - DAY
                         
          Built into the side of a huge tree, fifty feet up, this
          wooden structure houses two CIMMERIAN SENTRIES. A BIRD CRIES
          in the woods, causing one of the sentries to investigate.
                         
          THWICK! He suddenly stands up straight, unmoving. The one
          still sitting in the structure notices.
                         
                          CIMMERIAN SENTRY
           See something?
                         
          The standing sentry falls backwards, revealing an ARROW
          piercing his right eye. Shocked, the remaining sentry reaches
          for the WARNING HORN mounted on the wall.
                         
          But as he reaches for it, his shadow becomes three
          dimensional, MORPHING into
                         
          A SHADOW SCOUT
                         
          A thin, feral humanoid, bodies covered in tattoos, from the
          deepest jungles of Zingara. The scout lashes out with his
          black sword and cuts straight across the sentry's throat.
                         
          This Shadow Scout's name is REMO.
                         
                         
          EXT. SCOUT POST - DAY
                         
          Remo exits and stares down at CHEREN, a BLIND ARCHER clad in
          lamellar armor and a conical sedge hat. Cheren has an arrow
          notched and ready, but somehow he knows not to fire.
                         
          Cheren lowers his bow and lets out a BIRD WHISTLE --
           10.
                         
                         
          And the forest comes alive. The forces are an odd
          combination; massive KUSHITE TRIBESMEN, dark-skinned savages
          from the savannahs of Kush, and a LEGION OF AQUILONIAN
          MERCENARIES, heavily armored knights drawn from the cities of
          Aquilonia.
                         
          Their leaders, respectively, are the six foot-five Kushite
          chief UKAFA, gold-toothed, his body painted for battle, and
          the handsome, silver-armored Aquilonian LUCIUS.
                         
                          UKAFA
           That's the last of their guard
           towers.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           All this sneaking around for a
           lowly tribe of barbarians.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (O.S.)
           This lowly tribe of barbarians have
           buried every warrior ever to set
           foot on this land, Lucius.
                         
          KHALAR SINGH, a warlord atop a black horse, rides through the
          fog-shrouded trees.
                         
          He bears a nomadic visage, with tanned skin and almond-shaped
          eyes. While his voice is calm, his eyes burn with malice.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           That is only because they have
           never faced my legion.
                         
          Khalar regards Lucius with amusement.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Then show us. But should you fail,
           remember the plan.
                         
          Lucius scowls as he delivers a bow to Khalar Singh.
                         
                         
          EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          Corin walks out of the forge, looking around for Conan.
          Various other Cimmerians go about the daily routine, but
          Conan is nowhere to be seen.
                         
                          CORIN
           Conan?
           11.
                         
                         
          Corin looks to the ridge above the village, noticing a thick
          fog creeping in. The fog curls and eddies, something is out
          there.
                         
          Suddenly, Lucius and his legion of silver-armored warriors
          burst out of the fog, attacking with speed and strength.
                         
          But the Cimmerians are hardly caught flat footed. In seconds
          they are armed, and they counter the charge with a furious
          charge of their own.
                         
          SLAM! Sword and bone collide as the two enemy fronts smash
          into each other. And the battle devolves into one-on-ones --
                         
          Where the barbarians have the upper hand. Uran and Corin lead
          the main push of battle-frenzied barbarians as they swing
          their huge broadswords, extending their reach advantage over
          the Aquilonian's shorter weapons.
                         
          And quickly, the Aquilonian's numbers are cut in half. Corin
          squares off against Lucius himself. Lucius is sweating.
          Worried. It wasn't supposed to be this hard.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           Retreat!
                         
          As a unit, the Aquilonians race back into the woods. In
          seconds, the Cimmerians give chase in wild pursuit.
                         
                          CORIN
           Wait! Hold your ground!
                         
          But it's too late, nearly half the Cimmerian warriors are
          gone on the chase.
                         
                         
          EXT. CLIFF FACE - DAY
                         
          Lucius and the Aquilonians race up to a sheer cliff face.
          Nowhere left to run. They turn to see the Cimmerians
          gathering in front of them.
                         
                          URAN
           Death is in the air, invaders. Can
           you taste it?
                         
                          LUCIUS
                          (SMILES)
           Indeed. I savor it.
                         
          Uran notices something is wrong. His eyes go skyward. Atop
          the cliff stand Cheren and a dozen more of his blind archers,
          bows at the ready with FLAMING ARROWS.
           12.
                         
                         
          They let the arrows fly, streaking balls of flame heading
          right for the Cimmerians. But they do not hit them. They hit
          the tree trunks beside them.
                         
          And for a moment, the Cimmerians look relieved, until they
          notice small bags of a black substance tied to the arrows.
          The flames lick at the substance --
                         
          KABOOM! The forest erupts into flames as the Cimmerian
          warriors are burned alive.
                         
                         
          EXT. MOUNTAIN LAKE - DAY
                         
          Conan spins, started by the sound of the explosion. He sees
          flames rising above the treetops beyond.
                         
          He races back home.
                         
                         
          EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          Corin sees the flames in the distance as well. Suddenly,
          Ukafa and his Kushite warriors erupt out of the forest. Armed
          with fearsome barbed spears they charge the remaining
          Cimmerians, savage against savage.
                         
          But the Kushites are not alone. From behind the Cimmerians
          comes, AKHUN, a massive four hundred pounds of flesh, wearing
          loops of chains like armor, leads his turbaned TURANIAN
          HORSEMEN into the village.
                         
          The Cimmerian WOMEN arm themselves, but the Horsemen attack
          with NINE TAILED WHIPS pulling their swords from their hands
          and dragging them to the ground.
                         
          The Horsemen quickly gather up the women while Ukafa and his
          men keep the Cimmerian warriors all too occupied.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Conan rushes through a river, now tinged red with blood, and
          reaches the far end of the village.
                         
          Huts burn, women are chained, only a handful of Cimmerians
          still stand. Lucius and his Aquilonian mercenaries are
          helping the Spearmen slay the wounded.
                         
          Conan grabs a fallen sword and rushes for the nearest
          Aquilonian and RUNS HIM THROUGH. A ZINGARAN spots him and
          rushes him with his spear. Conan readies himself for the
                         CHARGE --
           13.
                         
                         
          When the Zingaran loses his head, lopped off by Corin's
          blade.
                         
                          CONAN
           Father!
                         
                          CORIN
           Come.
                         
          Corin, sporting a deep gash to his abdomen, pulls a reluctant
          Conan from the battle, back toward the forge.
                         
                         
          INT. FORGE - DAY
                         
          The flames of the forge still burn as Corin pushes Conan into
          the room. He bolts the door behind him.
                         
                          CONAN
           Do we need more weapons?
                         
          Corin drops his sword, then struggles to lift a heavy grating
          in the dirt floor. Beneath it a trough of cooling water leads
          under the hut and away from the village.
                         
                          CORIN
           Go. There is a hunting lodge in the
           North Pass with provisions.
                         
                          CONAN
           No! I will fight!
                         
          Corin grabs Conan by his tunic, pulling him up to his face.
          Corin's eyes are half-crazed.
                         
                          CORIN
           This fight is over, but yours has
           just begun. You wanted to be a
           warrior of the tribe, Conan--now
           you must be its last.
                         
                          CONAN
           Father, I am not afraid to die.
                         
                          CORIN
           Good. Make your death have purpose.
                         
          BOOM. Something slams at the door. It does not budge. Again,
          BOOM.
                         
          A shadow appears under the door, sliding into the forge, and
          MATERIALIZING into the form of Remo. Remo quickly slides away
          the bolt.
           14.
                         
                         
          In rush enter Lucius and Ukafa. Corin and Conan face their
          attackers, fighting in close quarters. Lucius rushes at
          Conan, only for Conan to duck under his attack and --
                         
          THROW HIM IN THE FIERY FORGE. Lucius SCREAMS in agony, rising
          up to reveal half of his formerly handsome face burned to a
          crisp.
                         
          Corin fights Ukafa to a standstill, until Remo emerges from
          the shadows behind him and drives a short sword into his
          back.
                         
          Corin falls to his knees.
                         
                          CONAN
           No!
                         
          Lucius delivers a massive backhand, sending Conan flying
          backwards -- and demolishing one of the Forge's main support
          beams.
                         
          Half of the forge comes crashing down on top of Conan,
          pinning his bleeding form to the ground, just a few feet from
          his fallen father.
                         
          Enraged, Lucius turns his anger to Corin, raising his sword
          to deliver the killing blow.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (O.S.)
           I said I wanted a word with him.
                         
          Lucius stays his hand as Khalar Singh steps into the forge.
          Beside him stands the PICT who escaped from Conan earlier,
          grinning from ear to ear.
                         
          Khalar Singh hands him a bag of gold.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           As promised.
                         
                          PICT
           (strange dialect -
                          SUBTITLED)
           Their heads. You promised me their
           heads.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           All you wish, once we are gone.
                         
          The Pict nods and heads off, drawing his knife. Khalar Singh
          stares down at Corin, sizing him up.
                         
          Corin lifts up into a sitting position, back to the forge.
           15.
                         
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           I take no pleasure in this day,
           barbarian. Your people are fierce
           warriors, deserving of every story
           told of them. But now you must
           choose the story for yourself. I am
           Khalar Singh. My army is handpicked
           from the best Hyboria. My second,
           Ukafa, and his Kushite horde. Remo
           and his Shadow Scouts from the
           jungles of Zingara. And countless
           others. They all had a day like
           this one. They all chose a way
           forward.
                         
          Into the forge walks Cherin and Akhun. The lieutenants stand
          behind Corin, eyeing Corin with malice.
                         
          Corin catches a glimpse of Conan, buried but staring back at
          him, unable to move. Corin quickly turns away, careful not to
          give his son away.
                         
                          CORIN
           What is it you want?
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           I seek neither gold nor steel, but
           flesh and blood. The last of a
           royal line that goes back three
           thousand years.
                         
          Corin LAUGHS.
                         
                          CORIN
           Royalty in Cimmeria? Never. Each
           man is free here.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           But I seek a woman.
                         
          Khalar looks outside the door of the forge. The Cimmerians
          women are being herded by the slavers.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           A queen in hiding. Point her out
           and you'll spare the lives of your
           own. Perhaps even your wife?
                         
                          CORIN
           My wife was killed, long ago, by
           swine such as you.
                         
          Khalar nods, understanding.
           16.
                         
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Then our stories began in the same
           place, Cimmerian. I too lost my
           wife to marauders. How many men, in
           how many lands have suffered so?
           The only answer is power, strength
           unfettered, the kind of which can
           unite all Hyboria under a single
           crown. That is the legacy I seek.
           Will you join me?
                         
          It's a powerful, convincing speech. But Corin holds his
          tongue, unmoved.
                         
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Very well. Then death will be your
           story. Your men will die. And your
           women too, when I am done with
           them. None will survive to carry
           your name forth, and over time,
           even your enemies will forget you
           ever were. You will be wiped from
           the pages of history.
           (to his men)
           Take your blood, but leave the
           kill.
                         
          One by one, the lieutenants beat and stab Corin, taking
          pleasure in his pain.
                         
          Conan struggles, trying to move, to yell, to do anything
          other than lie there. But a huge timber lies upon his back,
          pinning him to the ground.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Fariq! Come!
                         
          Entering the wrecked forge is FARIQ, the six year old son to
          Khalar Singh. He stares at Corin's bleeding form with the
          dispassion of a sociopath.
                         
          Khalar picks up THE SWORD Corin and Conan had forged
          together, the one Corin took away. He admires it, then hands
          it to his son. He keeps a hand on it as it is too heavy for
          his son to lift alone. He instructs his son as if teaching
          him multiplication.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Before you lies our enemy. His
           tribe waits for him in the beyond.
           What would you do?
           17.
                         
                         
                          FARIQ
           I would cut out his eyes, father,
           so that he will not find them. So
           he will wander the afterlife
           forever.
                         
          Khalar smiles.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Show me your strength, Fariq.
           Without it, you will never rule.
           With it, you will never be
           forgotten.
                         
          Fariq DRIVES THE SWORD INTO CORIN'S EYE. Corin doesn't make a
          sound. Once Fariq has ripped out Corin's eyes, Khalar runs
          Corin through.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           You have your desire. Death has
           found you.
                         
          Corin spits out his last words, also meant for Conan.
                         
                          CORIN
           Soon -- it comes for you.
                         
                         CONAN'S POV
                         
          Conan glimpses around the faces of Khalar and his men, each
          image seared into his memory as if ablaze.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Burn this place. It no longer
           exists.

          EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          The forge is lit afire from a half dozen torches, thrown onto
          its roof and inside its windows. Khalar and the other watch
          as the building roars into flame.
                         
                         
          INT. FORGE - DAY
                         
          Smoke fills the air. Conan struggles, still unable to move.
          He COUGHS, dying.
                         
          But then the fire collapses more of the forge, and the
          falling beams shatter the one that pins Conan to the ground.
           18.
                         
                         
          Slowly, painfully, Conan drags himself into the cooling
          trough that runs beneath the hut.
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.
                         
                         
          EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          Conan exits the forge only to see the entire village burning.
          The bodies of everyone he has ever known litter the
          landscape. Nothing stirs. Until he hears a strange CHOPPING
          SOUND.
                         
                         THE PICT
                         
          Conan spots the Pict, who is decapitating a dead Cimmerian
          warrior, adding to the collection of heads at his tattooed
          waist.
                         
          The Pict doesn't notice as Conan slips up behind him, then
          RUNS HIM THROUGH.
                         
          As the wide-eyed Pict dies, Conan takes the sword and CUTS A
          NOTCH into his arm.

                         NOTCHED ARM
                         
          Where there was once a single notch, there are now FIVE such
          notches, on a much broader arm that struggles to pin another
          powerful looking arm.
                         
                         
          INT. BAR - MESSANTIA - NIGHT
                         
          A raucous bar on the Argossean waterfront. Out the window we
          see a port lined with Shemish galleys and junks from Kush.
                         
          The bar is filled with the hearty sailors and merchants of
          those ships, and those who desire to part them from their
          hard-earned money; Zamoran thieves, Hyborean mercenaries and
          Brythunian whores. Most of them watch the arm wrestling match
          taking place at the back of the bar.
                         
          A pair of CITY GUARDS, short swords sheathed at their sides,
          enter the bar and are immediately summoned over by the
          harried BARKEEP.
                         
                          BARKEEP
           He's back there.
                         
          The barkeep motion to the arm wrestlers.
           19.
                         
                         
                          CITY GUARD #1
           What's this one done?
                         
                          BARKEEP
           What's he done?! What hasn't he
           done? He's bedded six of my whores
           and finished off three casks of
           mead--and he hasn't paid so much as
           a silver piece for it.
                         
                          CITY GUARD #1
           So have your men deal with him.
                         
                          BARKEEP
           I did.
                         
          Behind the bar, six men each hold down two HULKING MEN
          YELLING in agony as their horribly broken arms are snapped
          back into place.
                         
                          CITY GUARD #2
           Sounds like a real problem. Too bad
           we have other places to be right
           now.
                         
          The Barkeep shakes his head, knowing the routine. He slips a
          pair of silver pieces into the soldier's hand.
                         
                          BARKEEP
           Just get that behemoth out of here.
                         
          The two City Guards make their way to the back of the bar.
          His back to them, the DRUNKEN MAN they're after struggles to
          pin his opponent, cobras beneath each of their wrists, ready
          to strike at the loser. A pair of voluptuous WHORES watch,
          caressing the Drunken Man's sinewy back.
                         
          The Drunken Man YELLS in fury as he SLAMS the other man's
          hand down upon the cobra, which immediately bites its prey.
                         
          As the soldiers arrive, the drunken victor throws his tankard
          of ale at the Barkeep, who's now back behind the bar.
                         
                          DRUNKEN MAN
           Piss-water! You'll serve my friends
           and I your best, barman, or you'll
           taste steel!
                         
                          CITY GUARD #1
           Time to leave, northerner.
                         
          The Drunken Man turns as the City Guard puts a hand on his
          shoulder.
           20.
                         
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          The gangly fifteen year old boy has grown into a powerfully
          built man, broad-shouldered with sun browned skin lined with
          battle scars. Only the piercing blue eyes and square cut
          black mane remain from the boy we last saw.
                         
          Conan stands to his full height, looming over the smaller
          City Guards, who instinctively take a step back.
                         
                          CONAN
           No, my small friends. It's time to
           die. Now--
                         
          Conan sways. The room spins. He falls on his face.

          Conan, unconscious, is dragged down the street by the two
          City Guards.
                         
                          CITY GUARD #1
                          (STRUGGLING)
           By the gods, he's as heavy as a
           horse.
                         
                          CITY GUARD #2
           Even a dead horse smells better
           than this.
                         
                         
          EXT. PRISON YARD - NIGHT
                         
          The City Guards drag Conan into a broad prison yard. Many of
          the INMATES are shackled together, hacking with picks at the
          rock walls on their work detail. Those in no condition to
          break rock are left in their own filth to rot. Some are even
          dead already, the rats gnawing at the remains.
                         
                         
          INT. PRISON GUARDHOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          The two City Guards drag Conan into the guardhouse, where a
          LIEUTENANT sits eating his dinner.
                         
          The Lieutenant doesn't even bother to look up from his meal.
           21.
                         
                         
                          LIEUTENANT
           What's the charge?
                         
                          CITY GUARD #2
           Public drunkenness. Another damn
           hill ape who can't handle his
           liquor.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT
           Is that so, boy? How do you plead?
                         
          Conan yawns in response. One of the City Guards slaps Conan,
          hard, across the face. Conan slowly opens his eyes.
                         
                          CONAN
           Where's the Captain of the Guard?
                         
          SCREAMS OF PAIN come from down the hall, past a locked door.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT
           In the cells, interrogating a
           prisoner. And you'll get the same
           if you don't answer. You're accused
           of public drunkenness. How do you
           plead?
                         
                          CONAN
           In truth, I've been guilty of much.
           Jewels stolen from the crowns of
           kings, men's heads split in battle
           for the price of a night's drink.
           But through that I've searched and
           waited and hunted my prey.
                         
          Suddenly Conan shifts upright, looking more sober than he did
          a moment ago.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           But drink? Haven't had a drop all
           night.
                         
          The guards holding Conan up by his arms, suddenly find those
          arms wrapped around their heads. Twist, twist. SNAP. SNAP. He
          breaks both their necks in an instant.
                         
          The Lieutenant is horrified. He goes for his sword. Conan
          bats it out of his hand, slamming his head against the back
          wall.

                          LIEUTENANT
           I don't have it. There's a guard
           inside the door. Only he can open
           it.
                         
          Conan picks up the Lieutenant's sword.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
           You can't kill me! He'll only open
           the door for me!
                         
          A FLASH OF STEEL as Conan delivers a blow.

          A GUARD sits on a stool next to a heavy metal door. Behind
          him, the CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD beats a chained ONE-EYED
          PRISONER to a pulpy mess.
                         
          There's a KNOCK at the door.
                         
                          GUARD #1
           What is it?
                         
           MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.)
           Need to see the Captain.
                         
          The Guard exhales, frustrated. He stands up, getting his keys
          out. He stops. Opens the small EYEHOLE to see into the other
          room.
                         
          The Lieutenant stares back at him.
                         
                          GUARD #1
           Fine, fine.
                         
          He opens the door--
                         
          Only to see Conan standing there, holding the decapitated
          head of the Lieutenant.
                         
          The shocked Guard goes for his sword. Conan swings the
          Lieutenant's head, smashing it into the Guard's jaw and
          putting him down for the count.
                         
          That's when the Captain of the Guard turns around. And WE
          RECOGNIZE HIM! He's LUCIUS, the disfigured Aquilionian who
          was one of Khalar Singh's lieutenants.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           Men!

          From around a corner come five more Guards, drawing their
          weapons. Lucius draws his as well.
                         
                          LUCIUS (CONT'D)
           You've made a huge mistake, ape.
           You'll never make it out of this
           place.
                         
                          CONAN
           I came for you, Lucius.
                         
          Lucius nods to the guards, who advance on Conan.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           You talk as though you know me,
           ape.
                         
                          CONAN
           I do. And I am no ape. I am
           Cimmerian.
                         
          As recognition crosses Lucius' face, Conan springs into
          action. He KICKS the table at the men, sending the knives and
          other torture implements flying right into the first guard.
                         
          The second guard tries leaping over the falling table. Conan
          just grabs him in midair and throws him even faster into the
          iron bands of the prisoner cells.
                         
          Lucius lunges at Conan, Conan steps in on him, grabbing his
          sword hand. In a show of strength, he twists Lucius' own
          sword until points down at the floor, then THRUSTS IT THROUGH
          LUCIUS' FOOT AND DEEP INTO THE WOOD FLOOR BELOW.
                         
          Lucius BELLOWS in pain, pinned to the spot.
                         
          The next three Guards rush forward, forcing Conan to deal
          with three weapons attacks at once.
                         
          The first to strike swings a mace and chain that wraps around
          Conan's sword and he tries to yank it free from Conan's grip.
          Instead, Conan pulls him in a wide circle, sending him flying
          into a wall-mounted torch. The guard burns like dry kindling.
                         
          The second to strike hits Conan on his sword hand, carving a
          deep gash and causing him to drop his sword.
                         
          Conan turns to face him, eyes filled with rage. The guard's
          face goes pale. Conan head butts him with all his might and
          the guard goes down, bleeding from mouth, nose and ears.
           24.
                         
                         
          However, the last Guard is upon Conan before he can react.
          The powerful soldier uses the shaft of his poleax to lift
          Conan off his feet and back against the far wall, pinned by
          the neck.
                         
          Conan struggles to breathe, the polearm shaft driving his
          throat into the wall. The thickness of the Cimmerian's neck
          gives him time to reach into his bracer, pulling out a hidden
          knife which he buries into the Guardsman's eye.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Lucius SCREAMS in pain as Conan pours water on the burning
          guard, and lifts the table back onto its legs. Then he pulls
          the sword out of the floor, a thick plume of blood rising out
          of Lucius' now liberated foot.
                         
          Conan takes Lucius' face and smashes it against the table.
          Lucius looks, aghast, as Conan takes his injured hand and
          places it over the torch flame, searing the wound closed. The
          Cimmerian never even bats an eye.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           What do you want? Who are you?
                         
          Conan turns his face to the burnt side.
                         
                          CONAN
           I'm the one who made you pretty.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           Impossible! You're dead!
                         
          Conan shows Lucius the FIVE SCARS running down his forearm.
                         
                          CONAN
           No. I am death. And I came a long
           way for you.
                         
          Conan lifts the sword.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           Wait!! Wait!!
                          (CONAN PAUSES)
           I can tell you where the rest are.
                         
                          CONAN
           Where?
                         
                          LUCIUS
           The end of the earth. You kill me,
           and you'll never find them.
           25.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           Who are you offering?
                         
                          LUCIUS
           Who do you think? All of them.
           Ukafa, Remo, Cheren, Akhun -- and
           Khalar Singh himself. But you have
           to swear you won't kill me.
                         
          Conan thinks about it.
                         
                          CONAN
           You have my word. You tell me where
           I will find Khalar Singh, and I
           will not kill you.
                         
          Conan lets Lucius go. Lucius hobbles to his chair.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           He is in a city called on the edge
           of the Eastern Sea. On the edge of
           Hyboria. Khor Khalba.
                         
          Conan looks him in his eyes, sizing him up. He likes what he
          sees. In a flash, Conan grabs Lucius' head again, yanking it
          back, exposing his throat.
                         
                          LUCIUS (CONT'D)
           You gave your word!
                         
          Conan rips a SMALL KEY from a large keyring. He drops it in
          Lucius' throat. The big man chokes instantly. A second later,
          Conan pours ale from a flagon down his throat as well.
                         
          Lucius swallows the key, gasping for breath as Conan releases
          him.
                         
                          LUCIUS (CONT'D)
           What are you doing?!
                         
                          CONAN
           Toasting, to our deal.
                         
          Conan swings his sword and cuts the One Eyed Prisoner from
          the wall.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Go. You are free.
                         
          One-Eye looks at his wrists and ankles, still hobbled by
          shackles.
                         
                          ONE-EYED PRISONER
           I won't get far like this.
           26.
                         
                         
          Conan hands him a fallen Guardsmen's sword.
                         
                          CONAN
           The key to your shackles sits in
           the Captain's gut. Happy hunting.
                         
          The One-Eyed Prisoner grins with malice. As he closes in on
          the terrified Lucius, Conan heads for the door.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           Barbarian! I had your word! You
           said you would spare my life!
                         
                          CONAN
           No. I said I wouldn't kill you.
                         
          We hear Lucius SCREAMS OF PAIN as Conan walks out into the
          night, cutting another notch into his arm.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. DESERT SANDSTORM - DAY
                         
          KHALAR SINGH looks older. Worn. He squints as he stares into
          a howling sandstorm.
                         
          UKAFA trudges through the deep sand to reach him. The
          sandstorm is so blinding we don't see him until he is less
          than five feet away.
                         
                          UKAFA
           Khalar Singh, we've lost half our
           cavalry legion, and still Fariq
           presses on! We must turn back!
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           He says the Queen is here.
                         
                          UKAFA
           He leads us in circles. He knows
           nothing of leading an army --
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Take care, Ukafa. You hold a
           special place in my kingdom, but
           blood you are not.
                         
                          UKAFA
           My apologies, Khalar Singh. I am
           simply concerned for your army.
           27.
                         
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           And I would gladly sacrifice every
           last man to get my hands on the
           Queen. And in that respect, Fariq
           has my confidence. He knows more of
           the legends of Acheron than anyone.
                         
          Suddenly, two forms race at them from the blinding sand. REMO
          and FARIQ. No longer a child, Fariq is now a man in his
          twenties, but he is hardly the strong warrior his father is.
          His frame is slight, his eyes beady.
                         
                          FARIQ
           Father, they are here! The hidden
           oasis, just as it was written.
                         
          Khalar Singh looks to Remo for confirmation. The misshapen
          and shadowy Remo nods.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAVE TUNNEL - DAY
                         
          Remo and Fariq lead Khalar and Ukafa into a natural tunnel
          carved out of rock. Inside, the sandstorm no longer rages.
                         
          And on the other side of the tunnel --
                         
                         
          EXT. OASIS - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A protected rock oasis, heavy vegetation crawling up the
          encircling cliff walls, herds of sheep grazing on fields of
          grass. At its far end, beyond a deep blue pond, lies a Greek-
          influenced monastery and several tiled-roof, mud-brick
          houses.
                         
          And moving between the pools are MEN and WOMEN going about
          their simple chores. They wear long flowing white linen robes
          and turbans.
                         
          The air and sand are perfectly still within the perimeter of
          the oasis. But beyond it, the sandstorm rages all around,
          sand hurled violently hundreds of feet into the air, swirling
          around the oasis as though it were the eye of some mystical
          hurricane, protected by an unseen force.
                         
          A row of robed YOUNG WOMEN kneel in front of one of the
          reflecting pools, quietly reading from prayer books and
          softly striking their right breast with a left hands wrapped
          in thorns.
                         
          One girl, ILIRA, mischievously taps the shoulder of the girl
          next to her with her thorn. The girl, TAMARA, squeals in
          pain, angry her prayer was interrupted.
           28.
                         
                         
          Ilira is the fun-loving dilettante of the relationship.
          Tamara the studious good girl.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Stop it! I'm trying to pray!
                         
                          ILIRA
           I'm bored.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Then hit yourself.
                         
          Tamara hits Ilira back with her thorn. Ilira SQUEALS, then
          hits a grinning Tamara back. Tamara grabs her, but as they
                         TUSSLE--
                         
           FASSIR (O.S.)
           Is that how one shows penitence?
                         
          Both girls instantly stop as FASSIR appears behind them.
          Fassir is an elder monk and leader of the monastery. He
          shakes his head, both out of fondness and disappointment.
                         
                          FASSIR (CONT'D)
           I expect more from a queen.
                         
                          ILIRA
           I'm sorry, Fassir. I just tire of
           saying the same prayer every day.
                         
                          FASSIR
           Then you should be able to
           translate it from its original
           Acheronian.
                         
          Ilira's face scrunches, unsure. Tamara steps in to help Ilira
          save face.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Of course she can. She even taught
           it to me. "Never again."
                         
                          FASSIR
           Go on.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Never again will we stand by as
           darkness consumes the world. Never
           again will innocents suffer for
           others' power. Never again will the
           Queen suffer so Acheron may rise.
           29.
                         
                         
                          FASSIR
           Very good, Tamara. You must have
           taught her very well indeed, Ilira.
                         
          A smile on Fassir's face confirms he knows the truth.
                         
          Suddenly, the monastery's BELL RINGS OUT. A moment later, a
          temple EXPLODES in flames.
                         
          Pouring out from the swirling sands come Khalar Singh's army.
          Cheren and his archers stand atop Khalar's
                         
          MAN OF WAR
                         
          A massive siege engine atop which CHEREN and his archers fire
          FLAMING ARROWS. The arrows arc down and explode as they
          impact the tiled roofs.
                         
          Sitting at the highest point of the Man Of War, Khalar Singh
          likes what he sees.
                         
                         CHAOS
                         
          The monks scatter in every direction, but wherever they turn,
          more troops burst out of the swirling sand.
                         
          A small handful of armed MONKS display acrobatic martial arts
          prowess as they battle with Khalar's heavily armed forces,
          but they are vastly outnumbered.
                         
          Fassir grabs Tamara.
                         
                          FASSIR (CONT'D)
           The Queen must not be captured.
           Take her out the North Gate.
           Quickly!
                         
          Tamara grabs Ilira and pulls her through the flaming
          battleground. Zingaran warriors cut down the monks while
          Turanian horsemen concentrate on the women.
                         
                          ILIRA
           We can't leave them.
                         
                          TAMARA
           If you are caught, everything we
           live for is lost!
                         
          WHIP! A whip encircles Ilira's waist. A massive TURANIAN
          pulls her to him. Tamara grabs the whip, pulling Ilira the
          other way. But she is no match for the huge slaver. He yanks
          on the whip pulling both of them to him --
           30.
                         
                         
          Only then does he notice Tamara's unsheathed knife which she
          plunges into his throat.
                         
          She frees Ilira and they run.
                         
                         
          INT. NORTH PASSAGE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A thin alleyway at the rear of the monastery, leading away
          from the din of battle, towards a rear gate of the oasis.
                         
          Tamara and Ilira run for the gate, only for the shadows of
          the alleyway to move and shift -- REMO and three of his
          shadow scouts.
                         
          They advance on the women, drawing dark shortswords.
                         
                          REMO
           No swords. Khalar needs them alive.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Good to know.
                         
          Tamara lunges for the nearest shadow scout with her knife,
          but when she strikes, she hits nothing but shadow. It reforms
          behind her and grabs her.
                         
          Another grabs Ilira. Tamara launches her body into the air,
          executing a backflip that puts her behind the shadow scout. A
          quick knife strike and he goes down.
                         
          And with one continuous motion, she vaults over the shadow
          scout holding Tamara, cutting his throat as well.
                         
          Remo and the remaining scout give chase, blending in and out
          of shadows. But each time they strike, Tamara defends Ilira.
          They near the far end of the alleyway, the North gate looming
          ahead with the desert beyond.
                         
          Remo blends into another shadow --
                         
                         
          EXT. MAN OF WAR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Remo materializes out of a shadow atop the Man Of War, next
          to Cheren, the archer.
                         
                          REMO
           The north gate. Destroy it.
                         
          Cheren and the other archers turn their fire to the gate at
          the end of the passage. They fire a volley of fiery arrows.
           31.
                         
                         
          INT. NORTH GATE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Tamara and Ilira run for the whirling sands just ahead --
          when the flaming arrows land before them.
                         
          Ilira hesitates.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Run!
                         
                          ILIRA
           We'll die!
                         
                          TAMARA
           We'll die if we stay!
                         
          She locks eyes with Ilira, who nods. Together they run right
          for the arrows.
                         
          But at the last minute, Ilira falters. She falls to the
          ground.
                         
          Tamara turns to see Ilira lying in the gateway a moment too
          late.
                         
          THE ARROWS EXPLODE causing a cave in that closes the gateway.
                         
                         
          EXT. SANDSTORM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Tamara falls to the sand as the gate collapses behind her.
          She looks back, only to see that Ilira didn't make it.
                         
                          TAMARA
           NO!!!

          Khalar Singh stares at the cloud of destruction at the north
          tunnel.
                         
          There, one form hurries into the swirling sandstorm.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Who was guarding that gate?
                         
                          REMO
           It was I, Lord.
           32.

           I hunt you.

          EXT. DESERT - DAY
                         
          Tamara stumbles through a stretch of barren wasteland, the
          plumes of the oasis' sandstorm now off in the distance behind
          her.
                         
          The sun mercilessly beats down upon her face, her lips are
          already chapped. She falls to her knees, unable to go on.
                         
          She looks up, as the heat streams off the desert floor,
          creating a swirling mirage. Through which the silhouette of a
          rider appears, followed by others.
                         
                         SLAVER CARAVAN
                         
          The horse-drawn carts of the caravan are lined with iron
          bars, and behind the bars are a bevy of young women, mostly
          looking worse for wear.
                         
          The HEAD SLAVER rides ahead, and walks up to the heap of
          white cloth that is Tamara.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Water -- please --
                         
          He lifts her barely conscious head, eyeing her features, a
          greasy paw examining her body. He smiles.
                         
                          HEAD SLAVER
           The gods are good.
           (to the other slavers)
           Chain this one in my cage. She'll
           be the prize of the auction in Khor
           Kalba.

          EXT. OASIS - NIGHT
                         
          The Man of War dominates the center of the oasis, its torches
          illuminating the scene before it. Akhun and the Turanians
          hold chains connected to the twenty women monks, kneeling,
          with their wrists chained to their neck collars.
                         
          In front of them kneels Fassir, beaten and bloodied.
           33.
                         
                         
          Khalar Singh, Fariq, and Ukafa step down from the Man of War.
          Fariq carries with him a large iron box with ornate carvings
          on it.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           All these years searching the ends
           of the earth. And here you are.
           Just a two day ride from Khor
           Kalba. I can scarcely believe it.
                         
                          FASSIR

                          (IN ACHERONIAN)
           Yes. Say nothing. Maybe he doesn't
           know who we are. Maybe he's not
           looking for the Queen.
                         
          Several of the women look up at him, shocked.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           That's right, my brethren, you have
           been lied to all your lives. Told
           you must hide yourselves, told you
           were alone. I want you to look at
           me, and see me for what I am. A
           brother. A friend. I have come not
           to hurt you, but liberate you.
                         
                          FASSIR
           You come for your own dark
           purposes, to raise Acheron.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Yes. I come to resurrect the
           greatest empire Hyboria has ever
           known.
                         
                          FASSIR
           An empire of evil, soaked in blood
           sacrifice and the blackest of
           magic.
                         
          Khalar Singh becomes infuriated, eyes blazing.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Have you hidden from the world so
           long that you cannot to see? Blood,
           magic, death: it is everywhere.
           Acheron is no different than any
           other kingdom, but for its glory.
                          (MORE)

           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           And in place of that glory, you
           offer shame? I knew shame, but that
           was before I was shown my true
           lineage.
                         
          Khalar draws closer to the women, looking them each in the
          eye.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           When I was but a child, raiders
           destroyed my village, cut our
           fathers to ribbons, and burned our
           women as sacrifice to foreign gods.
           Those few who survived, we ran for
           our lives, chased into caves at the
           edge of the Eastern Sea, left with
           nothing to live for. But then we
           discovered it. Acheron. The temple
           that spawned an empire. We learned
           that we were not broken goat-
           herders on a desolate coastline. We
           were the sons and daughters of
           kings.
           (stares in Ilira's eyes)
           And queens.

           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           For thirty years I have searched
           for you. In that time I built both
           an army and empire, but they are
           nothing compared to what we can
           create together. We can raise
           Acheron again. Never again will we
           hide like rats. Never again will we
           watch as our loved ones are
           slaughtered. I call forth the
           Queen. Stand and join me, and this
           day will have a joyous end.
                         
          No one moves.

           You would have all the world
           suffer, as you have suffered. We
           will die before we help you.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Yes. You will.
                         
          He nods to his son. He paces in front of the female monks,
          the box in front of them.

           The caves beneath Khor Khalba
           contain all manner of creature,
           many -- altered -- by centuries of
           blood magic. But one, in
           particular, has developed a special
           connection to the blood. A thirst.
           It is said that only the Queen of
           Acheron itself can resist its
           embrace.

           So what say you? Will you be the
           lucky one, or will you tell me who
           is?
                         
          A tear falls down her face, but she stays silent. There's the
          sound of SLITHERING as Fariq opens the box. She stares down
          inside the box --
                         
          AND SCREAMS.

          Tamara's eyes are met by a dozen others, SLAVES of every
          color, chained together with her in a CAGED WAGON. The SLAVE
          TRADER swings his whip twice more, hitting the cowering women
          in the cage.
                         
                          SLAVE TRADER

           approaches!
                         
          Tamara makes eye contact with the Slave Trader.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Let me go. I promise you'll be
           rewarded.
                         
          The Trader just laughs, leering at her.
                         
                          SLAVE TRADER
           And I would sample that reward,
           fair one, but you wear white.
                          (MORE)
           36.
                         
           SLAVE TRADER (CONT'D)
           Tell me, have the stars aligned and
           delivered a virgin slave into my
           care?
                         
          He eyes her lasciviously. Tamara turns away and does not
          answer.
                         
           SLAVE TRADER (CONT'D)
           No matter. I'll know soon enough.
                          (TURNS AWAY)
           Good day, sir! A lone rider in a
           desolate land. The perfect customer
           for what I sell.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Rides out of the sun, his massive form silhouetted by the
          bright desert sky. He stares at the slave wagons.
                         
                          SHEMISH WOMAN
           Please, master! Your gold can free
           me from this hole! I can bring you
                          PLEASURE--
                         
          The Slave Trader immediately WHIPS her, incensed.
                         
                          SLAVE TRADER
           Silence whore!
                         
          The Slaver goes to whip her again, but before the blow can
          fall, Conan grabs his arm. The Slave Trader looks furious,
          but Conan's size holds him back.
                         
                          CONAN
           Khor Kalba. Which way?
                         
                          SLAVE TRADER
           This is the road to Khor Kalba.
           Ahead. Past the Great Wall.
                         
          The Slaver nods to the east and Conan releases his arm.
                         
          The Slaver continues whipping the slave. Conan just rides on -
          - not his problem.
                         
          But as Conan passes Tamara, for a brief moment their eyes
          meet. Something about her. Conan stares a moment, then spurs
          his horse on.
                         
          Just then, the ground around them RUMBLES. Horses rear, the
          women SCREAM. Conan turns and looks up. His eyes go wide.
                         
                         ENORMOUS BOULDERS
           37.
                         
                         
          Coming thundering down the hills on all sides. The SLAVERS
          see them a moment to late.
                         
          SLAM. Several of the horses and carts are smashed by the
          rolling boulders.
                         
          Conan kicks his horse, trying to outrace the boulders. But
          when the wagon next to him is hit, its axle spears his horse
          in its side, and Conan goes down.
                         
          Pissed, he draws his sword. The Slavers scramble around the
          broken wagons, in chaos.
                         
          Only a pair of wagons still stands. One of them holds Tamara.
                         
                          CONAN
           Use your whips on the horses' legs!
                         
          The Slavers are confused. Then they notice
                         
                         TURANIAN HORSEMEN
                         
          racing down the hill, behind the boulders.
                         
          As the riders bear down upon the slavers, the Slavers do as
          they're told, entangling the legs of the first wave of
          horses, throwing their riders.
                         
          More than a few riders SNAP their necks as they're driven
          into the desert floor. The remainder fight hand to hand, and
          are cut down by either Conan's blade or the slavers' tulwars.
          But their victory is short lived --
                         
          As a SECOND WAVE OF RIDERS comes thundering towards them,
          before the Slavers can re-establish their perimeter. The
          riders start cutting the slavers down where they stand.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Conan lodges his sword in a still-rolling boulder. As it
          rolls, it pulls him up on top of it. From this height, Conan
          launches himself down at the horsemen below.
                         
          WHAM! He knocks a rider off his horse, Conan landing square
          in the saddle. He kicks the horse straight at the other
          riders. They don't see him coming until it's too late. He
          cuts them down where they sit.
                         
          The last remaining CARAVAN DRIVER whips his horse team,
          trying to pull his wagon out of the fight. Conan spins to see
          a FLASH of steel and the rider's neck plumes in blood as he's
          decapitated.
           38.
                         
                         
          Which is strange since the cavalry are nowhere near the
          wagon.
                         
                         REMO
                         
          The explanation comes as the shadow behind the driver MORPHS
          into Remo, the spindly Shadow Scout. He takes the reins,
          stopping the wagon.
                         
          Conan spots him, recognition in his eyes.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           You!
                         
          There's a SCREAM. Conan turns to see the other two SHADOW
          SCOUTS already hacking their way through the slaves on one of
          the caged wagons. A Shadow Scout gets to Tamara, only to have
          her FIGHT BACK.
                         
          Tamara kicks the first Scout in the face, slamming his head
          into the bars. However, the second one clubs her unconscious
          from behind.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Leaps from his horse, launching his body at Remo. Remo dives
          and rolls away. Small and misshapen, he is nonetheless very
          fast.
                         
          Conan strikes again. Again Remo dodges out of the way.
                         
          The Shadow Scouts draw swords, but Remo waves them off,
          speaking in the broken language of a savage.
                         
                          REMO
           The girl! Bring her to Khalar!
                         
          Conan launches an all out attack. Remo leaps over his sword
          and vaults Conan, landing on his back. He draws his sword,
          preparing to cut Conan's throat --
                         
          When Conan hurls his body backwards, into one of the huge
          rolling boulders. The impact crushes Remo and he loses his
          grip.
                         
          Conan spins to strike again, only to see Remo MELT INTO THE
          SHADOW OF THE BOULDER.
                         
          Conan turns his attention towards the other two Shadow Scouts
          as they drag the unconscious Tamara away.
           39.
                         
                         
          Conan mounts one of the cavalry horses and gallops towards
          the Scouts. They see him coming and let go of Tamara. THEY
          MELT AWAY INTO HER SHADOW AND DISAPPEAR.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          Dazed, she struggles to her feet. Conan appears beside her,
          his dagger out. Tamara gasps in fear but Conan only reaches
          out and breaks the lock on her chains.
                         
                          CONAN
           Who are you?
                         
                          TAMARA
           I am nobody.
                         
          He cuts the bonds on her feet. Tamara rises up, the battle
          scene revealed to her.
                         
          Dead bodies of the Slavers and Turanian horsemen lie sprawled
          in every direction. Tamara takes in the gruesome sight,
          shocked.
                         
                          CONAN
           Many died to capture nobody.
           (motions to his horse)
           Get up.
                         
                          TAMARA
           And if I don't wish to ride with
           you?
                         
                         
          EXT. DESERT - DAY
                         
          Conan rides his horse, Tamara trailing on foot, wrists
          tethered to Conan's saddle by a long rope. Tamara looks
          exhausted.
                         
          They reach a gallery of broken columns, spires of fossilized
          coral that juts out of the desert.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Stop! I want water.
                         
          Conan just keeps riding.
                         
                          CONAN
           Perhaps the slavers took your
           orders. I don't.
           40.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           I never knew men could be so cruel.
           Now I wonder if the world is filled
           with animals such as you.
                         
                          CONAN
           You speak of animals as if they
           were less than men. But animals
           don't stab their brothers in the
           back or steal their mother's only
           possession. And they never lie.
                         
                          TAMARA
           I haven't lied.
                         
          Conan get off his horse, unties Tamara and gives her a water
          sack. Tamara greedily drinks down the water.
                         
                          CONAN
           Very well. Give me your name.
                         
                          TAMARA
           I am Tamara Amelia Karushan. And
           you?
                         
                          CONAN
           I am Conan.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Conan? That's it?
                         
                          CONAN
           What more names do I need?
                         
          Conan then grabs Tamara around her waist, putting her atop
          his horse. He then mounts behind her, their bodies close.
          Conan's mouth is only inches from her ear as he speaks.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           There is only one truth I need from
           you, Tamara Amelia Karushan. Why
           does Khalar Singh want you?
                         
          Tamara looks away, but doesn't respond.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Then let's hope it's for your
           cooking.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT
                         
          A campfire amidst several large boulders, a line of windmills
          on the horizon.
           41.
                         
                         
          Tamara struggles to manage a cooking pot over a blaze. Conan
          comes over and smells the pot; his face scrunches from the
          odor.
                         
                          CONAN
           Trying to poison me?
                         
          Tamara steps back and gets down on her knees, her hands
          clasped.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           What are you doing?
                         
                          TAMARA
           Before we eat, I must pray.
                         
                          CONAN
           Crom! What would you pray for? That
           a bone may not get stuck in your
           throat? No words nor gods will give
           you one more moment than fate
           allows you.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Then you have no faith. And I am
           sorry for you.
                         
                          CONAN
           I need no pity.
                         
                          TAMARA
           But you do. You live in a world
           that is harsh and short. Where fate
           is unyielding and hope is a cruel
           joke. I live in a world with a
           purpose that guides me, where faith
           sustains me.
                         
          Suddenly, Conan KICKS DIRT PAST TAMARA, ONTO THE FIRE. The
          fire goes out, plunging everything into darkness.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Why did you--
                         
          Suddenly, there's the sound of FIGHTING. Grunting, blows
          being interchanged, then a LOUD SNAP AS BONES ARE BROKEN.
                         
          A moment later, the flames of the fire are stoked up again,
          revealing Conan standing over the groaning REMO. The other
          two SHADOW SCOUTS are dead.
                         
          Tamara instinctively jumps back.
           42.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           Don't worry. His back is broken. He
           won't be slinking away this time.
                         
          As Tamara gapes at Remo, Conan simply pulls the cooking pot
          off the fire.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Now, let's eat.
                         
                          TAMARA
           But -- what about him?!
                         
          Remo GROANS in pain.
                         
                          CONAN
           I enjoy a little music with my
           meal.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          AERIAL SHOT - POV - SOARING
                         
          Across steep valleys and up jagged peaks we race into steep
          and unforgiving mountains. Far off, we hear a pair of
          thunderous booms, almost like the sound of a heartbeat.
          THUMP, THUMP.
                         
          Cresting over a set of peaks, a gorge is revealed below, and
                         BENEATH IT--
                         
                         
          EXT. ACHERON - NIGHT - MOVING
                         
          A city carved out of the purple granite of a mountainous
          gorge. Hundred-foot towers rise up, their pinnacles crafted
          to depict ANGRY, GOD-LIKE FACES.
                         
          As we pass one of the faces, again we hear the sound of a
          thunderous heartbeat, now closer. THUMP, THUMP.
                         
          We GLIDE DOWN past hundred foot high pillars of flames,
          towards the growing sounds of SCREAMING and WAILING.
                         
          The streets of Acheron are lined with thousands of SLAVES,
          young and old, chained together, toiling under the lash of
          their cruel masters, the
                         
                         ACHERONIAN WARRIORS
                         
          Towering over the slaves, the warriors are a fearsome sight.
          Their armor, crafted from the bones of their defeated
          enemies, rises to a mask which covers much of their features.
           43.
                         
                         
          Only the red irises of their eyes peer through. That and
          their pitch black skin.
                         
          The slaves hobble down the main boulevard, their naked feet
          splashing in streams of BLOOD which flow from the
                         
                         ACHERONIAN PYRAMID
                         
          Up ahead looms a colossal pyramid, surrounded in a semi-
          circle by five massive statues. As we grow closer the
          grotesque surface of the pyramid becomes clearer, one hewn
          from cracked bone and empty sockets.
                         
          The thunderous heartbeat seems all around us now. THUMP,
          THUMP.
                         
          The three hundred foot high edifice is made ENTIRELY OF
          THOUSANDS OF HUMAN SKULLS. Many of the skulls still drip with
          blood, pouring down from the pyramid's crest, where stands
                         
          A BLACK THRONE
                         
          Images of snakes gorging themselves on hapless victims are
          carved in bas relief into the throne's surface.
                         
          Standing before the throne, surrounded by BLACK ROBED PRIESTS
          are a man and woman, mere shadows in the silhouette of
          torches.
                         
          The HEAD PRIEST and his ACOLYTE approach with TWO CROWNS. One
          is made of GOLD, the other of IRON.
                         
          The Gold crown goes on the head of the man. For the woman,
          the Iron crown is placed on her head.
                         
          And suddenly, THUMP, THUMP. IRON SPIKES SHOOT OUT OF THE IRON
          CROWN PIERCING THE WOMAN'S FOREHEAD, HER SCREAMS ECHOES
          THROUGHOUT THE CITY.
                         
          Blood streams down the woman's face as she turns toward the
          torchlight.
                         
          IT IS TAMARA.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT
                         
          Tamara leaps up, startled. Her face is covered in sweat, her
          eyes as terrified as the victim from her dream.
                         
          Nearby we hear screaming of another type. Remo.
           44.
                         
                         
          EXT. OPEN FIELD - NIGHT
                         
          MUFFLED SCREAMS. We pull out of Remo's wide mouth, stuffed
          with cloth, trying to bellow in uncontrollable agony.
                         
          A hand comes in and pulls out the cloth. It's Conan.
                         
                          REMO
           Please! Mercy!
                         
                          CONAN
           You are more fit to inflict torture
           than to endure it. Your life is not
           nailed to your spine as my peoples
           are.
                         
          We PULL OUT, revealing that Remo arms are spread-eagle,
          attached to ropes pulled taught by opposing tree limbs.
                         
          Conan nudges him with the point of his sword. Remo SCREAMS in
          agony, then speaks in his savage, broken dialect.
                         
                          REMO
           Stop! Stop! I know how make you
           rich! Rich! You hear name Khalar
           Singh? You have what he want. The
           girl, yes? Khalar give you anything
           for her. More!
                         
                          CONAN
           Why would he?
                         
          Remo pauses, not wanting to answer. Conan put the blade back
          to Remo's neck.
                         
                          REMO
           She could be the one.
                         
                          CONAN
           One what?
                         
                          REMO
           The one. The Queen.
                         
          Conan's mind races, remembering Khalar's words from long ago.
                         
                          CONAN
           A queen in hiding.
                         
                          REMO
           Yes! Yes! I sent to find her. Bring
           her. He wait for me now, at Great
           Wall. He pay you anything. More!
           45.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           So I should ransom her to your
           master? Not exactly loyal -- but
           still, a good idea.
                         
          Conan pulls out a sheet of handwritten paper from Remo's
          tunic.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           You'll help me deliver it.
                         
                         
          EXT. GREAT WALL - NIGHT
                         
          Torchlight dots the heights of a fifty-foot high stone wall,
          erected between giant rock formations, an impassable barrier
          that runs countless miles.
                         
          The wreckage of old siege equipment dots the hillside before
          the wall.
                         
                         
          EXT. CATAPULT - NIGHT
                         
          An aging catapult looks down upon the wall below. Slowly, it
          begins to turn.
                         
          Conan pushes the catapult until it aims towards the Great
          Wall.
                         
          We hear MUFFLED SCREAMS, and find Remo tied to a boulder
          cradled in the catapult. Conan pulls the gag out of Remo's
          mouth.
                         
                          REMO
           Please! Please! I help you! I do
           anything you wish!
                         
          Conan stuffs a parchment in his mouth. He takes out his sword
          and cuts another NOTCH into his arm.
                         
                          CONAN
           Good. Die.
                         
          He then cuts the rope and WHOOSH! The catapult fires tossing
          Remo and the rock he's tied to high into the night sky.
                         
                         
          EXT. GREAT WALL - NIGHT
                         
          BOOM! Patrolling SOLDIERS are crushed beneath the massive
          rock as it reduces a section of wall to rubble.
                         
                          CUT TO:
           46.
                         
                         
                         KHALAR
                         
          Stares down at Remo's broken body. Ukafa and Fariq stand
          beside him.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           He brought a message?
                         
          Ukafa hands him the bloodied parchment. Khalar reads it.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Gold, for the girl. A ransom, for
           me to deliver in person.
                         
                          UKAFA
           I'll find them -- and come back
           with their heads.
                         
                          FARIQ
           You let the girl escape once,
           Ukafa. What makes you think you can
           do better now?
                         
                          UKAFA
           I did what?
                         
                          FARIQ
           I found the monastery. It was my
           understanding that you were in
           charge of its capture --
                         
          Ukafa's anger grows.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Enough! We will take no chances. We
           will pay this thief what he wants,
           and more.
                         
                         
          EXT. BRIDGE TO NOWHERE - NIGHT
                         
          Conan returns from the nearby hills, carrying a pair of
          rabbits he's hunted and skinned.
                         
          He looks around, surprised not to find Tamara. He hears a
          yelp from nearby and walks to a dirt path beyond the
          clearing.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          She's tied up and gagged and she's wormed her way this far,
          muddying and scraping herself all along the way. She lets out
          a frustrated grunt as Conan simply picks her back up and
          carries her back to the outcropping.
           47.
                         
                         
          He pulls the gag from her mouth and drops a skinned rabbit at
          her feet.
                         
                          CONAN
           Here. Eat.
                         
          Tamara squirms away from the carcass, disgusted.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Couldn't you at least cook it
           first?
                         
                          CONAN
           Fire draws attention.
                         
          Conan tears into his rabbit, chewing on the raw meat.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Does it bother you, blood on your
           hands?
                         
                          CONAN
           The only blood on these hands I
           claimed with my own sword.
                         
                          TAMARA
           What does that mean?
                         
                          CONAN
           Clean hands mean nothing. Kings and
           Queens claim more lives than I will
           ever meet, and not a drop is
           spilled in their presence.
                         
                          TAMARA
           What are you talking about? I've
           done no harm to you. I've done no
           harm to anyone.
                         
          Conan confronts her, enraged.
                         
                          CONAN
           You lie. You are the very reason my
           people are dead.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Are you mad? I never met your
           people.
                         
                          CONAN
           But Khalar Singh has. He destroyed
           my people, looking for you.
                         
          Suddenly Tamara understands.
           48.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           The one who came for us? His name
           is Khalar Singh?
                         
                          CONAN
           You know this.
                         
                          TAMARA
           We did not know who sought us, only
           that we were sought.
                         
                          CONAN
           You hid from him. And while you
           did, others died in your place.
                         
                          TAMARA
           If we did not hide, countless more
           would have been killed! You do not
           know what purpose he has for our
           queen.
                         
                          CONAN
           And I do not care, for he will not
           live to see it bear fruit!
                         
          Tamara is shocked.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Wait -- you seek to kill this
           Khalar? We have the same aim. He
           takes my queen to Khor Kalba. I
           have sworn an oath to protect her.
           I can help you.
                         
                          CONAN
           Enough lies.
                         
          Conan puts the gag back in her mouth and binds her hands.
                         
                         
          EXT. ROCK RIDGE - NIGHT
                         
          Conan watches the Great Wall silently, absently playing with
          a DAGGER in his hand as he gauges the many guardposts along
          the wall. The archers. The barrels of oil. The cavalry.
                         
          He feels eyes upon him and looks down at Tamara, still bound
          and gagged, her eyes burning holes in his forehead. Conan
          pulls out her gag.
                         
                          CONAN
           You will keep quiet.
           49.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           What use is talking? You won't
           believe a word I speak. I only want
           to know this -- how will you kill
           Khalar? You are too big to play the
           assassin.
                         
                          CONAN
           You will be the lure that will draw
           me close. Then I will scale the
           wall and cut him down where he
           stands.
                         
                          TAMARA
           And the archers and cavalry? They
           will be napping?
                         
                          CONAN
           They will not be a problem.
                         
          Tamara thinks about it.
                         
                          TAMARA
           No. Not good enough.
                         
          Conan is shocked by her brazen response.
                         
                          CONAN
           Did I ask?
                         
                          TAMARA
           Should you fail, I'll be left
           without a weapon, helpless in my
           enemies hands. Let me help, Conan.
                         
          Conan responds by putting the gag back in her mouth.
                         
                          CONAN
           I will not fail.
                         
          But still Tamara glares at him -- and we can see the hint of
          Conan's resolve bending.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. GREAT WALL - DAY
                         
          Khalar Singh stands atop the wall, awaiting Conan. Fariq
          draws close.
                         
                          FARIQ
           Let me take care of this thief,
           father. He's beneath your notice.
           50.
                         
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           He killed Remo, likely his cavalry
           legion as well. Whatever he is, he
           is more than a mere thief.
                         
          Then, off in the distance, at the far edge of the desert
          clearing, two figures step out from amongst the boulders.
                         
          CONAN AND TAMARA
                         
          Conan holds a squirming, but bound Tamara.
                         
                          CONAN
           Be still!
                         
          Conan thrusts Tamara in Khalar's direction.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           (yelling to Khalar)
           I have what you want! Where's my
           gold?!
                         
                         KHALAR
                         
          Khalar reaches down and lifts a heavy sack of gold coins.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
                          (YELLING BACK)
           Triple your price. Come and claim
           it.
                         
          GATES OF THE WALL - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          The gates open and Khalar strides out into the clearing.
                         
          CONAN AND TAMARA
                         
          stand a hundred feet ahead.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Send her to me.
                         
                          CONAN
           Send the gold.
                         
          Khalar Singh throws the gold sack. It lands halfway between
          them. He sends Tamara ahead, her mouth gagged.
                         
          But the moment Tamara reaches the gold --
                         
          From out underneath the sand, FOUR HORSEMEN rise up out of
          the desert floor. They each bear weighted nets and spiked
          lances, and they surround Conan.
           51.
                         
                         
          The first rider gallops towards Conan who simply LOPS OFF THE
          HORSES FRONT LEGS. As the beast collapses, Conan crushes the
          rider's skull with his broadsword.
                         
          The next two riders attack together, but Conan dodges their
          nets and rips away one of their spears, only to lodge it into
          the other rider's chest. He dives at and tackles the first
          rider, TOPPLING HIM, ALONG WITH HIS HORSE. He snaps the
          second rider's neck.
                         
          The last rider comes at Conan, who horizontally slashes RIGHT
          THROUGH THE HORSE'S NECK AND THEN THE RIDER'S NECK. Both
          human and animal head tumble to the desert floor.
                         
          All four riders are dead, in a matter of seconds.
                         
                         KHALAR
                         
          Smiles. He's got Tamara by the neck.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You're fast. But are you fast
           enough?
                         
          Conan's eyes go to the top of the wall, where CHEREN and his
          archer prepare to fire. Conan rushes forward as the flaming
          arrows stream toward him.
                         
          EXPLOSIONS rip through the air where Conan was, throwing up a
          huge dust cloud.
                         
          Conan bursts out of the dust cloud, lunging in an attack.
                         
          But Khalar Singh is not there. He has withdrawn inside the
          gates.
                         
          Baring his teeth, Conan runs at the wall itself.
                         
          Cheren and the archers let loose another volley at Conan, who
          evades and strikes away the falling arrows with his sword.
                         
          Explosions fill the air, but none of them scorch Conan as he
                         REACHES
                         
          THE GREAT WALL
                         
          Conan hits the base of the wall at full stride, like a
          mountain lion. Reaching out, he launches himself up, taking
          half the vertical of the wall in a single leap.
                         
          Digging his hand into the seam of the wooden beams, he stops
          only to vault up again, taking the forty foot wall in two
          upward bounds.
           52.
                         
                         
                         WALL WALK
                         
          Conan leaps upon wall walk, the passageway atop the Great
          Wall.
                         
                         FARIQ
                         
          Tries to hide his surprise. Even as he draws his sword, Conan
          takes out the four SOLDIERS in his way.
                         
                          FARIQ
           You should have run, while you
           could.
                         
          Conan looks at the sword. It strikes a chord in him. IT IS
          THE SWORD HIS FATHER FORGED! Enraged, Conan charges the
          slight Fariq.
                         
          Fariq partially parries the attack. He's obviously well-
          trained, but he's no match for Conan. The tip of Conan' blade
          cuts a large gash in Fariq's cheek.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Fariq!
                         
          Khalar Singh arrives, grabbing his son by his collar and
          flinging him away from the barbarian. Fariq struggles to
          stand, trying in vain to hide his embarrassment.
                         
          Conan and Khalar Singh size each other up on the narrow wall
          walk.
                         
                          CONAN
           I was wondering what it would take
           for you to stop cowering.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           I wasn't cowering. I was studying.
           You're quite gifted with a sword,
           but it's not from schooling. Your
           speed and power makes up for a lack
           of -- finesse. I've seen such
           fighting before -- Cimmerian.
                         
          Enraged, Conan charges Khalar Singh. He swings down on Khalar
          Singh's head, only when the sword reaches it, it finds
          nothing but air. Khalar is fast.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Cimmerian it is. Now it makes
           sense. You came for blood, not
           gold.
           53.
                         
                         
          Conan responds by lunging in, swinging his broadsword in a
          broad arc, with all his might. Even in the small space,
          Khalar's lateral speed is dizzying. He sidesteps Conan's
          attack and backhands Conan's face with the flat of his
          tulwar.
                         
          Conan's resolve wavers momentarily, knowing Khalar could have
          just as easily sliced his throat.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Your people barely afforded me a
           challenge. You're little more than
           beasts.
                         
          Conan comes at Khalar with twice as much fury, smashing
          entire posts as he hacks at the warlord, who simply evades
          the attack.
                         
          Down the wall walk they move, Conan attacking while Khalar
          seems complacent enough just to defend.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           You've come a long way, barbarian,
           only to fail.
                         
          Khalar ducks Conan's last wild swing and gashes Conan twice,
          both deeply in his midsection. Khalar then KICKS Conan,
          sending the Cimmerian slamming onto the rock parapet.
                         
          CRUNCH. Conan lands directly on his back, his sword
          clattering away from him. Khalar's men back away into a
          circle. Conan struggles to get on all fours.
                         
          Khalar KICKS Conan in his shattered chest, lifting Conan off
          the ground with his might. He follows up with a devastating
          punch to Conan's face, one which lands like a piledriver.
          CRUNCH.
                         
          Conan can only bleed as Khalar looms over him.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           So much for vengeance.
           (to his soldiers)
           Get me oil -- and a torch.
                         
          Soldiers quickly bring over a bucket of oil and a lit torch.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Is that really the best you could
           do? Is that as far as you could
           think ahead? Just rush in and kill
           me?
           54.
                         
                         
          Behind Khalar Singh, Conan spots Tamara being brought up, her
          hands bound. Her eyes show an intense fear, but resolve as
          well.
                         
                         TAMARA' HANDS
                         
          Between the bonds she slips down a blade. It's CONAN'S
          DAGGER. She quickly cuts her bonds.
                         
          With all the attention focused on Conan, no one is quick
          enough to stop her as GRABS THE TORCH FROM THE SOLDIER,
          LIGHTING THE ARROWS IN CHEREN'S QUIVER.
                         
          Cheren spins around, sees the flames reaching his pitched
          arrows.
                         
                          CHEREN
           No!!
                         
          But it's far too late. Tamara hits the floor, beside Conan.
          BOOM.
                         
                         EXPLOSION
                         
          The blast sends parts of Cheren flying in every direction.
          Ukafa, Fariq, and the wall guards are flattened by the
          concussion.
                         
          Khalar Singh, who was standing closer to the explosion, is
          THROWN AGAINST THE WALL!
                         
                         KHALAR SINGH
                         
          The warlord slowly rises, his head pounding from the
          explosion. He looks up. The entire parapet is on fire.
                         
          He grits his teeth and climbs the wall.
                         
          ATOP THE WALL
                         
          A thick wall of flame rages before Khalar. Conan and Tamara
          are gone. He looks over the far side of the wall, where two
          figures on horseback ride off into the distance, Tamara
          holding Conan atop the horse.
                         
          Ukafa and Fariq rise and see what Khalar Singh sees.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Ukafa, you will take half our
           forces North, to the Sea. I will
           take the rest South.
                         
                          FARIQ
           What of me, father?
           55.
                         
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You will return to Khor Kalba. You
           will feed the women to the beast
           until you find our Queen.
                         
                          FARIQ
           I will not. I will track the
           barbarian with you --
                         
          Enraged, Khalar Singh grabs him by the back of his head,
          pulling him in close.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You think I care what you wish?!
           You want to play warrior? It is not
           in you. One day you will be king,
           but warlord, never.
                         
                          FARIQ
           I can. Let me prove it to you!
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You will not risk your life again.
           You are my line, my successor. You
           will not throw away all that I have
           worked for.
                         
          A smile creeps up on Ukafa's face, watching Fariq's
          embarrassment. He withdraws hastily, all eyes on him.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           (without looking at Ukafa)
           If I find you smiling before you
           bring me the girl, I will take
           every tooth I see.
                         
          Ukafa buries the smile as Khalar turns to the wall of flames
          left in Conan's wake.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. CORIN'S FORGE - NIGHT
                         
          The flames become the blaze of the forge.
                         
           CORIN (O.S.)
           More wood boy! We must test the
           steel with our fire.
                         
          Conan, a young boy again, kneels beside the woodpile, pulling
                         OUT LOGS--
           56.
                         
                         
          But when he hands them to his father, he notices his father
          is covered with sword wounds, cut and bleeding.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           What are you waiting for? The fire
           is dying.
                         
          Conan turns back to the wood pile. Instead of wood, the pile
          is full of the bodies of those he recently killed: Lucius,
          Remo, etc.
                         
          The young Conan struggles to push the first body onto the
          forge. Still the fire diminishes.
                         
          Conan turns and there is no more wood. And no more bodies.
                         
                          CONAN
           It's not enough. I've failed you
           father.
                         
                          CORIN
           It will never be enough, Conan.
                         
                          CONAN
           I don't understand --
                         
          He spins. Behind him TAMARA stands, a look of sadness on her
          face.
                         
                          CORIN
           Through suffering, you will learn
           your purpose, boy. And you have not
           begun to suffer yet.
                         
                         
          INT. ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Conan's eyes pop open. He inhales sharply, gripped by the
          dream.
                         
          The room is dark, surrounded by thick draperies. Conan lies
          on a straw bed with white sheets, soaked through with his
          sweat. He looks to his wounds, all bandaged.
                         
          He rises--a bit too fast because he falls back to his bed.
                         
                          TAMARA
           I wouldn't move so fast. I bound
           your wounds as best I could, but
           I'm no healer.
                         
          Conan looks over to discover Tamara sitting nearby.
           57.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           Where am I?
                         
                          TAMARA
           On the Wasp. You told me where it
           laid, just before you passed out.
           Though I can't say as I feel much
           safer here.
                         
          Conan's response is to rise again, his face contorting in
          pain.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Don't embarrass me with thanks, I
           only saved your life.
                         
                          CONAN
           You were -- adequate.
                         
          Conan pulls aside one of the thick draperies that surround
          his bed. Behind it lies a staircase, which he ascends.
                         
                         
          EXT. ZINGARAN GALLEY - NIGHT
                         
          Conan steps out onto the deck of a sixty-foot djunk,
          traveling quickly down a wide and powerful river.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Look what we have here. A hill ape
           in over his head.
                         
          Conan spins to see the rough, brightly dressed Zamoran pirate
          ARTUS leaping down from the quarterdeck, his sword out.
                         
          The other ZAMORAN PIRATES draw near as well. Tamara sees the
          scene, suddenly uncomfortable.
                         
                          CONAN
           I was just wondering what that
           smell was.
           (sniffs near Artus)
           Now I know.
                         
                          ARTUS
           We take no stowaways. Only paying
           passengers. You've best be laden
           with gold.
                         
                          CONAN
           If it's metal you seek, perhaps
           you'd settle for steel.
           58.
                         
                         
          In a flash Conan's sword lunges forward. CLANG. It meets
          Artus's, sparking as they collide. Artus LAUGHS.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Still fast Artus.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Fast, deadly, charming, rakishly
           handsome.
           (to the pirates)
           All hail Conan!
                         
                          PIRATES
           All hail Conan!
                         
          Artus slaps his hand on Conan's back and Conan winces in
          pain.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Sorry, friend. Looks like you've
           had a rough road.
                         
                          CONAN
           It won't get easier. Khalar Singh
           lives. He'll be coming for me and
           the girl.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Good. We're scrapping for a fight
           these days.
                         
                          CONAN
           This one may be more than you wish.
           I need you to get me close to Khor
           Kalba.
                         
          Artus rubs his beard.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Rest up. We'll get you there.
                         
          Conan withdraws to his room.
                         
                         
          INT. ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Conan collapses on the bed as Tamara follows him inside.
                         
                          TAMARA
           We go to Khor Kalba?
                         
                          CONAN
           I do.
           59.
                         
                         
          Conan puts a brawny arm over his tired eyes.
                         
                          TAMARA
           No. We do.
                         
                          CONAN
           Just leave me to sleep.
                         
          But Tamara doesn't leave, forcing Conan to respond.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           You would risk your life for
           royalty? Why?
                         
          Tamara pauses, realizing she must trust Conan to gain his
          help.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Because she represent freedom, not
           just ours but all Hyboria's. What
           do you know of Acheron?
                         
                          CONAN
           A tall tale. Meant to scare
           children.
                         
                          TAMARA
           It is no fable. It's my people's
           history. Acheron was an empire that
           swallowed all of Hyboria, led by
           the King and his legion of demon
           warriors. Unstoppable. Insatiable.
           Immortal. But still it had one
           weakness. For the true power of
           Acheron laid not with its King, but
           the Queen. Every twenty years, a
           new queen from the royal line would
           be coronated with a crown of iron.
           Spikes would pierce her, slowly
           drain her precious blood, and
           through her suffering Acheron would
           remain invincible. Until one of my
           ancestors, an Acheronian himself,
           put a stop to this tyranny. He and
           others spirited the new Queen away,
           hiding her from the empire and all
           those who would raise it again.
                         
                          CONAN
           What care I for queens and empires?
                         
          Conan turns to head back to his bed. Tamara grabs him,
          incensed.
           60.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           Didn't you hear me? This evil faces
           us all. All of civilization will
           fall if the army of Acheron is
           raised again.
                         
                          CONAN
           I heard. Only I would happily put
           all of your "civilization" to the
           torch myself.
                         
                          TAMARA
           But -- you owe me a debt, you
           thankless oaf!
                         
                          CONAN
           My only debt is to my people. And
           it still lies unpaid.
                         
                         
          EXT. MAN OF WAR - NIGHT
                         
          The enormous siege vessel lies before a burning PORT CITY.
                         
          A SAILOR, crying, grovels on his knees before Khalar and his
          men.
                         
                          SAILOR
           It was a pirate ship. They left as
           soon as the girl and the large one
           boarded.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH

          Khalar is surprised.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Are you certain?
                         
                          SAILOR
           Yes, please, I'm telling you the
           truth!
                         
          Khalar nods to one of his men, who slits the Sailor's throat.
                         
          Khalar turns to his FALCONER, with the huge bird of prey on
          his arm.

           him by sea.
                         
          The Falconer nods and heads off. Khalar looks to his
          soldiers.

          The ship sails like a ghost over black water, the stars lit
          up impossibly bright. Artus finds Tamara sitting near the
          bow. He hands her a steaming bowl of food.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Try not to taste it going down
           would be my advice.
                         
                          TAMARA
           You've known Conan long?
                         
                          ARTUS
           We sailed with him for a while. I
           would like to say I know the man.
                         
                          TAMARA
           He is a riddle to me.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Aye, he's that too.
                         
                          TAMARA
           We have the same goal. Why will he
           not trust me?
                         
                          ARTUS
           Why would he? He's a stranger in
           every land he trods. A man with no
           home, no people, none but the
           company of ghosts. And he bears the
           weight of their deaths every moment
           of every day.
                         
                          TAMARA
           That is no way to live.
           62.
                         
                         
                          ARTUS
           He doesn't live. I've seen in him
           great mirth, only to watch it
           smothered by greater melancholy. He
           owes a blood debt, and he can
           entertain no other joy, no other
           cause, until it is fulfilled.
                         
                          TAMARA
           And yet you call him friend, and
           risk death to help him.
                         
                         
                          ARTUS
           Let me tell you something of Conan.
           He will never lie. He will never
           break a trust, once given. And he
           will never, ever give up.
                         
                          TAMARA
           He's a stubborn ass.
                         
          Artus LAUGHS.
                         
                          ARTUS
           He is that, lass. He is that.

          INT. DUNGEON - THE PIT - NIGHT
                         
          AKHUN and his Turanian slavers lead the female monks into a
          large circular chamber, lit by many torches. Before them lies
          a PIT, dark and foreboding, with a bamboo grid placed atop
          it.
                         
          Fariq enters, an AIDE holding the iron box he used earlier.
          Fariq has a bandage on his face where Conan struck him, and
          he looks even more angry and malevolent than before.
                         
                          FARIQ
           Here we stand again. Will the queen
           reveal herself, or must another
           innocent suffer?
                         
          Fariq walks past the row of women, each recoiling. He slaps
          one. Then another, his rage only building.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           My father, he tires of your
           charade. He grows impatient. But I
           have no such haste. I enjoy
           watching you squirm.
           63.
                         
                         
          Fariq passes Ilira, slowing his pace. He closes in on the
          YOUNGEST FEMALE MONK, a true innocent with terrified eyes.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           Perhaps you'd like to see the end
           your sisters faced back at the
           monastery?
                         
          Fariq slowly opens the box before her.
                         
                         ACHERONIAN BOX
                         
          In the darkness of the box slithers a grotesque TENTACLE. The
          tentacle is severed, but still alive, thirsting for blood.
                         
          Terrified as she is, the young monk says nothing. Fariq
          closes the box.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           No? Your fear is not enough yet?
           Let's try harder.
                         
          Fariq nods to the slavers, who unchain her from the rest.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           I've read all there is to know of
           mighty Acheron. Why would true
           Acheronians protect a traitor to
           their own? You once held the entire
           world in your grasp, now you hide
           and cower like pitiful mice.
                         
          He pushes the girl. She falls to the grid, the sound echoing
          down into the pit.
                         
          AN INHUMAN GROWL emits from the darkness. Something comes.
          The girl looks below.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           And mice are meant to be swallowed
           whole.
                         
          Suddenly, a MASSIVE TENTACLE, ten times the size of the one
          in the box, comes hurtling up through the grid. It grabs the
          young monk, its barbs ripping into her, dragging her into the
          darkness below.
                         
          Her SCREAMS echo.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           What was in the box could only
           drink from you one at a time. But
           the beast of Acheron, it will claim
           four of you this night.

           Who will spare the rest and tell me
           which of you is the queen?
                         
          Not a single woman moves, resolved. Ilira catches herself,
          but also stays silent. She looks up to see Fariq staring at
          her.
                         
          CU - ILIRA'S EYES
                         
          Her pupils widen in fear as Fariq's cold stare bores into
          her.
                         
           FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
           I am here, swine.
                         
          Fariq turns -- only it is another FEMALE MONK that glares at
          him.
                         
                          FEMALE MONK
           I am the one you seek.
                         
          Fariq smiles.
                         
                          FARIQ
           At last. Some bravery. But of
           course, you wouldn't expect me to
           take your word, would you?
                         
          As the Fariq reaches for her--

          Tamara awakens with a SCREAM, her body resting against the
          curved hull of the ship.

           No!!!
                         
          Tamara looks around with a panicked look, until she realizes
          where she is.
                         
           CONAN (O.S.)
           I hope I awoke with less clamor.
                         
          Their roles reversed, now it is Tamara's turn to see Conan
          sitting nearby, drinking from a flask of mead.
                         
                          TAMARA
           You're drinking? You were near
           death this time yesterday.
           65.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           Is there a better reason to drink?
                         
          Tamara actually manages to LAUGH.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Do you think--I could try some of
           that? I'm curious of its taste.
                         
                          CONAN
           You've never tasted mead?
                         
          Tamara shrugs, embarrassed. Conan hands her flask. She takes
          a deep swallow, some spilling out over her cheeks. But she
          doesn't cough, and smiles brightly afterwards.
                         
                          TAMARA
           It's good.
                         
          Conan reaches for the flask, but Tamara ignores him, taking
          another swig. It quickly loosens her tongue.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Let me ask you something. Once
           you've killed Khalar and claimed
           your vengeance, then what? You will
           be free from your ghosts. What of
           your future, Conan?
                         
                          CONAN
           I have no future. It died with my
           people, as I should have.
                         
                          TAMARA
           So your life is penance? For what,
           for living? And when you too die,
           what do you believe happens then?
                         
          Conan just shrugs, taking back the mead.
                         
                          CONAN
           Nothing.
                         
          Tamara, her tongue loosened by drink, laughs.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Nothing? I couldn't live without
           some kind of belief in the world
           after this.
                         
                          CONAN
           I believe in the cold of steel, the
           warmth of flesh. All else is fairy
           tales.

           Perhaps. But I still die with faith
           in my heart, belief in something
           greater than one's self. What will
           you die with?

          Tamara steps out onto the deck, grabbing her pounding head.
          Her first hangover. She hears a THUMPING sound, followed by
          ANOTHER, and walks towards the side of the deck.
                         
          Tamara looks overboard, to the water below.
                         
                         TAMARA'S POV
                         
          THE RIVER IS FILLED WITH BODIES! Bloated, they float in blood
          red water as flies buzz around them. One of them hits the
          hull of the boat. THUMP.
                         
          Tamara blinks, unsure if the vision is real -- but then she's
          joined by other PIRATES who gape at the bodies below.
                         
                          PIRATE 1
           To stations! To stations!
                         
          Tamara turns and up ahead spies --
                         
                         BLACK WARSHIP
                         
          The larger warship cuts through the water, manned by a legion
          of rowers. On the deck of the warship, UKAFA and his SPEARMEN
          stand. The SAILORS get the most out of the billowing black
          sails. The ship gains fast.
                         
                         THE GALLEY
                         
          Conan exits his room, sees the danger. Artus appears at his
          side.
                         
                          ARTUS
           What do you think? They have us
           outnumbered, but we might beat
           their speed.
           67.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           That is what they wish. They drive
           us to another force, approaching
           from the south.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Then we fight?
                         
                          CONAN
           No. We give them what they think
           they want.
           (to the Pirates)
           About ship! Now!
                         
          The pirates leap into action, tacking and turning the galley
          with great speed and efficiency.
                         
                         THE WARSHIP
                         
          Ukafa smiles, his gold teeth shining. The ship's CAPTAIN
          stands beside him.
                         
                          CAPTAIN
           They're turning to run.
                         
                          UKAFA
           Good. We only need stay close.
                         
                         THE GALLEY
                         
          Is turned around now, fleeing. ARCHERS from the Warship fire
          arrows that barely reach the Galley. The Pirates dodge the
          few that land on deck.
                         
          Tamara reaches Conan and Artus. She's worried to say the
          least.
                         
                          ARTUS
           And now?
                         
                          CONAN
           Let us show them why she is called
           the Wasp.
                         
          Artus smiles. He was hoping Conan would say that.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Why is she called the Wasp?
                         
                          ARTUS
           Open astern! Load the stinger!
                         
          The Pirates rush to the back of the ship.
           68.
                         
                         
          THE BLACK WARSHIP
                         
          The Captain stares ahead, confused.
                         
                          CAPTAIN
           They are doing -- something.
                         
          Sure enough, the stern of the ship begins to part, revealing -
                         
          A MASSIVE CROSSBOW
                         
          Mounted with a barbed harpoon, fifteen feet long.
                         
                          CONAN
           Fire!
                         
          They fire the weapon. The harpoon races for the bow of the
          Warship, a thick rope trailing it. It smashes into the wood,
          ripping through it like it was paper.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Rip her apart!
                         
          The Pirates grab the heavy rope and run, pulling the rope,
          and the harpoon back towards the Wasp.
                         
          As it's pulled out, the barbs of the harpoon rip a wider hole
          in the warship.
                         
                         WARSHIP
                         
          The Captain and crew are in a panic. Men rush to patch the
          gaping hole in the hull.
                         
                          SAILOR
           We're taking on water!
                         
                          CAPTAIN
           Hard to port!
                         
                          UKAFA
           No. Let them fire again!
                         
                          CAPTAIN
           We will sink.
                         
          Ukafa guts the captain with his spear.
                         
                          UKAFA
           So be it.
           (to his spearmen)
           Get below. Be ready.
                         
                         GALLEY
           69.
                         
                         
          The pirates load the harpoon in the crossbow device a second
          time.
                         
                          CONAN
           Fire!
                         
          It fires, smashing again into the wooden hull of the Warship.
                         
          WARSHIP - INSIDE
                         
          The harpoon lodges deep inside the hull -- where Ukafa and
          his spearmen wait.
                         
                          UKAFA
           Now!
                         
          They rush forward and grab onto the harpoon.
                         
                         GALLEY
                         
                          ARTUS
           Bring her back!
                         
          Again, the pirates pull the harpoon back out. It falls into
          the water as they pull on the rope tied to it.
                         
          They do not notice Ukafa and his dozen spearmen clasping the
          very same rope as its pulled toward the Galley.
                         
          Artus looks at the Warship. It's foundering and sinking
          quickly.
                         
                          ARTUS (CONT'D)
           She's dead in the water!
                         
          A CHEER goes up among the pirates --
                         
          And then one PIRATE takes a spear through the chest. All eyes
          turn to the side of the Wasp, where Ukafa and his men climb
          aboard.
                         
          Conan's eyes alight with fury.
                         
                          CONAN
           Good. I was growing weary with
           boredom.
                         
          Conan motions to a pair of pirates.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Hide her below.
                         
                         BATTLE
           70.
                         
                         
          The Spearmen rush to the attack. The pirates spring to the
          defense of the ship, countering the Spearmen with cutlass and
          dagger. Ukafa marshals his men as a fierce battle rages.
                         
                          UKAFA
           Find the girl!
                         
          The Spearmen quickly make their way to the interior of the
          galley, throwing the dead bodies of the pirates overboard.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Conan grabs the nearby jib, swings over, and plants both feet
          in the face of one of the spearmen, knocking him over the
          side.
                         
                         ARTUS
                         
          The sea captain proves dangerous in his own right, grabbing
          the head of one of the Spearmen and violently pulling it down
          to the gunwale of the ship, impaling the Spearman's eye on a
          handspike.
                         
                         UKAFA
                         
          The massive warrior shows incredible speed as well, dodging
          one cutlass attack only to turn the weapon upon another
          pirate.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          The Cimmerian cuts through a Spearman, his gaze focused on
          Ukafa. Ukafa stares right back as he runs through a pair of
          pirates. Finally, the two warriors stand only feet apart.
                         
          The two warriors eye each other with satisfaction. Ukafa's
          frightening, sharpened gold teeth shine as he smiles.
                         
                          UKAFA (CONT'D)
           We are each the last of our tribe,
           Cimmerian. Yours dies this day.
                         
          Conan responds by lunging forward, swinging his sword in a
          broad arc. Ukafa is just as quick, stepping back and allowing
          his spear to block the swing.
                         
          Ukafa whirls the war spear in great circles, forcing Conan to
          parry, stepping back beyond the spear's reach.
                         
          The two powerful warriors trade blows back and forth, neither
          able to gain the advantage.
           71.
                         
                         
                          UKAFA (CONT'D)
           Your head will top my spear today,
           but know Khalar's pig son will soon
           share your fate.
                         
          Ukafa tries to spear Conan through the chest, and Conan
          decides to drop his sword, grabbing the spear as it passes by
          him.
                         
          Conan then pulls on the spear, throwing Ukafa off his
          balance, towards Conan. Conan then kicks the warrior in the
          chest, hurtling Ukafa backwards.
                         
          Now Conan turns the spear on its master. Ukafa, unarmed, is
          forced to backpedal as Conan thrusts the spear at him. A pair
          of close misses leaves Ukafa with gashes on his chest and
          arm, but he manages to knock the spear from Conan's hands.
                         
          The battle goes to hand-to-hand. It's primal, each of them
          covered in blood. Ukafa bear hugs Conan, then resorts to
          using his teeth to bite into Conan's shoulder.
                         
          Conan YELLS IN PAIN, butting Ukafa's head and knocking him
          back. Conan falls to the stern of the ship, his back against
          the harpoon crossbow.
                         
          Ukafa shakes off the head butt, and sees his spear nearby. He
          picks it up.
                         
                          UKAFA (CONT'D)
           Now finally, you die.
                         
          He raises up to hurl the spear through Conan, only to see
          Conan manning the harpoon, NOW TURNED TO FACE UKAFA.
                         
          The crossbow fires and the harpoon punches a massive hole
          through Ukafa, its momentum throwing him off the galley, into
          the sea beyond.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          She hides inside a small compartment of the ship. She hears
          FOOTSTEPS walking past, then returning. An ARM suddenly
          reaches in and grabs her.
                         
          As she's pulled out, Tamara SCREAMS right in Conan's face. He
          doesn't even flinch.
                         
                          CONAN
           Time to go.
           72.
                         
                         
          EXT. GALLEY - NIGHT
                         
          The battle ended, the pirates toss the dead Spearmen into the
          sea and prepare to make sail again.
                         
          Meanwhile, Conan lashes his sword to his back, standing by
          the gunwales with Tamara and Artus, a SMALL DINGHY waiting
          below.
                         
                          ARTUS
           I could get you closer. Another
           half day along the coast --
                         
                          CONAN
           I need you head west, to draw off
           our pursuers. I'll find another
           path to Khor Kalba.
                         
                          ARTUS
           So be it. Swift wind at your backs.
                         
                         
          EXT. DINGHY - DAY
                         
          Conan rows away from the galley with powerful strokes.
                         
                          TAMARA
           So you are taking me with you to
           Khor Kalba.
                         
                          CONAN
           I never said that. But I won't
           leave a virgin onboard a pirate
           ship, alone.
                         
                          TAMARA
           I -- but -- who said I was a
           virgin?
                         
          Conan just shakes his head as a parting fog reveals a large
          Colossus head, the fallen remains of an enormous statue,
          lying agape on the shoreline.
                         
                         
          INT. COLOSSUS HEAD - DUSK
                         
          Conan pulls off his jerkin, revealing a torso rippling with
          muscles.
                         
                          CONAN
           We'll rest here until morning.
           73.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           Will I awake alone? Do you intend
           to leave me?
                         
                          CONAN
           I would do you a kindness. Khor
           Kalba will bring only death.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Please, Conan. Artus told me of how
           you lost your tribe. I too had to
           watch as my people were taken from
           me.
                         
          Conan ignores her, gathering wood for a fire.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           All I ask is that you let me travel
           with you. I too have a purpose. I
           must get to the queen. I would
           rather you kill me here, than fail
           her again.
                         
          Conan continues collecting, infuriating Tamara.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           I was wrong about you. You are no
           fearless warrior. Your heart is
           closed to all but fear -- and hate.
                         
          Conan draws flint, starting the fire. Only once his task is
          complete does he answer Tamara.
                         
                          CONAN
           We leave at dawn. I will not break
           stride for you. Not once. I will
           get you into Khor Kalba. Beyond
           that I have my purpose, and you
           yours.
                         
          Tamara offers a thankful nod, her anger subsiding.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Nice fire. Does it mean you'll
           actually cook the meat this time?
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. KHALAR SINGH'S WARSHIP - DUSK
                         
          Khalar looks at the destruction of Ukafa's warship, the
          bodies filling the water. Khalar spots Ukafa's dead body
          floating there, harpoon still lodged in his chest.
           74.
                         
                         
          The ship's CAPTAIN approaches.
                         
                          CAPTAIN
           The pirate ship sailed to the west.
           Even under full sail it'll be no
           easy task to overtake her.
                         
          Just then, a FALCON approaches. The Falconer retrieves it, a
          parchment tied to its talon. He passes it on to Khalar Singh.
                         
          Khalar Singh reads it, a smile creeping upon his face.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Fariq has done well.
           (to the Captain)
           Head east, back to Khor Kalba.
                         
                          CAPTAIN
           But our chase points the other way.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           The chase is over. They come to me
           now.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - LATE DAY
                         
          Tamara watches Conan from a distance. He silently stalks prey
          with nothing more than a knife.
                         
                         A BOAR
                         
          Its ears listen intently, aware. Suddenly, it bolts.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Is just as quick, racing through the forest on a intercepting
          course with the great beast. He leaps over a fallen log,
          throwing his dagger with a sweep of his arm.
                         
          The boar goes down, the blade through its jugular. Conan
          walks up to the struggling beast, showing no satisfaction as
          he mercifully SNAPS its neck.
                         
                         
          INT. COLOSSUS HEAD - NIGHT
                         
          The great haunches of the beast roast over the fire. Conan
          turns the meat.
                         
          Behind him, Tamara approaches. She has cleaned herself up,
          her white robe translucent in light of the fire, her wet hair
          glistening.
           75.
                         
                         
          Conan can't help but notice her supple skin, her curves. He
          stops chewing.
                         
          Tamara notices. Embarrassed, she turns so that he can only
          see her side. Conan returns to his food.
                         
                          TAMARA
           What were the women of your tribe
           like, Conan?
                         
                          CONAN
           They fought beside the men.
                         
                          TAMARA
           So they were equals. And your
           mother?
                         
                          CONAN
           She died in battle, even as I was
           born.
                         
                          TAMARA
           So you never knew her. It was the
           same with me. I've always known
           being a mother was somehow not my
           fate. But--
                         
          Tamara falters, unsure. But Conan's quiet eases her.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           You said earlier Khor Kalba will
           bring only death. Were you trying
           to scare me, or do you really
           believe our end lies there?
                         
                          CONAN
           I don't lie.
                         
          Tamara nods, having heard as much about Conan. She turns back
          to face him, no longer hiding her body.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Then we don't have much time. Your
           mother perished too young, but at
           least she died having known the
           touch of one who cared.
                         
          Tamara steps closer to Conan.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           So -- do you care, Conan?
                         
          Conan rises to her, his broad form looming over her slight
          build.
           76.
                         
                         
          But Conan shows surprising gentleness as he removes her robe
          and pulls her naked body into his, their mouths meeting in a
          desperate kiss.
                         
                         LOVE SCENE
                         
          Conan lies atop Tamara by the fire, their sinewy limbs
          intertwined, fingers locked together. He thrusts into her,
          causing her face to contort in pleasure and pain.
                         
          The fire grows brighter as Tamara rolls on top, undulating as
          their pace quickens. Tamara CRIES OUT in ecstasy.
                         
                         AFTERMATH
                         
          Tamara stares into the fire, her body wrapped around Conan's.
          She gently caresses the notched scars cut into his arm.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           I've only ever heard you speak of
           what you'd die for, Conan. What
           would you live for?
                         
          Conan, his eyes closed, keeps them shut.
                         
                          CONAN
           Do you ever tire of talking? Let me
           rest, woman.
                         
          Tamara reaches down between Conan's legs. His eyes open.
                         
                          TAMARA
           I thought that may work.
                         
          Conan growls and pulls himself atop Tamara. Looking down at
          her face, her hair loose and wild, she's beautiful in the
          soft glow of the firelight.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           I see you clearly now, finally,
           after all this time.
           (she kisses him deeply)
           I would be that which you live for,
           Conan, if you would have me. You
           may have faith in nothing, Conan --
           but I have faith in you.
                         
          Conan lowers himself back down upon her.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
           77.
                         
                         
          EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE - DAY
                         
          Conan powers his way to the top of a high ridge, spotting
          down in the vista below:
                         
                         KHOR KALBA
                         
          Surrounded on three sides by the coastline, the stone
          fortress of Khalar Singh rests on a plateau, overlooking a
          bustling, tented city below.
                         
          Conan spots a long CARAVAN of packed camels working their way
          towards town, driven by DESERT TRADERS from Shem.
                         
                          CONAN
           We'll slip in, along with those
           traders. But you'll need a change
           of clothes, those monks' robes will
           draw attention.
                         
          Tamara looks down at her loose-fitting robes.
                         
                          TAMARA
           What will I wear?
                         
                         
          EXT. KHOR KHALBA - ENTRANCE - DAY
                         
          The caravan rides up to the walled entrance to the city,
          guarded by Khalar's troops. Blended in amongst the others,
          Conan now wears the elaborate head scarf and clothes of
          Shemish traders, obscuring all but his eyes.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          Tamara is dressed like a Shemish serving girl, her taut body
          barely covered by silken drapings. She glares at Conan,
          miserable.
                         
                          TAMARA
           I don't understand why I couldn't
           be dressed as you are. I look like
           a whore.
                         
                          CONAN
           And what better disguise for a
           monk?
                         
          Conan tugs on the rope for the camel to move faster. The
          Camel BRAYS and rears. Conan yanks harder and the camel flies
          forward, its eyes wide.
                         
          Conan meets its eye.
           78.
                         
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Do not test me, beast.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Is there not a living thing you can
           be at peace with?
                         
          They ride into the city, past the troops.
                         
                         
          EXT. KHOR KHALBA CITY - ENTRANCE - DAY
                         
          Conan and Tamara walk through the town's teeming market, a
          otherworldly bazaar replete with animal sacrifices, veiled
          faces and not a hint of morality.
                         
                         STRANGER
                         
          A FIGURE, his form hidden beneath a cloak, spots Conan and
          Tamara as they enter, and begins to follow them.
                         
                         WOODEN PLATFORM
                         
          The city ends at the sheer cliff wall at the bottom of the
          plateau. There stands a WOODEN PLATFORM that is lowered by a
          massive winch, unloading a cavalry regiment and then raising
          back up to the fortress above.
                         
                          CONAN
           It's probably only way into
           Khalar's fortress. I'm sure it is
           heavily guarded at all times, day
           and night.
                         
                          TAMARA
           So we must try to scale the cliff.
                         
                          CONAN
           And dodge arrows as we do so?
                         
          Conan motions up to the winch. Standing beside it are a half
          dozen of the four-armed ARCHERS.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           During the day, we'd easily be
           spotted on the climb. And it would
           be useless to even attempt at
           night. No, we must find another
           way.
                         
                         STRANGER'S POV
                         
          As Conan continues around the base of the mesa, the Figure
          following Conan is joined by TWO OTHERS.
           79.
                         
                         
                         ALLEYWAY
                         
          Conan and Tamara reach a less crowded area of the village
          when a VOICE rings out behind them.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           Halt.
                         
          Conan spins, sword at the ready. From out of the shadows
          comes a pair of MEN, their beady eyes fixed on Tamara.
                         
                          CONAN
           Thieves. You'll regret finding me.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           I think not.
                         
          From out of the shadows steps the ONE-EYED THIEF, the same
          one who Conan saved from Lucius' beatings. He smiles at
          Conan, lifting a KEY from a rope around his neck
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF
           It took longer than you think to
           cut this out of Lucius' stomach.
           After all that work, I figured I'd
           keep it -- for old times' sake.
                         
                         
          INT. THIEVES' TAVERN - AFTERNOON
                         
          A rundown hall, built beneath the city. Wooden supports hold
          up the buildings of the entire city block overhead.
                         
          And within the hall, a gathering of THIEVES and ROGUES.
          They're a flinty collection, many of them missing fingers or
          even hands, evidence of Khalar's cruel justice.
                         
          They eat and drink, sharing tales and tips, WENCHES and
          SERVING WOMEN their cautious eyes following the Cimmerian
          outsider.
                         
          The One Eyed Thief takes them to an open table, and
          immediately three of the serving women descend upon Conan,
          caressing him.
                         
          Tamara watches this, jaw dropped, and manages a COUGH, even
          as a SERVING GIRL delivers mead to the table.
                         
          Conan just smiles as he enjoys the silky bodies of the nubile
          women, their breasts practically framing his face.
           80.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           What? Do you wish to join in?
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Conan cleans mead from his face, scowling at Tamara, as the
          One-Eyed Thief uses the tabletop to explain the fortress.
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF
           --so you were right about the
           platform. You'll be long dead
           before you make it top. Same with
           scaling the cliff. There's no known
           way to break into the fortress.
                         
                          CONAN
           So that's it?
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF
           I didn't say that. I just said
           there's no known way in -- because
           no one has ever tried to. But
           breaking out -- that's another
           story. It's not much easier, but
           it's possible.
                         
          The One Eyed Thief offers the same gap-toothed grin.
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF (CONT'D)
           You just need to find someone crazy
           enough to show you the way.
                         
                         
          INT. SEWERS - NIGHT
                         
          Tamara is the last to follow Conan, the One Eyed Thief and
          the three THIEVES from before down a short ladder. Below lies
          a darkened catacomb, lit only by their torches.
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF
           These catacombs run underneath the
           entire city, even to the cistern
           that drains out from the fortress
           dungeon.
                         
          Tamara's foot drops into knee high water. She immediately
          grabs her nose.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Catacombs? You mean sewers.
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF
           Piss and shit are the last things
           you need to worry about down here.
           81.
                         
                         
          Tamara eyes the muddy water, nothing visible beneath its
          murky surface.
                         
                         
          INT. OTHER SEWERS - NIGHT
                         
          The group wades through the water, single file. Conan notices
          HIEROGLYPHICS and carvings on the wall of the catacomb.
          Massive creatures of the sea, dark sorcery, ritual sacrifice.
                         
                          CONAN
           What is it?
                         
                          TAMARA
           A warning. These catacombs are
           connected to the sea. It says that
           the beasts of Acheron protect its
           secrets.
                         
                          CONAN
           Not from me.
                         
          Conan presses on, into the darkness.
                         
                         
          INT. CISTERN - NIGHT
                         
          The catacomb widens out to a giant circular cistern, its
          walls rising up high into the darkness. As the torches bring
          light to the space, we see HUNDREDS OF DEAD, ROTTING BODIES.
                         
          As Conan and Tamara walk forward, the One Eyed Thief and the
          other stop at the entrance.
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF
           Sorry, friend. We stop here. We've
           heard too much about what lies
           within to go any further.
                         
          Conan simply nods and the thieves depart. Conan raises his
          torch, illuminating the near wall.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Where now?
                         
                          CONAN
           Around. Up.
                         
          Conan heads off one direction, leaving Tamara to navigate the
          other half. Her torch illuminates the grizzly path ahead. She
          inhales deeply and takes her first step.
                         
                         CONAN
           82.
                         
                         
          Following the slick wall, he passes many DEAD BODIES, but
          only one catches his eye. He stops before it.
                         
                         DEAD WARRIOR
                         
          Nothing more than a skeleton, picked clean by the rats. But
          he still bears his leather armor, and a horned helmet that
          resembles his father's own.
                         
          Conan takes the helmet and places it on his head. It fits
          perfectly.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          Tamara is gingerly making her way through the knee high
          sewage water and the dead bodies submerged within.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Oh!!!
                         
          Tamara leaps up, swinging the torch down towards the water.
          Conan, nearby, unsheathes his sword.
                         
                          CONAN
           What?
                         
                          TAMARA
           Something touched me. Something
           slimy.
                         
          Conan walks over, the torchlight revealing something on
          Tamara's leg. It's a SLUG, which he flicks off.
                         
                          CONAN
           Crom! Stop wasting time.
                         
          But when Conan steps forward, something ROILS THE WATER right
          before him. He spots a HUGE TENTACLE just before its
          submerges back into the water.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Crom indeed.
                         
          Then Tamara SCREAMS as another tentacle rises up from the
          water, wrapping around her waist. Tamara grabs hold of the
          wall as the tentacle tries to pull her underwater.
                         
          Conan immediately SLASHES the tentacle, pulling Tamara away.
          The squirming decapitated tentacle squirts black blood
          everywhere, the knee high water seems to come alive with
          roiling intensity.
                         
          Conan spins, finding a circular stone staircase tiled into
          the far cistern wall.
           83.
                         
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Let's go.
                         
                         
          EXT. CIRCULAR STAIRWAY - CISTERN
                         
          As they work their way up the circular stairwell, towards a
          thin shaft of firelight up ahead.
                         
                         
          INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT
                         
          Carved out of solid black rock, both sides of the broad
          corridor are occasionally punctuated by thick steel doors,
          leading to prison cells.
                         
          Conan and Tamara emerge from a sewer drain, pushing their way
          to the floor of the hallway. The heavy darkness presses in on
          Conan's torch like a sentient, animate thing.
                         
          The floor of the corridor is lined with DEAD BODIES, in
          varying states of decay. There are buckets, filled with
          entrails and feces, upended. Tamara put her hand over her
          mouth.
                         
          Conan continues down the hallway. He and Tamara begin to hear
          the sound of EERIE CHANTING.
                         
                          TAMARA
           What is that?
                         
          Up ahead, the torch-lined dungeon plunges into darkness as
          the torches end. Conan holds up his own torch, struggling to
          peer into the black void.
                         
                          CONAN
           Nothing good.
                         
          Conan takes a step forward when suddenly a POWERFUL WIND
          blows out his torch. A moment later, there's the sound of A
          GATE WHISTLING DOWN AND CRASHING INTO THE GROUND.
                         
          In the darkness, comes a DEEP, EARTHY CHUCKLE.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           Welcome.
                         
          A HOST OF OIL LIGHTS SUDDENLY COME UP, revealing that the
          gate that closed behind them was actually just a door to a
          vast CAGE built around a massive PIT.
           84.
                         
                         
          INT. THE PIT - NIGHT
                         
          The same pit where Fariq sacrificed the female monk, only
          now, a half dozen COMBATANTS stand on the grid above the
          void.
                         
          Hanging high above the pit, in baskets, lie other PRISONERS,
          including Tamara's fellow female monks. Several of them YELL
          out Tamara's name as they see her.
                         
          And watching everything, from an amphitheater above the cage,
          is the massive Akhun and several of his slavers.
                         
                          AKHUN
           Which ever one of you slaves gets
           me the girl, lives.
                         
          The Combatants all close in on Conan and Tamara, each taking
          a different plank way to get to them.
                         
                          CONAN
                          (TO TAMARA)
           Stay behind me.
                         
          Tamara steps behind Conan, who blocks the others' path to
          her.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Who dies first?
                         
          The first two COMBATANTS attack as one, the first wielding a
          short sword, the other a pike. The pikeman thrusts first,
          Conan deftly stepping aside, then pulling the pike, sending
          the wielder off balance and into the abyss.
                         
          The prisoner with the short sword doesn't fare much better,
          as Conan evades his swipe and decapitates him with a single
          blow.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          Tamara sees that the prisoner baskets are suspended by the
          top half of the metallic cage. She begins scaling the cage,
          her eyes set upon the imprisoned monks.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Three more COMBATANTS step in to replace the fallen duo.
          Conan readies himself as the first one steps up, only to have
          the combatant suddenly grabbed by a ENORMOUS TENTACLE, much
          like the one Conan cut through earlier.
                         
                         TENTACLED MONSTER
           85.
                         
                         
          Up from the darkness of the pit comes a gargantuan monster; a
          gigantic octopus-like behemoth, with multiple tentacles that
          feed a pulsing black orifice lined with razor sharp teeth.
                         
          The creature reaches out and grabs another SCREAMING
          combatants, lowering him to its mouth and devouring him in
          its gnashing maw.
                         
          The creature reaches for Conan, who ducks underneath the
          tentacle, the slices it off. He immediately turns back to
          check on Tamara -- and he discovers she's not there.
                         
          He looks up to see Tamara scaling the cage, now nearly fifty
          feet directly above him.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)

                         AKHUN
                         
          The massive warrior spots Tamara getting close to the
          prisoner baskets and motions to his two Jailers.
                         
                          AKHUN
           Get her!
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          She's reached the base of the chain supporting one of the
          baskets when she spots the two Jailers closing in, climbing
          towards her from either side.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Spotting Tamara overhead, Conan tries to keep beneath her,
          evading the swarming tentacles while balancing on the rickety
          planks.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          She's scaling down the basket supporting chain when the first
          Jailer reaches out to grab her. She reacts by GASHING his
          eyes, and as he instinctively grabs them, he FALLS TOWARDS
          THE PIT.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Conan barely dives out of the way as the fallen Jailer
          SMASHES through the plank he was on, forcing Conan to jump to
          another.
                         
          Just then another COMBATANT comes swinging for the Cimmerian,
          forcing him to defend while still not balanced.
           86.
                         
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          The next Jailer grabs her, pulling her off the cage. He
          struggles to pull towards a nearby exit hatch when she BITES
          HIS EAR OFF.
                         
          The Jailer drops Tamara, who SCREAMS as she falls.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Conan spots Tamara plunging towards him. In one swift move,
          he SLASHES his opponent, ducks underneath a writhing
          tentacle, and reaches out to GRAB TAMARA BY THE ARM AS SHE
          FALLS. His shoulder nearly pops out, but he manages to hold
          onto Tamara.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          She swings above the chasm, the gnashing teeth of the monster
          below her. Only a single splintering plank holds her and
          Conan aloft.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          With a grunt, he swings Tamara and throws her to safety, at
          the edge of the pit.
                         
          But as he gets to his feet, he spots the massive Akhun
          entering the arena.
                         
                         AKHUN
                         
          The giant warrior grins as he boards the same plank as Conan.
          He thrusts his thunderous legs down, causing the plank to
          bend and warp.
                         
          Conan struggle to balance on the undulating plank, but his
          training in Cimmeria serves him well.
                         
          Akhun smiles and step closer, again thrusting down with his
          legs. Conan's balance is thrown, but there's no other plank
          close enough for him to jump to.
                         
                          AKHUN (CONT'D)
           You'll make a nice meal.
                         
          Akhun steps down on the plank one last time, but this time
          Conan uses the momentum to SPRINGBOARD UP INTO AIR.
                         
          Conan soars into the air, his cat-like reflexes keeping him
          focused as he lands right before the stunned Akhun. With one
          great slash of his blade, Conan eviscerates Akhun.
           87.
                         
                         
          Akhun's innards drop out of his belly as he falls into the
          abyss, only to be snapped up by the massive beast.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. ARENA OF THE PIT - LATER
                         
          Conan lowers down the last of the baskets. Tamara use a sword
          to smash open the lock, freeing the prisoners inside.
                         
          Tamara shares hugs of joy with the other monks of her flock.
          The women look worn, but unbroken.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Where is Ilira?
                         
                          FEMALE MONK
           She was taken away by Fariq.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Then I'm too late.
                         
          One of the stronger looking women, an ELDER MONK, steps
          forward.
                         
                          ELDER MONK
           No. She was just taken this
           morning. It's not yet midnight,
           and Khalar still must bring her to
           the cave of Acheron.
                         
          Tamara nods and the women begin to ARM THEMSELVES. Conan
          shakes his head at the rag-tag group.
                         
                          CONAN
           You're going to fight Khalar's
           troops? Just you?
                         
          The Elder Monk grabs and nearby pike and twirls it expertly
          about her body, clearly well versed in it use.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Cimmerians aren't the only women
           who know how to fight. And to kill.
                         
          Tamara looks at the other monks.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Our duty was to keep the queen
           safe. We failed. But if Khalar
           brings her to Acheron, it will rise
           again -- and all our peoples'
           sacrifice is for nothing.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           So if the queen is not free by the
           stroke of midnight -- she must be
           already dead.
                         
          The other monks nod and they start to head off. Tamara is the
          last to head off, her eyes burning into Conan's.
                         
                          CONAN
           You want my help again.
                         
                          TAMARA
           No. You kept your word, I'll keep
           mine. I pray you fulfill your debt.
                         
          Tamara kisses Conan's cheek one last time and heads off.
                         
                         
          INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
                         
          The monk travel in single file, the Elder Monk leading the
          way. Suddenly, she stops, motioning to an entranceway ahead.
                         
                          ELDER MONK
                          (WHISPERING)
           Guard.
                         
                          TAMARA
                          (WHISPERING)
           Don't kill him. We need to find out
           which way Ilira was taken.
                         
          The Elder Monk nods and slips up ahead. We hear a SMASH.
                         
                         
          INT. CATACOMB ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT
                         
          The stunned GUARD lies before the assembled monks. Tamara
          glares down at him.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Tell us where the last girl was
           taken.
                         
          The Guard just LAUGHS at them through bloody teeth.
                         
           CONAN (O.S.)
           Let me ask.
                         
          The Guard's face drops as Conan steps out from the darkness.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Your debt --

                          CONAN
           Will be where your queen is.
                         
          Tamara smiles. She knows it is a half truth.
                         
                         
          INT. FORTRESS - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          As Conan and the monks enter, the throne room is empty,
          scattered light barely illuminating the expansive chamber.
                         
          Ilira sits on the throne, crown on her slumped head. Tamara
          runs over to her.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Ilira!
                         
          She raises Ilira's head, only to discover lifeless eyes.
          Tamara cradles her best friend's face.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           She's dead. It's over.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           Not yet.
                         
          Before the monks can react, ARROWS STREAK OUT FROM THE
          DARKNESS, killing them all. Only Conan is quick enough to
          dodge his arrow by diving aside.
                         
          When he comes up, Khalar has Tamara, his sword at her neck.
          Several ARCHERS stand behind him, at the ready.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           It's only begun. Because that one
           was not the heir to Acheron.
                         
          Khalar smiles down at Tamara.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           She is.
                         
          Slowly, what he's saying dawns on her.
                         
                          TAMARA
           No. It can't be --
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Secretive, the traitors of Acheron.
           It wasn't easy, but Fariq finally
           wrung honesty from the girl. That
           poor innocent was forced to live a
           lie, even as the truth was kept
           from the queen herself.

           And you did the rest, barbarian. My

           me.

           No!
                         
          Suddenly, a trap door opens beneath Conan and drops down in
          the darkness, landing with a heavy THUD.
                         
                         
          INT. FORGE - NIGHT
                         
          Conan awakens to the familiar sound of a hot blade SIZZLING
          as it hits the cooling vat.
                         
          But this is no dream of his father's forge -- as he looks up
          to see Fariq holding a sword, its tip still red hot, the
          flames of the fortress's forge behind him.
                         
          Conan's thrusts forward, only to find his armed chained
          around a heavy mortar and stone pillar.
                         
          Fariq strokes his newly acquired scar.
                         
                          FARIQ
           At last you awaken, Cimmerian. It's
           been hours you've made me wait for
           my fun.
                         
          Conan says nothing, but his eyes scan the room, taking in
          everything.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           You made me lose face in front of
           my father. That wasn't wise. But
           what should I expect from a
           Cimmerian?
                         
                          CONAN
           A swift end!
                         
          Conan strains at the chain, ripping the skin beneath his
          shackles -- but a thin wisp of mortar comes loose from the
          pillar.
                         
                          FARIQ
           Hardly. But that is a difference
           between you and me. A swift end
           would be a mercy I do not intend to
           grant. No, you must suffer for your
           transgressions.

          He waves the glowing sword tip in front of Conan's face.
                         
                          CONAN
           You lie. I was there. My father
           never uttered a sound.
                         
          Fariq LAUGHS, amused.
                         
                          FARIQ
           You were there? What were you
           doing, warrior? Watching your
           father die, without saying a sound?
           Taking your eyes will be justice
           indeed, coward.
                         
          Fariq pushes the hot tip of the sword against Conan's skin.
          Conan's face reddens with pain, but he doesn't utter a sound.
          But as Conan pulls on his chains -- more mortar falls. As
          Fariq turns back to place the sword in the forge, Conan
          notices one of the bricks the chains are fastened to is
          LOOSE.
                         
                          CONAN
           I saw my father die. Slain by one
           who can only kill men already on
           their knees.
                         
          Fariq turns, his eyes blazing. He glances over at the two
          GUARDS by the door, who try not to listen.
                         
                          FARIQ
           I've killed many in battle, cur.
                         
                          CONAN
           Really? Then why did your father
           not let you face me before, when I
           had sword in hand. He thought you
           unequal to the task.
                         
          Fariq responds by pushing the red hot blade against Conan's
          chest. Conan just YELLS back at him.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Coward! Prove your strength!
                         
          Again, Fariq pushes the hot blade against Conan's skin.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Take my eyes, coward -- if you can.
           92.
                         
                         
          Fariq yells and thrust the tip of the sword at Conan's head.
          Conan lifts his manacles, forcing the blade up into the brick
          holding his chain.
                         
          Then Conan pulls on the chains with all his might, loosening
          the heavy brick, which falls to the ground.
                         
          In one powerful movement, Conan begins SWINGING the chain
          with the mortar block on the end, a homemade ball and chain.
                         
          The two Guards come forward, sword drawn, only to meet with a
          CRUNCHING blow by Conan's weapon. Both their heads get caved
          in.
                         
          Fariq rushes Conan, getting in too close for Conan's wide
          swings. Conan simply meets Fariq's sword with the heavy
          chains, then encircles Fariq's neck with the steel bonds.
                         
          Fariq CHOKES, falling to the ground, gasping for air. But
          Conan doesn't kill him -- yet.
                         
                         THE FORGE
                         
          A vat of molten steel bubbles in a cauldron within the forge.
          Conan uses tongs to lift the cauldron out.
                         
                         FARIQ
                         
          Conan kicks him onto his back. Fariq's last vision is that of
          Conan, tipping the cauldron, the hot iron descending toward
          his eyes. Fariq SCREAMS.
                         
          Conan reaches down and picks up Fariq's sword. THE SWORD
          CONAN'S FATHER MADE FOR HIM.
                         
                         
          EXT. SEA PENINSULA - NIGHT
                         
          By torchlight, Khalar Singh leads his black-armored PERSONAL
          GUARD, two dozen men strong, across a rocky peninsula,
          jutting out into the sea. On the back of Khalar's horse,
          bound, rides the helpless Tamara.
                         
          As they round a large rock spire they spy a fearsome and awe
          inspiring sight. A massive SKULL, seemingly a natural rock
          formation, rises over the peninsula.
                         
          As they ride closer, we can make out one more detail -- the
          mouth of the skull is actually a massive door, at least sixty
          feet high, and seemingly made up of jagged bone. It has the
          appearance of teeth, completing the skull illusion.
           93.
                         
                         
          INT. ACHERON CAVE - NIGHT
                         
          It takes the full complement of soldiers to open the enormous
          doors. Khalar Singh rides in. Moonlight from the huge eyes of
          the skull illuminate terrifying faces in the darkness. Faces
          of demonic warrior statues.
                         
          At their feet lie the decaying bones of human skeletons, too
          numerous to count.
                         
                          TAMARA
           This is no empire, only a
           graveyard.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You see only with your eyes.
                         
          Khalar nods to his men. Two Guardsmen take their torches and
          light other torches set in the walls. It sets off a chain
          reaction. As far as the eye can see torches ignite revealing
          the true scope of this place.
                         
          An enormous cave, the walls lined with monumental columns
          that frame countless bas relief carvings of demonic origin.
                         
          And at the far of the cave, an ALTAR sits beneath a raised
          THRONE, surrounded by a SACRIFICIAL POOL. The pool is empty.
                         
          Khalar turns to his guards.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Close the gates and stay here. Send
           my son to me when he arrives.
           (motioning to two of them)
           You two, come with me.
                         
                         
                         THE ALTAR
                         
          Khalar dismounts at the sacrificial altar, carved of out of
          purple-shaded rock. Around its edges are deep channels, for
          the blood of its victims. And on its four corners -- shackles
          of bone.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           The Acheronians had a wonderful
           sense of balance, don't you think?
           For one to ascend to royalty,
           another must fall.
                         
          With the flick of a wrist, Khalar cuts Tamara's bonds.
           94.
                         
                         
          Tamara head butts him, struggling to escape, but Khalar
          absorbs the blow effortlessly. He throws Tamara upon the
          altar, his two guards shackling her in place.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           For a hundred generations the kings
           of Acheron were crowned, and the
           queens were sacrificed.
                         
          Khalar snaps his fingers and two guardsmen bring an ornately
          carved BOX MADE OF BONE, laying it before the altar. Like a
          Chinese puzzle box, Khalar manipulates the carvings of
          skulls, sacrifices, and creatures until the box UNLATCHES.
                         
          And from the box he lifts two items. A CROWN OF GOLD and A
          CROWN OF IRON. The crown of gold is magnificent, ornately
          detailed gold that glows in the firelight.
                         
          But the crown of iron is terrifying. Huge rough spikes extend
          from it in every direction. It looks more like a weapon than
          a crown.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           What a day for you. This morning
           you were a handmaiden. Tonight, you
           are a queen giving birth to an
           empire.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
                         
          Bloodied and weary, Conan approaches the Skull Rock. He has
          nothing more than his sword, his loincloth and a small BURLAP
          SACK tied to his hip.
                         
          He stumbles, falling to his knees. His wounds have taken a
          grave toll. Still he stands and presses on.
                         
          He pushes on the doors. They do not budge in the least. He
          puts his shoulder to the doors -- his every muscle straining
          to their utmost. Again -- no movement.
                         
          Conan backs away, taking stock of the surroundings. He climbs
          up the side of the rock.
                         
                         
          INT. ACHERON CAVE - NIGHT
                         
          Khalar Singh CHANTS in Acheronian. Ancient, harsh words, as
          he lifts the two crowns overhead, offering them to the
          statues of dark gods all around.
           95.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           Stop. You don't know what you are
           about to do.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           But I do. For thirty years I have
           dreamed of this day. The day our
           people rise from the ashes.
                         
          Khalar Singh continues his chant and places the gold crown
          upon his head. As he does so, the light from the moon
          reflects off the crown, bathing the sacrificial pool in an
          unnatural glow.
                         
          THUMP-THUMP. A deep and foreboding sound echoes throughout
          the cave, shaking everything like an earthquake. It sounds
          like the heartbeat of a giant.
                         
          Khalar next places the iron crown around Tamara's head. She
          thrashes and struggles but to no avail.
                         
          Once the crown is around her head -- THUMP-THUMP! The spikes
          around the iron crown grow shorter AS THE SPIKES DRIVE
          THEMSELVES INTO HER HEAD. She SCREAMS in agony.
                         
          Blood drips from beneath the crown, flowing into channels
          around the edges of the altar.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           It begins. You give birth to an
           empire.
                         
                         
          EXT. THE SIDE OF THE SKULL - NIGHT
                         
          Conan climbs -- muscles straining -- slipping -- hanging on
          by one hand -- and climbing again.
                         
          THUMP-THUMP. The statuary shakes, indeed the whole earth
          does. Conan nearly slips, but keeps his grip.
                         
                          CONAN
           Crom.
                         
          He reaches the eye of the skull.
                         
                         REVERSE ANGLE
                         
          With the moon over his shoulder, Conan stares down at the
          unholy sight before him. We pull back revealing Tamara, her
          blood draining from her body.
           96.
                         
                         
          INT. ACHERON CAVE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Tamara, her face pale from blood loss, begins to pray in
          pained whispers.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           It's good that you pray. Gods will
           be here soon.
                         
          Tamara struggles to speak, her body wracked with pain.
                         
                          TAMARA
           He'll--be---here--sooner.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Who?
                         
           CONAN (O.S.)
           Me!
                         
          Khalar turns to see the outline of Conan, framed by the
          moonlight, looking down at Khalar from atop of one the
          warrior statues. A thick vine dangles nearby, Conan's route
          down from the cave roof above.
                         
          Conan then leaps down to the skeleton covered floor before
          the altar. It is a killing floor.
                         
          The two Guardsmen leap for him, but Conan dispatches them
          with a pair of strikes. Both fall down dead.
                         
          Conan meets Tamara's eyes, a look of determination,
          assurance. He starts toward the altar.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           I will say this for you, barbarian.
           You are hard to kill.
                         
                          CONAN
           Let her go.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You've faced me before and lost.
           What do you think has changed now?
                         
                          CONAN
           My purpose.
                         
          Conan lunges for Khalar, their swords meeting with a flash of
          sparks. They fight to a brief standstill when ---THUMP,
          THUMP.
                         
                         THE ALTAR
           97.
                         
                         
          Tamara writhes in pain as the spikes drive deeper into her
          head. More blood pours forth. The blood in the channels
          speeds up and finds the channel leading down to the
          sacrificial pool.
                         
          Conan makes another movement toward the altar, but Khalar
          nimbly blocks his path.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You are strong, Cimmerian, but we
           both know you are not my equal.
                         
          Conan takes the burlap sack wrapped at his hip pulls it off.
                         
                          CONAN
           Once you used my father to teach
           your son a lesson about strength.
           Now let me teach you.
                         
          Conan tosses out what is inside. It falls to the ground,
          rolling to Khalar Singh's feet.
                         
                         FARIQ'S HEAD
                         
          Khalar looks down at the ground -- at the head of his beloved
          son, his eyes gone, replaced by molten metal. Khalar trembles
          in shock and rage.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           No.
                         
          Khalar reaches for the severed head, giving Conan a brief
          window to rush to Tamara's side. Conan tries to lift her off
          the altar, but the bone shackles still pin her down.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Cimmerian!!!
                         
          Enraged, Khalar CHARGES Conan throwing all his skill and
          force into an all-out attack. Conan simply sidesteps it, then
          shatters the bone shackle holding one of Tamara's wrists.
          Before he can shatter the other, Khalar charges again.
                         
          Khalar swings, Conan spins, his blade catching Khalar's just
          inches from his face. Conan throws Khalar off him, knocking
          the warlord back ten feet. Khalar's attack is feral,
          uncontrolled. He's lost his balance.
                         
          Spinning and striking blindly, Conan smashes the second
          shackle on her wrist. He continues his motion, bringing his
          sword around to meet Khalar's next strike.
           98.
                         
                         
          Now Khalar looks like the enraged amateur, and Conan the more
          polished warrior. Their battle takes them away from the
          altar.
                         
          With her hands free, Tamara struggles to pull the spikes out
          and remove the crown.
                         
          THE KILLING FLOOR
                         
          Conan repels another Khalar attack, this time striking
          Khalar's chest and drawing blood. The Guardsmen arrive from
          the other side of the cave, drawing their swords.
                         
          Khalar waves them off, his fury aimed at the Cimmerian.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           The Queen. Shackle her!
                         
                         THE ALTAR
                         
          In agony, Tamara pulls one of the spikes out, then another.
          She pushes with all her might, lifting the crown of iron off
          her bloodied head --
                         
          When the Guardsmen charge her, pin her down, and force the
          crown back on.
                         
          THUMP, THUMP! The crown spikes imbed themselves even deeper
          as Tamara SCREAMS. The blood now fills the channels of the
          altar.
                         
          WE FOLLOW the trail of blood, down the side of the altar, in
          a spiral channel around the leg, and in a wide circle around
          the altar until reaching the channel's end --
                         
          THE FIRST DROP OF TAMARA'S BLOOD TOUCHES THE SACRIFICIAL
          POOL. It BOILS instantly, multiplying itself exponentially,
          bubbling forth and filling the entire pool.
                         
          AND ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. A massive earthquake jolts the
          entire cave.
                         
          THE KILLING FLOOR
                         
          As Khalar Singh and Conan battle, the ground beneath them on
          the wide cave floor CRACKS and SPLINTERS.
                         
          THUMP-THUMP! The earthquake intensifies and the entire floor
          of the cave GIVES WAY, tumbling into an incredible abyss.
          Conan and Khalar alike grab onto the only rocks they can
          reach to prevent them from falling further.
           99.
                         
                         
          Conan ends up against one of the walls on the side of the
          cave. Khalar clings to the rocks on the edge of the sacred
          pool.
                         
          Their bodies are illuminated by a fiery glow. They look
          below, searching for the source of the glow.
                         
                         ACHERON
                         
          Another two hundred feet deep lies the golden spired city of
          ancient Acheron. The cave is but a forechamber, the slightest
          taste of the true glory and horror of Acheron.
                         
          And as they stare down into the ancient city, the shadows
          there MOVE.
                         
          Is it a trick of the light? No. Whatever the dark forms are,
          they are coming this way, climbing the tallest demonic spires
          and leaping impossibly far to climb up after Conan and Khalar
          Singh.
                         
          Khalar gazes down at the city with wide eyes.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Beyond my dreams --
                         
                         THE ALTAR
                         
          Tamara, her body's blood nearly drained, is still shackled to
          the altar, which now teeters over the edge of chasm, poised
          to fall into the fiery depths.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Conan!!!
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          On the other side of the abyss, Conan spots her and scales
          the cave wall, up to a tiered plateau. He moves quickly,
          trying to get to Tamara.
                         
                         KHALAR SINGH
                         
          Khalar watches, entranced, as the first of the creatures
          rises out of the pit. They climb the walls like insects,
          clinging to the walls, their heads swiveling like a praying
          mantis.
                         
                         ACHERONIAN WARRIORS
                         
          The look like the statues above -- a hybrid -- part human,
          part demon. Their skin is a perfect black, armor carved of
          black bone, faces once human but now demonic with blood red
          eyes and gnashing teeth.
           100.
                         
                         
          They advance on Khalar Singh, who is furthest down now that
          Conan climbs upward towards Tamara.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
                          (IN ACHERONIAN)
           I am Khalar Singh, King of Acheron.
           I command you to kneel!
                         
          And this demonic horde advances right for him, their razor
          sharp teeth bared. Unsure, Khalar grips his tulwars tight.
          The demonic creatures draw close, and they -- kneel. They
          climb out of the abyss and immediately lower their heads
          before Khalar Singh.
                         
          Out of the corner of his eye, Khalar spots Conan, drawing
          near.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
                          (IN ACHERONIAN)
           Show him the might of the army of
           Acheron!
                         
          But they do not rush to follow the order. They stir. One of
          them with more ornate bone armor than the rest looks over at
          Khalar's Guardsmen.
                         
                          ACHERONIAN COMMANDER
                          (IN ACHERONIAN)
           First, we feed.
                         
          Its voice is somewhere between a whisper and a hiss.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Fine. Take your fill. I will kill
           him myself.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Conan is on an intercept course with Tamara, leaping across
          chasms from statue to statue. Just below him, the first wave
          of Acheronian Warriors reach the Khalar's remaining
          Guardsmen.
                         
                         KHALAR'S GUARDSMEN
                         
          Khalar's Guardsmen, who have been watching the events with
          mouths agape, realize the danger too late. The horde of
          Acheronian Warriors leaps on them and a massive battle ensues
          between the demonic warriors and the soldiers.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          His climbing is dizzying, reminiscent of his youth scaling
          the cliffs of Cimmeria.
           101.
                         
                         
                         KHALAR
                         
          Intercepts Conan just below the altar, his tulwars at the
          ready.
                         
                          CONAN
           Your story ends here.
                         
          The two warriors square off, fighting even as they cling to
          the statues.
                         
                         ACHERONIAN WARRIORS
                         
          The demon warriors not only slay Khalar's Guardsmen, but rip
          their still living bodies apart, dousing themselves in the
          blood of their victims. It is a violent ritual, both
          Bacchantic and gruesome.
                         
                         KHALAR
                         
          Launches himself at Conan, his tulwars sparking off the stone
          statuary. Conan leaps to another statue, parrying the blows.
          Khalar overextends himself, and Conan's sword just barely
          misses his throat.
                         
          Khalar pulls back, tries to settle himself. Conan's eyes
          narrow, he knows what Khalar is doing.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Like a woman, Fariq cried and
           begged me to spare him.
                         
          Khalar ROARS in rage, launching an all-out offensive. Conan
          backs up slowly, waiting for his moment.
                         
          And it comes quickly. Conan ducks below the tulwars and CUTS
          Khalar across the stomach. Khalar loses his balance and
          falls, one hand grabbing a protruding statue arm, dangling
          over the abyss.
                         
          Conan raises his sword to finish the job.
                         
           TAMARA (O.S.)
           Conan!!!
                         
          Conan glances down. The Acheronian Commander drank his fill,
          and now moves to the altar itself, his claw stroking Tamara's
          body. With one touch, the shackles open. He and the
          Acheronian Warriors drag her pale body toward the abyss.
                         
          Khalar grins up at him through bloody teeth.
           102.
                         
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           They take her to a place you can
           never follow. Who will you fail,
           Cimmerian? Your father or your
           woman?
                         
          Conan leaps down to the altar. The Acheronian Warriors
          attack. Standing atop the altar, Conan cuts down all comers,
          cutting his way through the enemy, working his way to Tamara.
                         
                          CONAN
           Tamara!!
                         
          They leap on Conan, impossibly fast. They stab him. They cut
          him. But he does not stop. Even wounded, he throws them into
          the abyss.
                         
          And he reaches Tamara, just before the Commander drags her
          below. He grabs her arm. The Commander grabs her other arm,
          baring his shark-like teeth.
                         
          BLAM! Conan punches him in the mouth with his free hand and
          the Commander falls into the abyss.
                         
          The bloody Conan pulls Tamara up into his arms. Only for
          Tamara to scream.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Conan!
                         
          Conan spins just in time as Khalar strikes. Khalar's tulwar
          narrowly misses, and Conan counters. His father's sword runs
          Khalar Singh through.
                         
          Khalar's body falls into the abyss.
                         
          But the Acheronian Warriors surround them. Thousands climb
          out of the abyss, teeth bared, closing in on the wounded
          Conan. Tamara, badly weakened herself, grabs Conan.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Conan, you know what you must do.
           Kill me.
                         
                          CONAN
           No.
                         
                          TAMARA
           It is the only way to end this. My
           death gives others life.
                         
                          CONAN
           I cannot.
           103.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           You must. Your parents both
           understood that purpose. Now it is
           yours. Live, Conan.
                         
          A tear falls from Tamara's face. The demonic warriors prepare
          to strike.
                         
          Conan drives his sword into Tamara's heart. The crown spikes
          retract and it falls from her head, tumbling into the abyss.
                         
          BOOM! A seismic explosion shakes everything, an unearthly
          GUST OF WIND pulling the Acheronian Warriors back down into
          the abyss.
                         
                         ACHERONIAN CAVE
                         
          The cave begins to fall, massive sections of the roof
          dropping in to decimate the pyramid and the city below.
                         
                         ALTAR
                         
          Conan pulls Tamara's body away, even as the world descends
          into dust and debris.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
                         
          Khalar's HORSE stands near the entrance. Conan puts Tamara's
          body carefully atop the horse, then mounts it himself. He
          positions her in front of him, his arms encircling her.
                         
          Conan gives her lifeless body one last kiss, her blood
          staining his lips red, as his mother's did as a child.
                         
                         
          EXT. HIGH PLATEAU - DAWN
                         
          A blazing sun threatens to explode over the nearby mountains.
          Conan holds a single torch in his hand. His look is hard.
          Grim.
                         
          We pull back to reveal a funeral pyre, Tamara's body atop it.
          Conan places the torch to the pyre. It quickly spreads.
                         
          We move in, closer and closer upon Conan's ice blue eyes, a
          blazing fire erupting in them. A fire that will never be
          extinguished.
                         
           TAMARA (O.S.)
           Live, Conan. Live.
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.

                             EARLY PRODUCTION DRAFT

                             November 14, 2002




FADE IN:





EXT. ISTANBUL - DUSK

Glimpses of an ancient city.   Almost motionless against
the tide of time.
Sea swelled along an endless wall. Billowing silk frozen
against the sky. Birds lighting on Byzantine columns.
FINAL IMAGE is of an imposing STRUCTURE beyond the trees.




INT. PRISON FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE

Corridor of ancient stone and steel extends into infinite
darkness. Stale air hangs in the dim half-light like
atomized ether.
There is WHISPERING.   And tangled VOICES.
DRIFT IN PAST prison cells the size of closets. Brief
flashes of carved faces, insanity -- COMING TO REST ON the --




FINAL CELL

A gaunt PRISONER kneels on the granite, head bowed to a
wall hung tapestry of Christ. But he's not just praying.
He's digging. With his arm under the tapestry, he
scratches at the stone with a SPOON. After only a year,
the spoon finally breaks through.




INT. NARROW CHANNEL

Prisoner claws his way between ancient walls, comes to a
dead end against a thick wooden door. He nudges a
shoulder against it, digs in and pushes. DOOR GROANS
open, sucking air into the pitch black CHAMBER.




INT. PRISONER'S CELL

The tapestry covering the HOLE is pulled against the
wall, then billows outward like a sail.




INT. CHAMBER - PRISONER

pulls himself inside, chokes in the heavy air. He scans
the musty room. Antique furniture. A few empty crates.
And the remains of several deteriorating skeletons.

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                       2.





CONTINUED:

He looks to the far wall, sees a hint of light above
through the crumbling limestone. A way out. Too high to
reach, Prisoner pulls an old CHEST out of a cobwebbed
corner and slides it under the light.
He steps up onto the chest, grabs the edges of the hole
and starts to shove off when the top of the chest gives
way and his foot crunches through.
Prisoner reaches down to free his foot when he sees
something inside -- wrapped in a red cloth. He pulls it
out and as he unwraps it, he discovers the cloth is a
Nazi flag.
At the center is a crudely-shaped IRON RELIC. Eight inches
long. Stains on the edges. Could be the petrified tooth of
some prehistoric animal. Or maybe an ancient arrowhead.
As he holds it, feverish sweat starts to form on his face.




MYSTERIOUS POV

From BEHIND. As if he's being watched by someone else.
Prisoner spins, looks back AT us. Nothing.




PRISONER

starts toward the way out.




INT. PRISONER CORRIDOR

The Guard's flashlight beam probes the cell -- one by one
-- falls on the tapestry. Christ billows out from the
wall, revealing the hole.




INT. PRISON - VARIOUS SHOTS

ALARMS SOUND.    Lights BLAST ON.   Guards with weapons rush
through.




INT. NARROW CHANNEL

Prisoner squeezes toward light, grips the relic tight.




EXT. PRISON - NIGHT

SIRENS BLARE as SPOTLIGHTS sweep across the ominous
structure. Prisoner breaks from the darkness, runs for
the trees on the other side of the wall.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                         3.





CONTINUED:


                            GUARDS

                      (in Turkish)
             Stop!   Stop!
Prisoner spins, griping the relic tight. GUNSHOTS RING
OUT. Bullets streak toward him but never hit their
target. Guards check their weapons on the run.




EXT. NEAR A ROAD - NIGHT

Prisoner breaks from the trees, runs into a road.
Headlights wash over him and TIRES SCREECH. Prisoner
spins, is right in the path of a car.
BRAKES SQUEAL -- car locks up but too late -- IMPACTS
Prisoner who is violently thrown and lands in a heap.
CAR slides to a stop. DRIVER jumps out, sees the front
end sheet metal has accordioned all the way to the tires.
He scans the area for a body, spots the Prisoner and is
stunned to see him getting to his feet. Uninjured.
Prisoner is just as amazed. He glances at the RELIC in
his hand, notes the wrist has reddened and an odd SYMBOL
has appeared as if embossed in the flesh.
Driver calls out but the Prisoner is spooked, runs off.
OVER this we hear -- A CHILD'S SCREAM.




INT. APARTMENT - DAY

FATHER HENNESSEY (50), stands over a young teen (13),
JEANIE, splashes holy water on her body. She screams
again.

                           HENNESSEY

             Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut
             num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui
             serpentes!
Her body convulses, pulls against the bandages tying her
hands and feet to the bed frame. Notice her fingernails.
Drained of color. Almost black.
Her MOTHER is off to one side, completely hysterical.
On the other side is a crowd of bewildered TENANTS, all
crammed into the hallway outside the opened door.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                     4.





CONTINUED:

Nothing can compare with an exorcism.   Especially one
that's gone bad.
The rather obese Priest tries to steady his hands and his
heart. It's obvious he's totally out of his league here.
GIRL lets out another SCREAM that ECHOES OVER --




EXT. AGING APARTMENT BUILDING

Not in a third world country but smack center in one of
America's richest cities. Sparkling high-rises tower in
the distance while flashy billboards tout the sexiest
fashions, the hottest automobiles and the smoothest malt
liquor.

SUPERIMPOSE:   LOS ANGELES - TODAY





EXT. ALLEY BY THE APARTMENT

A faded yellow taxi PULLS UP and stops. Someone steps
out, grinds a cigarette butt into the asphalt.




INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - FOYER

Doors open, flood the musty darkness with a brief relief
of sunlight. A MAN -- whose face we don't see -- steps
inside, his trench coat hanging like the folded wings of
a raven.
He pauses, pulls an ORNATE LIGHTER and lights a
cigarette. Takes a puff and pushes on inside.




INT. NARROW STAIRCASE HALL WALL

Lined with tenants trying to get a glimpse of the
unexplainable.
The Stranger pushes through. Suspicious faces step out
of his path. The ones that don't he pushes aside -- even
the gangbangers.
The man has no patience for politeness, no time for tact,
no fear of anything.
This man is JOHN CONSTANTINE.
He arrives at his destination, barges into --




                                                      5.





INT. APARTMENT 7B

One scan of the situation is all it takes. The bed --
the child -- the panicked priest -- who rushes to John.

                        HENNESSEY

                  (whispering)
          Thank God you're here...
John shoots him a disgusted look.    Hennessey gives him a
wide berth.
John walks past the panic-stricken MOTHER without a
glance, sets his cigarette on the nightstand, the glowing
tip drooped over the edge. He puts a gloved hand to the
child's face and it burns on contact. His demeanor
instantly changes as he leans right next to the ear of
the little girl and whispers --

                        JOHN

          This is Constantine. John
          Constantine, asshole.
The girl JOLTS, bandages on her arms cut into her skin.
Eyes snap open -- glare right through him.

                          JOHN

          How ya doing?

                        JEANIE

          Vamos juntos a matarla.
John whips out a key chain crammed with medallions.

                        JOHN

          Let's see who we got here...
He holds them up so they cast shadows across Jeanie's
face. He flips through each of these sculptured SAINTS
until the child suddenly reacts to one -- tries to look
away.
John stares at the Saint responsible, seems genuinely
puzzled. He turns to the Mother -- very serious.

                        JOHN

          I need a mirror. Now.
Shaken, the Mother produces a small compact.   John pushes
it away, turns to the doorway crowd.

                        JOHN

          A large mirror. At least --
                  (sizes up the child)
          -- three feet high.

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                        6.





CONTINUED:

The hallway crowd discusses possibilities.

                             JOHN


             MOVE.

Tenants run to retrieve a mirror.     Hennessey looks
worried.
John grabs the bed -- shoves Hennessey aside as he swings
the bed around, legs gouging hardwood all the way. Faces
it toward the window.




INTERCUT - APARTMENT 5G BELOW

Several of the MEN from the hallway crowd storm through
an OLD WOMAN'S stuffy apartment, locate a huge iron-
framed mirror and rip it and half the plaster from the
wall.




JOHN

centers on a drapery ROPE, pulls hard. Drapery HOOKS
EXPLODE off the curtain rod as he swings open the window,
looks down into the alley where that yellow taxi is
parked.

                             JOHN

             Chaz?
CHAZ (20s) looks up from his cab. Cool. Frustrated.
You just know he'd love to be up there, not down here.

                             JOHN

             Move the car.

                             CHAZ

             Why?

                           JOHN


             MOVE THE DAMN CAR.

John frees the drapery rope, ducks back into the room.

                           CHAZ

             Park the car -- Move the car...
Chaz shifts into reverse, moves the car three feet.

                           CHAZ

             There, I moved the damn car.




                                                      7.





INT. HALLWAY

Four men struggle to carry up that enormous mirror. The
Old Woman follows, begs them to be gentle. They swing
the mirror around, take out a chunk of banister. She
freaks.




INT. APARTMENT 7B

Hennessey can only watch as John threads the drapery rope
through the fire escape railing, drapes it back through
the window and loops it over the ceiling fan.
He climbs onto the bed, leans over the child whose eyes
have closed and she's shaking badly. Her body seems to
be going into shock. Isn't strong enough for this.
John has no choice -- slaps her. Eyes pop back open.
Dark and dilated. He yells down at her in Aramaic and
English.

                        JOHN

          Amar natash bow basar! -- Rescind
          from the flesh I command thee --
The girl chokes as if ready to spit.

                        JOHN

          That's it -- time to go home.
Jeanie SCREAMS --

                        JEANIE

          Tiempo para morir!
Her body suddenly PULSES half again larger. John recoils
for a beat. Odd. He continues in Aramaic --

                        JOHN

          Amar natash bow basar --
Another PULSE and this time a SHAPE is clearly seen
expanding under the child's skin -- as if the demon
inside were trying to burst right through.
John backs off -- watches as the shape ripples her flesh,
like fingers caressing from the other side. John glances
to Hennessey. What the hell?
MIRROR arrives at the doorway, BANGS against the JAM.
John waves them in. The four men heft it into the room.

                         JOHN

          Lift it.   Over the bed.   Up.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                           8.





CONTINUED:

John ducks, settles on the girl as they raise it over
him.

                           JOHN

             Hennessey, tie it off --
Hennessey is glad to be called into service -- quickly
ties one end of rope to the mirror. John straddles the
girl, positions his head between her and the mirror above
him.

                           JOHN

             Now close your eyes -- all of you
             -- and whatever happens -- do not
             look into the mirror.
The men close their eyes.        Muscles tense under the
weight.

                           JOHN

             Amar natash bow basar! -- rescind
             from the flesh I command thee!
Jeanie reacts -- that SHAPE reappears, contorts the young
body all out of proportion.
John unblocks the mirror for a second and Jeanie is
reflected inside. It's not just the image of a young
girl in there, but something else. The surface of the
mirror FLEXES in the hands of the men. One starts to
look --

                             JOHN

             No!
Jeanie SCREAMS -- breaks free of the straps. She rises
up, grabs John tight around the throat. Nails dig deep.

                             HENNESSEY

             John?!

                              JOHN

                        (looking into
                         mirror)
             Not yet!
John struggles, puts his hands over her mouth -- cutting
off her air supply. Question is, who's going to pass out
first?
Jeanie's body is racked by whatever's inside her. She
goes into shock, body collapsing -- shaking -- close to
death.

                                                 (CONTINUED)





                                                       9.





CONTINUED:


                            JOHN

             Look!   Look at me!
But she's passing out first. John quickly takes the
medallion that caused the earlier reaction --

                           JOHN

             Goddamit -- look!
-- and presses it against her forehead. Eyes snap wide
and John unblocks the mirror. Jeanie locks on her
reflection and the image in the mirror changes
drastically.

                           JOHN

             Smile pretty you vain prick.
The child's reflection has now changed to a pissed off
DEMON. One that knows it just got suckered in.
MIRROR VIBRATES wildly in the men's grip. Demon
reflection ripples the glass -- bending it outward into
three-D space as the girl takes her last breaths --

                           JOHN

             Now, Hennessey. Now!
Hennessey PULLS the rope with all three-hundred-plus
pounds as John gives the demon face a full extended

FINGER.


                             JOHN

             For your boss.
Demon pushes for him but mirror is jerked into motion.
Swings right out the window but catches on a sliver of
wood --

                             JOHN

             No you don't.
John jumps up and helps push the mirror free.




EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HUGE MIRROR

Falls SLOW MOTION from the 7th story -- tumbling end over
end, sunlight beams glancing off the glass, PROJECTING
the image of the Demon into the LA cityscape. ONTO
buildings, sidewalks, a passing truck -- until all three
hundred pounds of IRON AND GLASS come CRASHING down ON
the taxi's hood.

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                       10.





CONTINUED:


                           CHAZ


             SHIT!

Demon's image SHATTERS on impact -- GLASS SPLINTERING
into a million diamond-like fragments that choke the air.
The GROAN of something evil reverberates into the city
beyond.
Chaz looks up, sees he missed dying by three feet.




INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Jeanie GASPS -- takes her first breath as a child again.
And CRIES. Mother pulls her in, hugs her tight. Note
the girl's fingernails. No longer black.
John's beat, reclaims that stub of a cigarette, still
burning. Takes a drag. He pushes past Hennessey who is
approaching the mother.

                           HENNESSEY

             Now about the fee...
John slips FROM VIEW into the kitchenette, hides the fact
that he has to lean against the door to keep his balance.
He catches his breath, looks up and is staring right at a
child's crayon drawing magneted to the fridge. A drawing
of a figure poking another in the side with a long stick.
This image is repeated over and over.
John tugs it off the fridge, tucks it away.




INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - LATER

Hennessey follows John down the spiraling stairs, passing
the gathered tenants. A few are freaked, cross
themselves. Others horrified. But many want to touch
them, shake their hands.
A shadowy FIGURE several floors up stares over the rail
at the heroes below. Note the slick suit, the polished
veneer.
This is BALTHAZAR and he definitely does not rent here.
He flicks an ancient COIN between his fingers.
JOHN pauses, gazes up through the stairwell as if sensing
something. No one there. Balthazar is gone.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         11.





CONTINUED:

JOHN shakes off the feeling, continues down the steps
where Hennessey is shoving his HAT in front of the
tenants. They're gladly giving to the cause.

                              HENNESSEY

             Thank you.     Yes... Gracias...

                             JOHN

             Hennessey.
Hennessey stops his panhandling, continues toward the
exit.




INT. FOYER

John and Hennessey stop near the front entrance.      John
rips the white collar from Hennessey's neck.

                           HENNESSEY

             I know, I know, but I didn't think
             she was really possessed, not like
             that.

                           JOHN

             I'm not back an hour and you drag
             me into --

                           HENNESSEY

             -- Don't be mad, John, don't be --
John rummages through his coat pockets --

                           HENNESSEY

             On the left side.
John keeps searching.

                             HENNESSEY

             Vest pocket.
John rips his smokes from the left vest pocket --

                           JOHN

             Don't do that shit on me --

                             HENNESSEY

             Sorry, sorry.    Here, you can have
             half.
Hennessey starts to divvy the cash but John snatches the
hat.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        12.





CONTINUED:


                            JOHN

             I should take it all, save you
             from yourself.
He gestures that bagged BOTTLE in Hennessey's jacket.

                           HENNESSEY

             It keeps them out, so I can sleep.
             Please, John, I need to sleep.
John stares at his pathetic friend, sighs, finally slips
a few bills from the wad and hands them over.
Hennessey is bubbling with appreciation, starts to
follow. John simply holds up a hand. Hennessey stops,
watches John walk out. Alone.




EXT. ALLEY BY THE APARTMENT

John turns the corner, spots Chaz punching a dent from
the taxi's hood.

                           JOHN

             I told you to move it.

                           CHAZ

             Well maybe if you had told me you
             were dropping a three-hundred
             pound mirror with a pissed-off
             demon in it I would have moved it
             further.
Chaz slams the hood.      They slide into the car.

                           CHAZ

             Well?

                           JOHN

             Well what?
Chaz reaches back into John's front coat pocket -- pulls
out Hennessey's wad of cash -- slips off a few bills.

                           CHAZ

             Shouldn't have cut your stay in
             the land of enlightenment. You
             were so close to growing a
             conscience.
John grins, pulls his special lighter, lights a smoke and
sits back.

                           JOHN

             Los Angeles...
He looks back up at the apartment, still puzzled.

                           JOHN

             Never ceases to entertain.
Chaz crams the car in gear as John takes a drag, coughs.




EXT. THE SKY

One of those perfect days. With perfect clouds. So
clear you feel you could reach out and touch Heaven.
Two young girls rise INTO FRAME on side-by-side swings.
For a moment they're suspended against that incredible
sky. Then gravity takes hold and they fall back to
Earth.

                           MAN (V.O.)

             You still with me?




INT. SUBWAY - DAY

ANGELA'S (30) weary eyes open. She's on her belly hidden
between track ties and shadows even deeper. Grips a
police-issue revolver tight. She's pinned down, unable
to move.

                           ANGELA

             Yeah...
The MAN is thirty feet down the same track. Their VOICES
ECHO off the curved walls, come from everywhere.
How either of these two got here isn't important.      Who
will get out is.

                           MAN (O.S.)

             So what's next, Detective?   We
             gonna do a full marathon?
Intermittent RADIO CHATTER buzzes from Angela's WALKIE-
TALKIE. You get the sense Angela is not alone in here.

                           ANGELA

             Put your weapon on the tracks and
             step out with your hands above
             your head.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         14.





CONTINUED:


                           MAN (O.S.)

             Or how 'bout you show yourself and
             I put a bullet in your skull just
             like I did hers!

                           ANGELA

             That's just not going to happen.

                           MAN (O.S.)

             You sure about that?!
Angela checks the chamber -- sees she has one bullet
left.

                           ANGELA

                     (almost pleading)
             Now put down your weapon on the
             tracks and --
GROUND BEGINS to VIBRATE.     Tunnel starts to GLOW.

                           MAN (O.S.)

             Well ain't this a peach?!
Angela looks back, sees several SHADOWS of figures waving
far off. Her RADIO is flooded with futzed CHATTER.

                           DETECTIVE WEISS (V.O.)

                     (over radio)
             Get off the tracks! Blueline is
             coming! Clear the tracks!
Angela peeks over the track.     Still no sign of her perp.
The TRAIN is coming INTO VIEW and its BEAM shoots through
the tunnel, turning every particle of dust into a supernova.
The SOUND is DEAFENING.

                           MAN (O.S.)

             C'mon, Detective, step into the
             light and be saved!!
Angela looks back, squints into the brilliant LIGHT.
She grips her GUN and in one burst of flat-out bravado --
rises as she AIMS.
And there he is -- the Man rising with his own gun.
Angela FIRES as both dive off the track. His BULLET
RICOCHETS behind her. Hers finds its mark. Man goes
down right in the train's path.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                       15.





CONTINUED:

Angela rolls over on the side of the tracks, catches her
breath. She closes her eyes and crosses herself as the
train roars past in a staccato blur.




EXT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY - DAY

Chaz's taxi pulls up, parks.




TAXI TRUNK

OPENS, REVEALS suitcases stamped with AIR INDIA.   John
starts inside, pauses as Chaz yells --

                           CHAZ

             There are four bags. I have two
             hands. This give you any ideas?

                           JOHN

             Make two trips?
John walks in.     Chaz curses under his breath.




INT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY

Evening leagues are going strong. John walks in, looks
totally out of place. He moves down the BALL RACK area,
runs his fingers across the various leftovers, finally
stops at a pearl-white dazzler.
He lifts it from the rack, steps out into the prep
area -- in front of one of the few lanes not in use.
Number 13.
John snatches a grease pencil from the overhead,
scribbles right on the ball -- "PROVISIONS DEPLETED."
He fluffs his trench coat back, steps onto the polished
wood with his well-traveled Oxfords.
Young bowlers on both sides stop to look at this oddity.
An attractive brunette is rather curious. John gives her
a wink. Her boyfriend doesn't appreciate it.
John bowls. Perfect hook ball. Strike! Brunette grins.
John returns the smile, heads into the hallway by the
pool tables.




                                                      16.





INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT

Seems small until you walk in and realize it's as long as
a bowling lane. Makes that cage enclosed bed at one end
seem like it's a mile away.
Chaz throws the suitcases on it as John arrives.

                        CHAZ

                  (yells across room)
          Simple question. How much longer
          do I have to be your slave?
John pulls a chain and a wall of window shutters open.

                        JOHN

          You're not my slave, Chaz. You're
          my very appreciated assistant.
          Like Tonto and Robin and that
          skinny fellow with the fat friend.
Along the floor, encircling the entire room, are 5 gallon
Sparkletts bottles. Each is adorned by a small hand-
marked CROSS. John takes a moment to adjust one out of
place.

                        CHAZ

          How much longer?
John doesn't like his tone.

                        JOHN

          Well I don't know, what's the
          going rate for saving a taxi
          driver hanging from his
          fingernails about to be swallowed
          into the jaws of Hell?

                        CHAZ

          So what time you want me back?
John gives him a knowing look, goes back to emptying his
pockets.

                        JOHN

          I need to make an appearance at
          Midnite's. Say ten-ish?
Chaz sighs, starts out --

                        JOHN

          Chaz...?
Chaz turns back, catches an object John throws him.

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                         17.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             A little something from Delphi.
It's a dashboard air freshener shaped like a cow.
Chaz tips it.     Moooooo.   John finds it rather amusing.

                             CHAZ

             Gee, thanks.
Chaz leaves. John removes a small BLACK BOX from his
jacket. He sets it carefully on its own shelf by the
window -- stares out.

                           BEEMAN (O.S.)

             'Provisions depleted?'
John turns to see BEEMAN waddle in.

                           BEEMAN

             I gave you three months worth.
             You were gone only one.
This diminutive occult version of Bond's "Q" carries a
custom bowling bag and squints in the light like a mole.

                           JOHN

             What can I say, Beeman, India was
             a real drain.
They shake hands.     Beeman sets his bowling bag onto the
table, unzips it.

                           BEEMAN

             So what do you need?

                           JOHN

             Everything you got.

                           BEEMAN

                     (pausing)
             You smell something, John?

                           JOHN

             Maybe. Incubus in this girl I
             just exorcized seemed a bit more
             spirited than usual.
Beeman starts pulling things out.      First is a frayed RAG.
Then glass containers...

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         18.





CONTINUED:


                           BEEMAN

             Well, I've got your stone
             fragments from the Road to
             Damascus, dust from the Dead Sea
             Scrolls -- oh, you'll love this --
Out comes a little MATCHBOX with a smiling bug graphic.

                           BEEMAN

             Screech beetle from Mount Sinai.
He shakes the matchbox and the BEETLE flutters inside.
It's WINGS create an eerie HIGH-PITCHED WHIRL. John
shrugs. So?

                           BEEMAN

             Yeah, to you it's nothing but to
             the Fallen -- like fingernails on
             a chalkboard.

                           JOHN

             What is it with you and bugs?
Beeman pulls out a set of sculptured BRASS KNUCKLES.
Actually solid gold and engraved with religious markings.
John takes them, tries them on. Nice fit.

                           BEEMAN

             Gold was blessed by the Bishop
             Anicott during the Crusades.
John spots a foot-long COPPER TUBE in the bag, pulls it
out, grips the bicycle handle on one end.

                           BEEMAN

             Watch it there.
With this puny little thing? John gives the handle a
squeeze and WHOOOOSH -- ten-foot FLAME BELCHES out.

                           BEEMAN

             Dragon's breath.

                           JOHN

             I thought you couldn't get it
             anymore.
Beeman shrugs, modesty. John starts to put it down on
the table and Beeman quickly pulls the frayed rag away.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                       19.

                           BEEMAN

             Whoa, don't want to get a flame
             near this.
                     (off John's look)
             Piece of the shroud Moses wore to
             the mountain.
John picks it up -- You're shitting me, right?    Nope.

                           JOHN

             Got any callinicus?

                           BEEMAN

                     (intrigued)
             How spirited was this incubus?

                           JOHN

                     (coughs)
             Like it was trying to come right
             out through the girl
Beeman just stares at him -- is this a joke?

                           JOHN

             I know how it sounds...

                           BEEMAN

             We're finger puppets to them,
             John, elaborate costumes -- they
             can work us but don't come through
             us. They can't. You know that.

                           JOHN

             Check the scrolls anyway.
             Corinthians. See if there are any
             precedents.

                            BEEMAN

             Sure, John.   Anything else?

                           JOHN

                     (coughs again)
             Wouldn't happen to have anything
             for --
Beeman sets down a bottle from the bag -- Vick's 44.

                             BEEMAN

             On the house.




EXT. LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

Lots of blue on blue in this parking lot.

INT. LOCKER ROOM

Locker door opens and Angela is there, covered in the
grime of the subway. She's pained as she pulls off her
shoulder holster. Looks at herself in the door mirror.
Tired, aging eyes stare back.

                        WEISS (O.S.)

          Gutsy move out there, Dodson.
Angela glances at DETECTIVE WEISS as he opens his locker.

                          ANGELA

          Gutsy?    Well that's a new one.
The two exchange a look.

                        WEISS

          You're alive. Bad guy's dead. No
          point in using the other words.

                          ANGELA

          Thanks.

                        WEISS

                  (shuts his locker)
          Even though it was reckless --
          irresponsible -- stupid...

                        ANGELA

          I knew you still cared.

                        WEISS

          You're good, Angela, real good but
          one of these days...

                         ANGELA

                   (heard it before)
          I know, nobody's luck lasts
          forever.
He meets her eyes.    Exactly.     He really does care.
Weiss breaks it off, leaves. Angela turns to close her
locker door, notices her reflection does not turn.
She grabs the door, looks back in. Reflection is as it
should be. She shudders, slams the locker door.




EXT. CLUB MIDNITE - 10 PM

So exclusive there's not even a line out front. Just a
pair of bouncers waiting to roll someone just for fun.

Chaz follows John from the cab to the entrance. A
Bouncer selects a PICTURE CARD from a deck. On the front
are TWO FLYING DOLPHINS. Only we can see the back, which
is --

                           JOHN

             Two frogs on a bench.
Yep. They let him pass. Chaz steps up and lucky him --
he gets the same TWO FLYING DOLPHINS.

                           CHAZ

             Two frogs on a bench.
But Chaz is stiff-armed because the back of this card
shows a BEAR in a dress.

                            CHAZ

             What?   But I'm with him!   Right,
             John?   John?
John glances back -- gives him an impassive look.   Chaz
backs away, stares after him. Someday.




INT. CLUB MIDNITE

MUSIC FLOODS this exclusive establishment. It's a clash
of cultures and influences not easily dated. A retro
speakeasy for the new millennium.
John walks through a maze of passages while the fantasies
of a twisted city play out in the shadows. He pauses,
sees a clan of suited businessmen in a corner, showing
off for several ladies.
One fills a line of shot glasses from a pitcher of water.
Another waves his hand over them, turns the water into
RED WINE. The ladies are very impressed, drink up.
NICO, a young black man, walks past John.

                           NICO

             Neighborhood's going to Hell.
John offers a half smile. He likes this kid, walks on.
One of the men in the group turns, watches John.
Balthazar. He grins and pockets that odd COIN.




INT. HALLWAY

John starts up a long flight of stairs, stops in front of
two very large doors.

Their surface is ancient, the wood petrified over
countless centuries. John places his fingers into the
gnarled folds, closes his eyes --

                           JOHN

             Numquam leadatur a morsu.
A living GROAN BELLOWS from the rigid seams but the doors
don't budge.

                           JOHN

             Bastard changed the code again.

             Midnite! Come on, do I have to
             huff and puff here?!
The doors unlatch.




INT. MIDNITE'S OFFICE

SWEEP ACROSS a meticulously-crafted ORRERY, a scientific
sculpture that normally displays our solar system in
relative motion. But the planets here are ancient RELICS
with symbols and names -- MATERIAL, ASTRAL, SPIRITUAL,
ICONIC, etc. And the globe at the center -- "CREATOR."
This is an orrery of the forces of the Universe.      And
it's not moving.

PAPPA MIDNITE stands in the jungle he calls an office.
Part African witch doctor, part savvy businessman. A

                           JOHN

             Well I do have a certain standard
             of living.

                           MIDNITE

             Tell me you found it.

                           JOHN

             I found the vault.

                           MIDNITE

             That's not what I asked.

                           JOHN

             Hey, can I help it if Buddhist
             monks don't take bribes?
Midnite strides toward him when John calmly pulls from
his pocket a small ebony and gold RELIC. It stops
Midnite cold.

                             JOHN

             Gotcha.
A reluctant grin cracks Midnite's stern features. He
takes the relic in his thick fingers -- stares
breathlessly at a gaunt figure bracing itself against a
cosmic wind.

                           MIDNITE

             Second century depiction of a
             sephiroth in the 4th realm...

                             JOHN

             Right.    So we good here?
Midnite ignores his outstretched palm, slides the relic
precisely onto one of the many rods jutting from the
Universal orrery.

                           MIDNITE

             It should counter the iconic
             plane --

                           JOHN

             That damn thing's never going to
             balance.
Midnite lets go and the complex machine actually starts
to move. To turn.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          24.





CONTINUED:

John is somewhat intrigued until the newest relic
collides with another and the orrery jams to a halt.
Midnite deflates, stares at John, suspiciously.

                           MIDNITE

             Must I remind you of what selling
             fake relics will do to your
             health?

                           JOHN

             It's authentic, Midnite, you just
             have the wrong piece. Jesus...
The two have a mini stare-down. John's rigid poker face
is only broken by a cough. Midnite sighs, breaks it off.

                           JOHN

             What? -- I didn't blink -- that
             was a cough. You never cough?
Midnite reaches into his tuxedo jacket and hands over a
thick stack of HUNDREDS.

                           JOHN

             Better not be any Washingtons in
             here this time.

                           MIDNITE

             Why did you cut your trip short?
John stops the counting, actually thinks about it.

                           JOHN

             I don't know... Just a feeling --
John suddenly spins toward the entrance doors, is stunned
to see --

                           JOHN

             Balthazar.
Balthazar is behind him.     Utterly confident.     Chillingly
so.

                           BALTHAZAR

             We're not still whining about
             Manhattan, are we?
John's attempt to disguise his anger fails.

                           BALTHAZAR

             That expression alone has made my
             entire night.

                                                 (CONTINUED)





                                                          25.





CONTINUED:

John takes several steps toward him.       Grins.   Malevolent.
There's history here.

                           JOHN

             I'll make your night -- I'll
             deport your sorry ass right where
             you stand --

                           MIDNITE


             JOHN.

John stops in his tracks.

                           JOHN

             It's bad enough that you let these
             half-breeds in at all but this
             piece of shit --

                           BALTHAZAR

             Perks of becoming a primary
             investor.

                           JOHN

             What?!
Midnite's eyes say it all -- not here, not now.

                           BALTHAZAR

             Things change, balances shift.
             Get used to it, Constantine.

                           JOHN

             Not while I'm still breathing --
John starts to cough again.

                           BALTHAZAR

             I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.
John tries to catch his breath, can't. And that scares
him a bit. He tries to hide it, pushes out.




EXT. CLUB MIDNITE

John SLAMS out the exit -- coughing. He pulls the Vicks
44 from his jacket, struggles with the child protector
cap.

                           HENNESSEY

             Hey, John.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         26.





CONTINUED:

John is surprised to see Hennessey waiting. He chokes,
is about to bust the Vicks 44 bottle.   Hennessey grabs
hold, twists off the cap with one flick. John guzzles
the syrup.

                           HENNESSEY

             I'm real sorry about this morning,
             John, real sorry. Please don't
             hate me for draggin' you into
             that. Please don't...
John can finally breathe.

                           JOHN

             I don't hate you.

                           HENNESSEY

             That's good to hear. Real good...

                           JOHN

             But could you at least wait until
             I call for you before you show up?

                           HENNESSEY

             You didn't call?

                           JOHN

             Not yet. Jesus, Hennessey, you
             freak me out sometimes.

                           HENNESSEY

             So you want me to go away and come
             back?

                           JOHN

             No. I've got an assignment for you.

                            HENNESSEY

             Really?   What kind of assignment?

                           JOHN

             The kind you'll have to be sober
             for.

                           HENNESSEY

             Oh God, you want me to surf the
             ether.
He instinctively touches an AMULET around his neck.       Four
intersecting crosses.

                           JOHN

             Come on, you know that exorcism
             wasn't right.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                       27.





CONTINUED:


                           HENNESSEY

             I... I don't have the Sight
             anymore.

                           JOHN

             Don't have it or don't want to use
             it?
Hennessey vacillates.     This is obviously tough for him.

                           JOHN

             Just look around. A few days.
             You spot anything unusual,
             anything -- you let me know.
             Okay?
John wraps an arm around his shoulder like a good buddy,
then reaches behind his neck --

                           JOHN

             It'll be like old times.
-- and unclips the amulet from Hennessey's neck. That
unnerves the big guy. John drops it in Hennessey's
pocket.

                           JOHN

             Just for a few days.

                           HENNESSEY

             Okay, okay... for you, John.      Like
             old times. Right.
Hennessey takes one last sip from his drink, hands the
bottle over. John downs the rest. Nods.




INT. ST. ANTHONY'S CHURCH - CONFESSION BOOTH - NIGHT

Angela sits inside.

                           ANGELA

             I killed a man today.   Another
             one.
FATHER GARRET sits on the other side of the mesh window.

                           FATHER GARRET

             I'm sorry, Angela.

                           ANGELA

             Most cops go twenty years without
             firing their gun. Not me. I
             always seem to be in the wrong
             place at the wrong time.




                                                     28.





INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT

Angela arrives home. Pours milk for a cat.     Lets her
hair down. Slips off her shoes.

                        ANGELA (V.O.)

          I didn't even see his face. I
          just pulled the trigger and he
          went away. Just like all the
          others...
Angela in the SHOWER -- trying to wash off the guilt.

                        FATHER GARRET (V.O.)

          These feelings are natural in your
          line of work, Angela. I'd be
          worried if you didn't have them.
Angela now in a recliner, cat in her lap.   She's tired.
Eyes are heavy.

                        FATHER GARRET (V.O.)

          But you have to be strong. You
          can't allow your faith to be
          overshadowed by guilt.

                         ANGELA (V.O.)

          I'm trying.
Her eyes close.

                        ANGELA (V.O.)

          I'm trying real hard.




INT. RAVENSCAR - NIGHT

Angela's eyes open. An Angela whose frightened features
are dripping with a fever sweat.
She's in a hospital gown, stares around a corner.
Janitor polishes the floor in the distance. A nurse
checks off charts in the f.g. And right between the two
darts Angela, unseen by anyone.




EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

A metal fire door swings open and Angela bursts out --
breathing deep. She runs across the tar roof, almost
afraid to look back.
She gets to the ledge, steps up.   A BOTTLE in the way
fall -- FOLLOW IT DOWN TO the --




                                                    29.





COURTYARD

-- where it SHATTERS --




INT. GROUND FLOOR HOSPITAL ROOM

The sound has drawn the attention of BARRY (10) lying in
bed. He moves up and stares out the window -- sees the
broken glass in the courtyard. He scans up the building
and spots a FIGURE standing on the roof.




ROOFTOP - WIDER

Chilling April air flutters Angela's gown, vaporizes her
breath. Tears stream down her cheeks as she contemplates
the unthinkable.
Cityscape of lights are spread out below but Angela is
seeing something else.

REFLECTED IN HER EYES --

is a city engulfed in RED FLAMES. Follow that tear with
the same reflection of fire inside as it traces her cheek
and slips into her mouth.
ANGELA shudders, rubs her wrist where we see the skin has
swelled and reddened just like the Prisoner's. And
there's that same circular symbol in the flesh.
She wipes her tears -- tries to be strong. Takes a few
breaths for courage, them simply steps off.




INT. BARRY'S ROOM

BARRY'S WIDE EYES follow her down.




EXT. COURTYARD - LATER

Barry approaches across the barren courtyard, leans down
to Angela's contorted body. But she's still alive.
Barry stares into eyes that are fading fast. He reaches
out, touches her face. Eyes close. She's gone.




INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT

Angela stirs awake.   Disturbed.
OVER this we hear INCESSANT COUGHING --




                                                       30.





INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM

John switches on the light, leans up from the sink and
wipes his mouth with a towel. It's covered with blood.
More runs down the drain. He stares at himself in the
mirror. ON John's worried eyes --

                                       MATCH CUT TO:





ANGLE - ANGELA'S EYES

looking equally distraught.

                        WEISS (V.O.)

          It's her, Angela...




EXT. RAVENSCAR HOSPITAL - WIDER - CONTINUOUS ACTION -


DAY

Angela is led by Detective Weiss past several officers
and medical personnel.

                         WEISS

          It's Isabel.
They arrive at the covered body in the courtyard.
Coroner sees Angela approach and lifts the sheet from the
face.
Angela comes to a dead stop, emotions coming fast and
furious.
She leans close and we see a mirror of Angela. That's
when you realize that wasn't a dream. This is her twin.
But that circular symbol is nowhere on her wrist now.
Angela's eyes well with tears. It takes everything she
has to stay in control. Helps to wrap herself in the
job. She steps back, looks up at the tall building.

                        ANGELA

          She... she fell from the roof?

                         WEISS

          No.   She jumped.
Angela gives him an incredulous glare.   Shakes her head.

                        WEISS

          I know it's hard to accept but --

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                        31.





CONTINUED:


                           ANGELA

             Isabel would never in a million
             years take her own life. Never.

                           WEISS

             Angela... there was a surveillance
             camera on the roof.




INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

John marches down a hallway, his trench coat a step
behind. He unconsciously rubs his left wrist, coughs.
Flicks an unlit smoke between his fingers.
John stops at a doctor's office door -- hesitates.




INT. RAVENSCAR - SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE

View of the rooftop. There's Isabel in her nightgown,
stepping up -- pausing just a second. Then one step and
she's gone. So clear. So unrefutable.




WIDER

Angela shudders as a comforting HAND rests on her
shoulder.

                           WEISS (O.S.)

             Take some time...
Angela brushes off his hand, then spots Weiss and the
others on the other side of the room. Whose hand was
that?




INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE

A LINE OF LIGHT BOXES illuminate several CHEST X-RAYS. A
DARK sinister splotch snakes through both LUNGS. John
stands there, stares at this wall of death with disbelief.

                           JOHN

             No -- I've beaten things,
             insurmountable things, things most
             people have never even heard of
             and after all that you think I'm
             going to be done in by THIS?
He raises a puny little cigarette. DR. LES ARCHER (50)
sighs. A delicate bedside manner is not his specialty.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         32.





CONTINUED:


                           DR. ARCHER

             You wouldn't be the first, John.

                           JOHN

             It can't be that simple. I mean
             come on, Les, you saved me before.
             You can do it again, right.

                           DR. ARCHER

             This is different. This is
             aggressive.
John tries to stay cool -- fails.     He TRASHES the X-ray
boxes. Diseased lungs disappear.      Doc shakes his head.

                           DR. ARCHER

             Twenty years ago you didn't want
             to be here. Now you don't want to
             leave.

                           JOHN

             That's because I know exactly
             where I'm going this time.




INT. HALLWAY

John steps outside of the Doctor's office, pauses to
gather himself. He starts walking. Wants out of here
fast.




INT. RAVENSCAR - HALLWAY

Angela is on the move. Emotions are coming in strong.
She can't get out of here fast enough.
She aims for the elevators, sees a MAN has just entered
one.

                           ANGELA

                     (rushing toward it)
             Wait, hold the door!
Angela, gets to the elevator, looks in. John stands
inside alone. This should be the first time we realize
they were in the same hospital.

                           ANGELA

             Going down?
John pauses as the doors start to close.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                      33.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             Not if I can help it.
The doors close right on Angela.




EXT. SOMEWHERE IN ISTANBUL - DAY

A PICKUP TRUCK crosses a barren landscape.
In the back bed are several goats and one Prisoner.
He grips the relic tight in one hand.   That anxious fever
has returned.
Glazed eyes dart to the side and lock on a rising
jetliner in the distance -- dart back to the road they're
on -- heading the opposite way.
Prisoner clamps his eyes tight, grips to the relic
tighter.
Eyes snap open and he turns, thrusts his elbow through
the center window, leans in and grabs the Driver -- jerks
his head back against the bulkhead -- cracking it in the
process.
Prisoner latches onto the wheel, takes control. He
swerves the car off the pavement, gets out and takes over
as driver.
Truck continues on, bouncing through a shallow ditch and
into the field beyond, aiming straight for the rising
airliners in the distance.




EXT. L.A. APARTMENT - DAY

Close to condemned status. SCAN UP floor after floor,
COMING TO REST ON a window covered with aluminum foil.




INT. HENNESSEY'S APARTMENT

Every wall of this tiny shithole is covered in aluminum
foil. A sober Hennessey stands surrounded by decades of
newspapers and periodicals -- tries to get his breathing
in check.
He instinctively reaches to his neck to touch the amulet
but it's not there. Oh yeah -- in the pocket. Decision
made, he reaches up, starts tearing the foil from the
walls and the window.




                                                       34.





EXT. ECHO PARK (DOWNTOWN L.A.) - DAY

John sits at a park bench. Motionless. Taking in the
world. Clouds passing the sun. Shadows drifting across
the city. Leaves swirling after passing cars.
John just sits there, HEARING every breath he takes,
wondering which one will be his last.

                         ELLIE (O.S.)

          Lung cancer?   Lung cancer?!
John turns to see ELLIE (23) strutting up the sidewalk.
Uninhibited. Oozing sex appeal. But dangerous. In more
ways than you think.

                        ELLIE

          That's funny as shit, John.

                        JOHN

          As if you guys didn't have
          something to do with it...

                        ELLIE

          Hey, I think you brought this one
          on yourself.
John stares at her, tries to get a read.

                        ELLIE

          Now why wouldn't you trust me?

                        JOHN

          I don't know, something in the
          air --
She sits right on his lap, playfully.

                        ELLIE

          Don't worry, John, you'll beat
          this. You beat everything.

                        JOHN

          Not this time, Ellie.
John lifts her off of him, sets her aside.

                        ELLIE

          Oh wow, you're serious... No
          wonder the Boss is in such a good
          mood.

                        JOHN

          Yeah, I thought maybe you could
          talk to him for me. You know...?

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                       35.





CONTINUED:

Ellie jumps off the bench, creates an odd SOUND as she
does.

                           ELLIE

             What?! Dammit, John, I know I owe
             you but to even ASK that? All
             those saints and martyrs slipping
             through his grasp -- his own foot
             soldiers sent back to him in
             chunks. He's going to take all
             that out on you, John, and he's
             going to enjoy ripping your soul
             to shreds until the end of time.

                           JOHN

             So I take that as a 'no?'

                           ELLIE

             You're the one soul the man
             himself would actually come up
             here to collect. And you know how
             much he despises this place.

                           JOHN

             I'm starting to see his point.
Ellie sits back down, strokes his arm.

                           ELLIE

             Have you gone to see the Snob?
Like scratching fingers across a blackboard.     No way.

                           ELLIE

             Look, don't let your ego get in
             the way on this. I'd miss having
             someone up here I can... relate
             to.
She gives him a kiss. And for a second John's leg is
brushed by a tail. John doesn't react. Just turns and
walks away.




INT./EXT. CHAZ'S TAXI - DAY

Seen through a mild rain is the Theological Society
building, a foreboding structure that looks out of place
for this city. John stares out the back seat window,
takes a swig from a bottle of hard liquor. He turns to
Chaz --

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         36.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             I'm sure I can get you in here.
Chaz gives the building another glance, shoves the meter
flag back down. Tick... tick... tick...

                           CHAZ

             Pass.




INT. THEOLOGICAL SOCIETY - LATER

A few bishops talk quietly. A cardinal studies
Scriptures. Definitely not the place for atheists.
John walks through the vaulted chamber room to the --




LIBRARY

John stops, fixes on the two gentlemen standing in front
of a fireplace. One is a young man of pure class wrapped
in Armani's best. The other is Father Garret.
John stands to the side and waits for their conversation
to end. An ATTENDANT makes the rounds.

                           ATTENDANT

             Can I take your coat, Mr.
             Constantine?

                           JOHN

             No thanks, I'm not staying long.

                           ATTENDANT

             How about you, ma'am?
Attendant turns to Angela standing just a few feet away,
her gaze fixed on the same two men.

                           ANGELA

             I'm not staying long either.
John glances over and for the second time they make
contact. Something about her eyes. John stares a bit
too long. Angela looks back toward the fireplace.

                           ANGELA

             My business with him is urgent.

                           JOHN

             First come, first served.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         37.





CONTINUED:


                           ANGELA

             So you're rude no matter where you
             are.
John gives her a look. The two men shake hands and start
to part. John and Angela make their move toward the men.
Both are surprised when Angela goes for Father Garret and
John goes for --
-- the SNOB, officially known as GABRIEL.       Yes, that one.




FATHER GARRET

and Angela have retreated to another area for privacy.

                           ANGELA

             Why is he stalling on this? My
             sister needs a Catholic funeral.

                           FATHER GARRET

             Angela, it's still considered a
             mortal sin --

                           ANGELA

             She didn't commit suicide.

                           FATHER GARRET

             The Bishop has read otherwise.

                           ANGELA

             Father... David -- this is Isabel.
                     (meeting his eyes)
             Please...
Father Garret stares at her, tries to be compassionate.

                           FATHER GARRET

             I'll talk to him again.
But Angela has just lost a load of faith.




BY THE FIREPLACE

Gabriel sits in his chair, watches the fire with
unblinking eyes. John approaches from behind and against
the backdrop of flame, sees the nebulous shape of wings.
The ghostly image is visible for only a heartbeat.

                           GABRIEL

                     (without looking back)
             I know what you want, son.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         38.





CONTINUED:

John sits across from him.

                           JOHN

             Been keeping your all-seeing eye
             on me, have you?

                           GABRIEL

             I could offer how a shepherd leads
             even the most wayward of his flock
             but it might sound disingenuous.

                           JOHN

             So you're going to make me beg?
Angela pauses on her way out, looks over.

                           GABRIEL

             It wouldn't help. You've already
             wasted your chance at redemption.

                           JOHN

             What about the minions I've sent
             back, the souls that I've saved --
             that should guarantee my passage
             across --

                           GABRIEL

                     (keeping it private)
             -- No -- passage requires faith
             and faith by definition is belief
             without proof. You have proof.
             And that means you're not playing
             by the same rules as everyone
             else. Your work has mostly been
             for selfish reasons. I'm sorry.

                           JOHN

             This is bullshit -- bullshit!
Now he's really got Angela's attention.

                           JOHN

             It's like you've got some cosmic
             scale weighing everything we do --
             help an old lady across the
             street -- put in a nickel, kick a
             dog, take out a dime -- you're
             fucking nickel and diming us to
             death down here!

                           GABRIEL

             Keep your voice down.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                     39.





CONTINUED:

John jumps up, leans into his face.

                           JOHN

             And you know what, you're the ones
             with the problem, not us -- You make
             these impossible rules to decide who
             goes up, who goes down and you don't
             even understand us --
This more than anything gets under Gabriel's skin.

                           GABRIEL

             Each of you is born with the
             promise of salvation preordained.
             The cost of your redemption is
             simple belief. And yet you whine
             about impossible rules. Sometimes
             I imagine you hardly deserve the
             gift you have been given.

                           JOHN

             Gift?! More like a curse the way
             you manage things.
Gabriel stands and towers over John.

                           GABRIEL

             I am taking your situation into
             account, John, but don't push me.

                           JOHN

             Why me, Gabriel? It's personal,
             isn't it? I didn't go to church
             enough? I didn't pray enough? I
             was five bucks short in the
             collection plate? Why?
Gabriel moves right up to him, makes this very personal.

                           GABRIEL

             You're going to die because you
             smoked 30 cigarettes a day since
             you were 15. And you're going to
             Hell because of the life you took.
             Or to put it in a way that your kind
             would understand. You're fucked.




EXT. THEOLOGICAL SOCIETY - MINUTES LATER

Angela stands on the porch at the edge of a downpour.
She hears a cough, looks over to see John standing on the
other side, looking equally frayed. They share another
glance.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                          40.





CONTINUED:

John fishes a pack of cigarettes from his pocket.        Empty.

                           JOHN

             He has a rotten sense of humor.
                     (steps past)
             And his punch lines are killers.
John tosses the cigarette pack, walks right into the
RAIN, away from Chaz's taxi pulling up.

                            CHAZ

                      (shouting out)
             John?   It's raining! Hey!
Angela watches John disappear in the rain, looks down at
the empty cigarette pack.

                                          DISSOLVE TO:





INT. HENNESSEY'S APARTMENT - A CIGARETTE PACK

lies on the floor next to food wrappers, Coke bottles and
stacks of newspapers. Hennessey sits amongst the
garbage, slumped over. But he's not sleeping.
He's surfing the ether. Allowing his sixth sense to
guide him. His hands move down and across the stacks of
newer periodicals, fingers probing the layers of
information.
Left hand suddenly stops.
Hennessey's eyes open. He removes the layers of periodicals
on top of his left hand, leans close. Edges his fingers
away and sees an OBITUARY. A name -- Isabel Dodson.




EXT. L.A. STREETS - EVENING

John walks the streets, numb to the world. A rat
scurries past near the curb. Then another. Several
crows fly by.
Above him is a BILLBOARD - "YOUR TIME IS RUNNING OUT."
Doesn't matter that below it is -- "TO BUY A NEW CHEVY."
The point is crystal clear. John shakes his head, breaks
out laughing which quickly turns into a coughing fit.
He leans to a gutter. Another rat scoots past. John
barely notices. Then a frog jumps past. But it's the
crab crawling by that finally catches John's gaze.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        41.





CONTINUED:


                           VOICE OF MAN (O.S.)

             Hey, buddy, you got a light?
John turns, settles on a silhouetted figure standing
behind him, unlit cigarette butt in its mouth.

                           OLD MAN

                     (coughs)
             We gotta stick together, right?
John gathers himself. As he walks over to this OLD MAN,
he rummages through his coat pocket, retrieves a
matchbox.
The box shudders as a high-pitch FLUTTERING filters from
inside. Old Man winces as his entire body VIBRATES.
John realizes -- this is Beeman's matchbox, the one with
the screech beetle inside. And now he knows -- a beat
too late.
Old Man attacks.
John is knocked onto his haunches. As the Old Man closes
in, he's revealed in more detail. Body and face are
actually an intricate puzzle, an assemblage of city
vermin. Rats, insects, crows, frogs, crabs -- all held
together in the shape of a man.
John scampers backwards, just inches from this being's
outstretched grasp. He shakes the matchbox and the
screech beetle inside flutters again.
Old Man/Demon cringes as his entire body vibrates apart
for a second, then snaps back together. He GRABS onto
John with fingers of squirming vermin. Snake wraps
around his wrist. Crab snaps at his skin.
John shakes the beetle box harder -- causing the parts to
vibrate even further. Old Man grabs John's head and
vermin of various leg count crawl right onto John's face.
John's had enough -- shakes the matchbox violently, then
smashes it against the sidewalk.
BEETLE lets out a death SHRIEK and the Old Man
stutters -- his parts vibrating so wildly you can
actually see the b.g. through the seams.
John scampers loose, grabs a road barricade and swings it
with all his might. Old Man form shatters on impact.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                        42.





CONTINUED:

The entire mess collapses to the ground in a flood of
scattering critters. John starts stomping on them as
they scatter into the city.
John stands there, shocked and concerned.      What the hell
is going on?




INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - DAY

That surveillance VIDEO FOOTAGE from Ravenscar plays
again. There's Isabel in her nightgown walking across
the roof.
Spread out on a cluttered coffee table is Isabel's case
file. CORONER'S REPORT is opened. Let's see "NO DRUGS
IN SYSTEM" and the biggie -- "Cause of Death -- SUICIDE."
Angela sits on the couch in her robe.      Disheveled and
distraught. She's taking this hard.

                           ANGELA

             I'm sorry, Isabel...
She lowers her head.     And in that brief moment of
silence --

                           ISABEL (V.O.)

                     (on TV)
             Constantine.
Angela snaps back to the TV, freezes in shock.
There's Isabel ready to jump but this time she's looking
right back AT us -- at Angela. Then she's gone.
Angela quickly rewinds the tape and watches the sequence
again. This time Isabel doesn't look back. This time
there is no name. But Angela did see it. Did hear it.
She sits for a second.     Stunned.




INT. MIDNITE'S OFFICE

John paces as Midnite works on that Universal orrery,
adjusting components but balance continues to elude him.

                           JOHN

             A few months, maybe a year.
             That's it. End of story. Game
             over.

                            JOHN (CONT'D)

                      (as Midnite doesn't
                       react)
             Well, don't break down on my
             account.

                           MIDNITE

             What do you want from me?   A
             shoulder to cry on?

                           JOHN

             This bastard attacked me right out
             in the open -- on Sepulveda no
             less.

                           MIDNITE

             They don't like you, John. You've
             deported how many back to Hell?

                           JOHN

             That's just it -- this wasn't some
             possession or wayward half breed,
             it was a full-fledged demon.
             Here. On our plane.

                           MIDNITE

             Right.

                           JOHN

             I know what I saw.

                           MIDNITE

             You must have just crossed over
             and didn't even realize it --

                           JOHN

             I didn't cross over -- It was on
             this side. Here.

                           MIDNITE

             -- it's wet out, you're wandering
             around aimlessly, not to mention
             completely emotional --

                           JOHN

             Emotional?!
John slams a fist against the counter. The orrery almost
topples but Midnite saves it. Decades of work almost
lost.
Midnite glares at a desperate John.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         44.





CONTINUED:


                           MIDNITE

             Okay, so you saw something. We've
             seen a few small ones slip through
             now and then.

                           JOHN

             It's more than that... first the
             girl, then this.

                           MIDNITE

             John, you know my connections.
             Any shifts or tremors in the
             planes and I'd hear about it.
John just shakes his head, looks up -- convinced.

                           JOHN

             Something's coming.
Midnite sighs, gives up with him.




INT. LAPD OFFICE - LATER

The name JOHN CONSTANTINE is center screen on a
monitor -- typed into the police station's SEARCH ENGINE.
Angela sits alone in the squad room, rain streaking
across the windows.
Interpol comes back with results and a list of priors
scroll under John's name.
Must be a hundred PARKING VIOLATIONS. Several SPEEDING
tickets and a few RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT. In fact John's
license has been REVOKED.
But it's the other incidents that draw Angela in.

BRIEF CLOSEUPS

Of specific words in a few HEADLINES -- "Occult activity
on the rise..." "Claimed possession is refuted by
Bishop..." "Satanic cult dissolved..."
Accompanies with an assortment of unusual case photos.
-- BLOOD PATTERNS on a WALL -- Odd SYMBOLS burned into a
ceiling. A cross burnt to a crisp.
-- JOHN in handcuffs looking back at a mother holding her
son in her arms. A younger and more noble Father
Hennessey stands beside them, looking grateful.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        45.





CONTINUED:

Another line -- "INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE to PROSECUTE."
Angela scrolls, sees cities listed where John has made
waves -- LONDON -- PARIS -- ROME -- BUDAPEST -- MOSCOW.
Stops on the one that matters -- LOS ANGELES. And
there's an address.
Angela hits PRINT and the HP HUMS away.
A desk PHONE RINGS. Angela quickly looks around, sees
she's the only one here. She gets up, answers it.

                            ANGELA

             L.A.P.D.   This is Dodson, hello?
Dead air. The next PHONE RINGS. Angela reaches for it
when the NEXT ONE RINGS, and the NEXT, the NEXT.
The RINGS HOP phone to phone in intimidating mockery.
Angela freezes, forces herself to stay calm.     Sure
enough, the RINGS abruptly CEASE.
Angela reaches over, rips the page from the printer,
leaves.




INT. ISTANBUL AIRPORT - DAY

A police guard scans passengers and a printout of the
Prisoner. He walks past a man standing in the metal
detector line.
This is actually the Prisoner wearing the clothes and
glasses of the Driver. Is that a blood stain on the
lapel?
Sweat drops from his forehead and he nervously places the
iron relic in a bag he took from the truck driver. He
has no choice but to place it on the conveyer belt.




MYSTERIOUS POV

Watching the Prisoner.      He looks back AT us, suspicious.
Nothing there.




PRISONER

looks back nervously, as his bag goes through the
detector.




                                                         46.





DETECTOR SCREEN

shows the folds of the bag, a wallet, a passport and
nothing else. The iron relic doesn't even produce an
outline.
Bag slides out, untouched. Prisoner can't believe his
luck, grabs the bag and walks on toward the gates.




EXT. LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

VARIOUS of the city -- the contrasts between the bright
and cheerful and the dark and mysterious. That abandoned
mission behind Bob's Big Boy, the Islamic Temple wedged
between competing banks.

COME TO REST ON --

The towering statue of The Good Shepherd. His hands are
welcoming us into the "HOLY CROSS CEMETERY."
Right across the street is the 20 Lanes Bowling Alley.




INT. 20 LANES - THE BAR

John drinks alone.   Pissed at life.      At death.
That small black box of his lies on the table unopened.
Spider runs across the table. John flips an empty glass,
traps it underneath. He takes a drag on his cigarette,
tips the glass and blows smoke inside. Spider can't
escape the poison air, bumps the glass. Trapped. Dying.

                        JOHN

          Welcome to my life.

                        ANGELA (O.S.)

          Mr. Constantine?
John looks up, spots Angela.        Those eyes again.

                        ANGELA

          I saw you at --

                           JOHN

          -- I remember.

                           ANGELA

          And --

                           JOHN

          Yeah.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          47.





CONTINUED:

She did make an impression.

                           ANGELA

             I'd like to ask you a few
             questions.

                           JOHN

             I'm not really in the talking mood
             right now.

                           ANGELA

             Could you just listen then?
Angela sets her LAPD detective badge on the table.

                           ANGELA

             Please?

                           JOHN

             Always a catch...
Angela sits across from him, puts the badge away.

                           ANGELA

             My sister was murdered last week.

                           JOHN

             Sorry to hear...

                           ANGELA

             Her name was Isabel.   Isabel
             Dodson?
She looks for a reaction.     None.

                           ANGELA

             You don't remember her?

                           JOHN

             Never met her.

                           ANGELA

             You sure?

                           JOHN

             She look anything like you?
                     (as Angela nods)
             I would've remembered.
Another beat as their eyes meet.       John looks away.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         48.





CONTINUED:


                           ANGELA

             She was a patient at Ravenscar.
             Then last Tuesday she just decided
             to step off the roof.

                           JOHN

             I thought you said she was murdered?

                           ANGELA

             Isabel would never take her own life.

                           JOHN

             You'd be surprised at what people
             will do.

                           ANGELA

             Look, I know I'm not making much
             sense -- hell I'm not really sure
             what I'm doing here... I just
             feel -- the circles you travel
             in -- the occult, demonology,
             exorcisms...
John just stares at that spider in the glass.       Trapped.

                           ANGELA

             I believe someone got to her, Mr.
             Constantine, brainwashed her into
             stepping off that roof. Some kind
             of legion or cult.

                           JOHN

             Sounds like a theory.   Good luck.

                           ANGELA

             Well I thought with your
             background and experience, you
             could at least point me in the
             right direction.

                            JOHN

             Yeah, okay.   Sure.
John points -- toward the exit.      Angela is not amused.
But she's not giving up.

                           ANGELA

             My sister always talked about a
             world better than this. Heaven as
             some call it. She wasn't afraid
             of dying because she knew it was
             waiting for her. What everyone
             fails to grasp is that if she had
             really taken her own life --

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                       49.





CONTINUED:


                            JOHN

             -- she would have committed a
             mortal sin and her soul would have
             gone straight to Hell where it
             would never feel love or
             compassion or anything but pain
             again as the master himself rips
             her apart over and over for the
             rest of eternity.
                     (beat)
             That about right?
The words have hit so hard that Angela is speechless.
John sees the hurt in her eyes, would like to take it
back -- but it's too late.
She turns and starts out, slows --

                           ANGELA

             You're not the only one afraid of
             Hell.
John tries not to let that get to him. She leaves. He
glances out the window, watches her pass by. So long.
Good riddance.
But something's not right. Those deep shadows on the
buildings seem to be moving. John watches, confused,
realizes they're heading in Angela's direction.

                           JOHN

             Oh shit...
He stands, gains his bearings. As he walks out he flicks
the glass over. Spider runs free.




EXT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT

Cars are lined all the way down the street. Angela walks
along the sidewalk unaware of the shadow following her.
It's joined by another in the trees -- both closing in
with each step.

                           JOHN (O.S.)

             Detective!
Angela looks back, sees John in the street.

                           JOHN

             How open is your mind?

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         50.





CONTINUED:

She doesn't answer, continues walking. What she doesn't
see are the shadows seeping back into the fringes. But
John does. He starts walking toward her.

                           JOHN

             Do you believe in Heaven and Hell?
                     (off no answer)
             How about what comes out of each?
Angela keeps walking.      He catches up with her.

                           JOHN

             Hey!

                           ANGELA

             You mean like angels?

                           JOHN

             And demons.
Angela stares at him, continues walking.       He keeps up.

                           JOHN

             See, you don't have the mindset
             for this kind of work.
They walk together down the lonely street.

                           ANGELA

             Look, I see terrible things every
             day. A mother drowns her baby. A
             ten-year-old shoots his father.
             But it's not demons, it's the evil
             that men do.
Behind them, a streetlight BLINKS OUT. Then another.
They're not looking back so they don't see it.

                           JOHN

             You're right, we're capable of
             terrible things but we usually
             justify it with motives like money
             and power and jealousy.
Another LIGHT FIZZES, blinks out.

                           JOHN

             Then sometimes, something comes
             along and gives us just the right
             nudge and we do truly evil things
             just for the kick of it.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                             51.





CONTINUED:


                           ANGELA

             I don't believe in demons.

                            JOHN

             You should.   They believe in us.
They pass another streetlamp as it goes bright, then
blacks out. Both look up.
The next LAMP FLARES then FIZZES OUT.
Angela turns and sees that there are no lights behind
them. She looks to John. But he's staring straight
ahead. Because now the light in front of them is FLARING

BRIGHT.


                           JOHN

             We should go...
Second later it BLINKS OFF.         John grabs her hand --

                             JOHN

             Fast.
Angela's confusion turns to tension as a raspy guttural
WIND races toward them.
John jerks her into action. They run towards the next
light. It blinks out right when they reach it.
They race to stay in the light, aiming toward the safety
of the brightly-lit statue of the Good Shepherd.




EXT. HOLY CROSS CEMETERY

They make it through the gate, pass through an alley of
overhanging trees. Something RIPPLES through the
branches -- flitters right past Angela's face. She swats
at it, manages to get a branch across the cheek.
They near the Good Shepherd and the floodlights FLICKER,
fade out. Statues of saints become dark monoliths.
John stops in an OPEN AREA between trees and a mausoleum.
A lit CROSS on the wall provides the only illumination.
Angela feels the scratch on her cheek, sees a trickle of
blood. Now she hears SOUNDS in the darkness. Like
LEATHER RUBBING. Surrounding them.

                             ANGELA

             What is that?

                                                  (CONTINUED)





                                                         52.





CONTINUED:

John is just as surprised he's saying this --

                           JOHN

             Wings.

                           ANGELA

             Wings?
John rummages through his trench coat -- fishes out that
cloth Beeman gave him. The one supposedly wrapped around
Moses.

                           JOHN

             And maybe talons.
The cross is getting dimmer and dimmer...

                           ANGELA

             Are you kidding? Of what?

                           JOHN

             Something that's not supposed to
             be here.
John quickly wraps the cloth tight around his hand.
Angela spins, eyes seeing only darkness as the sounds get
CLOSER -- ghastly sound of MOVEMENT in the fringes of
light.
The cross now resembles a dying wire filament and with
every second the circle of light gets smaller and those
SOUNDS GET CLOSER. John takes out his special lighter.

                           JOHN

             Close your eyes.
They are now standing in pitch darkness.

                           ANGELA

             Why?

                           JOHN

             Suit yourself.
John flicks the lighter and in one powerful motion --
sweeps his arm up as he lights his hand.
Sacred cloth catches fire -- then IGNITES with a
brilliant retina-searing FLASH -- blinding Angela and
illuminating a --
-- CIRCLE OF WINGED DEMONS -- a roiling broth of
reptilian death -- right there -- ready to pounce.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         53.





CONTINUED:

RED FLAME radiates from the cloth and DEMONS SHRIEK as
they are instantly vaporized.
John tucks his burning hand into a coat pocket,
extinguishes the flame. He leans down to a rubbery stain
left from one of the burnt demon carcasses. Shakes his
head in disbelief.

                           JOHN

                     (to himself)
             'I accidentally crossed over?'    I
             don't think so.

                           ANGELA

                     (coming up behind)
             What was that? I saw wings -- and
             teeth -- they were flying. What
             the hell were those things?!

                           JOHN

             They weren't angels.
John scans the area, trying to think this through.

                           JOHN

             Seplavites, actually. Scavengers
             for the damned.
                     (off her lost look)
             Demons?

                           ANGELA

             What? You can't be serious...
             this is impossible...

                           JOHN

             Yeah...
                     (to himself)
             And I don't think they were after
             me...
John looks at her with renewed interest.

                           JOHN

             You really believe she wouldn't
             commit suicide?

                           ANGELA

                     (a bit thrown)
             My sister?
                     (a beat)
             Never in a million years.
John makes the decision.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        54.





CONTINUED:


                             JOHN

             Let's be sure.
He starts walking.     Angela is now compelled to follow.

                             ANGELA

             How?

                            JOHN

             Simple.   See if she's in Hell.




EXT. L.A. COUNTY MORGUE - NIGHT

Not exactly an inviting place.
Hennessey steps off the curb, looks up at his
destination.




INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

John stares at a photo of Angela and her father in police
uniform. Obviously happier times.
Angela walks out of her bedroom holding a cardboard box.
That gray cat follows close to her heels.

                           ANGELA

             These are all Isabel's things.

                             JOHN

             The cat too?

                             ANGELA

             Yeah, why...?
John ignores the box of items, picks up the cat. He
studies it a bit, then sits back in a chair with it.

                           ANGELA

             Don't you need candles and a
             pentagram for this to work?

                           JOHN

                     (deadpan)
             Why, do you have any?
John puts his feet, shoes and all into a BUCKET OF WATER.

                           JOHN

             I need you to step outside now.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                      55.





CONTINUED:

Angela wants to stay.

                            JOHN

             Angela?   Please.
Angela reluctantly moves toward the exit. John holds the
cat, stares into its huge, unblinking eyes. There's a
moment where animal and man seem to connect.
The water around John's feet begins to BOIL.
ANGELA pushes the door closed behind her but it slows on
its way to latch.
Bulbs pulsate as current ramps down. The room flickers,
is suddenly caught in a ghostly dim half-light and John
has now crossed over into --




APARTMENT IN HELL

Same layout, different decorator. John takes a deep,
raspy breath, slowly stands. He turns to the wall behind
him which is torn away, looking like some half-bombed
structure in Beirut.
Beyond the wall is no longer the blackness of a
nightscape but a sickly sepia glow. Not quite day, not
quite night.
John steps over the crumbling wall into --




EXT. HELL LOS ANGELES

John walks out onto the top overpass of a crumbling maze
of intersecting freeways. Burnt-out husks of long-
forgotten vehicles sit in rows of gridlock. A low DRONE
penetrates the silence.

                             JOHN

             Is she here?
On the horizon is a dying RED SUN.    It strains to cut
through the putrid brown haze.

                             JOHN

             Is she here?!
His VOICE REVERBERATES to infinity.

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                          56.





CONTINUED:

John cautiously steps closer to the railing, looks down
to the ribbons of twisting streets below. They're
crammed with teeming masses of the damned. All walking
down in silence, faces numb with sorrow and grief.

                              JOHN


             IS SHE HERE?!

That low DRONE RISES IN PITCH and John now spots a huge
blanket-like BLACKNESS crawling over the cityscape,
rapidly closing in on him. You get the feeling this
isn't a safe place for the living.

                            JOHN

             It's a simple question!    Is she
             here or not?!!
John suddenly locks on something far off.
On top of a distant skyscraper is a FEMALE FIGURE in a
sheer white gown. John can't make out her face but knows
she's looking right at him.

                              JOHN

             Isabel?
She lifts something and tosses it. John watches as a
small object tumbles toward him just ahead of closing
darkness.




INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY

In that same motion we left her in -- Angela finishes
pushing the door closed. As it LATCHES --

                           JOHN (O.S.)

                     (weakly)
             Angela... come back in...
Confused, Angela pushes the door back open. Cat BOLTS
out. Angela catches her breath, moves inside.




INT. LIVING ROOM

John sits slumped in the chair, drained. Steam rises off
his skin. Angela sees the water in the bucket has almost
all boiled out. She walks in, kneels down to him.

                              ANGELA

             John?     What happened?

                                                 (CONTINUED)





                                                       57.





CONTINUED:

Sweat drips off as he looks up. He opens his palm --
reveals to Angela a simple HOSPITAL BAND. The name
"ISABEL DODSON" is typed on it.
Even as a semi-convert, this news completely floors
Angela. She takes the plastic band -- grips it tight --
tries to hold herself together. The adrenaline and pain
overwhelm. Her knee buckle and she drops to the floor.
John watches, isn't sure how to help. He finally reaches
out a single hand -- slowly rests it on her shoulder.
The contact seems to open a floodgate of emotion and
Angela falls right into his arms. John hasn't been this
close to anyone in a long time. Angela finally composes
herself.

                            ANGELA

             How?   How did you do this...?
John tries not to stare into those eyes too long.     Fails.




INT. L.A. COUNTY MORGUE - NIGHT

Body drawer slides open -- reveals Isabel. Lying in a
cold, sterile room of death. A Hell of a different type.
Hennessey stares down at her, looks around the room
again, makes sure he's still alone.
He reaches in, rips open the protective plastic and
lowers his hand inside. Places it first on her forehead.
Nothing. Then on her chest. Nothing. Wrist is last.
Hennessey shudders. This is it.
He closes his eyes and opens himself to the void --

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             When I was a kid, I saw things...




FLASHBACK - EXT. STREET - DAY

A TEN-YEAR-OLD John comes out of a corner store with milk
in a bag. He slows, eyes a MAN at a mailbox.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             Things I wasn't supposed to.
The man looks right at young John as he passes. His face
is distorted and his feet have sprouted roots which are
dug into the ground.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                       58.

                           WAITRESS (O.S.)

             Coffee?
Young John looks up toward the voice --




INT. DINER - NIGHT (PRESENT)

John looks up at the Waitress.

                           JOHN

             Tea.
She leaves. Angela sits across from him.      They're at the
table by the window.

                           JOHN

             My parents sent me to a doctor, a
             shrink, a priest. I was in four
             different institutions by the time
             I was eighteen.
Angela notes him rubbing his wrist.

                            JOHN

             The last place they put me was run
             by a church...
A DOCTOR rushes past their table.     PAN WITH him INTO...




FLASHBACK - INT. MENTAL INSTITUTION - HALLWAY

The Doctor rushes toward distant SCREAMING.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             The revered Father made the
             brilliant deduction that I was
             possessed, said I needed to be
             exorcised...




INT. ROOM - HIGH ANGLE

The Doctor runs in. Sees the revered Father below,
leaning over a bed where an 18-year-old John is held down
by three interns and that Doctor. John angrily screams
at them all.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             It was like someone trying to pull
             teeth that weren't there.
Young John clamps his eyes shut tight.




                                                      59.





INT. DINER - JOHN (PRESENT)

Present-day John does the same, remembering the pain.

                        JOHN

          So I took things into my own hands
          and I found a way out.

                        ANGELA

          You attempted suicide.
John sees she's looking at his wrist. The hint of a
jagged scar can now be seen under the sleeve.

                        JOHN

          I never attempt anything.
John's reflection in the window becomes --




FLASHBACK - TEENAGE JOHN

kneeling with a pair off scissors.     He's inside a...




INT. CLASSROOM

Teenage John looks up at a room filled with people from
all walks of life. Teachers, doctors, lawyers, garbage
men. All somewhat different than normal. They sit in
school chairs and wait for John to do the deed.
He puts the blade to his wrist -- one swipe and the world
around him accelerates away in a STREAKED BLUR --




INT. DINER (PRESENT)


                        ANGELA

          But you're still here.    Alive.

                           JOHN

          Not my doing.
His chest suddenly HEAVES forward -- and we're on...




FLASHBACK - TEENAGE JOHN

as he's jolted by DEFIB PADS.     He's in the back of a...




INT. AMBULANCE - MOVING

Paramedics are soaked in sweat. One looks a bit like a
young Dr. Archer. Heart monitor is FLAT LINE. There's
little hope.




                                                     60.





EXT. LOS ANGELES

The ambulance moves through a city that is transforming.
From this world's Los Angeles to a barren Hell version.

                        JOHN (V.O.)

          Officially I was dead for seven
          minutes. But believe me, seven
          minutes in Hell is a lifetime.
Ambulance heads toward that dying RED SUN.




INT. AMBULANCE

FLAT LINE on the monitor suddenly SPIKES with a pulse --




INT. MORGUE (PRESENT)

Hennessey's hand jerks back from the plastic. His eyes
fix on Isabel's wrist. That odd circular SYMBOL is back.
Hennessey's unsettled, quickly shoves the drawer closed.
He rushes out, slams right into a SECURITY GUARD coming
in.

                        SECURITY GUARD

          Hey, what're you doing in here?
Guard looks back into the body room, sees a drawer
partially open. He walks over, pulls it out further --
sees the plastic cut away. Jesus.
The symbol has already faded from Isabel's wrist.

                        JOHN (V.O.)

          When I returned I didn't just see
          demons anymore, I could do the one
          thing they couldn't -- come and go
          as I please.




EXT. MORGUE - HENNESSEY

runs as fast as a very obese man can -- aiming for that
PHONE BOOTH on the corner. He grabs the receiver,
punches numbers as fast as he can. RING -- RING --

RING --


                        HENNESSEY

          Be there, John... please...
Something shivers up Hennessey's leg and into his body.
Eyes glaze over and Hennessey settles on a RESTAURANT.

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                        61.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN (V.O.)

             Heaven and Hell are right here,
             behind every wall, every face --
             the world behind the world. It's
             crossing over that's the real
             trick. That's why most demons can
             only whisper in our ears. But
             even a whisper can turn your
             favorite pleasure into your worst
             nightmare.




INT. LATE NIGHT RESTAURANT

HENNESSEY barges in, squeezes past the MAITRE D'.

                           MAITRE D'

             Sir, you need a reservation!
But Hennessey is on a quest.     For food.   And it's
everywhere.
He starts grabbing meals right off of plates. Fish,
pasta, prime rib. Shovels it all in. Patrons are
yelling -- screaming. He's eating as if his life
depended on it. And even though he's devouring anything
in sight, this huge man is wasting away before our eyes.
In the middle of all this chaos is one customer calmly
eating his meal. Balthazar.
Hennessey hijacks a food cart -- consumes everything on
it yet his skin is getting looser and the body inside
gets thinner.
He grabs a steak from a woman's plate but she jerks it
back so he bites into his arm. She screams as her
husband pulls her away.
Hennessey's strength is withering away. Desperate, he
grabs a FORK, digs it into his own hand.
A Hispanic BUSBOY rushes into the room, grabs onto
Hennessey.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             But the worst demons are the ones
             that are allowed to be here -- the
             ones that are half-human so they
             blend in...
Balthazar stands, throws a few bills on the table and
starts toward the back EXIT.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             ... just like those with the
             angel's touch living alongside of
             us. The half-breeds.
That Busboy lowers Hennessey to the floor. For a moment
we see him framed against the front doorway. And in that
instant we get a brief glimpse of --




ALTERNATE LOS ANGELES

An incredible pristine lake reflecting a city of light.




BACK TO SCENE

BUSBOY looks up, meets Balthazar's eyes. Bitter enemies.
Balthazar grins, flips that coin between his fingers. He
leaves out the back exit.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             They call it 'the Balance.' I
             call it hypocritical bullshit.




INT. DINER


                           JOHN

             So when one of them gets a little
             cocky, peddles their influence or
             hijacks a soul -- I deport their
             scaly ass right back to Hell.
                     (takes a sip of tea)
             I don't get them all but maybe
             enough to insure my retirement.

                           ANGELA

             Sounds like you're trying to buy
             your way into Heaven.

                           JOHN

             Well, what would you do if you
             were sentenced to a prison where
             half the inmates were put there by
             you?
Not a serene image at all.     Angela studies him.

                           ANGELA

             Why you? I mean many go to Hell,
             why were you able to escape?

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          63.

                           ANGELA

             God has a plan for all of us.

                           JOHN

             Not for me.
John's bitterness is obvious.     Angela just stares at
him -- finally --

                           ANGELA

             Isabel saw things too.
John looks up. Moment is lost when her CELLULAR RINGS.
The cop in her reacts, flips it open.

                           ANGELA

             Detective Dodson here.




EXT. RESTAURANT - LATER

The morgue is seen across the street.     The Guard that
chased Hennessey is just outside.

                           WEISS (O.S.)

             Security Guard spotted him near
             the body, chased him out.
We MOVE PAST Angela standing with Weiss.       Around them is
a complete shambles of fine dining --

                           WEISS

             He comes over here, makes a run at
             the entire menu and pow --
             deflates like a fricken Macy's day
             balloon.
-- COME TO REST ON John's shattered face. He stares down
at Hennessey. Now yards of loose flesh sunken over an
assemblage of bones. Only that ragged black tie he wore
is familiar now.
John leans down to the remains of his friend. A cop
starts to intervene but Angela blocks him. Let him be.
John has trouble taking this in, reluctantly reaches into
Hennessey's coat pocket -- finds the protective amulet he
himself removed from his friend. That's even more
crushing.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                    64.

             Why didn't you call me, you fat
             sonna bitch...
John lowers his head, then spots blood stains on one of
Hennessey's hands. He opens the fingers, studies the
fork wound. The blood is already drying over it.
John reaches over to the mess of dishes on the floor and
grabs a melting ice cube.
He pushes it into Hennessey's hand, wiping away the dried
blood. It quickly becomes apparent -- this isn't random
stabbings. This is a shape.
John takes a napkin, lays it on the palm and presses.
Residual blood creates a symbol onto the napkin.
It's the same circular symbol we saw on Isabel's wrist.
John doesn't know what it is, but he knows it's important.

                           JOHN

                     (to Hennessey)
             Rest in peace, Father.




INT. 20 LANES - BEHIND THE LANES

With a loud crowd and 20 huge PIN MACHINES GRINDING AWAY
the noise back here is DEAFENING. But this is Beeman's
home. See the desk, the TV. The fold-away bed.
Beeman is on the phone. There's a conversation but it's
way too noisy to hear. All we see are the emotions on
Beeman's face. No doubt news of Hennessey's death is one
of the biggies.
Beeman quickly reaches for a marker, puts it to paper and
starts drawing -- listening and drawing --
He's finished, hangs up. Stares at the Symbol. That
cabinet with the ancient books now gets his attention.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             I need to see where Isabel died.




EXT. EAST LA - NIGHT

Graffiti-adorned walls give way to a tall iron fence,
heavily-shadowed grounds and finally the six-story

A rim-lit figure stands on the roof. But this one isn't
wearing a hospital gown, he's wearing a trench coat.

                           ANGELA (V.O.)

             Seances, crystals -- channeling...
             Our father thought she was just
             trying to get attention. She
             certainly did that.




EXT. ROOFTOP

Angela stands behind John. A large water tank is
anchored to the roof next to her. Note the FLAME logo.

                           ANGELA

             She'd tell everyone about things
             she said she saw. Crazy things.
             Things that hadn't happened yet.
             She'd scare my mother to death,
             talking on and on about
             Revelations and the end of the
             world. Then one day she just
             stopped... never said another
             word.

                           JOHN

             So you put her in here.
Angela doesn't need to be reminded.     It hurts even more now.

                           JOHN

             Show me her room.




INT. CORRIDOR

John and Angela head toward Isabel's room. A NURSE
appears from around the corner walking with a boy. It's
Barry, the boy in the courtyard.
He locks on Angela and when she makes eye contact he
breaks away from the Nurse, runs toward her with arms
outstretched.

                           NURSE

             Barry!
He runs right into Angela's arms, hugs her tight. Angela
is totally baffled. John is thoroughly intrigued.

                           NURSE

             Oh God...

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         66.





CONTINUED:

She rushes in, gently tugs the boy away.

                           NURSE

             No, Barry, that's not Isabel.
Barry stares at Angela. He reaches out, touches her
face, confused. Nurse pulls him back even further.

                           NURSE

             I'm sorry. They were friends. He
             kind of had a crush on your sister.
Angela nods, understanding. The Nurse leads Barry away.
He doesn't take his eyes off Angela the entire time.
Neither does John.

                           JOHN

             You were twins.
Angela nods, steps inside.      John pauses, thinking.




INT. ISABEL'S ROOM

John steps inside, gives the sterile room a thorough
scan.

                            JOHN

             So how long?

                            ANGELA

             Two months.
                     (beat)
             This time.
He pulls out a drawer, looks at the bottom.

                           ANGELA

             I already did all that.
John runs his hands under the steel bed frame.

                           ANGELA

             Now you're insulting me.

                           JOHN

             You don't walk off a building
             without leaving something behind.

                           ANGELA

             You saw everything she left
             behind. In that box.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                          67.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             Maybe she left something else.
             Something more personal. Just for
             you.
Angela doesn't like that look he's giving her.

                           JOHN

             You were her twin, Angela.    Twins
             tend to think alike.

                           ANGELA

             I'm not like my sister.

                           JOHN

             But you were at once time. When
             you were kids. When you'd spend
             every waking hour with each other.
             You'd start a sentence, she'd
             finish it. You'd get hurt, she'd
             cry.

                           ANGELA

             That was a long time ago...

                           JOHN

             That kind of bond doesn't just
             disappear.

                           ANGELA

             There's nothing here.
Angela seems unbalanced.     John gets more aggressive.

                           JOHN

             She planned her death in this
             room, she thought it up right
             where you're standing --
Angela backs away.     John advances.

                           JOHN

             She knew you'd come -- She counted
             on you to see what she saw, to
             feel what she felt -- to do what
             she did. What did she do, Angela?

                           ANGELA

             How should I know?

                           JOHN

             What did she do, Angela?

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          68.





CONTINUED:


                             ANGELA

             I don't know!

                           JOHN

             What would you do?
Angela backs into a wall.       Nowhere else to go now.

                           JOHN

             What would you leave her? What
             would it be? Where would it be?!
             Where would it be?
Angela lashes out, shoves John hard, pushing him out of
her way. She turns to the window, almost hyperventilating.
John stays back, watches. Angela opens her eyes. The
tension seems to flow right out of her when she sees --

                             ANGELA

             The tree.




EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

A lone tree stands in the center of the lit courtyard.
John and Angela approach it. Examine it. Nothing. John
drops lower on the tree, to a child's height.   Finally
sees something near the ground, gestures to Angela.
She kneels down next to him, sees what he sees.
That same SYMBOL. The one Hennessey carved into his
hand. But this time there's more.

                           ANGELA

                     (trying to
                      rationalize)
             There must have been a tree in our
             backyard... when we were kids...
John may not be buying it but he's not saying anything.
His fingers trace these words carved below the symbol --

                             JOHN


             'COR 14:01.'


                             ANGELA

             Cor?

                             JOHN

             Corinthians.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                    69.





CONTINUED:


                           ANGELA

                     (shaking her head)
             There is no 14h act in Corinthians.
John's face goes pale --

                           JOHN

             I need a church.




INT. HOSPITAL CHAPEL - MINUTES LATER

Several families sit in solemn prayer. The pastor
comforts a man and wife. John and Angela slip through,
head for the shelves of reference books on the back wall.
They whisper.

                           JOHN

             Corinthians goes to 21 acts in the
             book of Ethenius. It's like a
             dark mirror of the Bible. It
             paints a different view of
             Revelations, says that the world
             will not come to an end at the
             hand of God but be reborn in the
             embrace of the damned.

                           ANGELA

             There's a difference?

                           JOHN

             Depends on which side of the fence
             you're standing.
John stops, casually sticks his hand in the pastor's bowl
of holy water near the altar.

                           ANGELA

             So why haven't I seen this book
             before?

                           JOHN

             Because it doesn't exist here on
             this side.
John closes his eyes and the water in the bowl begins to

BOIL --


                           ANGELA (O.S.)

             What do you mean --
Flickering candlelight slows to a stop, catching Angela
mid-question and the room in that dim half-light.
John turns and is inside --




                                                     70.





SAME CHAPEL - HELL

The epitome of blasphemy -- A church in Hell. Only they
don't worship God in here. And that's not Christ on the
cross. And those stained glass windows are now slate
black.
John is now facing books with completely different
markings. He searches as a DRONE rises in pitch and an
INKY BLACKNESS begins to flow down the walls, getting
closer to John with each heartbeat.
He finds the book, steps back as he closes his eyes --




REGULAR CHAPEL


                        ANGELA

          -- not here on this side?
John turns, covered in sweat. He's holding a book she's
never seen, is already flipping through it.

                        ANGELA

          Where did that come from?

                        JOHN

                  (stopping to read)
          13:29. 13:30 -- Here...
          Corinthians 14:01...
                  (skimming to this)
          'The sins of the father would only
          be exceeded by the ego of the
          son.'

                        ANGELA

          Whose son?
John stands, his brain going into overdrive.

                        JOHN

          Symbol isn't a demon's... that's
          why I couldn't place it... not a
          normal possession...

                        ANGELA

          John, what are you talking about?

                        JOHN

          But he can't cross over --
          impossible for the son to cross
          over...

                         ANGELA

          Whose son?   God's?

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                       71.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             No.  The other one.
                     (off her look)
             Lucifer had a son too.




INT. 20 LANES - BEHIND THE LANES

Beeman sits under the glow of a desk lamp. The narrow
alley of machines stretches out behind him. He stares
into the scrolls -- an ancient book with a single page
folded a thousand times. Turns another page.




BOWLING AREA

Amazing how disturbing a bowling alley is when it's
closed. Rows of empty lanes stretching into darkness,
the unlit pin areas looking like the jaws of an army of
beasts.

                           BEEMAN (O.S.)

             Oh my...




BEHIND THE LANES

Beeman has stopped turning pages. That's because he's
now staring at an etching of the same symbol. Below are
ink drawings of a ghastly beast rising up through a body.
But it's what's above the beast that is most troubling.
A figure on a cross -- his arms outstretched -- seemingly
welcoming the beast into this world.

                           BEEMAN

             This is not good...
BOWLING BALL hits a lane.     Beeman spins to the sound.
BALL ROLLS round and round, closer and closer until it
CLANGS dead against the back wall of one of the lanes.
Beeman gets up, starts down the corridor of dormant pin
machines.
He stops at lane 13, leans way way down, past the
machinery and peeks out the pin hole.

                           BEEMAN

             John?




                                                     72.





EXT. LA STREETS - NIGHT

Angela's SUV races quickly through traffic while John
gets her up to speed.

                         JOHN (V.O.)

           The myth says Mammon was conceived
           before his father's fall from
           grace but was born after.




INT. SUV


                         JOHN

           But unlike his old man, he's never
           been in the presence of the Creator
           so he has no fear of him, no respect
           either. That goes double for us --
           God's most prized creations. Mammon
           would be the last demon we'd ever
           want crossing over.

                         ANGELA

           But demons can't come and go,
           that's what you said.

                         JOHN

           Unless they found a bridge.
                   (off her look)
           Some psychic with the chops to
           reach all the way to Hell and the
           grit to withstand whatever shit
           she'd pull out.

                          ANGELA

           Isabel...

                         JOHN

           But even a bridge wouldn't help
           Mammon. Because to cross over, the
           myth says he'd still need the one
           thing he could never get. Divine
           assistance. The help of God.
Angela sits back, letting that sink in.

                         ANGELA

           So it's impossible.

                         JOHN

           Impossible? Sure it's impossible.
           That's what makes it so dangerous.
           These things exist to break the
           rules, to find the loopholes. If
           the past is any indication, then
           the future isn't on our side.

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                         73.





CONTINUED:

John sits back, gut churning.       Angela's in detective mode.

                          ANGELA

             She knew. That's why she killed
             herself. But it doesn't make
             sense...

                           JOHN

             Makes sense to me.

                           ANGELA

             John, she sacrificed herself to
             beat him.
John nods.     Your point?

                           ANGELA

             Why is she in Hell?
One of those rare moments where John has no answer.




INT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY

Something small and SHINY is rolling down the alley.      It
lands in the trough, spins round and round --
Beeman leans out to try and see what it is.      The silver
object keeps spinning.
He waits for it to stop, swats a fly near his face.      Then
another.
Book on his desk ignites in flame.




EXT. 20 LANES - NIGHT

SUV pulls into the empty parking lot. John is out before
Angela gets it in park, unlocks the side door. A few
flies escape to freedom as he opens the door. John
rushes in.




INT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY

Only a LOW HUM pervades the dead stillness of the alley.

                             JOHN

             Beeman?
John grabs the door that leads behind the pin area.      It's
locked from the other side.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         74.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

                     (pounds on door)
             Hey, Beeman? Beeman?!
The LOW HUM fluctuates -- sounds like a BUZZING.

                           ANGELA

             Maybe he's not here.

                           JOHN

             He's always here.
Several more flies flit by him. This time John notices,
turns and spots the source of the HUM -- a cloud of FLIES
near the center aisles. Angela follows his gaze, spots
them as well.

                           ANGELA

             What?
John heads across the lanes. Swarm gets thicker and
thicker. Angela keeps up with him, covers her mouth.
They approach the pin area of the center lane. The
source of the swarm is slowly revealed. In the catch
trough is a solid mound of flies.
John leans closer, spots a HAND protruding from the
mound.

                           JOHN

             Oh Jesus, no --
He rips his coat off, flings it at the mound and million
flies scatter -- revealing the body of Beeman. Ravaged.
Flies pouring out of his mouth, his ears --

                           ANGELA

                     (stepping back)
             Oh God --
John goes ballistic, screams to the walls --

                           JOHN

             Who are you?! Answer me!!
             Goddamit -- reveal yourself!   I
             summon you!
He angrily rips his sleeves up -- revealing two distinct
TATTOOS on his forearms. Slams them together with all
his might -- clenching his eyes tight -- concentrating --
Veins in his arms and neck bulge, look ready to explode --

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                            75.





CONTINUED:

Angela steps back in awe as the air around his
outstretched arms begins to WARP -- to tear a faint hole
from the bowling alley right into another world right
here -- darker -- Hellish --

                           JOHN

             Into the light I command thee!!
             Into the light I --
John is choked by a cough -- can't finish -- arms
separate and he buckles to his knees, reveals to Angela
just how ill he really is.
She leans down to him, sees hints of blood on the floor.

                           JOHN

             ... this is my fault... I sent
             them in... I sent them right to
             their deaths... a damn one-man
             plague.

                           ANGELA

             John, you need a doctor.

                           JOHN

             I've seen a goddamn doctor!!
Angela glares at him -- understands now.       He's dying.
John stands, almost stumbles.       Angela tries to help.

                           JOHN

             Get away from me!!

                           ANGELA

             John?

                           JOHN

             Stay the hell away --
                     (tortured look to her)
             Please --
He uses the handrail to walk away. Angela stands there,
confused by her own emotions. She turns back to the
carnage, hears the distant SIRENS.




INT./EXT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

John sits in his opened window, simmering. He holds a
lit cigarette but doesn't dare put it to his lips.
Outside the city goes about its unending churn.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         76.





CONTINUED:

Down on the street are several police vehicles. ENGINES
START and they drive away. Swirl of blue and red lights
flash across John's moist eyes.

                           ANGELA (O.S.)

             There were no trees in our back
             yard.
John finds Angela across the room in his doorway.

                           ANGELA

             But you knew that already, didn't
             you?
John meets her eyes.     Sees the questions piling up.

                           ANGELA

                     (walking towards him)
             You see something in me...
             Something Isabel had.

                           JOHN

             Go home, Angela.

                           ANGELA

             I need to understand --
John just shakes his head.

                           ANGELA

             Why not?

                           JOHN

             Because you open up to that world,
             you're inviting whatever's out
             there back in. That's what
             happened to Isabel.

                           ANGELA

             I'm not Isabel.

                           JOHN

             No, she embraced her gift while
             you denied yours and that denial
             is exactly why you're still alive.
             Stick with me, that'll change.
John gets off the window, starts walking away.

                           JOHN

             And I don't need another ghost
             following me around.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                           77.





CONTINUED:


                           ANGELA

             Dammit, John -- they killed my
             sister!
That stops him cold.

                           ANGELA

             I can't let them get away with
             that. Even if it means going down
             the same path she did. Now if you
             won't help me get there, I'll find
             my own way. But I won't run.
             Never.
The two stand there -- locked in this moment.

                             ANGELA

             Please...
John can't believe this day -- looks her dead in the eye.

                           JOHN

             You do this, there's no turning
             back. You see them -- they see
             you. Understand?
Angela never blinks as she nods in agreement.




INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - LATER

Pushing slowly through a lifeless apartment -- drawing
closer to the opened bathroom door. WATER is pouring.

                            ANGELA (O.S.)

             Do I take off my clothes or leave
             them on?
                      (a beat)
             John?

                             JOHN (O.S.)

             I'm thinking.

                             ANGELA (O.S.)

             John.

                             JOHN (O.S.)

             On is fine.




INT. BATHROOM

John fills a 70-year-old porcelain BATHTUB.       Angela
stands in the center.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         78.





CONTINUED:


                             ANGELA

             Why water?

                           JOHN

             It's the universal conduit.
             Lubricates the transition from one
             plane to another. Now ask me if
             there's water in Hell.
John turns off the faucet.

                             JOHN

             Sit.
Angela grabs his shoulder for balance, lowers herself.
When she's sitting, the water is all the way to her neck.

                           JOHN

             Normally only a portion of the
             body has to be suspended but you
             wanted the crash course...

                           ANGELA

                     (teeth chattering)
             What will I see?
His eyes say it all.      Enough.

                             JOHN

             Lie down.

                           ANGELA

                     (gesturing the depth)
             Lie down?

                           JOHN

             You have to be fully submerged.

                             ANGELA

             For how long?

                           JOHN

             As long as it takes.     Here --
John cups the back of her neck, holds her face just above
the water as she lowers down. Her breathing is picking
up. John leans over the tub, looks straight down at her.

                            JOHN

             Last chance...
                     (off her look)
             Take a deep one.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          79.





CONTINUED:

Angela takes a deep breath, holds it. John pulls his
hand away and she settles to the bottom, her eyes riveted
on his the entire time.




ANGELA'S POV

A silent John ripples above.     His hand grips her arm,
skin to skin.




BACK TO SCENE

Angela lies there and panic sets in. She starts to
surface but John pushes her head back to the bottom,
holds it firm. Her eyes dart about. Air is running out.
She can't hold her breath much longer. It's not
working --
But the room's lighting begins to pulsate -- as if the
current were ramping down. It slows to that dim half-
light as --
JOHN'S EYES -- CLOSE.     A single blink.
ANGELA is lying in now BOILING WATER, screaming for all
of her life. Water muffles the sound but not the fury.
Huge TUB SHUDDERS hard -- snapping out of the hold down
bolts. John is stunned -- how powerful is this woman?
Another SCREAM and the inch-thick TUB CRACKS.     Water
starts streaming onto the tile.
John lunges, grabs Angela and PULLS her up from the
water -- her muffled SCREAMS SHATTERING the air as her
mouth breaks the surface. She SLAMS hard against his
chest -- arms wrapping tight -- fingers digging into his
back -- leaving marks that might just scar.
TUB GIVES WAY and the damn breaks. John and Angela go
down -- hit the tile as one -- water washing over them
both.
ANGELA lies there on top of John. Trembling.      She looks
up him, eyes filled with revelation.

                           ANGELA

             All those people... so sad...
John nods, helping her understand.

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                       80.





CONTINUED:


                           ANGELA

             ... I've always known... where the
             bad guys are... where to aim, when
             to duck... it's not luck... I've
             always known...
Tears stream down her cheeks. John reaches out to touch
her when her eyes CLAMP TIGHT in pain --

                           JOHN

             Angela?
Eyes snap open and she's off him in a second, runs out.
John pries himself from the tile, goes after her.




INT. BEHIND THE ALLEY

Angela runs behind the vertebrae of machines, dripping
water the entire way. John tries to keep up.

                           ANGELA

             It was rolling toward him -- not a
             ball -- something smaller. Shiny.
She stops, kneels to the floor.     John walks up to join her.
Something glints in the catch trough. She reaches down,
plucks it up and brings an odd COIN INTO VIEW --
John's face contorts with rage as he takes the familiar
coin.

                           JOHN

             Balthazar.




INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - LATER

Beeman's bowling bag is flipped and the contents are
dumped onto a table. Powder, bugs and bullets go
everywhere. John retrieves the odd-tipped bullets.
Those brass knuckles and that copper pipe are taken also.




CHRISTIAN RELICS

are removed from a display cabinet.
There's the pure platinum Flask of Divinity, the
petrified husk from the River of Life -- the hollow shaft
of an iron cross -- all striking pieces individually but
when twisted and locked together form a very imposing --

                                                    81.





CONTINUED:


-- HOLY SHOTGUN.

He swings the cross down, pours a pound of blasting
powder into the husk -- chambers a special bullet into
one of the ten barrels, snaps it shut -- turns and FIRES.
BULLET leaves a trail of flame as it streaks across his
endless apartment, blasts the center out of --
A carton of Lucky Strikes.
SETTLE ON the Surgeon General's warning -- burning away.

                           ANGELA (V.O.)

             Can you kill him? What about the
             Balance?




INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - LATER

John is stuffing the bowling bag while Angela watches,
now dressed in dry clothes. That shirt is John's.

                            JOHN

             That half-breed tipped my scales
             when he started killing my
             friends. I'm just adding a little
             counterweight.
John lifts that holy shotgun -- KA CHICK --

                             ANGELA

             What about me?    I can't stay here
             forever.
John turns to her -- locks on those eyes. He reaches
into his coat pocket as he walks up to her. She shudders
as his arms wrap around her face and for a beat they're
cheek to cheek. When he pulls back she sees he has
clipped Hennessey's AMULET around her neck.

                           JOHN

             Think of it as a bulletproof vest.

                             ANGELA

             So I'm going.

                           JOHN

                     (knows he can't win)
             You're staying in the car.




                                                    82.





INT./EXT. 20 LANES - DAWN

FAT-ASS TIRES BURN under the full torque of a 426 HEMI.
A jet-black '70s BARRACUDA BLASTS from the basement
garage of 20 Lanes -- slides onto the streets of L.A.
Angela hangs on as John grabs the SKULL shifter knob --
slams into 2nd -- leaves another layer of tread behind.




EXT. OCEAN

FLYING OVER the ocean, a 747 ROARS RIGHT OVER US.
Dipping out of cloud cover, it reveals the coast of a
sprawling metropolis stretched out miles below.




L.A. LANDMARKS - DAWN

streak PAST. The Big Donut, the occult bookstores, the
'57 Chevy sign, that Mission in the park.
This is actually the POV FROM John's Barracuda.
He downshifts -- DRIFTS PAST a building with a facade of
pre-stressed concrete and huge gold letters -- "BZR

FINANCE AND BROKERAGE."


                           JOHN (O.S.)

             This shouldn't take long.




INT. BZR BROKERAGE

Elevator opens and John steps out into a lobby of
concrete and glass. Pretentious design screams money.
Lots of it.
Since trading is still a half hour away, the place is
practically empty.
Across the room a stainless steal DOOR HISSES open. John
looks the other way as a Security Guard exits. Thick
DOOR glides closed, seals with another HISS. No way in.
John notices the janitor down one hallway. It's Nico
from Midnite's. He and John lock stares. Nico opens a
"Security Only" door, steps inside -- leaves the door
open.




INT. TRADING ROOM

Monitors are powering up around the room. A few of those
Young Businessmen we last saw at Midnite's are here.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                        83.

                           YOUNG TURK

                     (into phone)
             Hey, early bird is a fat bird,
             know what I'm sayin'?
Balthazar walks through, looking every bit like the smug
and successful businessman he is. He stops at a LONG
MIRROR on one wall. Adjusts his collar, his hair. His
"look."

                           PRETTY BOY

             What are we pushing today, sir?

                           BALTHAZAR

             Phillip Morris.
As Balthazar admires himself, his reflection distorts
slightly. The demon in him? He touches his face, does a
vowel stretch. His face distorts even further.
That's got him moving closer to the mirror.
Balthazar's concerned because now his skin appears
in motion, rippling as if liquefied. And just when he
sees the surface of the mirror BLISTERING and starts to
move --

BOOOM --

One way GLASS EXPLODES outward on the front edge of a
FIREBALL -- sending Balthazar flying with glass and
flame.
John stands on the other side in an ACCESS CHANNEL --
that Dragon's breath flamethrower now duct-taped to his
holy shotgun.

                           JOHN

             How's he doing it?
John steps into the trading room, eyes Balthazar rising
from the floor. Suit's in shreds, half his face is
burned off, but now he's pissed.

                           BALTHAZAR

             This is in direct violation of the
             Balance!

                           JOHN

             Screw the Balance.
John hits him with another BLAST of FLAME -- pins him
hard against the wall.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                       84.





CONTINUED:

Balthazar's young turks attack. One leaps over the
trading station. John swings around -- aims the SHOTGUN
-- BOOM -- half-breed is blasted midair.
The other turk seems to defy gravity as he scampers
across the ceiling. John aims up -- PUMPS SEVERAL ROUNDS
-- steps out of the way as a body falls, smashes into a
desk. BOOM -- BOOM -- that'll keep it down.




INT. BARRACUDA

Angela hears the GUNSHOTS. Cop instinct takes over and
she gets out of the car. Checks the amulet. Intact.




INT. BZR TRADING ROOM

John turns his attention back to Balthazar, doesn't
hesitate and hits him with a continuous tide of flame.
Suit and skin is peeling off, revealing something else
underneath. The true form.

                           JOHN

             How's he doing it, you half-breed
             shit?!
John swings the flame aside so he can KICK Balthazar
against the wall. But now his WEAPON SPUTTERS. Shit.
Charcoal hand thrusts out, bats away the shotgun and
grabs John by the throat.
Balthazar rises from the ashes.     He may be burned, but
he's one tough son of a bitch.
Balthazar slides    John up a wall by his neck. John can't
break his hold.     He's choking, frantically rummages
through his coat    pockets. Comes out with those sacred
GOLD KNUCKLES on    his right hand.
Balthazar tightens his grip and John swings, clocks him
across the face. The enhanced punch sends a dizzying
ripple throughout Balthazar's body.
But he doesn't let go. John is choking, starts whaling
on him. Again and again -- each punch weakening this
demon more.
John finally gets him against the wall. Right arm's
tired so he slips the gold knuckles onto his left hand,
and with extreme pleasure -- continues punching away.
Drives Balthazar to the floor, right to the brink of
death.

CONTINUED:

He leans up, winded. Watches in delight as Balthazar
strains to take his final breaths.

                           BALTHAZAR

             I will see you very soon...

                           JOHN

             Not really, no.

                           BALTHAZAR

             You can't cheat it this time...
             you're going back to Hell.

                            JOHN

             True.   But you're not.
John removes that small BLACK BOX from his coat.
Balthazar tries not to be concerned until John unlatches
it and removes the one weapon he hardly ever uses --
A Bible.

                           BALTHAZAR

             What are you doing?

                           JOHN

             I'm reading you your last rites.
Balthazar reacts.      This isn't good.

                           BALTHAZAR

             Your remedial incantations have no
             relevance to my kind.

                           JOHN

             Aren't you half human?
Balthazar doesn't have to answer.

                           JOHN

             You see, that makes you eligible
             to be forgiven. You do know what
             it is to truly be forgiven? To be
             welcomed into the kingdom of God?
Balthazar's worst nightmare.

                           JOHN

             A demon in heaven -- love to be a
             fly on that wall...

                           BALTHAZAR

             You're not a priest, you have no
             power...

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                       86.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             -- I escaped hell, who else do you
             know that has the power to do
             that?!
Balthazar is now doubting his own beliefs.

                           JOHN

             Just tell me how Mammon is
             crossing over and you can go back
             to your shithole.
Balthazar isn't convinced.
John stands -- raises the Bible and starts to read --

                           JOHN

             'May the merciful God have mercy
             on you and grant you the pardon of
             all your sins...'
He places a hand on Balthazar's forehead. Balthazar
glares at it as John's voice rises with commanding
authority.

                           JOHN

             'Whosoever sins you remit on earth
             they are remitted unto them in
             heaven. I absolve you from -- '

                           BALTHAZAR

             -- It may not even work...

                            JOHN

             How?   How's he doing it?!
Balthazar looks scared as shit to tell him.

                           JOHN

                     (bellowing out)
             'Grant your child entry into thy
             kingdom in the name of the Father,
             and the Son and the Holy Gh -- '

                           BALTHAZAR

             ... Sangre de dio.
John is stunned -- did he hear right?     Balthazar nods.

                            JOHN

             How?

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                        87.





CONTINUED:


                           BALTHAZAR

             What killed the Son of God will
             give birth to the son of the
             devil.
John's mind races and he finally puts it together.

                           JOHN

             He's found the Spear.
Balthazar's expression confirms it.

INT. 747 - MID-FLIGHT

Prisoner in an aisle seat, trying to keep calm. He looks
behind him as if being watched. Just nerves again.

EXT. BZR BROKERAGE - FRONT AREA

ANGELA moves through the gathered crowd looking up at the
building. As she makes her way through, the amulet
brushes against bodies -- swinging from side to side.
Angela suddenly stops in the center of the street,
turns...

                           ANGELA

             Something's coming...
She stares at her surroundings with an increasing sense
of dread. Then hears the RUMBLE and TIRES SCREECHING.

                                               (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Angela spins, spots John's BARRACUDA exploding around the
corner. It barrels up the street and slides to a
SQUEALING stop in front of her. Passenger door swings
open.

                           JOHN

             What happened to staying in the
             car?

                           ANGELA

             You were in danger.

                           JOHN

             Well now there's a premonition.
SIRENS crack the air.     Angela jumps in and John PEELS

OUT.





INT. BZR

Balthazar is taking his last breaths when the sound of
WIND filters through the room. He looks up as a shadow
drapes across him. Eyes widen.

                           BALTHAZAR

             One more chance...
Shadow darkens and his decimated form shudders.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             Jesus didn't die from being nailed
             to a cross.




EXT./INT. BARRACUDA - MOVING

John takes a turn at 70 as Angela stares into John's
Bible.

                           JOHN

             He was finished off by a soldier's
             spear.
He points in the Bible at a detailed painting of the
event -- Jesus hanging on the cross -- being pierced by a
soldier's spear. It matches that child's drawing John
removed from the fridge -- now lying on his seat.

                           ANGELA

             I'm Catholic, John -- I know the
             crucifixion story.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                           89.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             Then you know what this spear
             would mean to a demon trying to
             cross over.
She doesn't.

                           JOHN

             The stains on its edges?
Angela looks back at the painting, notes the liquid
flowing from Jesus' wound. Angela can't believe it --

                           JOHN

             Mammon needed divine assistance --
             how's the blood of God's only son?
Angela sits stunned for a moment.

                           ANGELA

             So that's it -- he's got
             everything he needs to escape...

                           JOHN

             Not quite.
                     (glances at her)
             Twins.
Angela gives him a look.       Something in the rearview
mirror catches his gaze.

                             JOHN

             Here we go --
John floors it and Angela glances out the back window,
spots something in the traffic -- bounding over vehicles,
hitting the pavement on all fours --

                             ANGELA

             What is that?

                           JOHN

             A hound on the hunt.
A blur of muscle and bone leaps over cars at incredible
speed -- denting in roofs, CRACKING a WINDSHIELD --
causing general chaos. Cars brake -- SLIDE into each
other. And still this thing keeps coming.

                             JOHN

             Hang on --
BARRACUDA slides into an alley, races toward the other
end.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                        90.





CONTINUED:

Angela looks back, sees their pursuer enter the alley.
It makes huge strides along the walls, defying all manner
of physics.

                            ANGELA

             Impossible.
The beast goes right up the wall and disappears above the
building.

                            ANGELA

             I lost it.
BAM, something lands hard on the roof, denting it a good
foot.
A huge clawed TALON punches into the sheet metal, starts
shredding it right over Angela. Talon thrusts in.
Angela dodges it -- her amulet swinging wildly.
John HITS the BRAKES and the beast flips off the roof and
onto the hood -- right INTO VIEW.
A muscular anomaly with eyes that are unmistakably
Balthazar's. He lashes against the windshield with an
extra appendage. Thank God for safety glass.
He jerks back his embedded talon, pulls the entire
windshield out with it, smashing it on the hood. GLASS
PARTICLES EXPLODE into the car.
John throws the car into a spin, slamming the Barracuda
into several parked cars. Balthazar is uprooted, is
thrown from the car.
Angela looks back, sees Balthazar rolling into traffic.

                            ANGELA

             He's down --

                            JOHN

             He's not down.   Gimme your phone.
Angela pulls out her cellular.

             Yeah, but I'm kind of busy right
             now, John.

                           JOHN

             Dammit, Chaz, I'm trying to save
             my ass here!

             OUT YA WANKERS!!! NOW!!





EXT. LA STREETS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

John heads toward the skyline now -- at 90 mph -- to the
3rd Street Bridge on the horizon.
Angela scans behind them, can't believe her eyes.

                           ANGELA

             He's back.
Here comes Balthazar through traffic on all fours --

Chaz swerves onto the other side of the narrow bridge.
He SCREECHES TO A STOP across the roadway -- opens the
glove box, grabs a velvet-wrapped object and pulls a
glass vial out of it.
Inside flows a phosphorescent green liquid. Chaz jumps
out, runs to the back of the car, pauses when he hears
the sound of a STRAINING ENGINE.
Here comes the topless Barracuda over the bridge's arched
roadway. And what the hell is that running behind it?

                           CHAZ

             Shit -- shit -- shit --

John smacks the wheel, victoriously -- looks over to
Angela who sighs with relief. His expression changes as
he centers on the empty necklace dangling around her
neck.

                           JOHN

             Where's the amulet?
WHAM -- something reaches through the roof hole and JERKS
HER right out of the car.

                           JOHN

Both leap onto the concrete rail, lean over and spot a
HUGE WINGED SHADOW just as it disappears below the
bridge.
Chaz is speechless as he turns to John. This is too
much. John gives him the out he's been waiting for --

                           JOHN

             We're even.
Chaz nods and John leaves him at the rail.   He jumps back
in the BARRACUDA and PEELS OUT.

           And the bridge.

                         MIDNITE

           You're giving this girl way too
           much credit.

                                                         96.





CONTINUED:

Midnite just stares at him.

                           MIDNITE

             It's a fine line that separates a
             hero from a fool.

                           JOHN

             I'll take my chances.

                           MIDNITE

             And taint my establishment with
             your blood? I don't think so.

                           JOHN

             Midnite --

                           MIDNITE

             You know what that device can do
             to the ill-equipped --

                           JOHN

             Midnite --

                           MIDNITE

             -- and even in your most glorious
             days your brain was never your
             most powerful attribute --

                           JOHN

             Where the hell is the chair, you
             dumb shit?!
Midnite just stands there -- his body inflating past it's
seven feet. John knows he went too far.

                           JOHN

             That was the cancer talking, you
             know that, right?

                           MIDNITE

                     (holds up his finger)
             Once.
John nods.




INT. STORAGE AREA

Fluorescents flicker, REVEAL boxes of toilet tissue,
cooking supplies, etc. And sitting in one corner by the
huge power transformer is --

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          97.





CONTINUED:

-- the chair. Heavy wooden monstrosity with straps and
cuffs and the wear of many who sat in it for the last
time. Yeah, it's an electric chair right out of Sing
Sing.

                           JOHN

             What's in your bathroom, a Renoir?

                           MIDNITE

             I have insurance issues.
John clears off the seat, starts to sit.        Midnite blocks
him.

                           MIDNITE

             You haven't surfed in decades.

                           JOHN

             Like riding a bike...
He tries again.     Midnite blocks him again.

                           MIDNITE

             You'll be lucky to reach an
             elemental plane.

                           JOHN

             Then just increase the juice.
John tries again.     Again Midnite stops him.

                           MIDNITE

             In your condition your body won't
             take much.

                           JOHN

             I just need enough rope to find
             her.

                           MIDNITE

             And if you do -- what then?

                           JOHN

             One goddamn problem at a time --
John shoves past him, plops his ass in the huge chair.
His feet dangle off the ground. Midnite stands by, won't
help. So John starts strapping himself in the chair.
His chest, his ankles. One wrist. He obviously can't
strap the other. He looks to the big man.

                           JOHN

             You want me to sign a waiver?

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        98.





CONTINUED:

Midnite sighs -- finally straps the other wrist in --
pulls it TIGHT. Ouch.

                           JOHN

             Hang on, Angela.




EXT. SKY - CLOSE ON ANGELA

moving in a surreal fashion across an evening sky. Below
her the City of Angels sweep past. Her eyes drift open
and widen in horror as she sees beyond reality --




REFLECTION IN HER EYES

The city is ON FIRE. It's a repeat of Isabel's prophetic
vision before she jumped.

                           MIDNITE (V.O.)

             Listen to my voice inside...




INT. MIDNITE'S - STORAGE ROOM

Midnite kneels in front of John who is now handcuffed to
the chair, cables draped from every limb.

                           MIDNITE

             I'll try and guide you out.

                           JOHN

             Try?

                           MIDNITE

             Mammon was forced out of that girl
             when she jumped so unless he found
             a holding vessel to wait in, he
             would have fallen back to Hell.

                           JOHN

             No, he's still here.   I'm sure of it.

                           MIDNITE

             Then watch yourself. He could be
             in anyone out there.
John nods. Midnite lifts a palm of INSECT WINGS in front
of his face.

                           JOHN

             Roach wings? What happened to
             using lilac pedals -- ?

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                           99.





CONTINUED:

Midnite cranks the JUICE on the panel as he BLOWS and John
reacts as if being hit by a blast of wind. His head slams
back against the slats. His skin ripples from the force.
STAY ON his face as the sound of POWER courses through John.

                           MIDNITE

             Peter do caelis, Deus, misere
             nobis. Fili Redemptor mundi,
             Deus, Miserere nobis...
A FLASH turns into a streak behind John's face --
stretching to infinity.

                           MIDNITE (V.O.)

             Find the possessor and the Spear
             will be revealed... find them...
             find them and follow...
The flash whips back TOWARD us and John is suddenly
somewhere else. He looks O.S.




INT. PRISON CHAMBER FROM THE OPEN

FROM that MYSTERIOUS POV, we watch the Prisoner hold the
Spear for the first time. Like before, he turns and
looks behind him where --
John now stands. Watching.      John centers on the Spear in
the Prisoner's hand.




FLASH AHEAD - INT. ISTANBUL AIRPORT

That same MYSTERIOUS POV of the Prisoner in line.      He
turns as he did before and it's --
-- John behind him.     Watching.   Prisoner turns away.




FLASH AHEAD - EXT. LAX TERMINAL - EVENING

MYSTERIOUS POV is ON the Prisoner at the exit doors.        He
looks back, suspiciously, and there's -
John.   Watching.    Prisoner turns, heads to the minivan.




FLASH AHEAD - EXT. EAST L.A. - MYSTERIOUS POV - NIGHT

of a minivan still smoking from a recent impact against a
large iron ENTRANCE GATE. Prisoner is running from it,
glances back --

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                        100.





CONTINUED:

John is there. Watches as the Prisoner enters the
abandoned wing of -- Ravenscar. John reacts. How did he
miss this?




FLASH AHEAD - INT. SLEEP ROOM

Fifty beds with fifty patients. Asleep. The Prisoner
kneels next to one of the beds. John walks over, touches
him and he rocks to the floor. Dead. Body reveals the
Spear on the blanket of the bed.
John reaches out to touch it when the boy BARRY suddenly
SITS UP from under the blanket and grabs him by the
throat. NOTE the boy's BLACKENED FINGERNAILS.
John struggles to pull him off but the boy's grip is
locked tight. John grabs at his hands -- chokes out the
name --

                          JOHN


             MIDNITE!!

John's hands suddenly become MIDNITE'S as his ally pulls
him back into --




INT. MIDNITE'S - STORAGE ROOM

John's face is held tight in the life-saving fingers of
Midnite's grip. John gasps as he comes back -- nods to
Midnite and finally --

                           JOHN

             Ravenscar. The abandoned wing.
             He's in the boy.




EXT. OVER HILLSIDE - FLYING - EVENING

WINGED SHADOW glides across the landscape, sweeps across
manicured grounds and rises to reveal Ravenscar Hospital.




INT. MIDNITE'S OFFICE - LATER

Midnite piles ASSAULT RIFLES, SHOTGUNS, GLOCKS onto a
table.

                           MIDNITE

             You know these won't kill them.
John adjusts the flames of a butane heater under a pan.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         101.





CONTINUED:


                           MIDNITE

             You probably won't even get close
             enough to use them.
In the pan is that RELIGIOUS RELIC he brought from India.
It's now MELTING. Midnite has trouble watching it
dissolve.

                           MIDNITE

             And it's not just the boy.
John coughs, pours the melted gold into several small
casting blocks.

                           MIDNITE

             You better worry about whoever's
             helping him.
John gives the big guy a glance, dips one of the castings
into a pot of water -- HISSSSSS.

                           MIDNITE

             As much as I admire your blind
             faith even in the most dire
             situations -- expecting to just
             waltz into a facility that is
             about to become the floodgate of
             Hell is reaching a bit, even for
             you.
John stops the work, centers on him and Midnite just
knows what he's thinking. Midnite sighs, heavily.

                           MIDNITE

             Well I suppose two fools can die
             just as easily as one.
John almost smiles.

                           MIDNITE

             Hey, you think I'm trusting you to
             save the world?
John taps the casting and out falls a GOLD-TIPPED BULLET.

                           MIDNITE

             But we're going to need more than
             a few magic bullets to get inside.
John centers on the Sparkletts bottles positioned around
the room. Just like John's. Hmmmm...

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                       102.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             That ritual you do with the water,
             can you do more than one bottle at
             a time?
Midnite raises an eyebrow.




EXT. RAVENSCAR - NIGHT

The motorized MAIN GATE is jammed -- opening and closing
on a crashed VAN. The van the Prisoner carjacked. The
abandoned hospital wing stands ominous against a moonlit
night. Vague figures move about near the emergency
entrance.
John's BARRACUDA IDLES up with its headlights off. John
stares out, points up to the WATER TANK -- on the roof.

                              MIDNITE

                        (sighs)
             Figures.




INT. RAVENSCAR - PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM

Therapy machines look like medieval torture devices in
the dimly-lit room. BARRY stands waist deep in a large
hydrotherapy tank inset into the tile floor. His skin is
pale, sickly looking. Obviously containing Mammon takes
its toll. Especially on a child.
His hands are below his waist and now we see they're
lowering a still-unconscious Angela into the water. Her
face floats just above the surface as he buckles
restraining straps around her wrists.




INT. RAVENSCAR - ABANDONED WING

Front glass doors swing open and John and Midnite calmly
strut inside. Stop.
HEAR the O.S. MURMURS of an unseen crowd.
This EMERGENCY ROOM is crammed with people. Lawyers.
Brokers. Soccer moms. Truck drivers. Etc... Most are
crowded in front of a set of double doors.
Room goes dead silent as all eyes lock on our guys.
John steps from Midnite, raises his hands like a riot
cop.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         103.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             Okay -- let's cut the scratch and
             call it a night. Meeting's over.
That's got their attention. As entertainment. A few
chuckle. John is surprised to see Ellie stepping from
the crowd. Still that bundle of sexual energy.

                           JOHN

             Ellie?

                           ELLIE

             Oh, John, you know how much I love
             it on this side. This was just an
             opportunity to make it permanent.

                           JOHN

             You think his son will be any
             different? He'll just turn this
             place into his own Hell and then
             where will you to party, Heaven?

                           ELLIE

             No need to get nasty.

                           JOHN

             Never bothered you before.

                           ELLIE

             I am so going to miss our little
             trysts.
Ellie steps closer.     The crowd starts to close in with
her.

                           JOHN

             I'm sure you will.
John pulls out his lighter, holds it up -- flicks it on.

                           JOHN

             Now turn around and take your
             friends with you.
Can he look more ridiculous?

                           JOHN

             I will deport you.   All of you.
             You know I can.
John steps back up onto a chair, thrusts the lighter
higher --

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        104.





CONTINUED:


                           ELLIE

             Oh, John, this is embarrassing.
             Where is your pride?
-- right under a SPRINKLER HEAD.

                           JOHN

             Go to Hell.
Ellie looks up just as the sprinklers trigger.




SERIES OF SHOTS

Ellie and a room of half-humans -- all looking up as
water sprays from every nozzle. John and Midnite tense
because the first drops have no effect. A beat -- a
SPURT in the waterlines and suddenly -- SHRIEKS fill the
room as half human skin begins to FRY.

                           ELLIE

             Holy water!
Emergency lighting has snapped on -- throwing the room
into a strobing nightmare of action. Flashes of human
skin melting, revealing snippets of the true demons
underneath. It's total pandemonium as their rage is
directed toward the only real humans in the room.
John and Midnite fling their coats open -- draw their
WEAPONS and starts FIRING away at the attacking horde.
Sacred bullets cause major damage -- wounds that ripple
out through demon bodies.
John and Midnite slam back to back -- spinning under the
protective shield of a showering sprinkler head --
shooting at all manner of distorted forms that venture
into the COLUMN OF SPRAY.
One reloads while the other FIRES. It's a hellish form
of a turkey shoot. Nothing sacred, nothing spared.
John goes for the double doors. Midnite covers him --
blows away another two disintegrating demons. Two come
up behind and he spins, takes them down.
JOHN gets to the doors, starts to open them when Ellie
jumps onto his back -- nails digging in.

                           ELLIE

             I'm not going back there!

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                      105.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             We are what we are, Ellie --
John FIRES over his back, loosens her grip. He grabs
hold, shoves her face up into the spray of an overhead
sprinkler head. Legs flail about.
Midnite comes out of the rain -- grabs John.

                           MIDNITE

             Let's go.
John drops Ellie to the floor. No more pretty face -- no
face at all -- yet the screams still come.
John and Midnite get to the doors -- shove through.




INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM

Angela's body and face are completely submerged now. She
comes to, sees Barry above her -- tries to rise but the
boy pushes her head to the bottom, holds it there. Last
bubbles are floating up from her mouth. Barry places his
other hand on her arm, closes his eyes.




INT. CORRIDOR

Holy rain has stopped in here. A fine mist floats in the
air. John and Midnite make their way through. Only
their footsteps on the tile break the stark silence.
Another set of doors is ahead. Before they reach it a
faint shadow crosses in the mist. Both pause, expecting
something to reveal itself. But it doesn't.




INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM

Faint waves undulate Barry's skin -- ripple from his
chest, down his arms and into a submerged Angela. Every
muscle in her body tenses in stark relief.




ANGELA'S POV

Barry's image ripples above her in silence. Room
lighting starts to pulse -- slower and slower and when
it's caught in that dim half-light -- Angela JOLTS and
this time we CROSS OVER INTO --




                                                        106.





PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM HELL

Angela is lying in a bone-dry tank, lifts her head up to
see a room not much different than the one she just left.
Except for the SOUND. That low DRONE RISING IN PITCH --
those DEMONIC SCREECHES scratching at the walls.
And now those INKY splotches begin consuming the color
and light from the walls. Moving in on Angela. Closer
and closer -- whatever's coming is just about on her.

                         MAMMON (O.S.)

          Angela.
Angela SPINS and for a split second comes face to face
with the hideous form of MAMMON. She SCREAMS.




INT. NORMAL PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - REAL TIME

John and Midnite burst into the room, spot Barry standing
in the tank. His hands in the water. On Angela.

                          JOHN

                    (rushing toward him)
          Barry!
Barry looks up, sees the two men rushing toward him.
Guns aimed.

                         JOHN

          Let her up!!   Let her up!!
A beat as John meets Barry's eyes -- realizes he's
staring at a frightened child. Barry backs away as --
-- Angela sits up behind John.    Water rippling off,
straps dangling free.
John turns -- locks on her BLACK EYES.

                         JOHN

          Shit --
John thinks fast -- scans the area and sees every mirror
in the room has been shattered. So much for the quick
fix.
He jumps into the water with her, grabs her face and
pushes her against the tank walls. This is an exorcism
on the fly.

          Amar natash bow basar! Rescind
          from the flesh I command thee --

CONTINUED:

Angela's eyes snap open -- dark and dilated. John sees
it -- clasps a hand over her mouth -- cutting off her air
supply.

                           JOHN

             Back to Hell, asshole --
Her body undulates as Mammon's shape tries to come through.
Pulsating through her arms, her chest -- her face.
Angela BITES into his palm. John recoils. She shoves
him off and John hits the tile hard. Angela jumps from
the tank, pushes past in a blur. John spins to see
Midnite standing right there -- Angela now firmly in his
size-twelve grasp.

                           MIDNITE

                     (to John)
             Finish it.

INTERCUT WITH:





MYSTERIOUS HIGH POV

John coughs, struggles to stand. He tries to cover but
it's obvious his end is nearing. Midnite positions
Angela to face him, braces her arms out from her sides --
crucifixion-style. She tries but can't break free. John
puts a hand to her forehead --

                           JOHN

             Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut
             num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui
             serpentes.

                           JOHN/MIDNITE

             Rescind from the flesh I command
             thee -- Amar natash bow basar!
Angela's body stops fighting. The darkness in her eyes
and fingernails begins to fade. It's working...
Midnite is suddenly JERKED backwards with an agonizing
YELL. Angela is dropped, slips into unconsciousness.
John watches in horror as Midnite's 300-pound frame is
lifted right off the floor by an INVISIBLE GRASP, slammed
into the ceiling, then twisted and thrown with incredible
force against the floor.
Midnite glares at John, tries to speak.     But the words
die on his lips.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          108.





CONTINUED:

Enraged, John scans the empty room, sees a large SHADOW
on the ceiling that doesn't belong to any object.
He holds back a cough long enough to rip up his sleeves
and slams those tattoos together --

                           JOHN

             Into the light I command thee!
             Into the light I command thee!
It takes every ounce of John's life force to keep this
spell alive and when he's about to drop from exhaustion
the shadow is brought fully into the light -- becomes
that familiar shape of WINGS.

                           VOICE OF MAN (O.S.)

             Your ego is astounding.
John strains to see the shadow become the real thing --
the majestic wings of an angel.

                           JOHN

             Gabriel?
John is too weak to even be surprised anymore.

                           JOHN

             Figures...
Gabriel touches down in front of him.       Spear in his hand.

                           JOHN

             And the wicked shall inherit the
             Earth.

                           GABRIEL

             You presume to judge me, John.

                            JOHN

             Betrayal, murder, genocide?    Call
             me provincial.

                           GABRIEL

             I am seeking to inspire humankind
             to be all that was intended.

                           JOHN

             By unleashing Hell on Earth?     Good
             thinking...
Gabriel's wings fold behind as he walks around John.

                           GABRIEL

             You've had it too easy for too
             long.

                           JOHN

             So what's a few thousand years of
             pain, right?

                           GABRIEL

             You never deserved to be blessed.
             You've all been born with a silver
             spoon in your mouth, never really
             appreciating the gift you were
             given so freely -- unconditional
             love from your creator.

                           JOHN

             And that just bugs the shit out of
             you.

                           GABRIEL

             It's not your fault. Like the
             animals you are, you never learn
             unless sufficiently prodded.
             Pleasure has no lasting effect.
             But subject you to pain,
             unpleasantness -- suffering -- and
             you will take notice, you will
             fight to overcome, to earn your
             redemption. That is when you're
             at your best.
Angela's fingernails are starting to darken once again.

                           JOHN

             You're trying to teach us a
             lesson?

                           GABRIEL

             No, I'm giving you the chance to
             rise above the suffering and truly
             earn the love of God.
                     (a beat)
             The road to salvation begins
             tonight. Right now.
John just stares at this rogue angel, centers on the
Spear in his hand. He makes a break for it. Gabriel's
wings beat once.
The GUST BLOWS John through the double doors, back into
the --




                                                       110.





CORRIDOR

-- where he smashes against a mesh-screened window, drops
to the floor in a heap with the other dying carcasses.




PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM

Gabriel turns back to Angela. He approaches her -- his
rippling wings sliding up around her, enveloping her --
pulling her in. Those eyes of his could melt Dracula.




CORRIDOR - JOHN

can't even stand, let alone save the girl.     Or humanity.
It would be so easy to give up. To roll over and die.
But instead, he tries something he hasn't done in a long
time.

                         JOHN

                   (whispering)
           ... I know I'm not one of your
           favorites... I'm not even allowed
           in your house these days... but I
           could use a little attention...
John waits for nothing. His body crumples, his cheek
landing flat against the tile.
Glistening shards of mirror glass lie around him. As he
stares at his reflection in one, he gets the idea.




PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - ANGELA'S EYES

begin to quiver.   The color drains.    Blackness is waiting.




CORRIDOR - JOHN

slides his back up the wall as he reels in that shard of
mirror.




PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - ANGELA'S

posture begins to change. Mammon's form ripples through
her -- starts to push out through her skin. Gabriel
stands behind her, his wings cocooned around her waist.

                         GABRIEL

                   (whispering to her)
           Cross the bridge to your destiny...




                                                     111.





CORRIDOR - JOHN

pulls up his sleeve, exposes his old scar. He pauses a
beat, closes his eyes. STAY ON his face as he makes one
swift SLICE movement.
But he's in a rush here -- makes that same motion across
his other wrist as well.
With both wrists purging his life away, John settles back
into the corner and waits for the inevitable.

                          JOHN

            Hurry...




PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - GABRIEL

reveals the Spear.




CORRIDOR - JOHN

is dying.    Eyes are starting to close as...




PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - GABRIEL

Raises the Spear over Angela's chest.
HEAR the SOUNDS of a million DEMONS inside of her ready
to break free --
He holds the Spear high above her chest -- readies for
the final thrust as --




CORRIDOR

Bulbs flicker as current ramps down and TIME COMES TO A

COMPLETE STOP.

All we're left with is a distant METALLIC DRONE, like the
reverberation of a gong struck a thousand years ago.
John lies in that dim half-light.    Motionless.
Something starts to swirl near him and just like that,
John is no longer alone. Shadow falls over his pathetic
form.

                          SATAN (O.S.)

            The time has come at last to
            collect your soul.

John pries his eyes open...

                             SATAN

             Hello, John.

                             JOHN

             You're early.

                           SATAN

             You're the one show I wouldn't
             miss.

                             JOHN

             So I've heard.
Satan sees John's slit wrists.

                            SATAN

             I didn't think you'd make the same
             mistake twice.
John looks up at him.

                           SATAN

             You didn't, did you?

                           JOHN

             ... so how's your son?

                           SATAN

             And why would that matter to you?

                           JOHN

             ... he's topside...

                             SATAN

             I know.

                             JOHN

             With Gabriel.

                             SATAN

             Your point?

                           JOHN

             He's helping your son create his
             own Hell on Earth...

                           SATAN

             Well, boys will be boys...

                           JOHN

             He has the Spear of Destiny.

CONTINUED:

Satan didn't know that.     Now he's concerned.     He studies
this dying man.

                           SATAN

             This is another one of your cons.

                           JOHN

             Go look for yourself...
Satan is still suspicious.

                           JOHN

             You've waited twenty years for me,
             what's another twenty seconds?
Satan contemplates his remark. Metallic reverberation is
overtaken as SOUND and MOTION ramp back to real time --




PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - THE SPEAR

is about to be thrust into Angela's chest.

                           SATAN (O.S.)

             Gabriel?
Gabriel looks up -- spots him in the room. Gabriel
reacts -- pulls the spear toward her with all his
might -- but Satan is faster -- Angela vanishes and
Gabriel has now pierced dead air.
Satan holds Angela tight -- covering her mouth like John
did. She struggles and the demon inside appears --
reflected in the huge chunks of tank glass scattered on
the floor. Hideous. The real MAMMON.

                           SATAN

             Say goodbye to the sun -- both of
             you.
Mammon SHRIEKS and Gabriel's beautiful wings ignite in

FLAME --


                           GABRIEL

             No!!!!!!!!




CORRIDOR - JOHN

is rocked by a major jolt that shakes the entire building
to its foundation. A moment later --

Satan is back. John looks up, gives him that look -- you
owe me. Satan hates admitting it but knows it's true.

                           SATAN

             So... what do you want?   An
             extension?
John shakes his head, can barely utter a sound...

                           JOHN

             Isabel...

                           SATAN

             What about her?

                           JOHN

             ... let her... go home...

                           SATAN

             You would give up your life so she
             could go to Heaven?
John manages a nod...

                           SATAN

             Fine.
                     (closes, opens eyes)
             It's done.




INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM

ANGELA gasps -- her first real breath's a strain.
Adrenaline rushes through her and she quickly closes her
eyes --




EXT. THAT GORGEOUS SKY

Stretches out BEFORE us. And here come those two swings,
penduluming up in SLOW MOTION.
Young Angela and Isabel share that moment again. But
this time Isabel lets go and jumps out of her swing.
Her body sails up and away, her fingers reaching out for
what seems so close... so close...
Isabel keeps going until she fades into the sky.

                           SATAN (V.O.)

             Time to go.




                                                       115.





INT. CORRIDOR

John relaxes, stops fighting the inevitable. Satan takes
his hand, starts to pull him home but suddenly finds
himself pulling on what seems to be infinite mass. Try
as he might, he can't budge John an inch.
And now John's other hand leaves his side, and as if
weightless, begins to rise toward something above.
No sense in beating around the bush here, John is in the
embrace of God.
Satan sees this and recoils in absolute RAGE --

                        SATAN

          The sacrifice!! No!!!!   THIS ONE

          BELONGS TO ME!!

John's rising hand drifts back down in front of Satan,
the middle finger fully extended. Final straw.
Satan goes rabid -- turns to PURE ENERGY for a split
second. His hands remain on fire.

                        SATAN

          You will live, John Constantine,
          you will live so you'll have the
          chance to prove that your soul
          truly belongs in Hell. You will
          live!
Satan eagerly plunges his blazing hands into John's
body --
John screams in agony. Satan tears through his tissue --
collecting the cancer, then ripping out a mass of
diseased tissue with one vengeful pull. John's final
blood-curdling SCREAM ECHOES over --




INT./EXT. RAVENSCAR

-- through every room. Every corridor. Rippling out
across the ground and finally dissipating in the hills
beyond.




INT. CORRIDOR

On his hands and knees, John takes that first breath.
New lungs fill for the first time. No cough. Not even a
wheeze. Face has renewed color. Wrists have sealed
tight.

John is healed.
He stands, steps back inside the --




PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM

John stops over the body of one seven-foot African
warrior. He stands immobilized, wrecked with emotion.          A
SOUND draws his attention to the one thing that could
cause him even greater rage --

GABRIEL --

is hunched over near a wall. Jagged cartilage stumps
protrude from his back. A pattern of sinew and bone is
burned into the floor behind him. It's all that remains
of his once majestic wings.
John approaches, spots blood dripping from the former angel.
He realizes what this means. Gets a kick out of it.

                            JOHN

             Human...
Gabriel looks up as John retrieves a gun from the wet
floor.

                           JOHN

             You don't deserve to be human.

                           GABRIEL

             Then pass judgment on me now.
John raises the gun -- puts it to Gabriel's forehead.

                            GABRIEL

             Do it.   Seek revenge.   End my
             life.
John's finger nudges the trigger.

                           GABRIEL

             Kill me! Pull the trigger!     Be
             the hand of God!
John pauses, realizes what's happening here...

                           JOHN

             ... and I'll be condemned again...

                            GABRIEL

             Do it!

CONTINUED:

It takes everything John has not to pull that trigger.
He lowers the gun, shaking his head.

                           JOHN

             You're even worthless as bait.
John starts to turn away --

                           GABRIEL

             Deny your true nature today, but
             what of tomorrow, of the tomorrow
             after that? It is only a matter
             of time before you end up right
             back where you belong. It is who
             you are, Constantine. Damned.
John's fist starts behind his back, gains momentum the
entire arc until it ends abruptly against Gabriel's face.
The ex-angel is propelled all the way to the wall --
SLAMS HARD against the concrete. Body crumples on
impact, slides down to the muck. You know this hurt like
absolute hell.

                           JOHN

             That's called pain.    Get used to it.
John turns toward the double doors -- stops cold.
Huddled in the doorway, covered in grime is Angela and
Barry. The experience has obviously left them both
drained.
John walks across the room, kneels down to them.

                           ANGELA

             Thank you, John.
He nods, beat. Wipes a trace of blood off her brow, puts
a hand on Barry's shoulder. HOLD a beat ON this gritty
family tableau.

A HAND comes in, affixes an unseen object to a protruding
rod. Its weight causes it to drop OUT OF FRAME but a
moment later it rises back INTO VIEW and finds a balance.




EXT. AFRICA

JOHN pulls back the protective hood from his face.
Healthy and tan with a new lease on life. He pops a
NICORETTE TABLET, then unwraps rolls of cloth from around
the Spear of Destiny. He drops it in the hole, stares at
it a long beat.




INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - THE ORRERY

The entire mechanism shudders. And now miraculously,
every globe, every moon, every obscure object in this
miniature occult universe begins to rotate in complete
sync.
As it does, the defining object finally slides INTO VIEW.
John's lighter.   ANGELA watches it rotate past, nods in
approval.




EXT. AFRICA

John sighs, finally sweeps mounds of soil over the sacred
relic. He stands, nods. Job done.
A breeze blows past and John senses being watched. He
spins and finds -- nothing. For a hundred miles. He
starts walking.

                        JOHN (V.O.)

          Some people are born to make a
          difference. I had to die. Twice.

                                       MATCH CUT TO:





EXT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY - ANGELA

walking right in step. Something is closing in on her.
A new TAXI pulls up. Chaz is driving. Angela gets in.

                        JOHN (V.O.)

          God does work in mysterious ways.




                                                     119.





EXT. AFRICA

John continues walking as something closes in on him at
incredible speed.

                        JOHN (V.O.)

          Some people like it...
Our view RISES OVER him and gliding across the barren
landscape are the SHADOW of WINGS.

                        JOHN (V.O.)

          Some people don't.




                                         FADE OUT.

          FADE UP ON:
          SPACE. Infinite stars. A TITLE:

          1870. THE ARIZONA TERRITORY.
          We descend past DARK CLOUDS. Violent FLASHES ripple within.
          Thunder blends with DRUMS as we reach a BOX CANYON...

          A BONFIRE -- SILHOUETTED BODIES -- APACHE WARRIORS
          Whirling around the fire -- war paint -- masks and headdresses --
          a RELIGIOUS RITE or CELEBRATION. On the periphery, we FIND...
          A BEAUTIFUL APACHE WOMAN. Softly singing to the even more
          beautiful BABY in her arms as we FOLLOW THEM INTO --
          A TEEPEE. The simple melody of the woman's song as she lays the
          baby on a blanket, gently swaddling it, LOVE in her eyes.
          But.
          The wind starts to HOWL. QRAJ. And then... a BURST OF
          LIGHT through the opening of the teepee -- intense ULTRAVIOLET:
          FWHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSHHss!!!

          THE E IRE TENT IS RIPPED UP INTO THE SKY, LEAVING THE WOMAN AND
          HER BABY-EXPOSED!!!! She SCREAMS -- grabs her child and starts
          to RUN -- CHAOS EVERYWHERE as the tribe scatters in TERROR --
          Suddenly -- Apaches are getting YANKED INTO THE AIR by some
          superior force -- PLUCKED savagely into the light, GONE -- as we
          WHIP AROUND the horror show of SCREAMING, DISAPPEARING INDIANS --
          And now -- A DEAFENING SHRIEK AS STRANGE DOMED OBJECTS HURTLE

          DOWN, CRASHING LIKE COMETS TO THE CANYON FLOOR AND CRUSHING

          FLEEING PEOPLE.
          Impossibly, the objects are STEEL MACHINES. BELLY VENTS snap
          open and DRILL CONES drop out -- jagged teeth CHURN TO LIFE --
          faster -- FASTER -- as the drills begin CHEWING INTO THE GROUND.
          THE WOMAN -- staggering back in SHOCK and AWE -- clings to her
          baby for one final SCREAM and -- BLACK. Over which we read:
          C--() ... .-4ï¿½_ s A N D A

          EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY

          burning sun FLARES LENS, beating down on... A MAN.
          Lying in the barren DESERT. Out cold. Handsome... but HARD.
          We'll call him THE MAN IN BLACK, the color of his dirty clothes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          A PINK TONGUE LICKS HIM. The man STARTS AWAKE -- to find a
          MONGREL DOG over him. Mangy. But sweet.
          COUGHING, the man stumbles up. How'd he get here? And where
          the hell i.: here? And -- OWWW. A GASH in his side...
          .. part of the wound oddly SEARED. He winces. Trying to solve
          this painful puzzle. Something GLINTS on his wrist:
          A STEEL BRACELET. No clasp to pull it off. He touches the
          surface -- TSSS -- SHIT -- It's HOT!
          And there's a BLACK STETSON on the ground. The Man grabs it to
          shield his eyes... but STOFS:
          A WORN PHOTOGRAPH in the inner brim. A WOMAN. Young,
          beautiful. SMILING.
          The Man stares: does he KNOW this woman? is this even HIS hat?
          The dog BARKS ALERT. The man turns -- QUICK -- his hand reaches
          toward his hip on INSTINCT but there's no holster. NO GUNS.

          THREE RIDERS ON HORSEBACK ARE COMING OVER THE RISE:
          THE CLAIBORNE BROTHERS -- WES, MOSE and LUKE. Dusty and tough.
          Wes gallops right up to our Man, gives him the once over --

                         WES CLAIBORNE
          Howdy.

                         (NO RESPONSE)
          We're riding towards Absolution. You
          know how far west we are?
          The Man's got NO IDEA what he's talking about.

                         LUKE CLAIBORNE
          Maybe he's a dummy.
          Wes hops off his horse, right in The Man's face now --

                         WES CLAIBORNE
          There a reason you don't wanna answer my
          question, friend?
          And now, Mose nods to the BRACELET on The Man's wrist --

                         MOSE CLAIBORNE
          Wes, he's got iron on his wrist... and
          he's been shot.

                         LUKE CLAIBORNE
          Bet he's a chain jumper.
          Luke spurs his horse behind him -- The Man's SURROUNDED.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         LUKE
          If he escaped, there'll be a bounty.
          Let's bring him with us.
          Wes nods as he slides a SAWED-OFF DOUBLE-BARREL from his back
          scabbard. COCKS both barrels. The dog GROWLS --

                         WES CLAIBORNE
          Not your lucky day, Stranger -- turn
          round and start walking.
          But The Man doesn't move. The Claibornes share glances. Wes
          steps forward -- RAISING HIS RIFLE --

          WES CLAIBORNE (CONT'D)
          Dead or alive, no difference. I said

                         WALK OR--
          THE MAN MOVES, A MECHANISM OF BRUTAL VIOLENCE -- YANKS the rifle
          forward as BLAMI -- shot goes WILD -- suddenly the gun's in THE
          MAN'S HANDS -- BLAXI Wes is BLOWN backwards, HOLE IN HIS CHEST!
          As Hose draws his Enfield, The Man FLIPS the rifle again --
          SLAM! MOSE FLIES OFF HIS SADDLE as The Man rolls -- UNDER
          Luke's horse -- GRABBING Luke's ankle -- suddenly Luke's FLAT on
          his back -- BREATHLESS, staring UP at the double-barrel:

                         LUKE CLAIBORNE
          -- P-please, God -- d-don't --
          -- The Man PULLS the trigger but CLICK! The rifle's EMPTY.
          Luke's RELIEF is short as The Man SLAMS the gun-butt down,
          knocking him out cold. And ALL of this took about ten seconds.
          This man is a cold-blooded KILLER. But somehow... he didn't
          seem to KNOW that. CONFUSION. Drops the rifle, looks down at
          his hands... covered in BLOOD. And the BODIES in his wake.
          The WIND loosens a piece of PAPER from Wes's jacket. It DANCES
          on the breeze -- flattens against The Stranger's foot. He picks
          it up, BLOODY FINGERPRINTS on what we now see is a TELEGRAM --

          "TO FORT STANTON -- STOP -- ABSOLUTION TOWNSHIP BESIEGED BY

          OUTLAWS -- STOP -- FIFTY DOLLARS FOR ANY MAN WITH A GUN -- STOP

          -- ABSOLUTION AWAITS -- STOP"

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          (a hoarse whisper)
          Absolution...

          SLAM TO MOMENTS LATER:
          With a HYA! The Man sends two horses GALLOPING, mounts the
          third, wincing at that gash in his side. Starts to trot off...
          sees the dog following...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

          THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
          Get outta here. Leave me alone.
          But the dog keeps following. Like they're FRIENDS now. The man
          turns away dismissively as we BOOM UP to reveal the WIDE OPEN
          VALLEY below... and a SPECK within it that is:

          EXT. TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY

          A CROOKED SIGN: "ABSOLUTION." The town is dismal and forgotten.
          Crumbling buildings blistered by sun. The Man rides in --
          dehydrated, the wound DRAINING him.
          His eyes fall on the first building he sees... A CHURCH.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY

          BAM! The door flies open and VOTIVE CANDLES FLICKER. The Man
          looks at the dog and says --

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Stay.
          The dog sits by the door as The Man enters -- EMPTY -- he's
          moving -- into a small kitchen area -- bottle of whiskey --
          uncorks it with his teeth -- drinks -- pours some on the wound --
          then A PISTOL COCKS behind him --
          Meet MEACHAM, town preacher, a tough, wash-foot Baptist:

                         MEACHAM
          Palms to heaven, Friend.
          The Man freezes. Turns up his hands.

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Been shot.

                         MEACHAM
          Only two kinds of men get shot --
          criminals and victims.
          (steps forward; hard)
          Which one're you?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          don't know.
          Meacham hears the HONESTY in his voice. Knows a lost soul when
          he sees one. Lowers his gun, softening...

                         MEACHAM
          Got a name, son?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Don't know that either.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         MEACHAM
          What do you know?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          (a beat; then)
          ... English.
          Off Meacham, INTRIGUED -- we CUT TO:

          INT. CHURCH RECTORY - LATER

          A CANDLE FLAME -- a NEEDLE passing through it -- it's LATER and
          Meacham's studying The Man's wound:

                         MEACHAM
          Odd wound. Looks... cauterized.
          (off The Man's look)
          Means somethin' burned it half closed.
          The Man just stares. News to him. And now, as Meacham leans
          over the wound, the METAL CROSS around his neck begins to
          twitch... lifting ever so SLIGHTLX off his chest -- towards the
          strange BRACELET on the Man's wrist. Meacham reacts --

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          Nice trick. That some kinds... magnet?
          The Man looks at him -- "What the hell is a 'magnet'?!?"
          Meacham shrugs it off, readies the needle --

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          Try'n hold still.
          He pokes the hot needle through the wound -- The Man winces
          slightly, but bears the pain.

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          Where'd you ride in from?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          West. Woke up in the desert.
          Looking up at the sun like I'd been
          dropped outta the sky.

                         MEACHAM
          Seems I remember a story about that
          happening once... fella by the name of
          Lucifer.

                         (GRINS)
          How 'bout I just call you "Luke," for
          short.
          But TheMan's distracted by his REFLECTION in a cracked mirror:
          his own face unfamiliar. Meacham nods towards The Man's HANDS --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          That blood yours or somebody else's?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Three men rode up. Drew on me.

                         (STILL CONFUSED)
          My hands... moved on their own.

                         MEACHAM

                         (A BEAT)
          Anything else you wanna confess to while
          you got my attention?
          And The Man senses somehow that, ygg, there is... but:

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Everything that happened before I woke
          up...
          (shakes his head)
          It's gone.

                         MEACHAM
          Well. Too bad. Can't absolve you for
          your sins if you don't recall 'em. That
          bein' said...
          Meacham looks up, eyes twinkling. This is not a fire n'
          brimstone preacher. This is a guy who GETS IT --

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          I seen bad men do good things and good
          men do bad things. Whether you end up in
          heaven or hell... it's not God's plan...
          it's yours.

                         (BEAT)
          You just got to remember what it was.
          The Man considers. Darkly --

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          What if I don't want to remember?

                         MEACHAM

                         (BEAT; GRINS)
          Then you're probl'y goin' to hell.
          On cue -- SMASH!!! The stained glass window EXPLODES as a
          MOLOTOV COCKTAIL hurtles into the church. FIRE spreads around
          the pews -- MEACHAM ACTIVATES -- tears curtains off the
          confessional and uses them to STAMP OUT the fire --

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          Dammit -- it's Dolarhyde's men!
          WHOOPS and HOLLERS and GUNSHOTS outside! The Man whirls to see
          A DOZEN MEN ON HORSEBACK, marauding through town --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

          EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Their leader is PERCY DOLARHYDE, a cocky, hot-tempered bastard --
          he ignites another Molotov, hurls it at the CLAIMS OFFICE --

                         PERCY

          THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM MY FATHER! ONLY

          CLAIM TO LAND AROUND HERE'S THE ONE WITH
          HiS NAME ON IT!
          The gang rides down Main Street, HOOTING -- Percy cocks another
          Molotov, aiming for the SALOON --
          But one of his men, half-Apache NAT COLORADO, shouts:

                         NAT COLORADO
          Percy! N2t the saloon!

                         PERCY
          Why the goddamn hell not?!

                         NAT COLORADO
          Cause your dady said so.
          Something LOADED in the way he emphasizes "daddy." Percy GLARES
          -- strange RESENTMENT between them. With a growl, Percy GALLOPS
          OFF, chucks the flaming bottle onto the CHURCH STEPS:

          INT. MEACHAN'S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

          Meacham finishes putting out the fire, grabbing a couple
          blankets as he moves past The Man --

                         MEACHAM
          You wanna help or are you just gonna
          stand there and burn?!

          EXT. CHURCH - PORCH - CONTINUOUS

          FRIGHTENED TOWNSPEOPLE run for the sanctuary of the church,
          Meacham SWATS OUT the fire on the steps --

                         MEACHAM
          All right, folks -- don't panic! Get
          inside and you'll be fine... C'mon...
          Meacham tosses The Man one of the blankets, nods across the
          street to the GENERAL STORE which is just STARTING to burn --

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          Put it out before it gets goin'!
          ON THE MAN, not sure how he suddenly became the damn fire
          brigade, but HUSTLING across the street to --

          THE GENERAL STORE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.
          WHIPS open the blanket, beats at the flames advancing toward the
          roof -- PUTS THE FIRE OUT as the door FLIES OPEN and out steps:
          A KID. 11. Rough n' tumble. And right now, mouth full of
           LICORICE. Two FULL JARS of CANDY in his hands. OOPS:

                         KID
          Just tryin' to save the candy.
          (SWALLOWS, worried now)
          You one of my Pa's hired guns?
          Before he can answer, HOOFBEATS behind them -- and here's PERCY.
          He yanks the reins, pulls his REVOLVER on our Man --

                         PERCY
          Who the hell're yam?
          Whatever the opposite of Love At First Sight is, THIS is it:

                         THE MAN
          Nobody.

                         PERCY
          Nobody is right. You think you can just
          collect your fifty dollars and ride off?
          You signed up for the wrong side, boy.
          The kid's scared. The Man ISN'T, despite the gun in his face:

                         PERCY (CONT'D)
          Tell you what. You get down on your
          knees and kiss my boot.
          The Man's eyes narrow --

                         PERCY (CONT'D)
          You do that and I'll let you run back to
          wherever the hell you came from so you
          can tell whoever you see...
          (cocks his gun)
          Absolution belongs -tg..th-e- 1Dolar es.

                         THE MAN
          You want me to kiss your boot?
          Percy extends his boot just INCHES from The Man's face:

                         PERCY
          Tongue's just fine if you're feelin'
          amorous. Don't hold ba --
          THWIP! The Man YANKS Percy's boot off his foot in one quick
          move and KWHAM!!!1 WINGS IT RIGHT INTO PERCY'S FACE!
          Percy FLIES off the HORSE -- The Man grabbing his rifle -- the
          moment Percy lands, it's STICKING into his NECK:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         THE MAN
          Kiss this, you sonofa --

          NAT COLORADO (O.S.)

          -- PUT IT DOWN !
          -- Nat Colorado gallops around the corner, SHOTGUN RAISED.

                         PERCY
          Goddamnit, Nat -- SHOOT HIM!!!
          -- but The Man yanks Percy up by his collar, using him as a
          SHIELD between himself and Colorado. Eerily calm --

                         THE MAN
          Wherever you came from? Go back.
          Colorado knows he's dealing with a PROFESSIONAL. MORE GANG
          MEMBERS ride up, surprised -- a dirty outlaw, GREAVEY, barks:

                         GREAVEY
          Sheriff's right behind us, Nat!

                         PERCY
          You goddamned shitheels! Don't you even
          THINK about leavin' me!!!!
          Colorado -- DECISION -- doesn't take long -- glares at The Man --

                         NAT COLORADO
          Be seeing you.

                         THE MAN
          Look forward to it.
          With that, Nat spurs his horse -- YA! The others follow him as
          he RIDES HARD out of town. Percy growls at The Man --

                         PERCY
          You are a dead man. You hear me? So
          help me God I will kill you my--
          DM! The Man's SMASHES Percy's skull with the gun, knocking him
          OUT COLD, as LAWMEN approach on horseback --

                         KID
          FA! He caught Percy Dolarhyde!
          SHERIFF KYLE TAGGART rears up on his horse. Tall, dark and
          handsome despite a SADNESS in his eyes, already dismounting:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Emmett -- you all right?
          The Kid (now EMMETT) strides towards his father excitedly:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         EMMETT

          a-f lap jack- then-stared-down-Nat-Colorado-
          like-he-wasn't-even-scared!!!!
          Taggart turns to The Man now, cautious, but grateful --

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Pardon my boy, mister. He can be
          excitable.
          (puts out his hand)
          Kyle Taggart.
          The Man shakes Taggart's hand. A beat. Then --

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          . Luke.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Well I'm in your debt, Luke. Tune of
          fifty dollars, actually.
          (off The Man's look)
          Our advert? The telegram?
          The Man NODS -- Oh, RIGHT.

           SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          Could use a man like you in case any of
          'em come back...

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          -- I'm just passing through.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Fair enough. You don't mind spending the
          night, bank opens in the morning... I'll
          get you your money then.
          (nods down the street)
          Saloon's got rooms. You just tell Maria
          I sent you.
          The Man tips his hat, nods to Emmett (still STARSTRUCK), turns
          to go. Taggart furrows his brow as the DOG scampers after him.

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          You here with the prospector woman?
          The Man stops. Intrigued. Turns back --

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          woman?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Yup. Real looker. Came into town
          yesterday with that there dog. She a
          friend of yours?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          ON THE MAN. His first real LEAD.

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Maybe.
          And as The Man heads off, we HOLD ON TAGGART, his spidey-sense
          tingling that all is not RIGHT with this...

                         DEPUTY WADE
          Somethin' wrong, Kyle?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          What's that French sayin' where you swear
          you seen someone before?

                         DEPUTY WADE
          Don't speak French.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          No... you sure's hell don't.
          Taggart takes one last look at The Man departing as we CUT TO:

          EXT. CATTLE RANGE - MAGIC HOUR

          300 head of CATTLE under a blood red sky -- BOOM DOWN to THREE
          RANCH HANDS by a fire. One's drinking liberally from a BOTTLE;
          call him ROY CLANTON. The other two trade glances, nervous:

                         RANCH HAND #1
          Should take it easy there, Pal --

                         RANCH HAND #2
          Mr. Dolarhyde don't like it when we drink
          on the job.

                         ROY CLANTON
          I don't give a damn what he don't like --
          gotta sit here and babysit a damn herd of
          cattle. Dolarhyde ain't gonna do squat.
          (rises; grabs his

                         CROTCH)
          Gotta see a man about a buffalo...
          He lets out a big BURP and stumbles off behind a ridge. More
          THUNDER. Something doesn't feel right. A sudden WHOOSH and --

          A COW'S PULLED INTO THE AIR BEHIND THEM BY SOME INVISIBLE FORCE,
          JUST LIKE THE APACHES IN OUR OPENING! Flies STRAIGHT UP, out of
          FRAME. Its PLAINTIVE MOO blending into all the others:

                         RANCH HAND #1
          You hear that?

                         RANCH HAND #2
          Hear what?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.
          ANOTHER COW zips up from the herd behind them. And ANOTHER.
          MANY OF THE SWSSHS. The men slowly turn toward the sound as --

          ALL AT ONCE, HUNDREDS OF COWS FLY OFF INTO THE SKY!

                         RANCH HAND #1

          SWEET JESUS!!!

          THE DARKNESS EXPLODES WITH EERILY BRILLIANT BLUE LIGHT! THE MEN

          SCREAM AS THEY'RE ENGULFED IN IT AND --
          ROY CLANTON -- comes RUNNING back up the hill, pulling up his
          pants as the light DISAPPEARS -- to find the men GONE. So are
          the COWS. PULL BACK... he's ALL THAT'S LEFT in the open range.

          INT. GOLD LEAF SALOON - NIGHT

          THE BATWING DOORS SWING OPEN: The Man In Black enters with the
          dog, tips his hat to a couple WHORES. They GRIN, liking what
          they see. RANCH HANDS drink their pay. Behind the bar, a MAN
          and WOMAN argue. DOC and MARIA; she's a buxom Mexican beauty;
          he's 300 roly-poly pounds of ANXIOUS CASTILIAN JEALOUSY:

                         DOC
          -- I know you are, don't lie to me!

                         MARIA
          How many times do we have to do this,
          Arturo? J. love you.

                         DOC
          Really? Do you?!?
          (holds up a POCKETWATCH)
          I found this in our bed! And I don't
          k3 Vg. a watch, Maria. I can't AfjQrd a
          watch because y insisted we buy this
          saloon!
          She looks at him SQUARELY -- yes, some SECRET withheld. As The
          Man In Black reaches the bar, he's Maria's EXCUSE to end this:

                         MARIA
          We have customers.
          And MOVES off. Doc stomps toward the exit -- sees EMMETT at the
          back of the bar stealing sips of BEER from left-behind glasses:

                         DOC

          AFUERA! ADULTS ONLY!!!
          Emmett RUNS OUT. The Man sits beside an old cuss named ATTICUS.
          The dog heels at The Man's feet, eyes a STEAK on Atticus' plate:

                         ATTICUS
          That mutt makes a move for my steak, I'll
          drill him down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         MARIA
          Shut up, Atticus. This is the man who
          took out Percy Dolarhyde.
          Atticus grumbles and goes back to eating, but not before
          sweeping his duster aside to show the GUN in his holster. Maria
          rolls her eyes, sets a GLASS in front of The Man, who nods:

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          I'm looking for a woman.
          She gestures to the WHORES --

                          MARIA
          What kind?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          This kind.
          He removes the PHOTO from inside his hat. The one of the WOMAN.

                         MARIA
          Never seen her before. But she is
          beautiful.
          (pours him whiskey; then
          one for herself)
          Here's to you finding her, Senor.
          ON THE MAN. Not exactly sure he WANTS to. But they CLINK
          glasses, knock 'em back. Maria pours him another:

                         MARIA (CONT'D)
          You have any idea what kind of mess you
          just stepped into?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          No. But I figured I'd be safe in here
          seein' as how that boy I tossed off his
          horse didn't wanna burn your saloon.
          Maria's eyes go down. Somehow GUILTY. But then:

                          - -

                         MARIA
          It's not the boy you should worry about.

                         (OMINOUS)
          It's his papa.

          EXT. RANCH - NIGHT

          POV: UPSIDE DOWN, A MAN, surrounded by his RANCH HANDS -- his
          FACE just out of the light, hat brim lowered under an oil lamp:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Name's Woodrow Dolarhyde. I'm what you
          might call, the Tall Hog at the trough.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.
          His face comes INTO light: 50's, tailored finery, patent leather
          Wellington boots that bespeak wealth. HARD. Exudes POWER:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          You're Roy, right? Clanton, is it? Been
          working for me two weeks now, and I
          haven't had the pleasure.
          Our POV belongs to ROY CLANTON, the ranch hand from the cow
          abductions. TERRIFIED -- his arms and legs TIED TO THE SADDLES
          OF TWO HORSES, kicking dirt in front of Dolarhyde's RANCH HOUSE:

                         CLANTON
          Mr. Dolarhyde, I... I swear I didn't

                         STEAL YOUR--
          -- a VIOLENT "SSST" from Dolarhyde JOSTLES the horses --
          STRETCHING Roy tight enough to SNAP -- he SCREAMS --

                         DOLARHYDE
          Best not to interrupt me, Roy, makes the
          horses skittish.

                         (THEN)
          You partial to history? Here's a primer,

                         LISTEN CLOSE:
          He pulls out a WHIP, gripping it by its STERLING SILVER HANDLE.
          Starts CIRCLING the horses as he lets the whip UNFURL:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          Following the War Of Northern Aggression
          -- what some ironically refer to as the
          "Civil" War -- came a prodigious nation-
          wide market for beef. Cowtowns sprang up
          all along these prairies, Roy; populated
          by enterprising young drovers -- among
          'em, my daddy, Jeremiah Dolarhyde. Sold
          six of his gold teeth and a sword gifted
          to him by Robert E. Lee for twenty of the
          scrawniest Longhorns you ever saw -- then
          turned 'em into the fattest herd West of
          the Chisholm Trail.
          (stops: the WHIP)
          Watched him work this lash, driving those
          steer til his fingers bled... but what
          good's a whip without a herd, Roy?
          And slowly, torturously, SWEEPS the whip tip in the dirt...

                         ROY CLANTON
          Mr. Dolarhyde, Sir, you gotta believe me
          -- I went to take a piss and and -- saw a
          light in the sky -- blue -- and when I
          ran back the cows and fellas were gone!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         DOLARHYDE
          The sky. Opened up. And took my cows.
          Incoming HOOFBEATS -- Dolarhyde looks up to see COLORADO and the
          rest of the GANG returning from Absolution.
          A WOMAN emerges from the servant's quarters. APACHE. 50's.
          Beautiful. As the men REAR, Nat Colorado MEETS EYES with her.
          A relationship we don't understand yet as Dolar strides up --

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          Where's Percy?

                         NAT COLORADO
          Jail. Sheriff locked him up.
          Dolar darkens. Unsheathes a KNIFE. Looks down at Roy:

                         DOLARHYDE
          When're these people gonna lgarn?
          He STABS the knife down... SLICING the rope tethered to Roy's
          FEET. His lower body SLUMPS to the ground, he breathes a SIGH:

                         ROY CLANTON

                         THANK Y--
          Dolar SLAPS the horse's rump, to which Roy's UPPER TORSO is
          tied; it GALLOPS off, dragging a SCREAMING ROY into the night.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Everyone saddle up. Got us a sheriff to
          kill.
          As he MOVES OFF, Dolarhyde's eyes go to the Apache Woman.
          Something passes between them. She seems CONCERNED.

                         NAT COLORADO
          Wasn't the sheriff, got him caught. It
          was a stranger.
          That STOPS Dolarhyde. He turns back, face dark:

                         DOLARHYDE
          ... What stranger?

                         NAT COLORADO
          Usually a man gives off a scent. Where
          he's been. What he's done.

                         (STILL SPOOKED)
          He didn't have one.

          OFF DOLARHYDE, EYES BURNING --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

          INT. SHERIFF TAGGART'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          A BULLET, in close up, twirling between the thumb and forefinger
          of SHERIFF TAGGART. Boots up on his desk, TROUBLED.
          Deputy Wade pours himself a cup from a TIN POT OF COFFEE:

          DEPUTY CHARLIE WADE
          Percy wouldn't've come in shooting
          without his daddy's say-so, Kyle. You
          best get ready for a war 'cause that's
          what's comin'.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Tomorrow we ride the little shit up
          Phoenix way, turn him over. Dolarhyde's
          got a beef, he can take it up with the
          6th cavalry.
          Taggart's on his feet, grabs his JACKET off the door --

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          Goddamn tired of this... fatass rancher
          scaring good people off their lan--
          He STOPS. Something catches his eye on the posting board.
          YANKS a piece of paper off, a mixture of CONFUSION and CONCERN

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          Sonofabitch.
          WHAT DOES HE SEE? Before we get a chance to KNOW --

          EXT. SALOON - NIGHT

          EMMETT'S FACE rises into frame, peering into the saloon from
          below a windowsill. Sees THE MAN IN BLACK at the bar as ---

          INT. SALOON - NIGHT

          -- he SLUGS back a shot, the dog at his feet, still eyeing that
          steak on Atticus' plate. The Man points to his GLASS:

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Another.

                         MARIA
          You drink like a man who wants to forget.

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          (haunted; the irony)
          Other way round.
          The dog WHINES AGAIN for the steak. Atticus SLAMS down his
          silverware. Draws his GUN --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         ATTICUS
          You got three seconds to get your dog
          outta here or I blow his balls off.

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          (without a blink)
          Not my dog.

                         ATTICUS
          Q=... two...
          -- and just before "three"... CA-CLICK. Atticus FREEZES,
          because there's a RIFLE BARREL at the back of h,iS head now:

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Give you odds you don't get to 'three.'
          RACK TO FIND the person holding the rifle is A WOMAN.
          Beautiful. EXOTIC. Dressed in leather. Meet ELLA SWENSON.
          ON THE MAN IN BLACK. Can't help himself. immediate and
          undeniable CHEMISTRY. But she pays him no mind -- makes a PSST
          sound and the dog snaps to her side. Atticus uncocks his gun,
          slowly slides it back in the holster --

                         ATTICUS
          I was just havin' some fun, Miss --

                         ELLA
          Give- him, the steak.
          Atticus HESITATES, angry at the humiliation. Ella PRESSES THE
          GUN HARDER against his neck, lowering him -- and his plate -- to
          the floor. Right in front of the dog, who GROWLS --

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          Now say you're sorry.

                         ATTICUS
          (biting his tongue)
          I'm-- sorry.

                         ELLA
          His name's 'Happy.'
          HappyBARES HIS TEETH. INCHES from Atticus' face

                         ATTICUS
          I'm sorry... 'Happy.'

                         ELLA
          Alright then.
          (lowers her rifle)
          You're right. That was fun.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.
          -- Atticus scrambles back to his feet and OUT the door, as Ella
          looks at the Man In Black:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          What're you doing with my dog?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          I was hoping you could tell me.

                         ELLA
          The hell're you talking ab--?
          WRIST BRACELET. Surprise and REVELATION:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          Where... did you get that?
          Before he can answer, SHERIFF TAGGART enters, along with DEPUTY
          WADE (carrying a SHOTGUN), and 5 other deputies. They move
          cautiously to THE MAN, like he's a powder keg about to go off...

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Hey there, "Luke." Mind following me
          down to the office so we can have us a
          chat...?

          THE MAN IN BLACK

                         (CONFUSED; ALERT)
          What for?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          All due respect, I'm the law, mister.
          That's what for.
          The men LOCK EYES:

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Tell you what, Sheriff. How about you
          keep the fifty dollars you owe me and I
          just walk outta here like we. never met?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Because we did meet.
          ON ELLA. For reasons we're not sure of, the idea of The Man
          leaving ALARMS her. All the Gunslingers' hands are POISED by
          holsters. The Man stays preternaturally COOL:

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          L can't be accountable for what happens
          if they draw on me.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          And what's gonna happen?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Best you don't find out.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Now why'd you have to go and say that?
          Taggart gives a nod and the men start to CONVERGE --

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          (low; genuine plea)
          Don't.
          But Charlie makes a MOVE and The Man SLAMS his head into a pole
          -- the NEXT GUNMAN reaches for his pistol -- The Man PUNCHES his
          THROAT -- SLAMS the third into a bench -- The FOURTH straight
          down on the Faro table --
          TAGGART levels his REPEATER -- but The Man just GRABS the barrel
          as Taggart FIRES a ROUND into the ceiling -- now the rifle's in
          THE MAN'S HANDS and just before he PULLS THE TRIGGER on Taggart:
          HE SEES EMMETT AT THE WINDOW. About to watch his father's
          MURDER... and The Man LOWERS the gun:

          THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
          I told you, I don't wanna hurt anyb--
          CRACK! The butt of a PISTOL WHIPS the side of his SKULL! The
          Man DROPS as we REVEAL who just knocked his ass OUT:
          ELLA! Taggart draws a gun and pins The Man, whipping out that
          piece of paper he pulled from his office...

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Yup -- looks just like him.

          NOW WE IT'S A WANTED POSTER WITH THE MAN'S FACE ON IT:

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          "Jake Lonergan. Scourge a' The
          Territories. Wanted Dead or Alive."
          And The Man... now forever known as JAKE... stares WOOZILY into
          his OVERTURNED HAT... the photo tucked inside of the BEAUTIFUL
          WOMAN... her image goes BLURRY... then mil{:

                         AND WHAM:

          MEMORY FLASHCUTS1 STROBELIXE IMAGES --
          1.) A tilted, handmade trail sign: "SAGUARO PASS."
          2.) We're in a CABIN somewhere. BLINDING ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT
          EXPLODES INTO THE CABIN, against which a DEMONIC SILHOUETTE
          appears -- it looks like an INDIAN IN FULL-FEATHER HEADDRESS --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.
          3.) A WOMAN'S FACE -- THE WOMAN FROM JAKE'S PHOTOGRAPH -- she
          looks at us and SCREAMS --
          4.) Now we're someplace VERY DARK -- a cave? As some kind of
          TERRIFYING OCULAR PROBE lowers right in front of our eyes --
          5.) Now we're RUNNING through the cave -- ESCAPE -- BREATHING
          HARD -- a LIGHT at the end of the tunnel -- BLINDING SUN hits us
          as we emerge -- our eyes ADJUST to see:
          6.) A STRANGE ROCK FORMATION on the rim of a canyon -- like a
          STONE TOWER pointing to heaven as the SUN WHITEWASHES US TO:

          INT. JAIL CELL - PRE-DAWN

          JAKE'S EYES OPEN and he GASPS AIR! His POV: a FACE comes into
          FOCUS -- PERCY DOLARHYDE. GRINNING at him from the next cell:

                         PERCY
          You're a dead.
          Jake sits up. Woozy. Blinking back to reality.

                         PERCY (CONT'D)
          My daddy's comin' for me, Boy. You're
          gonna end up another dead shitheel under
          his spurs. I am gonna watch you suffer
          for a long, long --
          Jake moves LIGHTNING QUICK -- reaching through the bars,
          GRABBING PERCY'S COLLAR, YANKING FORWARDS -- SLAMMING Percy's
          head into the bars, KNOCKING hIM OUT COLD AGAIN. Percy DROPS.

                         JAKE
          Shut up.
          Jake sits back on his cot, rubbing his still-throbbing head.

          EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - JAIL - CONTINUOUS

          A PRISON WAGON pulls up in front of the Sheriff's office, along
          with Taggart's GUNMEN on horseback. ELLA takes frame as the men
          dismount and head into the office -- she pursues DEPUTY WADE
          with a real sense of PURPOSE:

                         ELLA
          I need to see Lonergan. It's important.

                         DEPUTY WADE
          'Fraid not, Miss -- we're preppin' him
          for transport.
          And pushes PAST her, into the office with the men. HOLD on Ella
          -- dammit, she NEEDS to find a way in there.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

          INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - JAIL CELL - CONTINUOUS

          A KEY in the LOCK as the cell door OPENS: Sheriff Taggart, Wade,
          the gunmen. GLARING at Jake, then noticing Percy --

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          What happened to him?

                         JAKE

                         (DEADPAN)
          Man walked into a bar.
          Taggart shakes his head as Charlie and a deputy unlock Percy's
          cell, CUFF HIM, drag him out. Taggart points to Jake:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Step back against the wall there. Move
          and I shoot you dead.

                         JAKE
          (as he does)
          You should've let me go.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Yeah, I should've shot you in your knee.
          You put down six of my deputies.

                         JAKE
          Six was all you had.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Hell, they're gonna love you in Phoenix.

                         JAKE
          Yeah? What's in Phoenix?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          What you got comin', Jake Lonergan.
          Taggart reaches into his shirt, pulls out a pair of GLASSES.
          Slips them on his nose. Takes out that WANTED poster and reads:

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          Aggravated banditry, 17 counts, Forgery,
          Blackmail, Hijacking, injurious use of a
          cattle prod, Arson, Incitement of
          Whorehouse Riot, and Trespassing with
          intent to deflower. You're also leader
          of a gang of outlaws includin' Creek
          Johnson and Bull McCade, which makes you
          accessory to every law they broke too.

                         JAKE
          (after a long BEAT:)
          That it?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Saved the best for last... 'Murder.'
          That LANDS on Jake. Wondering if this is TRUE. Evenly --

                         JAKE
          It say who I killed?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Prostitute outta Mojave, name of Alice
          Wills.
          Taggart rises, removes Jake's BLACK STETSON from a hook on the
          wall, pulls that PHOTOGRAPH OF THE WOMAN from the inner brim:

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          If I were a bettin' man, I'd say this
          would be Ms. Wills, would it not?
          Jake just stares, CONFUSED. SHAKEN.

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          They found her dead in a cabin round
          Saguaro Pass, twenty miles west of here.
          With that, a CLUE falls into place: SAGUARO PASS.

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          Deed was in your name.
          He slips the photo back in the brim, tosses the hat to Jake:

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          Dead hooker with a hole in her chest, in
          your cabin, plus your sterling reputation
          equals guilty as goddamned sin.
          (draws his GUN)
          And you're gonna hang for it.
          At gunpoint, Taggart PUSHES Jake out the door --

          EXT. DESERT PLAINS - DAWN

          Against the RISING SUN, Dolarhyde and 15 GUNMEN ride hard, armed
          to the teems. They REAR in the hills above Absolution. Dolar
          looks down through BINOCULARS as NAT COLORADO turns to...
          an incoming WIND. Across the valley, a massive BLACK CLOUD
          is starting to SWIRL. Violent BLUE FLASHES within. Eerie.

                         GREAVEY
          blue light... Clanton said he saw
          blue light before the cows disappeared...

                         DOLARHYDE
          Just a storm.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         COLORADO
          No storm I've ever seen... I say we wait
          'til it passes.
          But Dolar isn't listening. THROUGH HIS BINOCULARS: he sees
          PERCY being carried into the prison wagon. Followed by Jake.

                         DOLARHYDE
          No time, they put him in an iron coach.
          With a HYA! he's OFF, the others FOLLOWING with reluctant looks
          -- still SPOOKED by that incoming STORM:

          EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

          As Jake's loaded into the prison wagon after the still-
          unconscious Percy, he SEES MEACHAM through the barred window.
          The preacher flashes SYMPATHY as Wade takes out the cuff key:

                         DEPUTY WADE
          Gimme your wrist.
          Jake holds out his hands. Wade unlocks one wrist, freeing a
          cuff... then takes that cuff and LOCKS IT to Percy's wrist.

                         JAKE
          What're you --?

                         CHARLIE
          Best way to make a man stay put: chain
          him to his enemy.

                         (A GRIN)
          You lovebirds have a nice trip now.
          SLAM: the door CLOSES and LOCKS. Jake SIGHS and tries to sit
          back, but it's hard tethered to Percy's slumped form. Shit.
          Then QWW -- something starts to STING and he looks down:
          HIS BRACELET. Has started PULSING RED. And it's getting WARM.
          Jake stares -- ON EDGE -- what the hell's happening? As --
          OUTSIDE, Taggart mounts the buckboard. EMMETT feeds the horses:

                         EMMETT
          You sure he's a bad guy, Pa? He did give
          Percy a lickin'.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          He's bad enough.

                         EMMETT
          (not so sure, but --)
          . can I come with you?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Too dangerous.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         EMMETT
          Dangerous to drive a damn coach? Why
          can't Charlie just take him?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Because it's my job, Emmett. That's what
          these people pay me to do. And your
          mother would kill me if I brought you.
          Emmett looks off, half sad, half angry --

                         EMMETT
          Good thing she's already dead then.
          And turns without a goodbye. Taggart watches him leave, wishing
          he could connect. Takes the reins and looks up -- REACTS:
          THAT MASSIVE. FRIGHTENING CLOUD IN THE SKY -- roiling faster
          toward town. The scary BLUE FLASHES within grow more INTENSE.
          IN THE COACH -- WITH JAKE, looking at the BRACELET, the pulsing
          growing MORE FREQUENT -- and then, a VOICE:

          ELLA (0.S. )

          HEY!
          Jake turns to see ELLA, pushed up against the coach window:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          Tell me where you got that bracelet...

                         JAKE
          Maybe you should'a asked before you
          knocked me out..

                         ELLA
          Please... I need to know. Just tell me
          where you got it.

                         JAKE
          Y dOli' .xBmbgX - - I don' t remember my
          name or where I've been or any of the
          things they said I done, so leave me the
          hell alone.
          And sits back as the coach starts to MOVE, leaving Ella in the
          dust. Some of the gunmen ride atop it; others on horseback
          cover the coach in a protective ring.
          Wade sees something incoming from the NORTH:

                         DEPUTY WADE

          KYLE!!!
          Taggart looks up: Dolarhyde's gang racing down the mountain --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART

                         DAMNIT --
          He unslings his SHOTGUN as his men ready their weapons --
          ON DOLARHYDE'S GANG, riding hard, guns ready too --
          This is about to get UGLY. BUT... from the OTHER end of town,
          the WIND picks up --
          As the massive storm cloud seems shockingly to have STORED AT A
          H -- its EYE churning, ROARING and... TWO BOLTS OF BLUE
          LIGHTNING CRACK DOWN FROM IT! Happy starts BARKING MADLY. Ella
          sees the lightning and starts to BACK AWAY in fear:

                         ELLA
          NonoNO -- GET TO YOUR CELLARS! EVERYONE

          UNDERGROUND NAT!
          But her cries are LOST as -- RRRRRRRR!!!!!

          A LONG, NARROW FUNNEL SHOOTS FROM THE CHURNING CLOUD: A TORNADO!

          BREAKING THE MOMENTUM OF THE SHOWDOWN --
          The stagecoach UPENDS, FLIPPING SIDEWAYS as the animals try to
          break free -- Taggart and his men are THROWN --
          Inside, Jake and Percy TUMBLE end-over-end -- SLAMMING into
          walls, LOCKED TOGETHER -- JARRING Percy back to consciousness --
          Dolarhyde's men are THROWN from their horses too as the animals
          STAMPEDE OFF in different directions --
          THE 1Q8k=O ENGULFS THE TOWN! THE CONCUSSIVE BLAST BUCKLES

          THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE. SHERIFF'S STATION. BROTHEL. WOOD

          STRIPPED RIGHT OFF THEIR FALSE FRONTS LIKE PIANO KEYS!
          Okay, wait. Just wait. Take a breath. 'Cause it's
          about ... . to get... . MORE insane...

          TEN MANTA RAY-SHAPED HOVER-SPEEDERS BURST FROM THE CYCLONE!
          ROARING into the town, FLYING just above ground --

          TOWNSPEOPLE'S FACES -- GOING DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE -- 19TH

          CENTURY BRAINS TRYING TO PROCESS THE IMPOSSIBLE --

          STRANGE STEEL RINGS fire from the speeders and mushroom out --
          KA-CHING! -- SNAP OPEN and CLAMP around necks, arms, legs -- and
          from these steel collars, CABLES LASH OUT, whip-snapping back to
          the speeders and TETHERING MAGNETICALLY to them --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.
          Yeah-these are HIGH-TECH LASSOS:

          HELPLESS VICTIMS ARE YANKED OFF THE GROUND AND PULLED BEHIND THE
          SPEEDERS LIKE ROPED STEER! Two of TAGGART'S GUNMEN. Now some
          of DOLARYHYDE' S. Screaming, just gone. THIS IS A...Qlp lam.
          EMMETT -- stunned -- as SHERIFF TAGGART runs for him --

                         SHERIFF TAGGART

          EMMETT !
          Emmett runs into his dad's embrace --

           A_LIVERY_STABLE -- the HORSES stamp in their stalls as Taggart

          connects to a speeder and WHOOSH! Taggart's RIPPED off his
          feet, dragged away -- ELLA tackles the boy as ANOTHER RING zooms
          overhead, locks around a FLEEING WOMAN -- she's TAKEN --

          BIRDCAGE THEATER!
          With a "C'MON!!!" she rushes him through the FRENZIED CROWD --

          INT. PRISON WAGON - CONTINUOUS

          JAKE AND !MERCY -- TRAPPED IN THE UPSIDE-DOWN COACH -- Jake sees
          DEPUTY WADE on the ground just a few feet away, head bleeding --

                         JAKE

          HEY!! LET US OUT!!!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.
          -- but WHOOSH! A METAL COLLAR CLAMPS AROUND WADE AND YANKS HIM
          AWAY! Percy STRUGGLES wildly against Jake in a TUG-O'-WAR:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)

          STOP PULLING AND GIMME YOUR HAND--!

          YOUR DAMN HAND!!!
          Percy RELENTS. Offers up his hand. Jake grabs all of Percy's

          FINGERS, TIGHTENS HIS FIST AROUND THEM -- CRRRRAAACKI
          SNAPS THEM BACKWARDS!!!!! Percy SHRIEKS as Jake KICKS him back
          against the wall, FORCING Percy's hand out of the cuff -- and
          now Jake's UNTETHERED too!
          THROUGH THE CROWD -- DOLARHYDE hears his son SCREAM. SEES the
          overturned coach and TWO-FINGER WHISTLES to:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Colorado!
          Nat Colorado RACES IN as Dolar draws his .45 -- BANG! --
          shatters the coach lock -- they PULL Percy out:

                         DOLARHYDE

          QUIT WHININ' AND FIND A HORSE!
          As Dolar runs for his horse, Percy sees a PISTOL left on the
          ground -- grabs it with his good hand and FIRES at Jake who
          JUKES behind the coach for cover, Percy SHOOTING in a FURY but:
          -- KLINK! A collar CLAMPS around Percy's neck and he's YANKED
          OFF TOO! Dolarhyde turns and SEES HIS SON DISAPPEAR:

          INT. MEACHAM' S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

          Meacham ushers people into the church as WALLS SHAKE, PEWS JUMP:

          INT. BLACKSMITH'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS

          DOC AND MARIA burst in, huddle under a window. Across the room,
          a YOUNG MAN clamps a hand over his TERRIFIED WIFE's mouth --

          EXT. BIRDCAGE THEATER - CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

          ELLA -- hurrying Emmett toward the theater's CELLAR DOOR, but a
          SPEEDER circles around and ROARS toward them --
          ON JAKE. He SEES this -- and suddenly, to HIS surprise as much
          as OURS... HIS BRACELET ACTIVATES! METAL COMING TO LIFE,
          coiling up around his arm -- WHAT? HOW? -- as it becomes...

          A SMART GUN BLASTER WE PON! A HOLOGRAPHIC SCOPE MATERIALIZES,
          tracking that speeder as it DESCENDS on Ella and the mother and:

          BALLLLAMMMI THE BLASTER FIRES A PULSE, VAPORIZING THE SPEEDER

          MID-AIR! THE RECOIL HURTLES JAKE BACK 15 FEET, INTO A WALL.
          Ella reaches the CELLAR DOOR with Emmett. LOCKED. Sees a
          HATCHET in a stump -- rips it out and HAMMERS the lock to bits:

                         ELLA
          Everyone inside! GO GO GO!!
          Ushering Emmett and TOWNSFOLK underground, PULLS the door SHUT --

          EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

          JAKE stumbles up... as a speeder FIRES A RING AT HIM. But
          reflexively, his WRIST WEAPON FIRES ANOTHER BLAST, vaporizing
          it! He looks down at the blaster: "Hell y ."
          Another speeder circles around -- KABOOM! The blaster's
          incredible firepower SPIRALS THE SPEEDER OUT OF CONTROL, it

                         CRASHES INTO:

          INT. MEACHAM'S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

          The speeder PLOWS through, parishioners flee -- the CHURCH BELL
          breaks from the BELL TOWER -- CRASHES DOWN ON THE SPEEDER --

          EXT. TOWN STREETS - CONTINUOUS

          As Jake keeps FIRING, the last speeders turn tail and RETREAT --
          disappearing back INTO THE TORNADO as the cloud overhead OPENS
          UP and INHALES the swirling mass, which spirals to the heavens.
          ... GONE. The massive cloud seems to VAPORIZE and the DESERT
          SUN returns... debris flutters... smoke clears...
          And all... is... STILL.
          As our CAMERA RISES to reveal... HALF THE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN

          SUCKED INTO THE SKY.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          From the rubble, SURVIVORS EMERGE: EMMETT and ELLA from the
          cellar with inhabitants. DOLARHYDE. DOC. Al in SHOCK:

                         DOC
          Maria -- oh God-- they t-took her-- What
          just...?
          MOANS, WAILS... desperate cries as people search for loved ones.
          JAKE'S BLASTER -- RETRACTS, folding in on itself -- shrinks down
          to size, reverting back into a BRACELET. He's stunned. So are
          the remaining townsfolk. DOLARHYDE is first to speak:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Who the hell're ?

                         NAT COLORADO
          He's the one who caged Percy.
          Dolarhyde starts MOVING toward Jake -- wild killer eyes --

                         DOLARHYDE
          Whatwere__tho_se__thinae?

                         JAKE
          -- why're you asking m&?!
          Dolarhyde GRIPS Jake's arm -- THE BRACELET:

                         DOLARHYDE
          This! Where'd you get this?! It was
          shooting the same light beams they were --

                         JAKE
          Let go of my wrist.

                         DOLARHYDE
          -- I'm not lettin' go of nothin' til you
          tell me what the he--
          KA-LLLANG!! Suddenly that CHURCH BELL comes HURTLING out of the
          church wreckage, PLOWS through debris. People scatter. And out
          of the church stumbles...
          AN ALIEN. 8 FT. TALL. Standing upright, limbs inverted --
           limbs that DRAG, wounded, as people SCREAM and RUN and Jake and
          Dolarhyde can only stare, jaws dropped, and the monster LUNGES:
          WHUPWHUP -- something SPINNING through the air -- A HATCHET ---

          SCHLUCK!!!! -- EMBEDDING IN THE ALIEN'S HEAD! WHIP TO --
          ELLA, hang iust hurled it. The alien lets out a DEATH RATTLE
          then FALLS FORWARD, the hatchet embedding deeper as it HITS THE
          DIRT. Holy SHIT.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.
          Ella's adrenaline dynamo starts to die down, replaced now by
          SHOCK. And for what seems like the first time, FEAR. She
          EXHALES a crazy breath, stumbles back... as slowly... people
          converge around the corpse:

                         EMMETT
          Is it... dead?
          Jake KICKS the alien. It doesn't move. Happy BARKS --

                         DOLARHYDE
          . The hell j,,a it?

          MEACHAM (O.S.)
          A demon.
          They all turn to see MEACHAM. TERRIFIED.

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          Revelations 16:14: "For there are
          spirits of demons, showing signs."
          (points to the alien)
          Escaped from hell itself.

                         EMMETT
          Lookit its wrist! It's got one'a those
          bracelet things too!
          Indeed, there on the creature's wrist is an IDENTICAL BRACELET.
          ON JAKE. Mind tumbling. He meets eyes with ELLA. Her face as
          EAGER as his to understand this and now... BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.
          What's that SOUND? Everyone looks at each other. Colorado
          bends closer to the corpse... SCARED...

                         NAT COLORADO
          I think... it's comin' from somewhere
          inside it.
          People look at each other: WHAT NOW? Trying to control the near-
          hysteria they all feel. Finally, Dolarhyde takes a BREATH --
          more BRAVADO than actual courage:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Only one way to find out. We need to cut
          it open.

                         (TO DOC)
          You're a doctor. Got a bone saw?
          DOC snaps out of his stupor, looks up, FREAKED --

                         DOC
          . Are you... serious?
          (looks to them all)

          WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?!?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Wake u Those things took your wife --

                         DOC

          I KNOW THAT!!

                         DOLARHYDE
          Well this one here's our only chance of
          findin' where they went.
          That LANDS on all of them. A long beat. Doc looks down at the
          thing, ORANGE GOO dribbling around the AXE in its head...

                         DOLLARHYDE
          So you got a bone saw or don't you?

          INT. GOLD LBAP SALOON - DAY

          THUD! The alien corpse is DROPPED onto the bar by Doc and
          Meacham. As Dolarhyde and Colorado follow through the batwings
          -- Doc WHIPS a SHOTGUN from under the bar:

                         DOC
          Stay outside. You're not welcome in
          here!
          Dolar brings up his COLT -- so does COLORADO --

                         DOLARRYDE
          I own more of this town than any man in
          it so I'll go wherever the hell I damn
          please. And for the record? You ain't
          welcome in my country, Mexican.
          Ella steps between them, BAD ASS --

                         ELLA
          Whatever troubles you had don't mean a
          damn thing against the ones we got now.
          We wanna see our way through 'em, your
          guns better start pointing in the same
          direction, Goddammit.
          Doc and Dolar never take eyes off each other. or their GUNS.
          Finally... Dolar LOWERS his. So does Doc. People BREATHE.
          Meacham slips on a pair of GLASSES, studying eerie veins and
          muscles through the creature's viscous outer layers. Doc turns
          his focus to the alien too. Picks up his PUMP-OPERATED BONE
          SAW. Presses his boot on the bellows, it turns with a WHIR...
          SHAKING as he brings the SPINNING BLADE to the alien's CHEST.
          Looks at Meacham, AFRAID --

                         DOC
          If it 'mss a demon, and I cut it open... am
          I going to burn for it?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.
          Meacham hesitates a beat, then CROSSES the air in front of Doc --

                         MEACHAM
          That should cover ya.
          ON DOC. Little relief. BROW SWEATING, he brings the spinning
          blade down toward the disgusting ALIEN -- VRRRRZZ -- HESITATES --

                         DOC
          Excuse me.
          B GH! He PUKES on the ground.

                         EMMETT
          Jesus, Doc!!!
          Doc wipes his mouth with a handkerchief, slightly DEFIANT --

                         DOC
          This is not normal. I'm entitled to
          vomit. We should XU be vomiting.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Just cut, Lardass.
          Doc GLARES... with a still-shakitig hand, gets back to business --

          VRRRRZ -- CUTS THROUGH THE STERNUM -- ORANGE BLOOD SPRAYING --
          and... SHUNK! Doc looks up at Jake, gestures to the carcass:

                         DOC
          Senor? A hand?

                         (TO DOLARHYDE)
          You too, maricon.
          The men all grip the chest plate and PULL -- A DISGUSTING CRACK.
          Everyone turns away, scowling, Emmett wafting the air:

                         EMMETT
          Damn! Smells like a dead dog's ass.

                         MEACHAM
          Emmett.

                         EMMETT
          Sorry, Father.
          Doc covers his face with his handkerchief as he explores...

                         DOC
          Chet wall's partially collapsed... no
          familiar organs of any kind...

                         DOLARHYDE
          'course they're not familiar. Just look
          at this th--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.
          SUDDENLY THE ALIEN'S ARM LASHES OUT -- claws SNAP OPEN and PIN
          Dolarhyde against the wall! Everyone tries to PRY the claws
          from his neck -- but the second Doc withdraws his hands from the
          alien's chest, its arm goes LIMP. Dolarhyde drops, GASPING...

                         DOC
          Spinal reflex.
          And GRINS at Dolar's pain. But Meacham NOTICES something around
          Dolar's neck where the alien pinned him, like a ring of DUST:

                         MEACHAM
          Something on your neck. Hold still.
          Meacham sweeps a little off Dolar's neck, rubs it between thumb
          and forefinger. The dust GLINTS under the kerosene lamp:

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          I'll be damned... gold.
          They check the creature's hand talons: GOLD FLAKES underneath
          'em, and Lots of it. Colorado checks its taloned feet:

                         NAT COLORADO
          Down here too.
          (looks to Dolar)
          This much ore... could only have come
          from a digging in a mine.
          That LANDS on everyone. but most especially ELLA. Who looks up
          to see Jake READING her in this moment.

                         EMMETT
          In the ALIEN'S EYE is a SMALL FLASHING LIGHT. On/Off/On/Off in
          time with that BEEP BEEP BEEP.

                         DOC
          Gimme my scalpel.
          In MACRO CU, DOC CUTS INTO THE EYE, WET SQUISHY SOUNDS as he
          pulls it from its socket, attached to a STRINGY OPTIC NERVE
          dripping with juice. Clamped to the nerve is a METALLIC ORB:
          -- he takes hold of the blinking orb. It FLARES to life, the
          light coalescing into a 3-D ARROW-LIKE HOLOGRAM. Confusion.
          Doc REMOVES it from the optic nerve and the hologram DISAPPEARS:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Where'd it go? The hell'd you do?

                         DOC
          Nothing, just pulled it off --
          He reconnects it to the optic nerve, the hologram REAPPEARS:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         DOC (CONT'D)
          Only works when it's touching the
          creature.
          Colorado moves closer... rainbow light flickering across his
          face...

                         NAT COLORADO
          I think... it's a compass. Look:
          (fiddles with tweezers)
          No matter how you move it, it points in
          the same direction.

                         EMMETT
          Compasses point north. That's west.

                         MEACHAM
          (realizing; to Jake)
          West's where 141 came from.
          ON JAKE. Another puzzle piece falling into place.

                         EMMETT
          If you're right, what's it pointing to?

                         ELLA
          The rest of 'em.

                         (THEN)
          Be my guess.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Then that's where I'm goin'.
          He SNAPS his PISTOL open, loading bullets:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          One of my ranchers said my herd
          disappeared into the sky. 'Til about ten
          minutes ago, I figured him for a liar.
          (SNAPS barrel closed)
          Nobody takes my cattle.

                         MEACHAM
          Your b was taken too.
          A FLASH of something from Dolarhyde -- could that be EMOTION?
          But just as fast, it's GONE. Almost a THROWAWAY:

                         DOLARHYDE
          I noticed.

                         NAT COLORADO
          What if they're already dead?

                         EMMETT
          They're not dead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

                         ELLA
          Kid's right. If all they wanted was to
          kill us, they would've.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Looked to me like... they were ropin'
          people.

                         (THEN)
          Means they need 'em for something.
          Whatever it is, we can either stand here
          guessin'... or go find out.
          His eyes flash to Nat: "C'mon." And they EXIT. Everyone looks
          at each other, working up the courage to face what they know
          they must. Doc grabs his SHOTGUN, starts gathering shells:

                         DOC
          If she's alive -- if there's even a

                         CHANCE --

                         MEACHAM
          Lord hates a coward... but our bullets
          were useless against those things. Other
          than his wrist gizmo, we're outgunned and
          outnumbered.
          As one by one, they turn... to JAKE. Who until this point has
          been mostly SILENT. Observing. But now -- he's gone from enemy
          to potential savior in a heartbeat.

                         JAKE
          Whoa, I got nothing to do with this --

                         ELLA
          You got everything to do with it. If you
          can remember where you got that thing --

                         JAKE
          I remember you all wantin' me on the end
          of a damned rope. Whatever's happenin'
          here's got nothin' to do with me.

                         ELLA
          You sure. about that?
          He LOOKS at her. No, he isn't. But he sure as hell won't stay
          to debate it -- turns to go --

                         EMMETT
          Mr. Lonergan? Sir?
          The EMOTION in the boy's voice STOPS Jake at the door.

                         EMMETT (CONT'D)
          My mother died last year. My Paw... he's
          all I got.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.
          And despite a fleeting moment of SYMPATHY, Jake darkens --

                         JAKE
          Kid, I'm the last man you want anywhere
          near you, your Pa... or anyone else in
          this goddamned town.
          OUT the door. Everyone trades looks, then Ella FOLLOWS:

          EXT. SALOON - NIGHT

          Jake moves FAST past blown-out STOREFRONTS as Ella PURSUES:

                         ELLA
          That's it? You're just gonna run away?

                         JAKE
          No, Sister. I'm walking away.

                         ELLA
          Well s w.
          As he keeps on walking, Ella picks up a ROCK, wings it at the
          back of his HEAD -- WHAMI Jake stumbles forward, TURNS AROUND --

                         JAKE ELLA
          SONOVA-- -- I told you to gyp.
          Ella strides forward, picking up another rock on the move --

                         JAKE
          What's your damn problem?!

                         ELLA
          You're comin' with us.

                         JAKE
          I'm not coming anywhere. And you throw
          that rock I swear I'll--
          WHAM! The rock glances off his shoulder --

                         ELLA
          If you're walkin' away from here, what
          the hell're you walking tsQ?
          That PENETRATES as Jake realizes he doesn't really KNOW. And
          that's the last thing he's gonna admit --

                         JAKE
          What the hell are you walkin' to, Lady?
          'Cause if I heard right, it sounds like
          suicide to me.
          -- now it's her turn to pause. Cryptically:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         ELLA
          I... just wanna help these people.

                         JAKE
          Bullshit. You wanna help yourself. Saw
          your face light up the minute you knew
          that thing might lead you to gold.
          And the fact that he's BUSTED her gets Ella's hackles up --

                         ELLA
          It's not gold I want, you dumb
          sonofabitch, it's what it'll buy me.

                         JAKE
          And what's that?

                         ELLA
          Remange.
          Whatever that means, it's a deep, painful LONGING in her. She
          stares at him, DEAD ON:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          And lookin' at you? I'd bet a silver
          dollar... its what you want, too.
          With that, Ella turns and STRIDES OFF as we HOLD ON JAKE, face
          knotted in conflict. As her words RESONATE.

          MEACHAM (V.0.)
          Was the Devil come to Absolution... come
          to drag our town down to hell...
          SERIES OF SHOTS - AS DUSK TAI .t $. TQ .NIGItT:
          Though BURNING EMBERS, Emmett helps a LITTLE GIRL pull her half-
          burnt DOLL from the rubble...

          MEACHAM (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          but our town's not just a buncha
          buildings, Brothers and Sisters --
          Nossir. Our town is fie. Good, God-
          fearing souls. Pure and hopeful. And
          the devil can't never take that away...
          Ella and Doc tend to WOUNDED PEOPLE in a triage area as...
          Meacham finds his overturned PULPIT. Determination in his eyes,
          he pushes it UPRIGHT:

          AND NOW WE CATCH UP TO WHERE MEACHANL'S VOICE 1S_CQMING FRUM:
          He's standing on the pulpit in the rubble, his words a
          sermon/call-to-arms -- every survivor GATHERED AROUND:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          In times of darkness, God asks that we
          come together so we may stand and fight.
          So we're goin' after our kin. Any of you
          aren't able or prepared, no shame in it.
          Head up to Fort Huachuca, join up with
          the garrison there and pray... Rest of us
          ride out at sun-up to recover that which
          we have lost.
          SUNRISE: Pistol chambers SPINNNN -- rifles are COCKED --

          MEACHAM (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Thy will be done, Lord, and there's an
          amen behind it.
          Lo and behold, most of the town survivors are just too damn
          scared. They form an EXODUS LINE, heading off toward the fort.
          Dolarhyde, Colorado and his REMAINING MEN (6) load the ALIEN
          CORPSE onto the back of a WAGON. Some of them trade glances --
          DAMN WORRIED about staying. Dolarhyde sees it:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Somebody got something to say?
          His withering GLARE keeps them from speaking up. Doc and
          Meacham climb onto the wagon:

                         MEACHAM

                         (THE ALIEN)
          Sure we need to bring that thing along?
          Doc nods as he TWISTS the forceps in the Alien's eye, the
          COMPASS HOLOGRAM flickering to life before them:

                         DOC
          If this arrow points me back to Maria?
          Yeah -- J'm sure.
          Emmett appears leading a PONY, a BOW and quiver of ARROWS slung
          around his back:

                         MEACHAM
          Can't come, Emmett, too dangerous.

                         EMMETT
          I can protect myself -- shoot, I'm the
          only master bowman in my archery club.
          Won the county tournament by shootin' a
          flipped nickel at 50 paces.

                         MEACHAM
          Somethin' tells me these things don't
          carry nickels, son. Answers's no.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         EMMETT
          You want me to ride off with the
          chickenshits, then double back, be happy
          to. But let's just skip that part and
          get to it, Padre.
          And that's the truth. Meacham sighs, no choice... finally:

                         MEACHAM
          Go fill your canteen, dammit.
          He SLAPS the reins and the wagon rides off. Emmett GRINS and
          mounts the pony, then sees... JAKE riding past. ANGRY EYES from
          Ella as she heels her horse and TROTS OFF angrily:

                         ELLA
          C'mon, Happy.
          But HAPPY remains, torn between them, tail wagging and looking
          up at Jake as if to say: PLEASE COME?

                         JAKE
          Oh shut up.
          Suppressing GUILT, he rides on toward the hills -- as Dolarhyde
          VEERS his horse in front of Jake, cutting him off:

                         DOLARHYDE
          I was ridin' into town to kill you for
          what you done to my son. You owe me your
          life, Boy.

                         (BEAT)
          Ride with us, we'll call it square.
          His hand rests on his nickel-plated .38. Eyes gleaming cruelly.

                         JAKE
          You that fast?

                         DOLARHYDE

                         FAST ENOU--
          -- WHOOSH: Jake's hand is already UP with his own PISTOL, having
          drawn before Dolarhyde can finish his sentence:

                         JAKE
          Now you owe me y.Q= life. We're square.
          In a DAZZLING TWIRL, Jake slaps it back in his holster. Point
          made, he RIDES ON. Dolarhyde, burning mad at having been out-
          drawn, turns to CULOBAI)U -- speaks LOW:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Follow him. Soon as he's got his back
          turned... kill him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          Shit. Colorado hesitates. Dolar GLARES: "Do it." Finally
          Colorado NODS acquiescence, moves off...
          JAKE -- on the OUTSKIRTS of town now -- riding past Meacham and
          Doc on the WAGON:

                         MEACHAM
          Figure out which way you're headed yet?

                         JAKE
          West. Saguaro Pass.

                         MEACHAM
          That's not what I meant.
          The inference LANDS on Jake. But he's in no mood. GALLOPS off.
          Meacham watches Jake go... MUSIC RISES AS WE DISSOLVE THROUGH:

          EXT. DESERT PLAINS


          JAKE -- RIDING HARD THROUGH THE DESERT:
          A man running from his demons, or maybe toward them... through
          plains and pasturage... until he sees the tilted ROAD SIGN:
          "SAGUARO PASS." Up ahead, he sees DEBRIS...
          Part of a ROOF, lying broken on the ground. Pieces of a STONE
          CHIMNEY. Jake comes over a rise... to REVEAL:

          EXT. ABANDONED CABIN - DAY

          A DESTROYED LOG CABIN. Walls partially TORN AWAY. Something in
          Jake is DEEPLY STIRRED. Dismounts, tentatively... walks up to
          the PORCH. Boots CRUNCH over broken window glass as they ENTER:

          INT. ABANDONED CABIN - CONTINUOUS

          LIGHT BEAMS stream in. Eerie quiet.
          Jake takes it in, HAUNTED. Something CRUNCHES under his boot --
          DRIED FLOWERS. Sticking out from an OVERTURNED CRACKED VASE.
          Jake BLINKS, affected -- Bends over, TOUCHES the VASE AS:
          MEMORY FLASECUT! FRESH FLOWERS in a woman's hand... THE W B&
          FROM JAKE'S PICTURE. She smiles at him --

                         THE WOMAN
          You shouldn't have.
          She turns, drops the flowers into the vase as we see she's
          talking to JAKE.

                         JAKE
          Got you somethin' else.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.
          CLINK -- He drops a LEATHER POUCH on the table next to the vase.
          A FEW GOLD COINS clink out. The woman turns to him, WORRIED:

                         THE WOMAN
          Where'd you get this?

                         JAKE
          Where do you think?
          The woman looks to the pouch -- Picks up one of the coins.
          TORN. Jake moves behind her. Close. An INTIMACY here.

                         THE WOMAN
          Your boys '11 come after you.
          ON JAKE. Dark. But DETERMINED:

                         JAKE
          Let 'em come.
          She turns to him, their eyes HOLD... and they KISS. Soft.
          Tender. Soulful.
          But then -- a THUNDERCRACK turns their attention to the window:
          A STORM CLOUD on the horizon. Same kind that consumed the town.
          The cabin starts to VIBRATE like a tuning fork. The pouch
          slides off the table... THE GOLD COINS SPILL OUT and --

          BACK TO PRESENT - JAKE
          REELING. What is this memory? Who the hell is the woman?
          Something GLINTS in the far wall where the chimney used to be:

          ONE OF THE GOLD COINS
          EMBEDDED in the wood. Jake pulls it out of the wall, a thousand
          questions in his eyes. Sunlight SHIMMERS off it and --
          MEMORY FLASHCUT! The spilled coins start SLIDING across the
          floor all by themselves, as if magnetically drawn to THE CHIMNEY
          -- WHOOSH! -- SUCKED right up into it by some VACUUM FORCE!

                         THE WOMAN
          What's happening?!!!

          WINDOWS EXPLODE! THE ROOF'S RIPPED AWAY BY SOME NSANE VACUUM
          FORCE AS ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT CRASHES IN! The Woman SCREAMS and --

          KA-CHINNNG! A STEEL COLLAR SHOOTS DOWN FROM THE LIGHT, CLAMPING

          AROUND HER NECK! A CABLE SNAPS OUT FROM IT AND WHIPS UPWARD,

          PULLING HER INTO THE LIGHT --
          She manages to GRAB a doorknob and DANGLES UPWARD, CHOKING as --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.
          A DEMONIC SILHOUETTE drops in front of them!
          JESUS!! Jake draws his pistol and FIRES!
           The demon SHRIEKS IN RAGE as SPIKED PLUMES fan out from its
           huge, elongated skull... making it look like a SILHOUETTED
          It QIAï¿½1.-L 2 A T EI! R HEADDRESS!
           Its HIDEOUS FACE comes into the light -- AN AIJIE -- as it
           raises its arm, wearing a WRIST BRACELET that reshapes into a

                         BLASTER --
           JAKE DIVES AWAY but a searing pulse RIPS A WICKED GASH in his
          side (now we know how he woke up with it in the desert) --

          THE PULSE PASSES THROUGH JAKE AND HITS THE WOMAN SQUARE IN THE
          C-Mr-M. She 's HURLED backward into the wall, Jake. CRIES OUT:

                         JAKE
          Alice!
          As he RUSHES to her, her collar UNLOCKS... and FLIES AT JAKE,
          clamping HE'S PULLED INTO THE LIGHT, CHOKING, SCREAMING --

          BACK TO PRESENT - JAKE
          As he STUMBLES back -- GASPING -- touching his neck --
          Catches his breath. ROCKED. Sees "Alice's" BLOOD STAIN on the
          wall. His shaking hand reaches out, brushes over it...

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          (trying out the name)
          "Alice"...
          Whoever she was to him, he feels sledgehammered with GRIEF. All
          he knows is, it was THEM. The creatures killed her. And this
          revelation... well, it galvanizes him with RAGE.
          Rage that gives him NEW PURPOSE... then--

          SUDDENLY -- INSTINCT -- JAKE SENSING SOMETHING IS HERE -- GRABS

          A CHIMNEY STONE AND SPINS, HURLS IT...

          AT COLORADO, IN THE DOORWAY BEHIND HIM AIMING A GUN:
          The stone HITS Colorado as he FIRES, the bullet tears PAST Jake
          -- as Colorado recovers, Jake BODYSLAMS HIM -- the GUN goes
          flying, they go hurling THROUGH THE WALL -- LANDING HARD on the
          other side -- aaballs-out. messy. close-quarter death match --
          Jake takes a PUNCH -- Colorado LOOPS an arm around his throat,
          YANKS -- they TUMBLE/SLAM to the floor, Jake LANDING on top of
          Colorado who holds the arm lock, CHOKING THE LIFE OUT OF HIM --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.
          Jake -- EYES POPPING -- SEES THE GUN just out of reach --
          fingers GRASP for it -- seconds before he PASSES OUT
          He GRABS the gun and swings it back -- BLAMMII!Colorado ROLLS
          aside as the WALL where his head just was BLOWSOPEN--and
          Jake's ON HIM, PISTOL WHIPPING HIM MERCILESSLYuntilheSPINS
          the gun back around and POINTS IT between Colorado's eyes:
          ON JAKE -- quaking with rage -- he wants to kill this guy so bad
          he can taste it... but something's HOLDING HIM BACK -- GRITS his
          teeth, COCKS the trigger and:

          EXT. ABANDONED CABIN - DAY

          -- we CUT WIDE on the cabin as a GUNSHOT CRACKS. A flock of
          BIRDS screech into the sky from the overgrown corn field...

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. DESERT PLAINS - DAY

          The rest of our people RIDE along, following the ever-tilting
          HOLOGRAPHIC ARROW, their COMPASS, floating from the dead alien's
          eye in the back of the wagon.
          Greavey, Dolar's ranch hand, heels up to ELLA. COCKY SWAGGER:

                         GREAVEY
          So... what's a pretty lady like y--

                         ELLA
          -- you finish that sentence, I shoot you
          in your beef whistle.
          Doc, sipping from his canteen, does a SPIT TAKE. Ella's eyes
          DRILL Greavey. Cut down a peg, he tips his hat, red-faced:

                         GREAVEY
          Ma'am.
          And rides past her, taking us to EMMETT and DOLARHYDE:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Tell me somethin', Kid... why didn't your
          father just take my money?

                         EMMETT

                         (CONFUSED)
          What money?

                         UOLARHY DE
          offered him a thousand dollars to leave
          town. He could's taken you outta harm's
          way, relocated... found you a new momma.
          And this just BURNS Emmett. A beat; then:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         EMMETT
          Is it true Percy's momma died givin'
          birth to him, Mister Dolarhyde?
          Something FLASHES in Dolarhyde. But he's contained:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Yeah.

                         EMMETT
          Then maybe you should use that thousand
          dollars to buy yourself a new wife.
          Emmett HOLDS his look against Dolarhyde's. Brave and
          UNFLINCHING. Doc can't help but grin at the kid's moxie... but
          it's short-lived as his face suddenly falls:

                         DOC
          Madre Dios...
          And we PAN AROUND, dropping over his shoulder to see what he's
          reacting to --
          AN ENORMOUS CRATER. ACRES WIDE... TWENTY FEET DEEP. Even
          Dolarhyde looks nervous now:

                         DOLARYHYDE
          What the... hell is it?

                         MEACHAM
          It was Winfield's Landing.
          They turn to see Meacham, brushing the DUST off a WOODEN SIGN:
          Holds it UP. " Winfield's Landing... Population 133."
          ON GREAVEY AND THE MEN. Shit. He doesn't mean...?

                         GREAVEY
          You tryin' to tell me those... things
          pulled the whole damn town into the sky?
          And suddenly a weird CRACK shakes the canyon -- like the SOUND
          BARRIER BREAKING -- everyone's look goes UP where:
          SWIRLING, DARK CLOUDS LOOM. The same clouds that dropped the
          tornado on Absolution. And that appeared in Jake's MEMORIES at
          the cabin. But this time, something's SHOT OUT from them --

                         MEACHAM
          That can't be good.
          The plummeting object HITS a distant dune, kicking up a SAND

          PLUME -- ROLLING TOWARD THEM --

                         DOLARHYDE
          Scatter.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.
          -- everyone runs their horses aside as the object BOUNCES over
          rocks -- then SLOWS... to a STOP.
          They STARE. Finally Dolarhyde kicks his horse forward slowly...
          DISMOUNTS, draws his GUN. What he sees is SHOCKING:
          It's an OVAL CAPSULE OF BLUE GOO, the outer layer some kind of
          TRANSLUCENT COCOON. Suspended within the murky Jell-o is a
          GE, DEC SHAPE. Motionless. UH-OH.
          The others draw guns too, converging around it in equal SHOCK
          and FEAR. But the thing doesn't MOVE.

                         DOC
          Should we... open it?

                         DOLARHYDE
          Should we open it? Hell NO we shouldn--

                         EMMETT
          -- oops --
          -- and now we find Emmett's already POKING it with a stick, a
          Small TEAR in the cocoon's outer embryonic layer -- GOO leaks --
          then it RUPTURES, EXPLODING as the horses REAR away, WHINNYING
          the goo spreads across the desert floor, thinning out.
          BEAT. Everyone wipes blue shit off their clothes as they come
          FACE-TO-FACE with the object inside, lying there on the ground:

          A COW. YES, A COW.
          Motionless. DEAD, in fact. A METAL TUBE jammed in its mouth,
          connected to a VALVE in the now-flaccid bubble's outer shell.
          Greavey notices a BRANDING on the cow's rump -- the letter "D":

                         GREAVEY
          Boss... it's one'a yours.
          Dolarhyde's eyes NARROW. Emmett looks at Doc, SCARED:

                         EMMETT
          Is-- is this what happened to my Pa?
          Doc dismounts. Moves to the cow's mouth and PULLS OUT THAT TUBE
          with a wet SQUISHING sound. Thinking it through:

                         DOC
          This was stuck down its throat... to help
          it breathe. That means they wanted to
          keep it alive, Emmett.
          (forces a small smile)
          I'm sure your father is fine.
          But Doc's eyes aren't sure. Meacham looks back to the sky:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         MEACHAM
          Why'd they dump it?

                         ELLA
          Whatever they needed from it, they
          must've got.

                         (THEN)
          Gonna get dark soon, need to keep moving.
          She does. The others FOLLOW in a chilled daze. The last is
          DOLARHYDE, glancing back at his dead cow with angry eyes...

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. RIDGE ABOVE VALLEY - DUSK

          Now our people APPEAR riding up a ridge... Dolarhyde shoots up a
          HAND, bringing the caravan to a STOP. Once again, SHOCK:

                         EMMETT
          Ho-ly shit.
          BOOM UP to reveal a SURREAL SIGHT in the valley below:
          AGAMBLING RIVERBOAT. Nose buried in the sand, paddlewheels
          facing the sky, as if it'd been dropped from the clouds into the
          desert. Just like that cow. Off their LOOKS --

          EXT. DESERT - THE PADDLEBOAT - MINUTES LATER

          TRACKING alongside of the TILTED PADDLEBOAT, our team rides
          around it. Trying to make SENSE. STENCILED on the stern is...

                         DOC
          "Colorado Queen."

                         (THEN)
          The river's two hundred miles from here.
          But Ella doesn't seem as impressed as the rest of them. In
          fact, her attention is drawn BEHIND them, to something coming up
          over the DUNES... the barest flicker of a smile --

                         ELLA
          Son of a bitch.
          IT'S JAKE ON HORSEBACK. Followed by another horse, with
          COLORADO in the saddle. Wrists tied but ALIVE. As Jake rides
          to a stop, he PUSHES Colorado off the horse -- the indian HITS
          the ground with a THUD as Jake levels Dolarhyde with HARD EYES:

                         JAKE
          Your man got it in his head that he was
          s'posed to kill me. I'm holding onto his
          ear 'til he says sorry.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.
          As Colorado stumbles to his feet angrily, humiliated, Dolar
          notices his BLOODY EAR. The LOBE has been SHOT OFF. He looks
          up at Jake, half-angry, half-EMBARRASSED --

                         DOLARHYDE
          Why'd you let him live?
          Jake's hard-as-nails. DRIVEN now --

                         JAKE
          Gonna need him.
          He rides past Dolar to Ella. Stops. Says, simply:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Nice boat.
          (then... SNIFFS)
          What's that smell?

                         ELLA
          That'd be me.
          He realizes her shirt's caked in the BLUE GOO from the cow.

                         JAKE
          Why're you blue?

                         ELLA

                         (DRYLY)
          Cause I missed ya.
          Their look HOLDS. A MOMENT. Something REAL between them.

                         DOLARHYDE
          We better keep movin'.
          A THUNDERCRACK. On the horizon, sheets of RAIN.

                         JAKE
          Storm's comin'. I say we dig in here til
          it passes.
          (to Colorado; fucking

                         WITH HIM)
          How's that sound, Nat?
          Nat BURNS. Dolar feels his AUTHORITY being undermined:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Storm or no storm, I say we keep movin'.
          Colorado finally turns to Uolarhyde. DEFIANT:

                         NAT COLORADO
          Too hard tracking anything in the rain.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.
          Dolarhyde GLARES at Colorado, who GLARES BACK: his loyalty now
          in QUESTION. The tide IS turning against the rancher.

          EXT. UPENDED RIVERBOAT - NIGHT - LATER

          RAIN POURS on the overturned boat. Horses tethered. The ALIEN
          CORPSE has been moved onto a slanted deck, covered by a TARP...
          WE TILT TO THE ALIEN'S HAND. Poking out. Motionless. HOLD on
          it, longer than we're comfortable.

          INT. UPENDED RIVERBOAT - LATER THAT NIGHT

          A RATTLESNAKE is coiled around a CHANDELIER... except the
          chandelier is on the floor and the floor is the CEILING.
          Upended gambling tables. WOODRATS scurry over FOOD. Every
          window's SMASHED... as if something just TOOK everyone.
          Dolar sits by a FIRE made from furniture parts, drinking from a
          WHISKEY FLASK. Colorado opposite, rubbing his MANGLED EAR.

                         DOLARHYDE
          You okay?

                         COLORADO
          (low, eyes averted)
          Yeah.
          Dolar pours some whiskey on a BANDANA, leans towards Colorado --

                         DOLARHYDE COLORADO
          Lemme clean it for you or
          it'll get -- -- I'm fine.
          Dolarhyde backs away. Colorado GLARES.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Say it.

                         COLORADO
          (after a beat)
          Is Percy worth dyin' for?
          Dolar's eyes flash. A mixture of anger and PAIN. Then --

                         DOLARHYDE
          He's my son.

                         (POINTED)
          I take care of my kin, Nat.
          ON COLORADO as that lands. Clearly, there's something here...
          a bond that seems to go deeper than just boss and employee. But
          WHAT? Finally Nat just gets up and LEAVES.
          Dolar watches him go, takes a healthy SWIG. Hears a WHIMPER.
          Looks over and sees... EMMETT, huddled in a corner. CRYING.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.
          ON DOLARHYDE. The kid's naked emotion AFFECTING him, but the
          fact Dolar might have a conscience makes him ANGRY too. Low:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          Hey. Kid.
          Emmett looks up, SNIFFLES. Dolar tosses him the WHISKEY FLASK:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          Take a drink and shut p.
          He gets up, walks off. Leaving the kid with the flask. As
          Emmett looks at it confusedly, stuffs it in his POCKET --

          INT. UPENDED RIVERBOAT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

          Meacham has set out TIN PANS under holes to collect RAIN WATER.
          Dumps a pan into his CANTEEN as Doc enters with COFFEE for him:

                         DOC
          (re: the tin plates)
          We brought enough water.

                         MEACHAM
          Not for drinkin', it's for blessin'.
          Doc nods: ah. Turns to go... STOPS. Turns back. Intense eyes:

                         DOC
          Padre... Maria came to see you in
          confession every Sunday. It seemed...
          she had a lot to talk about.
          (beat, this is hard)
          Was she having an affair?
          Meacham removes his spectacles. Looks at Doc --

                         MEACHAM
          You know I can't say.
          And Doc DOES know. But there's a quiet DESPERATION here --

                         DOC
          The last thing I said to her... I...
          (shakes his head; then)
          Please. If I'm wrong about my wife... I
          don't want to die angry.
          Meacham sees the PAIN in his friend's eyes.

                         MEACHAM
          You can ask Maria if she was cheatin' on
          you once we get her back. 'Til then?
          (bit of a grin)
          Don't die.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.
          And OFF DOC, thunder CRACKS --

          INT. RIVERBOAT - COMMODORE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

          RAIN pours down through an open gash in the roof, splashing the
          floor. Ella enters, glances back toward the door to make sure
          she's alone, then pulls off her shirt and folds it over a stool.
          Upper body NAKED in the moonlight. We catch only a FLASH of
          this, and for a moment it's PURE HOTNESS...
          . until she turns and something ELSE is revealed: criss-
          crossed LASH MARKS on her back.
          She turns away and starts to SPLASH herself with water, erasing
          the blue goo and dirt from her skin and face... then: A MATCH
          ignites behind her. She WHIRLS, startled, covering her breasts
          with her arms -- JAKE is sitting in a chair at the Commodore's
          desk, casually lighting a cheroot in his mouth:

                         JAKE
          You missed a spot.

                         ELLA
          The hell,-re- you doing here?

                         JAKE
          Mindin' my own business.
          (snaps out the match)
          Then you decided to take a shower.

                         ELLA
          Why didn't you say anything?

                         JAKE
          Givin' you privacy.
          She throws her shirt on, but her skin's wet and the shirt glues
          to her, celebrating her shape in a way that can't be ignored.
          Jake tosses her his jacket. As she slips it on, she notices a
          bottle of WHISKEY on the table... and the PHOTOGRAPH OF ALICE.

                         ELLA
          . she's pretty.
          (Jake says NOTHING)
          Who was she?
          Jake's quiet. DARK. Intense emotion, intensely suppressed:

                         JAKE
          only thing I know's her name was Alice...

                         (THEN; DISTANT)
          And she's dead.
          Ella looks up at him. INTO him --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         ELLA
          Maybe you loved her.
          Jake shakes his head, sort of mumble/chuckles in RESISTANCE:

                         JAKE
          All you women are the same -- Always
          wanna make it about Goddamn "love."

                         ELLA

                         (A BEAT)
          Trust me, Lonergan. I'm not the same.
          There is a force -- a strength about this woman -- that he
          connects with. But remains, true to character, ALOOF:

                         JAKE
          Don't matter.
          She takes a step closer. Soft. Intimate.

                         ELLA
          So what dj= matter?
          Jake just looks at her. Then, lifts the cheroot to his lips,
          the FLARE of its tip casting him in a demonic light...

                         JAKE
          What matters is I find the thing that
          killed her.
          (dark as hell)
          And make it pay.
          And now, he leans forward with a focused LOOK... holds up his

                         BRACELET:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Where'd you see this before?
          A beat. Ella -- somehow CONTAINED -- opens her mouth to lie.
          But he cuts her off --

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          -- and don't lie to me. You wouldn't've
          asked me if you didn't recognize it.
          Ella tightens. PAIN in her eyes. And Jake REALIZES:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Those things... they the ones who put
          those marks on your back?
          She swallows: a mixture of SHAME that he's found her out... and
          ANGER at what was done to her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         ELLA
          They took my people. Destroyed where I'm
          from.

                         JAKE
          Where's that?

                         ELLA
          North of here. Been trackin' 'em ever
          since, town to town. Best I figure,
          they're hidin' in a mine.
          Jake CONSIDERS all this. Softens a little:

                         JAKE
          Maybe if you'd told me the truth instead
          of throwin' rocks at me --

                         ELLA
          -- what, you would've stuck around?
          Bullshit. I couldn't've turned you away
          from what you had to do, any more than I
          could've stopped these people from going
          after their kin.

                         (BEAT)
          Truth ain't worth a damn, Jake... and
          we're gonna need all the guns we can get.
          Their look HOLDS... until Jake SMIRKS. Likes her style:

                         JAKE
          So that's the only reason you wanted me
          to come with you? Cause of my gun?
          There's a pause... then Ella SMIRKS back:

                         ELLA
          No, not your gun.

                         (BEAT)
          What you do with it.
          Among the many things these two ate feeling -- both separately
          and together -- the one that pops right now is ATTRACTION.
          Confusing as it is for him. The pregnant moment LINGERS...
          Until Happy suddenly starts to GROWWWWL, sensing something
          outside. ANOTHER CRACK OF THUNDER as:

          INT. STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS

          The horses STAMP NERVOUSLY out the window as Greavey and the
          rest of Dolarhyde's men (COBBETT and 4 others) HUDDLE in secret
          conference -- whispers that sound a lot like MUTINY --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

                         GREAVEY
          What the hell're we doin' here? We
          should be ridin' in the opposite
          direction of those things --

                         COBBETT
          We do that, the old man's likely to shoot
          us himself. Only way outta this is --
          And suddenly. Greavey SNIFFS the air, FROWNS:

                         GREAVEY
          . what's that smell?
          -- as they TURN to the deck where the creature lays... ALL THEY

          FIND IS AN EMPTY TARP FLAPPING AIMLESSLY:

                         COBBETT

                         AW SH--
          LIGHTNING FLASHES, illuminating the ship -- and als4THE ALIEN
          behind them. a coiled mass clinging spiderlike to the ceiling!!!
          Its arm WHIPS out, noosing around Cobbett -- LIFTS HIM off his
          feet -- SLAMS HIM into the ceiling -- TOSSES HIM like a ragdoll:
          The men SHOUT -- a PAIR OF RAZOR SHARP CANINES extrude from the
          alien then it SPRINGS -- SLICING THROUGH TWO MEN AT ONCE --
          GREAVEY and 2 others manage to SCRAMBLE AWAY:

          INT. RIVERBOAT - VARIOUS - CONTINUOUS


          JAKE AND ELLA
          HEAR the SCREAMS -- Happy takes off -- they RACE after him --

          DOC AND MEACHAM
          Hear them too -- grabs their PISTOLS -- and Doc, his CANTEEN --
          DQIRHXPE_. 9oWQ n
          Colorado snatches up a WINCHESTER, LOADS IT, throws another one
          to Dolar -- who's suddenly, surprisingly, PROTECTIVE of Emmett:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Get behind me, Boy --
          THE ALIEN SPRINGS INTO THE ROOM -- landing upside down on the
          ceiling. Dolar FIRES at it --

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)

          RUN, KID! GIT!
          Emmett SCRAMBLES down a FLOOR HATCH, disappears as Dolar keeps
          FIRING -- but the alien BATS the gun away and LIFTS Dolar UP --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.
          Paralyzed with FEAR, he EXHALES a terrified GASP and --
          THE CREATURE RECOILS FROM HIS BREATH! HURLS Dolar aside --
          THROUGH THE FIRE -- embers catch CURTAINS and FLAMES SPREAD --
          COLORADO races in, throws a TOMAHAWK -- it PINS the alien's claw
          to the wall, the monster SHRIEKS as Nat draws a PISTOL but --
          The alien SPITS A STICKY RESIN GOB -- it HARDENS, pinning NAT'S
          hand with the pistol to the wall in return. He STRUGGLES as the
          alien ADVANCES --
          BOOM! The Alien's shoulder EXPLODES ORANGE FLUORESCENT BLOOD as
          a GUNSHOT rings out -- it's Dolarhyde, back on his feet aid
          FIRING -- the monster SCREECHES and leaps down, DISAPPEARING
          through the hatch where Emmett fled --

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)

          GODDAMMITT!!!
          And the fire's GROWING around the boat --

          INT. CRAWLSPACE - CONTINUOUS

          EMMETT moves FAST on hands-and-knees through a narrow CRAWLSPACE
          -- around a corner here -- another there -- a MAZE --

          SOMEWHERE BEHIND HIM -- THE ALIEN -- CRAWLING FAST --
          EMMETT -- reaches another HATCH -- pushes through and OUT:

          INT. RIVERBOAT BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS

          -- DROPPING onto the floor -- as we WHIP TO Jake racing in from
          around a corner -- but suddenly: THE ALIEN BURSTS FROM THE HATCH

          BEHIND EMMETT, SWEEPING HIM UP IN ITS CLUTCHES:
          Jake's bracelet OPENS UP into that BLASTER and it's AIMED at The
          Alien but the creature CUPS a hand around Emmett and LIFTS HIM
          off the floor, a TALONED FINGER pressed to the boy's THROAT:
          STANDOFF. ELLA rushes in. The creature sees her -- HISSES --

                         JAKE
          Don't know if you understand me... but
          you hurt that boy and I hurt you.

          CLOSE, EMMETT -- MUFFLED, TEARS LEAKING FROM HIS TERRIFIED EYES:

          MEACHAM (O.S.)

          I=.

          RACK FOCUS TO REVEALMEACHAM BEHIND THE ALIEN:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)

          BY THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD, GO BACK TO

          HELL, DEMON!
          Meacham brings his CANTEEN down like a HATCHET, SPRAYING the
          alien with HOLY WATER... but NOTHING happens! And then --
          The Alien STRIKES -- SLAMMING MEACHAM BACK INTO A JUTTING PIECE

          OF IRON, IMPALING HIM --

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)

          ! ! !
          The Alien SPRINGS through a doorway, TAKING EMMETT WITH IT.
          Ella RUSHES after it as Jake RUNS to Meacham, hanging impaled:

                         JAKE
          Easy, now... Don't move, dammit --

                         (TURNS; SHOUTING)

          DOC -- GET IN HERE NOW!

                         MEACHAM
          Go after the boy... then you get our
          people back...

                         JAKE
          Stop talking. DQW! GET YOUR ASS--
          But Meacham GRABS Jake, EYE TO EYE. GASPING:

                         MEACHAM
           Listen up... 'cause I'm not gonna be able
          to say it again --
          (pulls Jake CLOSE)
          God don't care who you were, Son... only
          who you Mg.
          ON JAKE. AFFECTED. With a last RASP, Meacham DIES just as DOC
          races through the growing FLAMES -- REACTS -- no time to mourn --

                         DOC

          JAKE -- WE GOTTA GO M!
          But Jake can't let go -- FURY -- HEARTBREAK -- Doc PULLS HIM
          away -- Jake SNAGS THE CRUCIFIX off Meacham's neck as he's
          forced OUT, leaving Meacham's body to be CONSUMED BY FLAMES --

          EXT. UPENDED RIVERBOAT - DESERT - NIGHT

          The boat is a BALL OF FIRE in the pouring rain, as what remains
          of our heroes stumble out, COUGHING, devastated... Jake, Doc,
          Dolarhyde, Colorado, Greavey, 2 GUNMEN... and Ella and Happy
          atop a DUNE, following a TRAIL OF FLUORESCENT ORANGE BLOOD
          streaking into the desert. Happy BARKING MADLY. Ella drops to
          a knee, touches the orange blood as it WASHES AWAY in the rain:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         ELLA

          RAIN'S GONNA COVER ITS TRACKS!

                         NAT COLORADO
          That thing... was dead... it was d-ead...
          DOLARHYDE, RAIN pouring down his face... VULNERABLE and GUILTY:

                         DOLARHYDE
          I couldn't stop it -- It just... grabbed
          the kid.
          ON JAKE. Rage-filled against the flames... Meacham's CRUCIFIX
          in his hared, as his FIST closes around it. Looks up, HARDCORE:

                         JAKE
          Then we'd better get him back.

                         SMASH TO:

          INT. STALACTITE CAVERN - NIGHT

          STALACTITES loom from the ceiling -- BAM! EMMETT is DROPPED on
          the floor of a sinister cave -- scrambles back from THE ALIEN:

                         EMMETT
          Damn. You are one ugly bastar--
          PSST! The alien spits a RESIN GOB on Emmett's mouth -- PSST
          PSST! More gobs PIN his limbs to the wall. Emmett can't move --
          can't speak -- eyes WIDE and TERRIFIED --
          The creature looks down at an ARMOR PLATE on its bicep. Touches
          a series of keys and the armor spits out what looks like...
          .. a small RUBIK'S CUBE made of some alien alloy.
          The creature casually TOSSES IT in the air where it FLOATS and
          starts to SPIN -- as it does, its sides FLIP AND TURN (like a
          Rubik's Cube) -- emitting HIGH-PITCHED SONAR BEEPS:
          This thing's some kind of HOMING BEACON.
          Off Emmett's WIDE, GAPING EYES...

          EXT. DESERT PLAINS - SUNRISE

          Our people RIDE FAST against the rising sun, on the hunt for
          Emmett. Colorado REARS his horse, kneels by a trace of ORANGE
          BLOOD on some rocks.

                         NAT COLORADO
          (looks off --)
          West.
          Greavey and the others share a LOOK. E o Turn to Dolar --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         GREAVEY
          Boss, only took one of them things to
          kill four of us. We got no chance here.
          Dolarhyde BURNS -- knowing he's being ABANDONED --

                         DOLARHYDE
          You're a goddamn coward.
          (to the others)
           You work for me, dammit. You're my
          m e 1 1 Qyees.
          And Greavey, finally FREE to speak his mind, says SPITEFULLY:

                         GREAVEY
          Fine line between a coward and a fool.
          The men turn tail and RIDE AWAY. Dolarhyde SHOUTS after them --

                         DOLARHYDE
          You're all FIRED!
          Doc takes the opportunity to TWIST the knife:

                         DOC
          Looks like they finally found something
          to be more scared of than you.
          Dolarhyde feels his world CRUMBLING away man by man...
          Ella trots alongside Jake, who's staring at that DARK CLOUD MASS
          overhead with a bad feeling:

                         JAKE
          Clouds've been moving east since sun-
          up... 'cept that one.
          ON ELLA. We SENSE she knows something, something more she isn't
          saying. SNAPS her reins and they RIDE OFF:

          INT. BOX CANYON - CONTINUOUS

          As the group gallops into a BOX CANYON, Happy starts BARKING
          MADLY -- the horses SLOW --

                         ELLA

                         SOMETHING'S WRON--
          BLAMBLAN1111 GUNSHOTS from above suddenly PEPPER the ground --
          the horses REAR and KICK UP, startled --
          A DOZEN FIGURES ON THE CLIFFS ALL AROUND THEM. Badass OUTLAWS
          with RIFLES aimed at our heroes. One of them CALLS DOWN:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         OUTLAW GUNMAN

          EVERYBODY DRAW YOUR GUNS SLOW AND TOSS

          'EM ON THE GODDAMNED GROUNDI

          SHIT.
          SLOWLY, Jake draws his gun... tosses it. Now the rest of them.
          As they SEE -- TWO RIDERS -- incoming -- from the other end of
          the canyon. Rifles aimed and ready. Happy GROWLS...
          One of the outlaws knocks back the hammer on his rifle --

                         OUTLAW
          I say we just shoot 'em and take their--
          But the words catch in his throat as his EYES WIDEN:

                         OUTLAW (CONT'D)
          . Boss?
          Sure enough, they're looking right at (BRONC
          -JAKE. Both outlaws
          and HUNT) lower their guns, hostility replaced by SURPRISE:

                         HUNT
          What the hell you doin' back here,
          Lonergan?
          Oh, Christ. This is JAKE'S gang. ON DOLARHYDE. ELLA.
          COLORADO. All registering it. And JAKE, of course, doesn't
          REMEMBER these men as Bronc dismounts, NERVOUS:

                         BRONC
          Jesus, Boss... Creek's gonna shit when he
          sees you.
          (then; re: the others)
          And who the hell're they?
          ON JAKE. Now does he handle this? Ht:nt rides up next to him,
          SUSPICIOUS, and for reasons yet to be known, UNFRIENDLY --

                         HUNT
          What's the matter, Jake. Cat got your--?
          SMACKI Jake moves LIGHTNING FAST, SLAPS Hunt across the face,
          stopping the question on his tongue -- CATCHES the gun as it
          drops and presses the barrel into Hunt's NECK:

                         JAKE
          Since when're Qy the one asking the
          goddamned questions!?!
          Ella and our people REACT as Jake plays it up, beat defense a
          good OFFENSE. The outlaws are SCARED: this is the Lonergan they
          know. Hunt holds his BLOODY MOUTH:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         HUNT
          Christ, Jake... You broke my tooth

                         JAKE
          Quit whining. Now bring me to the rest
          of the boys, if that meets with your
          goddamn approval.
          Bronc and Hunt nod, mounting up, SHOUTING to the OUTLAWS above:

                         BRONC

          LONERGAN'S BACK. MEET US AT THE CAMP!
          As they RIDE OFF, Dolarhyde looks to Jake and mutters:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Nice company you keep.

                         ELLA
          What the hell're you doing? If we don't
          catch up to that kid, we're never gonna--

                         JAKE
          They called me "Boss." You wanna go
          after these things with five or fifty?
          (off her look)
          Like you said: we can use every gun we
          can get.
          Qh. That actually makes SENSE. But --

                         ELLA
          What exactly're you gonna say to 'em?

                         JAKE

                         (A BEAT)
          Tell you when I figure it out.
          And he SPURS onward, leaving her to follow uneasily --

          INT. STALACTITE CAVERN - DAY


          CLOSE -- RUBIK'S CUBE -- STILL SPINNING MID-AIR AS:
          OUR ALIEN HANGS UPSIDE DOWN from stalactites by four spindly
          limbs. Mid sleep cycle. And inches below its head...
          EMMETT, still webbed to the wall. Unable to move or speak,
          TERRIFIED. As suddenly... the cube DEACTIVATES. And DROPS --
          THE CREATURE'S EYES SNAP OPEN. It SPRINGS from the ceiling as
          FOUR DARK SHAPES blot out light, GLIDING IN...

          MANTRA RAY HOVER SPEEDERS

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          A gang of FOUR MORE ALIENS dismounts. The biggest and STRONGEST
          -- their LEADER -- barks GUTTURAL CLICKS at the alien who
          kidnapped Emmett. Kidnapper explaining as it removes another
          STRANGE DEVICE. The device beams a HOLO-PROJECTION...
          OF ELLA'S FACE! The aliens HISS in furious RECOGNITION.
          JESUS... is this some kind of otherworldly WANTED POSTER?
          PLUMES fan out angrily from the Leader's HUGE, ELONGATED SKULL --
          like an indian headdress! The creature TURNS to Emmett --
          It's the alien who killed Jake's woman! We'll come to know it
          as... THE SLAVER.
          It MOVES OMINOUSLY for Emmett, grasping the HANDLE of something
          that UNCOILS with fluid, frightening speed:
          A WHITE-HOT LASER WHIP. This will be The Slaver's SIGNATURE
          WEAPON. It spirals to its full length, FLASHING out at --
          EMMETT -- MUFFLED SCREAM! But... the whip DOESN'T cut him,
          instead it SLICES THROUGH THE WEBBING that pins the boy to the
          wall. As Emmett FALLS, The Slaver SWEEPS HIM UP -- Emmett
          FLAILS, punching, kicking to no avail -- but then:

                         DOLARHYDE'S FLASK
          Tumbles from Emmett's pocket and SPLASHES WHISKEY on The Slaver
          -- IT.. S[iRIEM WILDLI-Aa THE BOOZE CONTACTS FLESH, SKIN SMOKING!
          EMMETT -- tumbles away. Terror turns to REVELATION as he PULLS
          the webbing from his mouth:

                         EMMETT
          Holy SHIT.
          Another alien LUNGES for the kid but Emmett SPLASHES him with
          the flask -- the alien RECOILS, flesh BUBBLING --
          Emmett whirls -- sees the HOVERBIKES -- JUMPS onto one, twisting
           desperately at the controls --- IiON-DO , ï¿½'T THIS TURNS,__
          WO ?!! Another Alien SCUTTLES in FAST -- Emmett's scrambling
          boots slide into the foot supports, which automatically WHIR
          CLOSED as the bike THROTTLES FORWARD... DECAPITATING THE ALIEN!
          The bike SPINS UNCONTROLLABLY, plasma thrusters SCORCHING WALLS
          and setting two more aliens ABLAZE! The speeder KAMIKAZE
          BOUNCES out of the cavern at 90 MPH, Emmett screaming!
          The Slaver SCREECHES FURIOUSLY as the remaining creatures LEAP
          back on their speeders and GIVE CHASE!

          EXT. GANG ENCAMPMENT - DAY


                         A TARANTULA

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.
          Climbing onto an old desert stump -- BLAM! It's SHOT OFF by a
          couple DRUNK OUTLAWS, swigging booze from STOLEN WHISKEY CRATES
          piled on a WAGON. We're in an OUTLAW CAMP: roughly 40 fast guns
          and saddle tramps. Tents. Horses. Ample weapons. And right
          now, most of them are GEARING UP to ride out for some reason...
          One of them, CREEK JOHNSON, with a chewed up face like swiss
          cheese, slides a RIFLE into his saddle and shouts to the drunks:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          Hey --- ï¿½s 4 Lay off that whiskey and
          saddle up. Flyer's on its way and we
          best damn be sober for it.

          HUNT (O.S.)
          Creek turns; sees HUNT and BRONC crest the hill with the other
          OUTLAWS from the cliffs. ANGRILY:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          'Bout time you got back.
          (re: Hunt's bloody nose)
          What the hell happened to you?!?
          Hunt nods over his shoulder --

                         HUNT
          He did.
          The outlaws part to reveal JAKE, riding in with Ella and the
          rest of our people. Creek's eyes NARROW, NOT happy to see him:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          well, shit.
          It gets very, VERY QUIET. Our people tread warily, knowing
          whatever reaction Jake's eliciting, it AIN'T GOOD. He runs the
          gaunt of ACCUSING GLARES. Smart enough to know that CREEK is
          the man in charge. Dismounts:

                         JAKE
          You don't look happy to see me, Creek.
          Creek eyes him. TOUGH. Clearly, HISTORY here:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          We're fixin' to rob us a train in about
          twenty minutes and you come ridin' in
          like nothin' ever happened?

                         (FUCK YOU)
          No. Lonergan. I ain't happy to see you.
          ON JAKE. How to navigate bad blood that he doesn't REMEMBER?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         JAKE
          Well I'm sure you'll get over it.
          Then, pretty much DISMISSING Creek, Jake turns, addresses the
          rest of the men. If he's their boss? Hï¿½ _gQDn&. CT LIR .ï¿½Tâ¢

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Nice to see you, Boys, but we're not
          going after a train -- We're going after
          something else.
          The men seem... . CONFUSED. Not sure what the hell is GOING ON.

                         BRONC
          But Jake... you-- you said you didn't
          wanna be in charge no more.
          And this is a REVELATION. Jake glances at ELLA -- has to keep
          IMPROVISING to hold his ground:

                         JAKE
          Well, I-- changed my mind. So saddle the
          hell up.

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          They're not going anywhere with you.
          Creek's heard enough. Strides forward, a direct CHALLENGE:

          CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)
          You got some balls on you -- walkin'
          outta here a week ago sayin' what you
          said and doin' what you did and then
          ridin' back in here and givin orders.
          Just who the hell do you think you are?
          The IRONY of the question isn't lost on Jake, as Creek walks
          right up to Ella. CLOSE. Violates her space: studies her with
          a mixture of curiosity and CONTEMPT.

          CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)
          So. Are you her?

                         ELLA
          Am I who?

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          The whore Jake quit this gang for.
          OH. Another piece of the puzzle falls into place -- Jake's eyes
          SNAP to Ella as they both REALIZE... the men think she's
          " e." Jake does his best to stay cool, meets Creek's stare:

                         JAKE
          Watch your mouth, Creek.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          Or what? These boys are with = now.
          jID in charge. You may be fast, but you
          are goddamned outgunned.
          ON JAKE. OUR HEROES. Shit. Jake turns to the men --

                         JAKE
          That a fact, Boys?
          But Creek doesn't wait for them to respond:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          Put your guns on the whore. He so much
          as twitches, blow her brains out her ear.
          AT ONCE, 10 GUNS ARE LEVELED AT ELLA'S HEAD. No doubt as to who
           the men are LOYAL to. But Jake locks into Creek, UNFLINCHING:

                         JAKE
          Call her a whore again, that'll be the
          last word you ever say.

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          You ain't in no position to make threats,
          asshole. Hunt: take his gun.
          Hunt reluctantly scrambles over to Jake, oh-so-carefully pulls
          the PISTOL from Jake's holster:

                         HUNT
          Sorry, Boss... nothin' personal.
          Creek now turns to BULL MCCADE, roughly the size of a BARN.

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          Put him down, Bull.
          And Jake barely has time to react as Bull lets fly with a
          JAWBREAKING HAYMAKER that about knocks Jake out of his BOOTSI
          Dolarhyde and Colorado WINCE as Jake hits the dirt with a THUD --
          Creek striding over, cock of the walk, LEANS over him:

          CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)
          Where the hell's our gold. Jake?
          "Gold?" Jake SPITS BLOOD, defiant:

                         JAKE
          Don't remember.
          Creek NODS to Bull: SMASH! Another devastating BLOW. ON ELLA --
          at GUNPOINT. Wishing she could intervene. DOC too.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          Well I _dg remember you tellin' us you was
          leavin' us high and dry because you were
          in love... You just left out the part
          about taking half our goddamned haul from
          the Yuma Bank. So I'm gonna ask you one
          last time -- Where. Is. Our. Gold?
          -- WHAM! Bull PUNCHES Jake so hard he FLIES OFF HIS FEET:

          CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)
          Man can't run away from who he ja,
          Lonergan... you really think you could go
          straight just cause you were fool enough
          to fall in love with some woman?
          WHAM! Bull PUNCHES Jake back into oblivion, and on the HIT we:
          MEMORY FLASECUTi PEACEFUL SILENCE -- two FACES staring at each
          other across a pillow -- Jake and ALICE, naked, in a WHOREHOUSE

                         BEDROOM SOMEWHERE:

                         ALICE
          You sure you wanna give it all up?
          ON JAKE. Clearly TORN. But just as clearly, in LOVE.

                         JAKE
          What about you? Once we're gone, you
          ain't ever comin' back.
          She touches his face so gently. And whispers:

                         ALICE
          You're the first person ever believed I
          was better than this place... so I gotta
          believe in y=.
          (and she KISSES him)
          You're a good man, Jake Lonergan.
          PRESENT: as the words "Good Man" ECHO back to Jake. Stir=g_
          ]1â1n as Creek GRABS Jake's hair and YANKS BACK, rears up a fist:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          You figgered you could steal from us?
          All that gold was yours to take co you
          could go off and start a new life?
          Creek's next PUNCH takes us to another:
          TORY FLASECUTI REPLAY -- Jake and Alice in the cabin -- he
          drops the SADDLEBAG -- it CLINKS to the floor. She's worried:

                         ALICE
          Your boys'ii come after you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         JAKE
          (dark, determined)
          Let 'em come.
          BACK TO PRESENT -- as now Jake UNDERSTANDS the context of this
          moment -- what they were saying to each other -- He looks up at
          Creek, BEATEN AND BUSTED UP:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Okay... okay, I remember now...
          ("fuck you" grin)
          Demons stole your gold, Creek. But when
          you get to hell, you can ask for it back.

                         CREEK JOHNSON

                         (TSK'S)
          Okay then. That's the way you wanna do
          this...

                         (TURNS)
          Kill the whore.
          ON THE GANG. As they all cock their guns -- Aimed at Ella --
          This is IT --
          JAKE -- slowly lifts his head, suddenly RAGE-FILLED as --

          HIS WRIST BRACELET ACTIVATES! BLAMMMM11! A SEARING PULSE BLAST

          FIRES, VAPORIZING CREEK JUST BEFORE HE PULLS THE TRIGGER!
          EVERYONE'S FACES. Holy shit. Jake spits on the around between
          the SMOKING BOOTS that formerly belonged to Creek:

                         JAKE
          Told you not to call her that.
          ON JAKE. Pure KILLER. As he turns his weapon on the rest of
          the (awestruck) gang -- through BLOODY TEETH:

                          JAKE (CONT'D)
          You're all riding with me. Any one of
          you decides otherwise? So help me God,
          I'll kill you where you stand.

                         (AND THEN)
          I'm j2acj& and I'M in goddamne.d
          The gang quickly flips: "Absolutely, Jake/ Whatever you say,
          Boss..." Jake turns to the speechless Bull McCade and KICKS HIM
          IN THE BALLS as hard as he can, doubling him over.
          Now he meets eyes with ELLA. She can't help SMIRKING, grateful.
          DOC. Is the only one NOT looking at Jake. His attention drawn
          toward a SOUND coming from the distant DUNES --

                         DOC
          Dios mio.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

          A SPEEDER IS ROARING TOWARD THEM BOUNCING OVER DESERT:

                         DOLARHYDE
          (squints, realizing...)
          Jesus... it's the kid.
          As Emmett ROARS IN, the shocked outlaws SCATTER:

                         EMMETT

          THEY'RE COMING!!!! THEY'RE COMING!!!
          The kid TUMBLES off the speeder as it PLOWS RIGHT THROUGH CAMP,
          kicking up DIRT and UPENDING SUPPLIES. As Emmett scrambles up --

          VROOOM! FOUR MORE SPEEDERS ROAR OVER THE CREST IN PURSUIT OF

          EMMETT! THE ALIENS FROM THE CAVE!

                         JAKE

          EVERYBODY MOOOOVE!!!

          STEEL COLLARS START FLYING, ATTACHED TO ROPING CABLES -- BEFORE

          THE GANG KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING, THEY'RE BEING GRABBED AND

          DRAGGED AWAY!
          Those who have their wits about them FIRE BACK, trying to hit
          the flying machines. CROSSFIRE. CONFUSION.

                         THE SLAVER
          His speeder GROWLS to a halt. Dismounting like a killer biker.
          ON JAKE. As he SEES that horrible alien face across the crowd:
          QUICK BIT: Alice dying in his arms. And this same damn THING is
          the one responsible for it. And we're:
          BACK TO PRESENT. Jake's eyes LOCKED on the SLAVER as he says:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          You.

          BUT THE ACTION COMES ROARING BACK AS:
          Outlaws start FIRING at the Slaver, who REACTS in mere
          annoyance. Flicks open a POUCH on his bandolier for what look
          like THUMB TACKS -- throws them and they tan out, PIERCING THE
          NECKS of the outlaws, activating "Blue":
          !NTLY E ZE. TUR an
          The Slaver draws a ROL) that TELESCOPES into a SIX FOOT LANCE --
          KA-TCHING! BARBED ENDS snap out and the alien runs on two
          limbs, then FOUR -- LEOPARD-LIKE for speed -- rises back up and
          SMASH! SHATTERS each man into a million Pieces. Now he uses
          the bladed-ends to SKEWER five more outlaws and turns --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

          MEETING JAKE'S EYES IN MUTUAL RECOGNITION -- SCREECHES:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)

                         (TO DOLARHYDE)
          Find cover!!!
          Jake FIRES his pulse blaster, providing cover as DOLAR, DOC,
          EMMETT, and ELLA rush to hide behind the WAGON. The Aliens FIRE
          BACK as LASER CROSSFIRE shreds the camp -- EXPLOSIONS and CHAOS:
          THREE OUTLAWS scramble to form a GATLING CREW. It SPINS to
          life, MOWING DOWN tents as they try to hit the aliens --

                         ANOTHER ALIEN
          Hurls a boomerang-like "SMART WEAPON." It circles past the
          GATLING COWBOYS, BACK into the alien's hand as:

          THE TOP HALVES OFTHE_COWBOYS SLIDE OFF, SEVERED AT THE WAIST,'.
          An EXPLOSION blows one of whiskey crates open on the wagon:

                         EMMETT

          USE THE WHISKEY! IT BURNS EM!

                         ELLA

          -- WHAT?!

                         EMMETT

          LIKE ACID ON THEIR SKIN!!!
          Ella REACTS -- WHAT? As an alien SKITTERS toward her, she grabs
          a bottle and HURLS IT -- it EXPLODES all over the creature! A
          HORRIBLE SCREECH as its skin smokes, thrashing epileptically --

                         ELLA

                         (REVELATION)
          Oh my GOD --

                         DOLARHYDE

          LET'S GO!!!
          Our people ESCAPE for the horses. Doc climbs up on the WAGON
          buckboard and pulls EMMETT in the seat beside him --
          As ELLA leaps on a horse --

                         THE SLAVER
          Climbs back on his speeder and GUNS FOR HER, firing a STEEL
          COLLAR -- Jake turns -- SEES THIS. Starts RUNNING MADLY:

                         JAKE

          ELLA!!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          Too late: KA-CHANK! The collar CLAMPS her neck, RIPPING ELLA
          OFF HER HORSE! The CABLE snaps back and attaches to the
          hovercraft as it ZIPS by, DRAGGING ELLA BACKWARD LIKE A WATER

          SKIER BEHIND A SPEEDBOAT!
          ON JAKE -- FURY -- HIS BRACELET ACTIVATES! And there's a LOGIC
          here we'll come to realize, as he KICKS his horse into a gallop:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)

          HYAA!

          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUOUS

          ELLA'S DRAGGED BEHIND THE SPEEDER. Hands GRASPING at the
          magnetic collar as it HALF-CHOKES HER, yet keeps her upper body
          SUSPENDED just oft the ground while her heels BOUNCE HARSHLY --

          JAKE ON THE HORSE
          Riding hard -- aims his BLASTER, trying to get a TARGET on the
          CABLE linking Ella's collar to the speeder -- fires -- MISSES!
          The Slaver TILTS VERTICAL to fly through a narrow CANYON
          ENTRANCE as Ella's fingers reach wildly for THE BOWIE KNIFE on
          her belt. She starts CUTTING THE CABLE, trying to FREE HERSELF:
          WHOOSH! The speeder BLASTS out the other side of the canyon,
          Jake still in pursuit but suddenly...

          THE UNION PACIFIC LOCOMOTIVE IS CURVING AROUND A CORNER, RACING
          RIGHT FOR THEM! This is the train Jake's gang was gonna rob!

          INT. UNION PACIFIC EXPRESS CAR - CONTINUOUS

          Two PINKERTONS sit by a SAFE. LOOK UP at an unidentified ROAR --

                         PINKERTON #1
          You hear.that?

                         PINKERTON #2
          How many times I gotta tell you, Leonard.
          No one'd be stupid enough to rob this tr--

          SWWWWWM. IN THE WINDOW BEHIND THEM... THE SPEEDER BLASTS BY.

          GOING AGAINST THE TRAIN, ELLA BOUNCING BEHIND IT.
          When the Pinkertons SNAP around, Ella's GONE... but now they SEE
          JAKE -- ON HORSEBACK -- FLASHING PAST in pursuit!

                          PINKERTON #2 (CONT'D)
          1 stand corrected.
          They DRAW GUNS, running to see what's happening and --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

          EXT. UNION PACIFIC TRAIN - KID AIR AT 80 MPH - CONTINUOUS

          As the speeder SKIMS alongside the train, ELLA keeps struggling
          painfully to CUT HER COLLAR CABLE. Jake FIRES again, MISSES the
          cable but DETONATES THE SIDE OF A TRAIN CAR:

          INT. UNION PACIFIC - TRAIN CAR - CONTINUOUS

          The wall EXPLODES INWARD on the Pinkertons -- hurt, but ALIVE --

          EXT. UNION PACIFIC TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

          The speeder's SHAKEN. The Slaver GROWLS as he fights for
          balance. Reaches the TRAIN'S END, skims past the caboose and --

          DAMNIT. THE SLAVER ARCS BACK AROUND IN A WIDE U-TURN, SLOTTING

          IN FOR COVER BEHIND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TMINâ¢,=_`T1.2AVF.LLING,.J

          THE SAME DIRECTION NOW!

          ELLA'S FLUNG WILDLY BY THE HAIRPIN TURN! SHE DROPS THE KNIFE,

          IT CLATTERS AWAY! HER ONLY MEANS OF ESCAPE GONE!

                         JAKE'S POV:
          Through a slot between boxcars, the speeder BLURS in the
          opposite direction. Up ahead comes the CABOOSE. No more TRAIN:
          Thinking FAST, Jake LEAPS off his horse -- CATCHES A LADDER RUNG
          ON THE CABOOSE'. Teeth gritted, starts to CLIMB up onto:

          EXT. TOP OF UNION PACIFIC TRAIN CAR - CONTINUOUS

          Jake JUMPS from car to car -- over LOGS in a TENDER CAR --
          BLAM BLAM!!! The PINKERTONS are climbing to the roof, WEAPONS
          FIRING -- Jake loses footing, ROLLING off the side --

          EXT. SIDE OF TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

          -- but CATCHES another ladder rung and he DANGLES, looks DOWN:

          ELLA IS RIGHT UNDER HIM, DRAGGING BEHIND THE SPEEDER! HE

          REACHES OUT --

                         JAKE

          TAKE MY HAND!
          She GRUNTS WITH EXERTION as their fingers GRAZE each other and
          The Slaver SNAPS AROUND. Hurls a SMART DISC at Jake -- no
          choice, he LETS GO of the LADDER -- HITS the ground PAINFULLY

          THE PINKERTONS RUSH TO THE ROOF EDGE
          -- SXLSKLISH! The disc VIVISECTS THEM THEN CIRCLES BACK AROUND,
          cutting the IRON STRAPS that secure the logs in the tender car --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

          THE LOGS START ROLLING OFF THE TOP. CRASHING DOWN ON THE
          SPEEDER. It SPIRALS end-over-end, CRASHING into the desert!
          ON JAKE. He picks himself up, WINCING. Sees the SMOKING WRECK
          in the distance. Starts to limp, then RUN --

          EXT. CRASHED SPEEDER - CONTINUOUS

          Jake APPEARS through the smoke. No sign of The Slaver. Then --
          FALLING ROCKS turns his look upward. Though WOUNDED, the alien
          is SCALING a rock-face. Turns... a look that says "Next time."
          Then in a BLUR, it's GONE. Jake's blaster REVERTS into a
          bracelet. When the smoke clears:
          ELLA is revealed on the ground, thrown from the speeder. Jake
          REACTS -- EQ -- takes her in his arms.
          She desperately tries to SAY SOMETHING... but goes LIMP.

                         JAKE
          Ella...?
          Her head just falls back. Yeah. Hard to swallow, but it's
          true. ELLA'S DEAD. And if this moment ECHOES Jake holding his
          dead wife, well that's just fine. He stares beseechingly as...
          HOOFBEATS. The rest of our people gallop in: Colorado,
          Dolarhyde, Doc and Emmett in the wagon:

                         EMMETT
          Aw no... is she --?
          Jake looks up -- unhinged --

                          NAT COLORADO
           We need to get out of here NOT.

          JAKE NAT COLORADO
          Not gonna leave her here -- L4Re.Xam --
          -- I'M NOT LEAVIN' HER! -- This is Apache territory!
          They catch us, they'll kill u--
          THHHHHHHUNKI The air SCREAMS as an ARROW pierces the ground
          inches from Jake's hand! Suddenly THIRTY MORE -- ALL AROUND
          THEM -- forming an instant circle perimeter as --
          APACHE WARRIORS FLASH DOWNHILL. Dolar dismounts, swings Emmett
          to the ground --

          NAT COLORADO (CONT'D)
          Nobody move.
          Jake and Emmett freeze. The Apaches are ALL AROUND THEM.
          Fierce. BOWS and TOMAHAWKS drawn -- OFF THIS:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

          EXT. ARIZONA MOUNTAINS - TWILIGHT

          The sun DIPS behind the mountains... NIGHT FALLS...

          INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON ELLA'S DEAD FACE. Still. Beautiful. FIND JAKE, on
          his knees beside her, hands bound in front of him. An INDIAN
          WOMAN finishes wrapping the body in a shroud and LEAVES.
          Jake is alone. Overwhelmed. Raw. Something rising in him.
          Something he COULDN'T FACE... until this moment:.

                         JAKE
          I remember now.

                         (THEN; SOFTLY)
          I-- I did love her.
          And just saying it, saying those words, brings a swell of
          EMOTION to the surface... but he FIGHTS it. A losing battle, as
          his eyes WELL:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          She was like you. Seemed to think I was
          a good man.
          (finally, voice almost

                         CRACKS)
          But I couldn't save either of you.
          A beat... his bound hands gently touch her face...

          JAKE (CONT' D )
          Where's the good in that?
          His eyes CLOSE. Too much.

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, Ella.
          And that sits... then suddenly -- JARRINGLY -- THREE MORE BRAVES
          roughly enter, pull Jake up, FORCE HIM out:

          EXT. APACHE ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

          BAN! Our people are THROWN TO THEIR KNEES in a large CIRCLE OF
          APACHES. GUARDED by warriors with tomahawks and -- WHOOSH! A
          PYRE is ignited and if we ever had any doubt about Ella being
          dead, the BRAVES carry her roughly past --

                         JAKE

          HEY! GODDAMMIT DON'T YOU TOUCH--
          -- he's YANKED BACK and held in place as... ELLAIg BODY IS
          THROWN RIGHT INTO THE FLAMES. Jake helplessly watches her BURN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         EMMETT
          Wasn't your fault, Mr. Lonergan.
          Those things... were lookin' for her.
          Had a picture and everything.
          That breaks the spell. Jake looks over --

                         JAKE
          What d'you mean... 'a picture'?

                         EMMETT
          Floatin', like that arrow thing we found
          in its eye.
          Before Jake can makes sense of this, a teepee smoke flap OPENS
          and out steps the tribe's SACHEM. This is GREY WOLF -- dark,
          wrinkled face enhanced by TATTOOS. He takes one look at his
          prisoners and SPEAKS A FEW WORDS OF APACHE.

                         DOC
          What'd he say?

                         COLORADO
          "Kill them. And make it quick."
          Doc is amply freaked. Turns to Jake as FIVE OF THE BRAVES move
          for them, MENACING --

                         DOC
          Now'd be a good time to use your gun
          bracelet, my friend.
          But Jake is VACANT. BROKEN. All the fight seems GONE from him.
          His bracelet DOESN'T MOVE.
          Dolarhyde's grabbed first... PULLED FORWARD by one of the
          braves, raising his TOMAHAWK -- they're really gonna KILL HIM --

                         DOLARRYDE

                         (SUBTITLED)

          SOP. DON'T DO THIS.
          SURPRISED looks from just about everyone in the camp (besides
          Colorado) as we realize Dolarhyde just spoke APA
          ON GREY WOLF -- INTRIGUED as he approaches Dolarhyde:

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          How is it that you speak our language?

                         UOLARHYUE (SUBTITLE)
          Because I'm a damn genius.
          Grey Wolf's fascinated this man has the audacity to be a WISEASS
          given his circumstances. Turns to the Brave with the tomahawk --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          Forget about quick. Make him feel it.
          The Brave NODS, RAISES the Tomahawk again, but Dolar interrupts:

                         DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
          Two hundred head of cattle!
          Grey Wolf holds up his hand, halting the Brave's death blow --

          DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) (CONT'D)
          I'll have two hundred head of cattle u_a
          here in a day's time if you let me go.
          ON GREY WOLF. Considering this.

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          And how do I know you'll come back?
          Dolarhyde nods to Colorado --

                         DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
          You can keep my associate here. if I
          don ' t come back, you can kill him.
          Colorado REACTS. He's the only one here who knows what the hell
          these two are saying to each other as Grey Wolf approaches
          Dolar, looks right INTO HIM --

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          Why should I believe that you even care
          about this man?
          Dolarhyde's eyes flash EMOTION. Quickly bottled. Then:

                         DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
          Because he's my son.
           Wow. Didn't see that one coming. Grey Wolf levels Colorado
          with those unyielding eyes --

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          Is this true?
          And Colorado answers in ENGLISH, for the benefit of the others:

                         COLORADO
          Yeah... he's my father.
          REACTIONS. JAKE. EMMETT. DOC. Stunned silence. And so:

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          Three hundred head.
          Dolar looks to Colorado, who won't meet his eyes. His FATHER's
          eyes. Turns back to Grey Wolf, HARD --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
          Two fifty.
          HOLD ON GREY WOLF for a beat. Then --

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          Cut him loose.
          The Brave does exactly that. Dolar's FREE to go...

                         EMMETT
          Hey! What about =?!?
          ON DOLAR. A FLASH of regret. But it's gone fast.

                         DOLARHYDE
          What about you, kid?
          And he just walks out of the camp, leaving his son behind...
          GONE. And now, it's back to business --

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          Kill all of them except the half-breed.
          Our people are GRABBED. Jake's yanked forward, PINNED DOWN -- a
          Brave raises a HATCHET to kill Jake, who glares back with
          lunatic eyes. Ready to die. Almost wanting it:

                         JAKE
          What're you waiting for, asshole? DO IT.
          And as Jake's about to MEET HIS DEATH:

          FWOOM! THE PYRE SUDDENLY BILLOWS, TURNING FROM ORANGE TO GREEN

          TO WHITE -- EVERYONE BACKS AWAY AS --

          ELLA EMERGES FROM THE PYRE. WRAPPED IN A CAUL OF FIRE AND LIGHTI
          Except she isn't exactly Ella. She's a HUMANOID, incredibly
          close to us in physical appearance, her features acutely
          feminine, yet... ALJM.
          PANDEMONIUM. The Apache kneel in prostration, DROPPING weapons
          as flames DISSIPATE off Ella's backlit form. Her skin RETURNS
          to human flesh-tone. Hair too. When she finally STOPS, she
          looks like the ELLA we've come to know and love. STANDS there:

                         ELLA
          . what... happened?
          ON JAKE. Holy. SHIT. Everyone else equally STUNNED.

                         EMMETT
          You... died.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          Ella looks around. Fifty dumbstruck faces staring at her.

                         ELLA

                         (QUIETLY; CAUGHT)
          . oh.
          OFF ELLA, who's got a helluva lot to explain --

          INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT

          A deerskin shirt slips down over Ella's naked body.' A dark
          breechcloth is tied. She TURNS to us.: beautiful as ever.

          EXT. TEEPEE - NIGHT

          Ella emerges to find... JAKE. Standing outside.the teepee.
          HARD. And for a long moment, nothing is said. Until she takes
          a step TOWARD him:

                         ELLA
          If I'd told you on the boat, you never
          would'a trusted me --
          -- but he takes a step BACK. If he's relieved she's alive, he
          isn't showing it:

                         JAKE
          Did you hear what I said?

                         ELLA
          .. What?

                         JAKE
          When you were playin' possum. Did you
          hear what I mid?
          He's angry. Yes, even embarrassed. And because of it,
          something has SHUT DOWN in him again. That killer look is back.

                         ELLA
          No. I was mendin'.

                         (BEAT)
          It's like sleep.
          His eyes narrow, trying to understand:

                         JAKE
          How's it you look like one of us?

                         ELLA
          I can look like whatever I want to.

                         JAKE
          So you can't die?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         ELLA
          Sure I can. If my heart stops beating...
          just like you.

          .JAKE
          You're nothin' like me, Ella. You're
          one'a them.
          we can see that hurt her. But she deserved it, too. So
          desperately wants to reach him...

                         ELLA
          I'm not, Jake. I'm from a different
          place.
          He isn't sure what that means. Can he even trust her? Either
          way, she has ANSWER;. Darkly:

                         JAKE
          The one that took you.

                         (BEAT)
          It killed her.
          That LANDS on her. Knowing and painful.

                         ELLA
          They call him The Slaver. He's the one,
          gave me the scars. Broke me. And made
          me watch... while he killed my family
          too.
          Even with his guard up... Jake can't help but be STRUCK. As the
          sound of HOWLING WIND takes us to:

          EXT. BOX CANYON - RIM - NIGHT

          A SANDSTORM... through which a GHOSTLY FIGURE materializes...
          THE SLAVER. Moving with angry purpose toward the CANYON BLUFF.
          As he looks down into it, we hear the SOUNDS of MACHINERY below.
          But we DO__QT.YET_ REVEAL what it_ is__ he sees.
          He stalks down, LEAVING FRAME -- as we HOLD on the field of

          TWINKLING STARS ---

          ELLA (V.0.)
          For every drop of light in the sky,
          there's another world. Filled with
          life...

          EXT. APACHE CAMP - MINUTES LATER - NIGHT

          Ella's in front of the campfire, surrounded by EVERYONE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         ELLA
          Our race was first to map the stars...
          that's why they came for us. Took our
          planet, piece by piece. Slaughtered
          anyone who fought hack. Ones who
          survived were turned into slaves.
          Trackers.
          She says this meeting the eyes of GREY WOLF. There's immediate
          SIMPATICO here: a story the Indians could be telling.

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          They brought me aboard one of their scout
          ships -- a ship with only one purpose: to
          find other planets like mine. Planets
          they can take... people they can enslave.
          As the terrible gravity of all this HITS everyone, JAKE is first
          to understand...

                         JAKE
          X lead 'em here.
          Ella swallows. Wracked with GUILT.

                         EMMETT
          Well damn, lady, thanks a 1.

                         ELLA
          I never wanted this.
          (an EMOTIONAL beat)
          But they got... ways. Of making you do
          things.
          Her eyes are HAUNTED with memory. The inference is some kind of
          TORTURE. She pushes it away -- staying strong:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          Been tryin' to make it right... tried to
          blow the ship to hell by burnin' up all
          their fuel, then escaped down here.

                         (BEAT)
          'Cept it didn't work... damn thing
          survived.

                         JAKE
          Where is it.
          Jake's determined -- he's got his OWN agenda. Ella looks up to
          that OMINOUS CLOUD. Those BLUE LIGHT FLASHES ripple within:

                         ELLA
          Hiding in that cloud. Way I figure,
          they'll find enough fuel to leave by
          tomorrow, midday. Then they'll bring
          back the others.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         DOC
          "others"?

                         ELLA
          The whole fleet. They'll take what they
          need. Everyone on this planet. Anything
          too weak to survive... they'll toss.
          Like that cow.
          Tomorrow. Midday. Hi noon. This is bad, bad news.

                         NAT COLORADO
          What'd you mean, they're looking for
          "fuel"...?
          And before Ella can answer, Jake already GETS IT:

                         JAKE
          Gold. That's why they're in a mine.

                         ELLA
          (NODS, solemn)
          . wherever it is, that's where you
          escaped from -- and it's the only way
          back up to the ship.

                         (STEPS CLOSER)
          Even with your memory wiped, your
          instincts kicked in --

                         (HIS BRACELET:)
          That's how it works, Jake, the bracelet
          reads your impulse -- you wanna fight, it
          reacts. Somehow you took it off one of
          'em... don't you remember any of it?
          ON JAKE. Deeply STIRRED. As he looks down at the BRACELET and:
          MEMORY FLASBCUTSI REPLAY POV as we're HELD DOWN in that CAVE
          the TERRIFYING OCULAR PROBE lowers right in front of our eyes
          One of the ALIENS starts to activate the probe -- it begins to
          FLASH STEADILY -- HYPNOTICALLY -- PUvTNG OUR MIND --
          But our arm manages to BREAK FREE -- a BLADE hidden in our
          sleeve -- WE SLASH OFF THE. ALIEN'S HAND -- GRAB THE BRACELET off
          its severed limb -- it COILS around our wrist and ACTIVATES:
          BLAM SLAM! We BLAST the creature to oblivion -- we're FREE!
          JAKE IN PRESENT -- Eyes ALIVE with MEMORY:

                         JAKE
          I-- I blasted my way out...
          MEMORY FLASHCUTI REPLAY POV as we RUN through the cavern --
          ESCAPE -- a LIGHT at the end of the tunnel -- BLINDING SUN hits
          us as we emerge -- our eyes ADJUST to see:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.
          That STRANGE ROCK FORMATION HIGH ABOVE on the edge of a CANYON --
          the STONE TOWER pointing to heaven --
          JAKE IN PRESENT: The sequencing is COMPLETE for him now:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          I remember seeing a tower... made of
          stone... on the rim of a canyon...
          Upon hearing that, Grey Wolf suddenly speaks in animated
          gestures, pointing North. Colorado REACTS:

                         ELLA
          What? What's he sayin'?!?
          Colorado turns to Jake, a flicker of HOPE:

                         COLORADO
          That rock you're talkin' about... he-
          knows where it is.

          INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - NIGHT

          The Slaver ENTERS the gloom of an UNDERGROUND CAVERN. Two
          ALIENS melt from the dark to greet him with frightening HISSES.
          SENTRIES. We HOLD on the walls as something GLITTERS: GOLD.

          INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN - SOMEWHERE

          CLOSE ON SHERIFF TAGGART'S REFLECTION IN MURKY WATER. As we
          TILT UP to reveal him hanging UPSIDE DOWN. Eyes flutter open.
          He's seen better days. Dazed. Turns his head slightly...

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          You... all right...?
          DRIFTING over to see MARIA. Gravity PULLING her hair downward.
          Groggy. Mostly SCARED:

                         MARIA

                         (BRAVE FACE)
          . Fantastic. You?

          CAMERA SLOWLY TURNS, ROTATING 180 DEGREES, TO REVEAL THEY'RE
          STUCK TO THE CEILING OVER A WATER GROTTO. The whole town of
          Absolution is here... a hundred others from the now-cratered
          town of Winfield's Landing, feet embedded in the ORANGE RESIN.
          Suddenly, PERCY DOLARHYDE sees a TERRIFYING SHADOW spread across
          the wall -- what looks like a HUGE, COILING SNAKE:

                         PERCY DOLARHYDE

          H-- HEY!!! THE HELL'S THA--?!
          -- but what comes around the corner is a LONG METAL TENTACLE:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.
          A SCANNING MECHANISM on its tip shoots out a blue triangular
          beam -- itemizing specimens -- SELECTING ONE: SHERIFF TAGGART.
          Mechanized TALONS open up -- Taggart SCREAMS as he's PLUCKED
          from the ceiling like an apple from a TREE:

          DEPUTY CHARLIE WADE

          KYLE!!!!
          ANOTHER METAL TENTACLE slithers in and GRABS WADE -- swinging
          our men across the cavern where we reveal...
          . the tentacles are attached to a TERRIFYING ALIEN MACHINE.
          Taggart and Wade are PINNED DOWN on what looks like an operating
          table. As they thrash, RESTRAINING CLAMPS enfold their skulls.
          An OCULAR PROBE looms _Q.Xpr. them, This is the image _ e.'_A_beM1_
          seeing! This is what haRpened to him before he escaRe !
          WORKER-BEE ALIENS adjusts the device over their eyes -- INSTANT
          X-RAYS read their retinas -- HYPNOTIC -- as the men grow DOCILE
          and LIMP despite their fight and -- FLASHFLASHTLASHI
          The probe has ERASED THEIR MINDS. Catatonic stares.
          Now the machine arms slip the men into separate TRANSLUCENT
          CAPSULES. METAL BREATHING TUBES are implanted down their
          throats as the capsules begin to fill with a THICK, BLUE LIQUID.
          This is the same blue goo -- a protective gel -- that housed the
          COW in that jettisoned cocoon in the desert.
          More Worker Bees load the cocoons into TRANSPORT SHUTTLECRAFTS.
          We see containment holds filled with BLEATING COWS and REARING
          HORSES... all going through a similar cocooning process.
          All of this is overseen by THE SLAVER, who stalks up a ramp
          behind the cocoons. The craft HUMS to life, undergear
          retracting as it ROARS OFF down the tunnel...

          EXT. CANYON RIM - DANN

          Our people ride up a rocky slope with a few Apaches. Grey Wolf
          looks around and SPEAKS, Colorado translates:

                         NAT COLORADO
          This is Kiowa land, their sister tribe.
          As they near the bluff, Jake sees the STONE TOWER. Dismounts:

                         JAKE
          That's it.
          As they near the bluff, they hear the growing sound of that
          MACHINERY. Everyone dips low, peering over to see...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.
          What looks a whole lot like a CAVALRY FORT in the canyon below,
          amid a network of trenches and underground tunnels. Except this
          fortress is made of some kind of ALIEN ALLOY, glowing impossibly
          bright as its steel surface reflects the rising sun.
          DRILLING MACHINES are chewing deep into the earth, mining for

          GOLD -- THESE ARE THE SAME DRILLS THAT LANDED IN OUR OPENING.
          Massive receptacles are FILLED with HUGE CHUNKS.
          ALIENS move in and out, working, as if from an ant hive.

                         DOC
          Holy Jesus. Like a damn fort.
          Grey Wolf looks to his men, GRAVE, CRESTFALLEN as he realizes:

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          The Kiowa... they were taken too.
          Suddenly, the ROOF of the steel structure blossoms open like a
          CHROME LOTUS... and WHOOSH! The SHUTTLE TRANSPORT flies out of
          the canyon, RISING into the dawn sky...

                         ELLA
          Transports. Way they get people and gold
          back and forth to the ship.

                         DOC
          Place is crawling with those things.
          We'll never even get close.
          Grey Wolf SPEAKS --

                         NAT COLORADO
          He says there's a back way in... The Twin
          Rivers run underneath this whole canyon.
          Limestone tunnels up by the falls, couple
          miles East. Lead right down there.
          Jake looks to the SKY. DARK. DETERMINED.

                         JAKE
          The Slaver... he's up in that big cloud?
          Ella nods, HARD. Off their SHARED DETERMINATION, our SCORE
          rises. A DRUM CADENCE that suggests a MISSION starting to form:

          DOC. Skeptical, eyes narrow -- staring at Jake and Ella --
          surrounded by our team and the Apaches back at the APACHE CAMP:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         DOC
          Just so I got this straight... three of
          those things just kicked the shit out of
          your entire gang, took our whole town,
          and now you two're gonna ride right into
          that fort, try to hijack one'a those--
          He pauses on the word --

                         ELLA
          "Transports."

                         DOC
          -- ride it up to that space boat --

          Spaceshp.

                         DOC
          Then bring it down here and get everybody
          off alive? That's your big plan?
          Jake and Ella share a LOOK. Simply:

                         JAKE
          Yup.

                         DOC
          And just how do you figure on getting in
          there in the first place?

                         JAKE
          Poke a hornet's nest... they swarm
          at'cha.

                         ELLA
          You gotta draw 'em out. Buy us a
          distraction.
          A long beat of incredulous, do-you-believe-this-shit STARES:

                         DOC
          You want us to storm that fort? Against
          those things? With less than fifty men?
          It's suicide.

                         EMMETT
          It ain't, it's been done! I read at
          school how Ethan Allen and his Green
          Mountain Boys took Fort Ticonderoga, they
          weren't but a small garrison and they
          were outgunned --

                         ELLA
          We need all of you to make a stand.
          Together. It's the only way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         NAT COLORADO
          Make a stand with what?
          Jake turns to the WAGON they rode from Jake's gang camp -- the
          WHISKEY CRATES. Sweeps up a bottle:

                         JAKE
          This.
          An impossible mission. Sure death. Yet for the first time...
          they have an ADVANTAGE. Emmett cuts the moment with a BIG GRIN:

                         EMMETT
          Hell, yeah. Let's squish some bugs.
          Grey Wolf CHUCKLES, murmurs. Jake looks to Nat for translation:

                         JAKE
          Somethin' funny?

                         NAT COLORADO
          Yeah... that you whites finally know what
          it feels like to face extinction. Now
          that we're on the same side, he says we
          can all die together.

                         (THEN)
          They're with us.
          The LOOK holds between them --

                         JAKE
          Guess that means you're not waitin' for
          your dad to come back.
          Colorado's face CLOUDS. Years of ANGER and RESENTMENT:

                         NAT COLORADO
          Been Woodrow Dolarhyde's son my whole
          life... first time he ever copped to it
          was to save his own ass.
          (not without emotion)
          He's not comin' back.
          And as Colorado TURNS away, the PERCUSSION finds another GEAR --

          MONTAGE -- OUR CLAN PREPARES FOR BATTLE:
          Pieces of CLOTH are RIPPED, stuffed inside the WHISKEY BOTTLES.

          MOLOTOV COCKTAILS...
          Emmett works with Apaches and their KIDS, roping WOOD together
          to build LADDERS and CATAPULTS...
          WAR PAINT is applied to faces in DARK STREAKS...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.
          Jake slips on his coat. Sees Emmett lead a horse to mount up
          with his BOW and ARROW QUIVER:

                         JAKE
          Not you, Kid.

                         EMMETT
          Aw, hell, we been through this. Ya can't
          stop me.
          Jake draws his gun, SPINS it in his palm, aims at Emmett's FOOT:

                         JAKE
          I can shoot you in the foot.

                         EMMETT
          Bu111i11SHIT.
          Jake SIGHS -- bluff called. Holsters the gun and takes a
          knee... but just when we think this is gonna be a tender moment,
          he GRABS Emmett by the collar, pulls him CLOSE:

                         JAKE
          You told me your daddy's all you got
          left. Want me to save his ass?
          Then park yours right there on the
          ground, you little shit. Got me?
          Emmett's nailed. ANGRY, but knows he's gotta stay.

                         EMMETT
          Yeah. I gotcha.
          Jake releases him. Happy moves to Ella but she TSKS:

                         ELLA
          Stay with the kid, Happy.
          The dog WHINES but complies, moving next to Emmett. Jake climbs
          on his horse. Looks back to the boy -- now he Ia tender:

                         JAKE
          I'll get your father back. Bastard still
          owes me fifty dollars.
          The hint of a SMIRK... long enough for Emmett to SMIRK BACK.
          Ella, Doc, and Colorado mount Â»p too, along with a 10-MAN APACHE
          WAR PARTY. Jake meets eyes with GREY WOLF:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          You'll be ready?
          Grey Wolf NODS. Some part of the PLAN we have yet to learn.
          And now Jake starts to trot off, Ella beside him. This plays
          just between the two of them:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         ELLA
          That's a nice thing... what you said to
          the boy. I didn't know better, I'd say
          you got yourself a sweet side.
          She smiles. But Jake turns to her -- deadly serious:

                         JAKE
          There's nothin' sweet about me. I told
          that kid what he needed to hear so he
          wouldn't get in my damn way. All I care
          about is killin' that thing.
          And Ella reacts to the DARKNESS in his voice. Shakes her head:

                         ELLA
          I don't believe that.

                         JAKE
          Well believe it. I was playing a part.
          (straight at her)
          Just like you were.
          He CRACKS the reins, riding ahead. HOLD ON ELLA... who finally
          follows as they all ride out and MUSIC SOARS:

          EXT. DESERT PLAINS - CONTINUOUS


          JAKE, ELLA, COLORADO, DOC AND THE APACHE WARRIORS RIDE LIKE HELL

          TOWARD THEIR FATE, SLAMMING RIGHT INTO LENS -- AND WE MATCH TO:

          EXT. DOLARHYDE'S RANCH - DAY

          THUNDERING HOOVES -- but it's DOLARHYDE on his horse. REARS
          near the SERVANTS QUARTERS -- moving FAST toward a small hut:
          A HATCHET is embedded in a wood pile. Dolarhyde YANKS it out.

          INT. SERVANTS' QUARTERS - DAY

          The APACHE WOMAN we saw in the drawn-and-quartered scene earlier
          is washing clothes on a basin board. She turns as --
          Dolarhyde ENTERS. A menacing figure with a blade in the
          doorway. She stands, ALERT -- in SUBTITLED APACHE:

          THE WOMAN (SUBTITLE)
          What are you doing?
          Without response, he levels the axe and SLAMS it down on the
          FLOORBOARDS. Wood chips SPRAY until a GASH is opened. Dolar
          REACHES in... pulling out a CANVAS BAG. A few COINS spill
          out... COLD. He picks them up -- looks at the woman:

                         DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
          Need it to save Nat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.
          And now her worry becomes FEAR; English now:

                         THE WOMAN
          Is he okay?

                         DOLARHYDE
          He's gonna be.
          A storm of mixed emotions in his eyes. That stoic Dolarhyde
          veneer starts to CRACK... just a hint... as the woman MOVES to
          him... and TOUCHES his face.
          And he lets her. WHOA. We realize: this woman is COLORADO'S
          MOTHER. Dolarhyde, for all his wicked bluster, LOVES AN APACHE.

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          I won't let anything happen to him,
          Jenny.

                         THE WOMAN

                         (SOFTLY)
          Come back to me.
          With that, he's GONE with the gold. Leaving her full of DREAD.

          EXT. TWIN RIVER FALLS - CAVERN ENTRANCE - DAY

          A CASCADING WATERFALL flows over rock face into the TWIN RIVERS.
          The water curtain covers a CAVERN ENTRANCE. The back way in.
          Jake, Ella, Doc, Colorado and the Apaches cross slippery rocks
          and push through the water...

          INT. LIMESTONE CAVERN - CONTINUOUS

          Behind the curtain, they shake off the wet and remove TORCHES
          from waterproof buffalo-hide pouches. FIRELIGHT as our team
          creeps along in a column. TENSE. Jake glances at Colorado:

                         JAKE
          You and Percy're brothers, huh?

                         NAT COLORADO
          ... half.

                         JAKE
          So... your momma and Dolarhyde---

                         NAT COLORADO
          We friends now? Last I checked, you shot
          my ear off.

                         JAKE
          (a beat; then)
          Want it back?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          Colorado GRUMBLES, pushes ahead of Jake...

          EXT. FORT HUACHUCA - MORNING

          A BUZZARD picks at the EAR of a DEAD GANG MEMBER. More birds
          scavenge the dismembered remains of JAKE'S CREW as the rest of
          its LIVING MEMBERS -- roughly 30 -- tend wounds and get ready to
          move on. One of them looks up...
          .. and sees an INCOMING RIDER on the horizon:

                         OUTLAW

          BRONC!
          BRONC and HUNT look up. Draws their GUNS. So does the rest of
          the gang... until they see the rider's waving a WHITE FLAG. As
          he comes closer -- they realize it's DOLARHYDE:

                         HUNT
          One of them fellas Jake was ridin' with!
          Dolarhyde rides into camp, REARING in front of 30 guns

                         BRONC
          The hell you want?

                         DOLARHYDE
          It's about what you want.
          He reaches into his pocket and tosses Bronc a GOLD COIN:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          Lonergan stole your gold. That's a taste
          of what I got -- more'n you've ever seen.
          It's all yours if you help me get my boy
          back.
          The men trade LOOKS. Bronc eyes the coin. Alight with greed:

                         BRONC
          Who's got your boy?

                         DOLARHYDE
          Well, there's the rub.

                         (BEAT)
          I got two.
          Off that --

          INT. DEEPER IN THE LIMESTONE CAVERN - CONTINUOUS

          Our team has travelled far into the bowels of the cavern. Jake
          STOPS, torchlight reflecting the GOLD in the cavern walls.
          Doc cracks off a piece. POCKETS it. Shrugs:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         DOC
          In case we live through this.
          They SNEAK on down the narrow shaft til they're funneled into...

          THE WATER GROTTO
          Where our TOWNSPEOPLE were hanging. Now, GONE. Around the
          corner, the sound of ENGINES POWERING UP...
          A TRANSPORT. A dozen WORKER-BEE ALIENS try to corral the HORSES
          from the pen -- cruelly jabbing the animals with ALIEN CATTLE
          PRODS. The mares REAR and WHINNY.

                         JAKE
          We're never gonna get close to that ship.
          Silently. a DRIPPING. GLISTENING SHAPE rises un from the WATER
          behind them. Swaying like a COBRA ready to strike:
          Our people TURN... the TUBE ALIEN snatches one of the Apaches,
          SWALLOWING HIM in its thorny snout! The indian SCREAMS --

                         JAKE
          Lights a WHISKEY MOLOTOV, hurls it at the CREATURE: BOOM! It
          KEENS, BURNING, SPITTING OUT the Apache. ALERTED, the dozen
          aliens by the transport SWARM at our heroes!

                         NAT COLORADO
          C g_that shuttle.
          Colorado readies his TOMAHAWK -- Jake meets his eyes:

                         JAKE
          Knew there was a good reason I didn't
          kill you.

                         NAT COLORADO
          Just thinkin' the same thing.
          The men trade FATEFUL LOOKS... then the Indians HURL MOLOTOVS at
          the charging horde: KAAA-BOOM! Aliens TWIST and SCREAM --
          The Apaches STRIKE FEARLESSLY -- but the aliens quickly RECOVER
          and SHAKE THEM OFF, tearing most of them to SHREDS.
          The horses BREAK FREE and crash madly through the cavern --
          And this is the DISTRACTION Jake and Ella need to make their run,
          for the transport -- up the loading ramp:

          INT. TRANSPORT SHUTTLE - MINI CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

          Ella SLAMS a switch and the ramp DRAWS UP. Jake FREEZES:
          COCOONS hang all around, filled with motionless HUMAN BEINGS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         ELLA
          Jake - -
          (he can only stare)

          JAKE.
          She slaps open an ENGINEERING HATCH, drops down a LADDER. He
          takes a last awful look and SLIDES down after her --

          INT. TRANSPORT SHUTTLE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

          -- the ladder funnels into the COCKPIT. Ella starts TAPPING the
          console and HOLO-DISPLAYS appear, Alien text, rotating
          graphics. She slides into a SEAT --

                         ELLA
          Strap in. dammit!!!

                         JAKE
          Into what?!?
          Ella JAMS a lever forward and the shuttle RISES. JAKE grabs
          WEBBING that must be some type of SEATBELT, feeling the
          sensation of ELLQU as:

          INT. CAVERN TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

          Ella pilots the ship UPWARD, thrusters belching a WAKE OF FIRE
          that SCORCHES cavern walls and INCINERATES 6 ALIENS!
          As a HORSE streaks by, Colorado grabs a hunk of mane, LEAPS ON --

          NAT COLORADO (SUBTITLE)

          LET'S GO!!!
          DOC comes RUNNING frantically:

                         DOC

          DON'T LEAVE ME!!!
          Colorado PULLS Doc up onto the horse's bare back -- no easy task
          with Doc's 300 POUNDS. The remaining Apaches (5) commandeer
          horses and GALLOP HARD down the tunnel --
          Two aliens jump on MANTA-SPEEDERS in pursuit!

          INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - DAY


          THE TRANSPORT SHUTTLE KAMIKAZES THROUGH BI-SECTING TUNNELS:
          Jake has NEVER moved this fast, BARELY avoiding walls as Ella
          expertly pilots the ship. LEFT -- RIGHT -- SIDEWAYS -- up
          ahead, DIM LIGHT spills from a FISSURE leading above ground:

                         ELLA
          Hold on.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.
          She cranks back and the ship PITCHES upward --

          INT. TRANSPORT SHUTTLE - OVER THE CANYON - CONTINUOUS

          The shuttle BURSTS OUT into the canyon and skates the rim. Jake
          fights the G-FORCES and teeth-rattling TURBULENCE as --
          The craft keeps spiralling UP UP toward... THE OMINOUS CLOUD.
          As we come closer, an IMPOSSIBLY BLUE GLOW blinds us:

          EXT. UPPER CLOUD LAYER - CONTINUOUS

          The shuttle BLASTS through the upper cloud layer, to reveal...

          THE ALIEN SCOUT
          -SHIP. ENORMOUS AND THREATENING, like a BLACK METAL CLAW. Cloud banks encircle the ship as if it were the eye
          of a hurricane.
          ON ELLA. Like ice down her spine... as we drift back to JAKE.
          Trying to find a word to DESCRIBE this thing. Finally:

                         JAKE
          Sheee-it.

          INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

          The rest of our heroes GALLOP FAST out the criss-crossing
          tunnels -- KA-CHINNNG! Apaches are CLAMPED WITH STEEL COLLARS
          and YANKED off their horses as the SPEEDERS roar in from behind!
          Colorado VEERS toward a LIGHT as Doc ignites a molotov and they:

          INT. ALIEN FORT - CANYON - CONTINUOUS

          GALLOP Out into daylight, rigb-t_through the CENTER of the fort --
          Doc THROWS his molotov and BOOM!!! Aliens go FLYING, on fire!
          Doc throws another MOLOTOV, clearing a path for Colorado to RIDE
          HARD for the fort's 30 FT. STEEL ENTRY GATES... which start
           SWINGING CLOSED to trap them!
          But at the LAST SECOND, the horse SLIPS THROUGH the narrow
          opening as it THUNDERS CLOSED. Now the aliens are pissed off:

          EXT. ALIEN FORT - CONTINUOUS

          They start spilling over the fort walls in pursuit. A few mount
          SPEEDERS and launch as our guys ride DOWN THE CANYON TRENCH:

          ,INT. CANYON TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

          Colorado and Doc ZIG-ZAG around CURVES -- like mice navigatinga
          maze, so the speeders can't get a clear shot:

                         DOC
          They're gaining on us!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         NAT COLORADO
          That's the point!
          And just when it looks like Doc and Colorado are GONERS...
          BOOM! An EXPLOSION rocks the canyon as something HURTLES DOWN
          from above -- WHISKEY MOLOTOVS fired from the handmade
          CATAPULTS. BOOM! BOOM! Aliens are VAPORIZED, SHRIEKING!
          A cloudburst of FLAMING ARROWS brightens the sky as 20 APACHES
          RISE UP along the canyon rims: A AMBUSH!
          An ASSEMBLY LINE OF SQUAWS works like a drill team, soaking
          WHISKEY RAGS and wrapping arrows. Among them, EMMETT and HAPPY!
          The kid pocks an arrow like a damn EXPERT -- IGNITES it -- lets
          it FLY -- WHOOSH! It SKEWERS a speeder pilot who BURSTS INTO
          FLAMES, the speeder CORKSCREWS into another one, both EXPLODING:

                         EMMETT

          YEAHHHHH!!!

                         THE ALIENS
          Caught OFF-GUARD with NO WM TO TURN AROUND as from the OPPOSITE
          END of the canyon, a BELLOWING WAR WHOOP:

          GREY WOLF AND HIS 40 APACHES CHARGE IN. A MOVING HUMAN WALL
          CRASH! The Apaches HURTLE into the flank of aliens. LASERS are
          met with the CRACK of RIFLES and hatchets --

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)

          TAKE THE FORT! ! !
          The Apache leader spurs his horse onward, leading men toward the
          alien bunker. An EXPLOSION CONSUMES FRAME, becoming the:

          EXT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - ABOVE THE CLOUDS - CONTINUOUS

          -- PLASMA FIRE of the shuttle's burners as it ROARS toward the
          ALIEN SHIP... a SPECK against the BEHEMOTH:

          INT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          The shuttle sweeps past the command center's polarized window,
          where... THE SLAVER watches with EVIL EYES.
          He's on the UPPER LEVEL of a TWO-TIER COMMAND CENTER. A DOZEN
          ALIENS operate holo-consoles. Readying the ship to leave.

          INT. TRANSPORT SHUTTLE - SAME

          Ella settles down on a GLOWING DOCKING COLLAR. With the two
          ships CONNECTED, the DISPLAY flashes a DEPARTURE ALERT:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         ELLA JAKE
          -- Dammit --- -- what--?

          -- WHAT'S WRQNG?
          -- she's CLIMBING back up the ladder, he FOLLOWS:

          INT. SHUTTLE - LADDER TUBE - CONTINUOUS

          They quickly CLIMB up the LADDER TUBE --

                         ELLA
          Engines are warming up -- got eight
          minutes til the ship leaves, and about
          one til automated retrieval --

                         JAKE
          -- autojamated what --?

          INT. SHUTTLE - LOADING BAY - CONTINUOUS

          As they spill into the LOADING BAY, a CLANG reverberates:
          THE AIRLOCK DOOR -- AT THEIRFEyT
          The first EXPLOSIVE BOLT shoots off. Ella jams her SHOTGUN into
          a sheath on her back, presses herself flat:

                         ELLA
          Hug the wall.
          Jake does that beside her as the next bolt PINGS out --

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          When they come at us, aim for their
          heads. Only way to kill 'em for sure.
          He looks at his bracelet, adrenaline SURGING -- it ACTIVATES:

                         JAKE
          I'll aim just fine.
          THE LAST BOLT FIRES and the airlock door SHOOTS OFF:

          A MULTI- D HYDRAULIC "GRABBER" RISES INTO THE MECHANICAL

          LIMBS SWINGING AROUND INCHES FROM THEIR FACES!

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          SonofaBITCH!
          The manipulator arms SCOOP UP COCOONS, pulling them DOWN the

                         AIRLOCK:

                         ELLA

          C'MON!
          She JUMPS through the airlock -- Jake has no time to think:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         JAKE

                         DAMMIT --
          And JUMPS after her --

          INT. SCOUT SHIP - "THE FARM" - CONTINUOUS

          -- LANDING beside Ella. Starts to pick himself up... but what
          he sees ASSAULTS HIS MIND. We RISE UP UP UP, Ella and Jake
          growing SMALLER in what we now reveal is a MASSIVE HANGAR where:
          AUTOMATED -ARMS PLANT RECENT ARRIVALS INTO A VERITABLE FOREST of
          PEOPLE AND ANIMALS. Level after level, THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS
          OF COCOONS are suspended from branch-like limbs.
          Jake picks himself up, looking around the massive hangar in AWE.

                         ELLA

                         Ï¿½CIDYAPLQLWJJ
          -- she PULLS HIM into an alcove as a machine arm SWINGS
          overhead, flashing a WIDE CONICAL LASER that inventories cocoons
          like the machine in the underground cave. As they CROUCH:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          We can't let that thing see us or they'll
          know we're here.
          She turns -- hits buttons on a console -- a door SLIDES UP
          leading to a series of CORRIDORS. She starts to MOVE --

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          This'll take us to the bridge --
          But Jake doesn't follow. STARES at her --

                         JAKE
          Slaver's up there--?

                         ELLA
          I sure as hell hope not.

                         JAKE
          Then I'm not goin' with you.
          And now she HARDENS --

                         ELLA
          You got any idea how big this ship is?
          No ray you'll ever find him alone. Be
          like findin' a needle in a--
          -- SLAM!! Jake interrupts her by aiming at the LASER SCANNER
          and FIRING HIS BLASTER, blowing it apart. The scanner eye
          CRASHES to the floor, flaming. A KLAXON rings --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         JAKE
          I ain't gonna find him. He's gonna find
          me.

                         ELLA'S FURIOUS:

                         ELLA
          Thanks for the head start.
          She turns and RUNS. Jake moves to that scanner eye on the
          floor, walks right up to it and STARES into the shattered IRIS:

                         JAKE
          Alright, you sonofabitch... come and get
          me.

          INT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          JAKE'S FACE APPEARS AS A THERMAL HEAT SOURCE -- fritzing as he
          stares into the scanner. ALARMS scream.
          THE SLAVER fills with RAGE. And RECOGNITION.
          Aliens begin grabbing WEAPONS but The Slaver SHRIEKS for them to
          STOP. We don't need to speak alien to understand:
          "He's mine. "

          INT. SCOUT SHIP - CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS

          Jake has moved out into the corridors -- blaster ready -- eyes
          darting -- suddenly -- WHAM:
          A STEEL BARRICADE SLAMS DOWN BEHIND HIM. WHAM! Another in
          front -- WHAM! He's TRAPPED, shut off from the passageways...
          .. except ONE. A long, dark tunnel. A DOOR at the far end
          HISSES open: THE TURBOLIFT ELEVATOR.
          ON JAKE. Understanding... his call is bging answe

                         JAKE

                         (QUIETLY; HARD)
          Okay.
          And starts walking to the elevator... as a SCREAM takes us to:

          INT. CANYON - DAY

          Handmade LADDERS are SWUNG FORWARD onto the fort as Apaches try
          to SCALE the wall, but are BLOWN BACK by ALIEN PARAPET SENTRIES.
          ON DOC -- running TRIAGE on wounded warriors:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         DOC
          I need more bandages now!/ You: lint and
          splint that leg!

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          We're losing ranks ! ! !
           And then, out of nowhere... the BANG BANG BANG of 30 pistols
          fills the air as --
          DOLARHYDE RIDES IN WITH JAKE'S GANG! A renewed SURGE of energy
          as cowboys join Indians to fortify their ranks:

                         NAT COLORADO
          You came back!

                         DOLARHYDE
          Told you: I take care of my kin.
          Colorado knows that's as close to "I love you" as he'll ever
          get. But the UPSWING is short-lived as:
          A speeder WHIZZES past, dropping a METALLIC BUNDLE. It splits
          open right in front of the fort's STEEL GATES -- pieces
          hydraulically ASSEMBLING THEMSELVES in seconds, becoming:
          THE MOTHERFUCKING SUPERGUN_OF DEATH. TWO LETHAL BARRELS spin to
          life, firing STRANGE STEEL BALL BEARINGS in every direction.
          CLAW HOOKS snap out of the balls, EMBEDDING in soldiers! One
          LODGES in a GANG MEMBER beside DOC -- he FLAILS:

                         GANG MEMBER

          HELP ME!!! GET IT OFF!
          A RED SPRING-LOADED PIN depresses in the ball's center: KA-BOOM!

          SEARING WHITE LIGHT TURNS THE OFFICER TOAASH -- AN ALIEN
          GRENADE! Doc goes FLYING from the kickback, landing near:
          GREY WOLF -- FWWWWTWHCK!!! Another claw-ball CLAMPS into the
          Apache's SHOULDER -- he SHOUTS, struggles to pull it out --

                         DOC

          DON'T. STOP, DAMMIT!!!!
          The RED PIN starts to depress -- pOC LUNGES, JAMS HIS FINGER
          RETJff&H_THE PIN AND BLASTING CAP. Now he's stopped it from
          exploding, but if he pulls his finger out... HE DIES TOO.
          DOC and GREY WOLF lock eyes. Their fates suddenly ENTWINED as --

          INT. SCOUT SHIP - TURBOLIFT - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

          Bars of light move rhythmically across Jake's face -- BURNING
          with determination -- as he travels up in the turbolift. It
          slows to a STOP. The door cycles open and --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.
          -- the STRANGEST THING happens. DESERT SAND billows in a gust
          of ventilated air. SAND?! Jake emerges, blocking his eyes:

          INT. SCOUT SHIP - JUNKPILE CARGO HANGAR - CONTINUOUS

          -- the sand swirls and eddies. Visibility reduced to ZERO. As
          Jake pushes through, the air clears a little...
          His eyes WIDEN. Trying to make SENSE of what he sees:
          Remember all those BUILDINGS that were pulled up into the
          tornado when Absolution was attacked? And that CRATER they
          found that used to be "Winfield's Landing"? It-'-s all-HE
          in a junkwle hangar. Building pieces. False front
          facades. Debris piled on top of each other, TILTED AND TWISTED
          AT FUNHOUSE ANGLES. And the desert sand that was sucked up
          along with it all.
          A GLOWING REACTOR casts hellish light on the dormant wreckage.
          Weapon ready, Jake moves past part of A BROTHEL. Jutting
          fragments of a HORSE CORRAL. A CREAKING SALOON SIGN swings like
          a pendulum, CLANKS EERILY.
          A STEAM PIPE EXPLODES STEAM. Jake WHIRLS -- and like demons...
          5 ALIENS emerge. Slowly. Fanning out, taking positions as...
          THE SLAVER steps out of the smoke, squarely facing Jake. aAd_h@--
          is holding ELLA hostage. WRIST BLASTER pressed to her throat.
          Jake and Ella LOCK EYES. She's terrified, but staying STRONG.
          His hand LINGERS at his hip, blaster ready.

                         JAKE
          Drop the woman. We both know this ain't
          about her.
          But The Slaver only presses his blaster HARDER into Ella's neck.
          Almost GRINNING. And Jake MEETS the look --

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          She says you're as bad as they come.
          Jake curls back the fingers on both hands, CRACKING knuckles:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Well, you ugly sonofabitch... they say
          the same about me.
          A pipe SPEWS STEAM -- UNNERVINGLY LOUD. Then STOPS.

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Could'a had your boys kill me five times
          over, instead you rolled out the red
          carpet... so let's get it over with.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          The Slaver HISSES ANGRILY at the challenge. PUSHES Ella roughly
          off to one of his GANG, who keeps a blaster pressed to her side.
          Vow ' O right the a ter of the "town" junkpile.
          THE SLAVER -- his hand at his side, twitching.
          JAKE -- his hand is still.

          A PIPE SPRAYS STEAM AGAIN, SCREAMINGLY LOUD AND --
          Everyone DRAWS! But Jake's INSANELY FAST as he drops to a knee
          and FIRES gunsmoke-style -- BLAM SLAM! The Slaver's HIT and --
          ELLA -- WRENCHES her captor's arm backward and he fires USELESS
          ROUNDS into the air -- she takes a HIT in the leg as Jake SHOOTS
          the captor with a SHOT to the temple --
          Jake GRABS and PULLS Ella to safety behind a SHREDDED STORE
          FRONT, taking cover -- lasers PUNCHING through the building
          walls -- Ella spots an ALIEN lunging around a corner:

                         ELLA

          BEHIND YOU!!!
          Jake WHIRLS, SLAM!!! The creature FLIES off its feet.

                         JAKE
          Stay down.
          Ella does, and here come the rest of the aliens as Jake GUNS

          THEM ALL DOWN WITH PERFECT AIM.
          The REACTOR is hit in the crossfire and the ship RESPONDS with a
          turbine HOWL.
          Corpses litter the floor... all except for The Slaver. A trail
          of FLUORESCENT BLOOD leads around the corner...
          Jake WHIRLS to Ella -- her leg wounded --

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          -- you alright?
          In PAIN, she snatches one of those SMART DISCS off a dead alien:

                         ELLA
          Reactor's hit. if I don't get this ship
          on the ground soon, we're all dead...
          (tries to STAND, WINCES)
          Get me over to that turbolift.
          He slings an arm around her shoulder and LIFTS her, helping her
          to the elevator --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          Put me inside.
          He does. She sees his eyes go back to The Slaver's BLOOD TRAIL:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          I can manage the rest without you.
          (tough... but with

                         COMPASSION)
          Go do what you came up here to do.
          He looks at her. At the blood. At the unstable REACTOR.
          And Jake Lonergan makes a CHOICE:

                         JAKE
          Goddamnit.
          -- he gets INTO THE ELEVATOR with her. She SLAMS the control
          pad, doors CLOSE -- they start rocketing upward. She half-grins
          as her eyes hold on him. And within them... trust. AND FAITH.

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Stop smiling.

          EXT. THE BATTLEFIELD - OUTSIDE ALIEN FORT - CONTINUOUS

          As the FORT SIEGE continues, DOLARHYDE and COLORADO gallop back
          and forth between their men:

                         DOLARHYDE

          DON'T BREAK RANKS! HOLD YOUR LINES

          GODDAMIT! WE CAN TAKE THIS FOR--
          -- KATHWAM! An EXPLOSION throws them off their horses.
          Colorado picks up his father and they start RUNNING LOW under
          stray beams of PLASMA FIRE, reaching Doc and Grey Wolf:

          THE FOUR MEN -- PINNED BEHIND THE ROCK EMBANKMENT:
          Doc's finger is still STUCK in that ALIEN GRENADE, clamped to
          the bleeding Apache's shoulder:

          DOL.ARHYDE (CONT'D)
          The hell iz that?
          Grey Wolf MOANS in pain. Doc SHOUTS to Dolar:

                         DOC
          Tell him to hold still! If I have this
          thing figured right, long as t keep my
          finger under the red pin we won't blow
          up!

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          What's he saying?:

                         DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
          He says we're all gonna die.

                         COLORADO
          We need to pull it out of his shoulder!

                         DOLARHYDE
          I'm not pullin' anything!

                         (RE: DOC)
          He's the damn doctor!
          ZZZZZZAM! MORE people are CUT DOWN by the Alien GRENADE CANNON
          -- the BLOWBACK nearly KNOCKS the grenade out of Doe's hand --

                         DOC

          SHIT!
          Dolarhyde gets an IDEA. HARDENS. Looks Doc right in the eye:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Alright, listen -- you slide your finger
          from under that pin, I'll slip mine in
          and hold it in place. Then you pull it
          out and I'll throw it.
          Doc NODS fearfully. Dolar carefully SLIPS his finger under the
          pin as Doc SLIPS it out. PHEW. Now Doc takes hold of the
          grenade itself, nods "ready" to pull it out. Grey Wolf braces

                         FOR PAIN:

                         DOC

          Everyone LURCHES from the tension interrupt:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          Tell your wife we're clear.

                         DOC
          What?

                         DOLARHYDE
          -- your wife. Maria. We had an
          arrangement. I left your saloon alone
          and she paid me off.
          ON DOC. Reeling, now REALLY confused --

                         DOC
          We're broke. Paid you off with what?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         DOLARHYDE
          She stole from the people in your morgue.
          Gold teeth, trinkets, pocket watches --
          It LANDS on Doc: that's why he fond the watch under their bed.

                         DOC
          I thought she was cheating!

                         DOLARHYDE
          Just robbin' corpses.

                         DOC
          Thank God!
          (and then -- )
          Wait. You hate me. Why're you telling
          me this?
          With GENUINE REMORSE:

                         DOLARHYDE
          May not get another chance --

                         (THEN)
          -- and I still hate ya.
          A MOMENT. Forgiveness and atonement.

          WILL YOU GET ON WITH IT?111

          DOC AND DOLARHYDE
          One... two... three!
          And Doc RIPS the grenade from Grey Wolf's shoulder -- he HOWLS,
          CLAMPS tearing out of his flesh. But they did it!
          As more EXPLOSIONS decimate men, Dolarhyde PULLS the grenade out
          of Doc's hands, still holding his finger under the FIRING PIN --

                         DOC

                         WHAT'RE YOU--
          Dolarhyde looks at Colorado:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Tell your mother I love her.
          With that, he CHARGES into the swirling chaos

                         NAT COLORADO

          WAIT!
          -- but BOOM! Colorado's FORCED BACK by an explosion -- through
          the debris, he sees his father running toward...

                         THE SUPERCANNON

          Dolarhyde HURLS the grenade -- BOOM!!! IT DETONATES IN A

          MILLION PIECES! DOLARHYDE DISAPPEARS IN THE BLAST!

                         COLORADO

          NO!!!!!
          But his sacrifice 7M S THE TIDE! THE EXPLOSION BLOWS THE

          FORT'S FRONT GATES OFF! THEY TOPPLE ON A WHOLE BUNCH OF ALIENS!
          A CRY OF VICTORY as the humans STORM THROUGH! Aliens hurtle
          back in DISORDER --

          INT. SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          The small ALIEN BRIDGE CREW scrambles to control the damaged
          ship. The WHIR of the lift arriving, doors OPEN and --
          WHOOSH! The SMART WEAPON blurs out of the elevator, SLICING
          HALF A DOZEN ALIENS IN HALF -- circles back around to ELLA, who
          skillfully catches it as she RUN/LIMPS from the lift with JAKE --
          LASER FIRE IGNITES THE BRIDGE as he makes QUICK WORK of the rest
          and Ella mans a console, getting to work --

                         ELLA
          We're going down fast.
          She calls up telemetry on a HOLO-WINDOW: EARTH TERRAIN -- The
          BATTLEFIELD. Sets coordinates, vectoring the ship that way:
          A WHIR as a SECOND TURBOLIFT arrives... AND THE SLAVER STEPS
          QQT. Wounded, and very PISSED OFF. Jake says to Ella:

                         JAKE
          No matter what.
          Jake and The Slaver HURTLE into each other, TUMBLE off a
          catwalk, CRASHING into conduits and GUNKY WATER below.
          Jake staggers up but The Slaver is HUGE -- SLAMS Jake back into
          the water. PINS A FOOT on his blaster arm -- CRUSHING IT.
          Jake HOWLS as The Slaver presses a series of those HIEROGLYPH
          MARKINGS on Jake's BRACELET -- the symbols LIGHT UP in an UNLOCK
          CODE -- and KA-CHING! The bracelet POPS OF.E.
          The Slaver TOSSES IT into the gunky water. Draws his LASER WHIP
          -- WHUP-SNAP! The white-hot tip LASHES JAKE'S BACK, ripping his
          shirt and BURN-SCARRING HIS BACK!
          Jake SCREAMS in agony as The Slaver WHIPS HIM MERCILESSLY --

          EXT. SKIES ABOVE DESERT - CONTINUOUS

          The Scout Ship SCREAMS down out of the cloud, toward the CANYON:

          Outlaws and Apaches finish off the wounded, TOMAHAWKS RIPPING
          AWAY TENTACLED SCALPS! Carnage and joy -- but then:
          A MONSTROUS SHADOW spreads over the battlefield. Everyone looks
          up to see the SCOUT SHIP PLUMMETING DOWN --

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          Fall back!!! NOW!! NOW!!

          INT. SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - LOWER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

          Another LASER WHIP SNAP and Jake seems DONE. Now The Slaver
          LIFTS Jake from the water, CRUSHING his wind-pipe.
          Jake FLAILS, REACHING for something BELOW FRAME... finally GRABS
          and STABS it into The Slaver's side. The Alien ROARS in pain
          and looks down to see --

          ONE OF HIS OWN "ICE TACKS" FROM HIS BANDOLIER EMBEDDED IN HIS

          SIDE. IT STARTS TO GLOW BLUE WITH A HIGH-PITCH WHINE:

                         JAKE
          Go to hell.

          THE SLAVER'S ROAR OF DEFEAT IS CUT SHORT AS THE MOTHERFUCKER

          FREEZES TO GREY STONE. EXPLODING IN A MILLION PIECES!!!
          Jake DROPS, GASPING. Revenge fulfilled. Painfully starts
          CLIMBING a ladder back to the upper deck --

          As the humans FLEE from the fort, the remaining aliens RETREAT
          to the last shuttles for ESCAPE... start to LIFT OFF...

          as_it crashe _down!

          INT. SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          Jake FALLS into the seat beside Ella, straps in. Fighting the
          controls, she SEES THE WHIP MARKS on his back. It TEARS her
          heart open. And because this might be the end... she ADMITS:

                         ELLA
          I lied.

                         JAKE
          ... I know.

                         ELLA
          No, I heard what you said when I was
          layin' there...

          JAKE. Taken aback. LAID BARE. As she says:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          You are a good man. At least... to me.
          The ground GROWS BIGGER out the window. Her HAND reaches over
          for his. JAKE'S HAND clasps hers and --

          EXT. BADLANDS - THE BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS


          THE SHIP PLUNGES INTO THE CANYON AND CLEAR THROUGH THE ALIEN

          FORT, RIPPING IT INTO TIDAL-WAVE MOUNDS OF SHRAPNEL... CHEWS UP

          A HALF-MILE BEFORE SLOWLY COMING TO A FINAL, WRENCHING... STOP.
          The frame is WHITE with dust and SUNSHINE. As from the ether
          comes...
          EMMETT, HAPPY, and DOC, with GREY WOLF's arm slung over his
          shoulder. Among other faces, White and Apache... all of them
          PROUD WARRIORS. Staring in awe at:

          THE CRASHED ALIEN SHIP. DUG DEEP INTO THE CANYON FLOOR.
          Something starts to rain down. Looks at first like glitter...
          until we realize it's GOLD DUST.
          From an OPENING in the Scout Ship, the sound of THUNDERING
          HOOVES as... ALL THE ANIMALS STAMPEDE OUT. Then, slowly...
          HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE emerge, dazed -- their minds slowly WAKING
          UP. White and Kiowa-Apache ABDUCTEES.
          DOC RUSHES IN, searching faces -- no -- no -- no -- n--
          THERE she is, his BELOVED MARIA, stumbling weakly toward him as
          tears runs down her cheek. He EMBRACES her madly, kissing every
          inch of her face as...
          EMMETT pushes through the crowd, sees SHERIFF TAGGART --

                         EMMETT

          PAW!!!! PAW!!!!
          The kid GRABS his father and holds him for dear life, as Taggart
          stares back in a daze --

          It's me -- it's Emmett.
          And somewhere in there, RECOGNITION comes to the Sheriff's
          eyes... Emmett SMILES and throws his arms around his father
          again as --

          THE TOWNSFOLK OF ABSOLUTION AND THE APACHES FIND EACH OTHER.
          Families, lovers, friends... reunited.

          Moving through the FALLEN BODIES toward the lifeless form of
          Dolarhyde, his FATHER. Eyes welling, he drops to his knees...

          A VOICE (O.S.)
          Nat?
          Colorado turns -- it's PERCY. Confused. Like waking from a
          dream. Sees his father on the ground...

                         PERCY
          What... happened?
          And all Colorado can say is...

                         NAT COLORADO
          He's dead.
          That HANGS there. Percy blinks. And then --

          Who's gettin' the ranch?
          ON COLORADO. At first, words that don't compute. Then PURE

          Paw, he--
          Dolarhyde SMACKS Percy across the face:

                         PERCY (CONT'D)
          OW!!! What'd you do that for?

                         UOLARHYUE
          For being an ungrateful little bastard.
          Now shake your brother's hand and thank
          him for saving your ass, cause it's more
          than you ever would'a done bjM.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.
          Chastened, Percy glowers at Colorado. Grudgingly reaches out a
          hand. So does Nat. As they SHAKE --

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          That's better.

                         JAKE
          Staggers through the crowd. And sees ELLA. Thgy did it. But
          she still looks TROUBLED. Staring out at the vast desert...

                         JAKE
          . what is it?

                         ELLA
          We didn't get all of 'em. Some ran oft.
          That LANDS on Jake, as he too looks toward the endless horizon.
          HOLD on them, together, a VICTORIOUS but UNRESOLVED note...
          We RISE UP over the sea of bodies and the CRASHED SHIP, until
          Jake and Ella are just two small figures in the crowd...

                         FADE TO:

          EXT. TOWN OF ABSOLUTION - DAY

          A glorious sight: Absolution in REBIRTH -- FLUSH from all that
          GOLD. Storefronts brightly painted, the streets ALIVE.
          We PICK UP EMMETT running through the hustle and bustle with two
          APACHE KIDS. Suddenly, DOLARHYDE, COLORADO and their gang ride
          in. SHERIFF TAGGART emerges from his office with DEPUTY WADE:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART

          EMMETT! GET OVER HERE!!!

                         EMMETT
          -- what? What'd I dQ?

          SHERIFF TAGGART EMMETT
          Get outta the road before
          you're run down! If your (overlapping)
          momma saw y-- -- "saw me playin' in the
          street she'd roll over in her
          grave and shoot lightnin'
          bolts outta her eyes," I know,
          I know!
          He runs off. Taggart SMIRKS:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Kid's got a mouth on him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

                         DEPUTY WADE
          Well, Kyle, considering he saved your
          life, guess you'll just have to grin'n
          bear it.
          Dolar moves up to Taggart, tough as ever. The men HOLD looks:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Woodrow.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Kyle.
          Percy STEWS about something. Dolar WHACKS him upside the head:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          Go_ _on.
          Grudgingly, Percy hands Taggart a SHEAF OF PAPER --

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          What's this?

                         DOLARHYDE
          Claims to the land 50 miles west of here.
          I've signed it over to the township of
          Absolution.
          (off Taggart's LOOK)
          Considering I'm a businessman, I figure
          expansion's in both our interests. Needs
          the Sheriff's signature to be official.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Fifty miles west of here is where the
          goldmine is, Woodrow.

                         DOLARHYDE

                         (A BEAT)
          That so.
          With surprise, Taggart studies the paper. SMILES:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          What's this about twenty percent going to
          the Apaches?
          Dolarhyde glances at Colorado. A moment. But the hardened
          rancher maintains his rock-solid facade:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Figure the only way not to piss 'em off
          is to buy 'em.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Since when'd you worry about pissin'
          anyone off?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Just sign it, Goddamnit.
          With a grin, Taggart gestures for Deputy Wade to turn around and
          flattens the paper on his BACK, using it as a surface to SIGN:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          I'd say you were being generous, Woodrow,
          but I know you'd just be insulted.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Damn right.
          Dolar gives his hat a TIP, then mounts up to go -- and we RISE
          UP to the UPPER FLOOR of the GOLD LEAF SALOON, in the process of
          being rebuilt in grand style -- and MOVE IN on a WINDOW where:

          INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

          DOC AND MARIA burst through a door, tearing passionately at each
          other's CLOTHES -- Maria MOANS as Doc kisses her neck:

                         DOC MARIA
          SHH! The workers will hear
          us!!! Let them hear!
          As they TUMBLE back onto the bed, Doc LURCHES. Reaches under
          his back to find... a GOLD POCKETWATCH.

                         DOC
          What is this?

                         MARIA
          Look at the inscription.
          He flips it open to find an ENGRAVING: "MI CORAZON... POR
          SIEMPRE." Doc looks up at her, MOVED. Then -- PLAYFULLY:

                         DOC
          This looks like Aldo Mayberry's watch...

                         MARIA
          Shut up and kiss me.
          She pulls him down, OUT OF FRAME --

          EXT. EDGE OF TOWN - DAY

          A hand unties a HORSE from its tether bar -- it's JAKE. Saddle
          bags packed. A BARK turns him around... HAPPY. Yipping for
          Jake to FOLLOW. He GRINS. As MUSIC begins to RISE -- HOPEFUL:

          EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY

          In a LONG SHOT -- the distant SILHOUETTES of Happy BOUNDING
          through the shallow TWIN RIVERS, Jake following on horseback...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

          EXT. RIM OF CANYON - DAY

          As Jake approaches, APACHE SENTRIES emerge from rocks to keep
          outsiders away. Jake TIPS his hat and they nod, let him pass.
          He nears the bluff where ELLA, GREY WOLF, and the rest of the
          Apaches finish laying DYNAMITE DET CORD that trails down into
          the canyon. Ella hears Happy BARKING -- turns to see her dog
          with Jake. She smiles as he rides up, dismounts:

                         ELLA
          Second damn time that dog ran off on me.

                         JAKE
          Second time he brought me to you.
          Happy's tail wags. The look between Jake and Ella HOLDS. And
          it seems freighted with everything. Finally, he breaks it --
          glancing at the Apaches finishing their work with the dynamite,
          and the remnants of the ALIEN SHIP and FORTRESS below.

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Looks like you got everything set.
          Ella eyes Jake's horse, loaded with GEAR. Looks up, clearly

                         DISAPPOINTED:

                         ELLA
          Where you headed?

                         JAKE

                         (A BEAT)
          Got some messes to clean up.
          But she looks at him. fEADI.NG liim. wryly:

                         ELLA
          Messes.

                         JAKE
          ... Yep.
          (then; off her look)
          What.
          She walks right up to his horse. Right up to HIM:

                         ELLA
          I think you're ridin' off cause you're
          just scared of what'll happen if you
          stay.
          An INFERENCE here. Ella's going BOLD. Jake swings off his
          horse, lands beside her. Now. Almost CURIOUS:

                         JAKE
          And what's gonna happen?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.
          She steps CLOSER to him... INTIMATE:

                         ELLA
          You know.
          A CHARGE between them. All they wanna do is KISS...
          But that'd be too easy. And those wounds of his, they haven't
          quite healed. He drops his eyes; SOFTLY NOW:

                         JAKE
          If I stay... it's not gonna be good for
          anybody, Ella.
          A beat. She looks off. Nods. They say nothing. And now he
          slowly climbs back on his horse. Ella TOUGHENS:

                         ELLA
          Heard some rumors outta Abilene. Weird
          noises at night. Cattle mutilations.
          Weather phenomena. Figured I'd ride down
          there. Give it a look-see.

                         JAKE
          (his eyes narrow)
          What's 'phenomena'?

                         ELLA
          Big storms in places that don't get big
          storms.
          ON JAKE. Every fighting instinct in him suddenly IGNITED,
          though he plays it down:

                         JAKE
          You goin' down there yourself?

                         ELLA
          Why? You worried about me?
          You bet your ass he is. But, he shakes his head--

                         JAKE
          No, ma'am. You can take care of yourself
          just fine.
          (then; tips his hat)
          Be seein' you around.

                         ELLA
          goodbye, Jake.
          He gets back on his horse. Starts to ride off. Happy BARKS and
          trots alongside him. BARK BARK BARK. In dog that means "Don't
          be an idiot." Jake glances over --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         JAKE
          Get the hell away from me, you damn mutt.

          (BARK, BARK)
          Go on, GET.
          He heels his horse, leaving Happy behind to WHINE.
          Jake rides off into the sunset. But his heart's KICKING in his
          chest. And this is pretty much where things usually end...
          But. Jake pulls the REINS as he SIGHS. Turns the horse around.
          TROTS back to Ella, whose smile WIDENS as he closes the gap
          between them.
          Finally STOPS right in front of her. And despite his best
          effort to stay TOUGH... he just plain likes her:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Abilene happens to be on my way.
          He reaches out a hand... she takes it... as he PULLS HER UP INTO
          THE SADDLE. Ella grinning ear-to-ear as she folds her arms
          around his waist. Jake -- ever the outlaw -- grumbles:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Stop smiling, Goddammit.
          He KICKS the horse and Happy follows. Ella shoots a goodbye
          look to Grey Wolf, who NODS. Signals his men and FUSES ARE LIT:
          The DYNAMITE FUSES ssssssnake down the mountain -- reaching the
          canyon floor -- INTO those limestone tunnels where CLUSTERS OF
          DYNAMITE have been placed... and as FUSE MEETS EXPLOSIVE:
          ANGLE - JAKE AND ELLA CRESTING A HILL -- B000000000000MI The
          THUNDER of EXPLOSIONS makes them rear. They turn back to see...

          THE TWIN RIVERS GEYSERING UP INTO THE CANYON. COVERING ALL

          EVIDENCE OF THE ALIEN SHIP AND 'Q T.
          Ella folds her arms TIGHTER around Jake, her heart full. With a
          nod of private affirmation, he spurs the horse with a HYAI
          As the canyon behind them fills with rushing water, Jake and
          Ella ride hard into the fiery sunset...
          Away from the past, toward a future full of promise.

          FADE OUT.

          May 2002 Draft




      FOR EDUCATIONAL
       PURPOSES ONLY

                                                                 2.

FADE IN:

EXT. STREETS (LOS ANGELES) - DAY

End of the day.     An armored truck moves through the city of
Los Angeles.

EXT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - DAY
The armored truck pulls up. An ARMORED TRUCK GUARD emerges
from the back with a satchel and heads inside.


INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
A large foyer. Security station and elevators. PARTY SOUNDS
can be heard from a second floor balcony.
DOUGLAS is the security guard manning the station. Seeing
the Armored car Guard entering, he picks up the phone and
dials. Beat. Into phone --
                         DOUGLAS
           Last delivery's finally here.
The Armored Truck Guard approaches the security station. As
he and Douglas exchange paperwork, the Armored Truck Guard
references the sounds from upstairs --
                           ARMORED TRUCK GUARD
           Party?
                         DOUGLAS
           Introducing a new line of jewelry.
                         ARMORED TRUCK GUARD
           Wife wants me to buy her a ruby ring.
           Told her to spend a little time with
           the family jewels first.
PING. An ELEVATOR opens. A second security guard's inside.
Handing over the satchel and heading out --
                           ARMORED TRUCK GUARD
           Keep it real.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
We see the security guard with the satchel use a key-card to
gain elevator access to the lower floors. As the elevator
doors slide closed...

                                                              3.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - MOMENTS LATER
An exclusive showroom. Display tables empty. At one end of
the room, the elevator. At the other end, the open door to
a walk-in vault.

The ELEVATOR PINGS, and the doors open. The guard emerges
with the cart. Pushes it across the room to the outside of
the vault.
A man in a suit emerges from the vault and starts unloading
the cart into the vault.

INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY

A train arrives.   People jostle on and off.
One man remains on the platform. MILES. Crisp dresser.
Carrying a large leather bag. A cylinder hanging by a strap
over his shoulder.
The train doors begin to close.   When...
A fist inserts itself between the doors. They re-open, and
a man steps onto the platform. TONY FAIT. Well-dressed.
Intense.
Fait joins Miles. They watch the train pull out. They
check to make sure the station's empty. Then jump off the
platform into the tunnel and disappear.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
The man in the suit has finished unloading the cart. He
closes the heavy vault door and spins a large wheel on the
door, securing the vault.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY
Fait and Miles run down the dark tunnel, staying close to
the wall. Miles stumbles. Falls toward the deadly, high-
voltage third rail.
Out of nowhere, Fait's hand grabs Miles' jacket. Stops him.
Just before he hits. Inches from the rail. Fait pulls him
back up and away from the danger.
                        FAIT
          Watch yourself.
Miles nods.

                                                              4.
                           FAIT
          Keep it tight.
Miles nods again, and they set off.


INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY
Sounds of the PARTY continue from upstairs. At the security
station, the guard, Douglas, looks up from a magazine and
scans the security monitors.

ANGLE - SECURITY MONITORS
depicting the empty vault, empty vault anteroom, various
empty store areas and the elevator, in which we see the man
in the suit riding up.

BACK TO SCENE
Douglas settles back in with his magazine.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY
Fait and Miles reach an access door tagged with paint.    Fait
starts to open it.
Suddenly, the tunnel is filled with the ROAR of an
APPROACHING TRAIN. Fait and Miles leap to the wall.   Press
their backs against it as tightly as they can.
The TRAIN whooms past, inches from their faces. When it's
gone, Miles sighs with relief. Fait cracks the access door.

INT. SUBWAY UTILITY TUNNELS - DAY
Fait moves quickly, Miles following. Fait makes fast lefts
and rights, following more spray paint.
They branch off into a small dirt-floored space, deep in the
sub-foundation of a building. Fait stops. Overhead is a
flat ceiling. On the ceiling, his flashlight finds a spray-
painted circle.
                           FAIT
          Bull's-eye.
Without a word, Miles begins assembling equipment.    Fait
pulls out a cell phone.

EXT. PARKING GARAGE - (SANTA MONICA) ROOFTOP - DAY

                                                                    5.

A man, DUNCAN SU, sits in a rental 2002 Thunderbird.

INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Su's focused, intense, listening to a fancy WALKMAN through
HEADPHONES. We hear what he hears. Only there's no music,
just STATIC.
Suddenly, on Su's headphones, a PHONE RINGS. Su grows even
more alert. We hear a man with a French accent answer the
phone.
                           CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)
           Yes?

                         FAIT (V.O.)
           We're in position.
                         CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)
           Delivery confirmed. The stones are
           there.
                           FAIT (V.O.)
           Not for long.
CLICK.   HISS.
Su didn't like what he just heard.       Curses in Chinese.   And
takes off.

EXT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
Perched on the side of a cliff above the Pacific, next to
the park. The top floor is at street level.
Su easily gains access to the roof of the building. He
moves to an exact position just at the ocean-side edge. It's
an eight-story drop.
Su faces in.      And then... Hops backward off the roof.
Falling feet-first through the air, Su momentarily grabs
onto an eight-floor balcony rail, slowing his descent, then
lets go.
Momentarily grabs a seventh-floor rail and lets go. Grabs a
sixth-floor rail. Hangs on this time. Vaults lightly onto
the balcony.


INT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

                                                                    6.
A large, free-standing FISH TANK BUBBLES away. Nearby,
CHRISTOPHE is packing to leave town. When...
                         SU (0.S.)
           Where are the stones?

Christophe turns.       Sees Su standing behind him.
                         CHRISTOPHE
                   (French accent)
           Who the fuck are you?
Wham.   The Chinese boxing version of a bitch-slap.
                         SU
           Who's getting them for you?

                            CHRISTOPHE
           Fuck off.
Wham!   Wham!   Wham!     Wham!   Much more violent than a bitch-
slap.
                            CHRISTOPHE
           I'll tell you.
                            SU
           I know.

INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY
A plasma torch burns through the metal-reinforced slab
overhead. Fait taps Miles, who turns off the torch.
Fait hammers at the last layer. And...

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
A hole appears under the private display table, where it
can't be seen by the room's security camera.

INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY
Fait communicates via a high-tech, transmitting/receiving
earwig.
                            FAIT
           Daria.

INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY
Douglas looks up from his magazine and checks the security
monitors again. Everything a-okay.

                                                                   7.


ANGLE - FRONT DOOR
A limo pulls up outside.


EXT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - DAY
A uniformed chauffeur gets out of the limo, moves to the
back and opens the door. A very attractive woman in a
short, tight dress emerges.

INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY

Escorted by the chauffeur, the woman, DARIA, enters. She
approaches the security station. Up close, in the light,
Daria's even more alluring. And knows how to wield it.
                        DARIA
          I'm here for the reception.
                          DOUGLAS
          Name, please?
                          DARIA
          Angie Rawlins.
Douglas scans a list of names.      Checks off hers.
                        DOUGLAS
          Thank you. You can go on up.       Front
          elevator, to the mezzanine.
Daria turns toward the elevator. Then doesn't go. Just
glances up toward the party, suddenly unenthusiastic.
                        DARIA
          ... I hate these things.      Don't you
          hate these things?
                        DOUGLAS
          I'm just here to do my job.
Daria looks back at Douglas.      Studies him a moment.   Liking
what she sees.
                        DARIA
          Then again, you never know who you're
          going to meet...
She shifts her wrap, baring cleavage.      Then leans over the
desk. Giving Douglas an eyeful.
                          DARIA

                                                               8.
          I'll bet you're a lot more fun than
          any of those boring people upstairs.
Douglas is unaffected.   Just looks at her blankly.
                         DOUGLAS
          Really, ma'am.   I have a job to do.
Daria doesn't understand why he's not interested in her.
Then she glimpses Douglas's magazine lying on the desk.

DARIA'S POV
The magazine is Genre.   Males for males.   Buff boys.   Big
pecs, big penises.


BACK TO SCENE
Daria steps back.
                        DARIA
          Well, I suppose I should go up and
          see what they're selling.
Daria turns back and calls to her chauffeur, TOMMY.
                         DARIA
          Tommy...
What happens next happens very quickly and sotto voce, as
Daria walks toward Tommy:
She whispers into a hidden mike --
                        DARIA
          Change of plans. He's gay.
Tommy hears it over his earwig.
                         TOMMY
          No way.
                         DARIA
          Yeah way.
INTERCUT WITH:

INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY
Fait and Miles have heard it, too.   Into his mike --
                          FAIT
          Tommy.    Your turn.

                                                            9.

A look of alarm on Tommy's face.    Into his mike --
                         TOMMY
          Uh-uh.

                        FAIT
          This isn't a conversation.    Do it.
It's an order.    Tommy knows he has to.   Shit.
                         TOMMY
          Shit.
                         DARIA
          Key-card.

Then, still to Tommy, her voice again at normal volume --
                        DARIA
          Why don't you keep my purse?     I
          shouldn't be too long.
Daria hands Tommy her purse. Palms the key-card from him.
Then heads toward the elevator, as...
Tommy replaces the sick look on his face. Does his best to
look flirty as he walks over to the security station. Leans
over the desk with a yummy-smile on his face.
                         TOMMY
          ... Aloha.
(NOTE: The following scene is INTERCUT with Scenes 20
 thru 28.)
Douglas looks up from his magazine.
                         DOUGLAS
          Hi.
                        TOMMY
          I hope you don't take offense at
          this... but I just have such a
          weakness for a man in uniform.
                        DOUGLAS
          If that's your thing...
                        TOMMY
          Uniform's definitely my thing. I
          mean, I see a sailor, I'm thinking,
          mmm, seafood. Y'know?
                        DOUGLAS
          I'm not actually supposed to be

                                                   10.
          talking on duty.
                        TOMMY
          Who's talking? Honey, this is a
          flirting... But you're probably just
          another good-looking man wasting it
          all on women. World's full of fools.
Beat.   Douglas lets him see the Genre magazine.
                        TOMMY
          Yahtzee!... Okay, Mr. I-Always-Have-
          A-Hard-Nightstick. Put away the
          pictures of those underfed, white
          males and let's broaden your
          horizons.

                        TOMMY (CONT'D)
          I like sunsets and puppy dogs, and
          I'm big in the pants. Just hope I'm
          not too cute for you. And don't tell
          me it's a color thing, hon, or I'll
          come over there and slap a little
          discrimination right upside your
          yummy little cheeks.
                        DOUGLAS
          I'm hooked up.
                        TOMMY
          Another big, hot, cuddly, black love-
          Jesus got there first. That bitch.
          Taking you. From me.
                        DOUGLAS
          Sorry.
                        TOMMY
          Hey... This day and age, sweetie, I
          can appreciate the monogamy. Saving
          it for your number one is keeping the
          world safe, and it's okay by me.
          Even if you are just breaking my
          heart... Guess I'll just have to come
          in here someday, let you catch me
          shoplifting and resist arrest -- just
          to have you wrestle me down and cuff
          me.
                        DOUGLAS
          I can be pretty rough.
                        TOMMY
          Don't you get me all excited now.   I
          was just learning to accept my
          disappointment.

                                                                11.

Tommy sticks out his hand.
                           TOMMY
          Tommy.     But you can call me Rachel.

Shaking hands --
                        DOUGLAS
          Douglas. And, man, I really gotta
          get back to what I'm supposed to be
          doing, okay?
He looks away.     Scans the monitors.


ANGLE - MONITORS
Everything looks normal.

ANGLE BACK ON TOMMY AND DOUGLAS
Seeing Douglas is unaware of what's happening in the vault,
Tommy relaxes.
                        TOMMY
          I'll leave you alone. But is it okay
          if I just stand here and stare at the
          muscles I'll be missing for the rest
          of my
          life?
OFF which...

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Daria gets in. Looks back to make sure Tommy has Douglas's
attention. He does.
Instead of going up, Daria uses the key-card to access the
controls to go down.

ANOTHER ANGLE
As the doors close, Daria shoots a wink back at...

TOMMY
who furtively flips her the bird.        Never missing a beat with
Douglas.

                                                            12.
INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
Fait emerges from the hole beneath the table.

INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY

On the monitors, we see Fait in the vault anteroom and Daria
descending in the elevator as Tommy keeps Douglas's
attention diverted.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
Fait holds a small digital camera next to the room's
security camera. Mimicking the security camera's slow pan,
Fait films the room. When he's done....

CLOSEUP - FAIT'S DIGITAL CAMERA
We see the panning shot of the room on the monitor. Fait
pulls up an on-screen menu, clicks on "Repeat." Whereupon
the mini-movie begins playing in a continuous loop.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
As Fait mounts his camera in front of the security camera,
Daria steps off the elevator, putting her hair up, ready to
work.

INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY
On the anteroom monitor, we see the monitor on Fait's camera
slide into position, making the room look empty, as Tommy
continues diverting Douglas's attention.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
Fait and Daria push the display table aside as Miles shoves
equipment bags through the hole in the floor.
Fait opens the leather bag, revealing tools, a tripod, three
steel cables and a long, rectangular box. Miles grabs a
high-tech DRILL. Begins BORING a hole high up on the vault
door.
Fait hands Daria the tripod to set up, while he uncoils the
steel cables, attaches them to the wheel on the vault door.
Then opens the rectangular box and lifts out what's inside.
A surface-to-air missile. Fait sets it on the tripod.

                                                             13.
Miles, the hole drilled, picks up the cylinder he'd had
slung over his shoulder. Pulls out a pressurized metal
canister of liquid nitrogen.
Miles injects the nitrogen into the hole. A CRACKLING sound
as the super-low-temp LIQUID spreads out inside the vault
door. The outside frosts over.
Fait finishes attaching the free ends of the cables to clips
on the SAM. Final checks of the rig.
                        FAIT
          Out.

INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - DAY

Speeding through L.A.   Calling 911 on a cell phone.
                        SU
          ... I want to report a crime in
          progress.

INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY
Fait is the last one down through the hole.   Beat.    He looks
at the others.
                        FAIT
          Faith.
                        MILES
          Faith.
                        DARIA
          Faith.
Fait pulls out a remote control firing device.   He pushes
the button. And...

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
The SAM IGNITES with a blinding flash and streaks across the
room. The steel cables instantly snap taut and... RIP the
vault's wheel and frozen locking mechanism right the fuck
out of the door.

INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY
They felt a rumble.   Tommy covers --
                        TOMMY
          Earthquake.

                                                             14.

Douglas checks the monitors.      Everything looks okay.
                        TOMMY
          Bet you know how to hit a ten on the
          Richter scale...


INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
The crew re-emerges through the floor to find the vault door
in pieces and a hole the size of a Sub Zero where the SAM
augured into the opposite wall.
                          DARIA
          Holy shit...

Fait's already swinging open the vault.
                        FAIT
          This will trigger the silent alarm.
          Let's go. We got eleven minutes.
Miles moves down the rows of   drawers, using a tool to pop
all the locks. Fait and Daria   follow behind, quickly pulling
out the drawers and emptying   jewels into nylon bags. Fait
empties drawer after drawer.    All white diamonds. When...
He opens a drawer containing various colored diamonds.     And
stops, admiring them.
                        FAIT
          ... I love colored stones... Look at
          this...
He holds up a small, faceted blue diamond.
                        FAIT
          Two-point-seven million.
Into the bag.
                        MILES
          Whose shit we stealing, anyway?
                        FAIT
          Drug dealers and money launderers.
                          DARIA
          Works for me.
Then something else catches his eye. He holds up a small,
pink diamond on a chain. Admires it.
                        FAIT
          This I can use.

                                                           15.

And pockets it.
                         DARIA
          T.

Fait moves to her. Daria's fishing into a nylon bag she
found in a drawer. Pulls out a handful of... Large black
diamonds. Many more in the bag.
                         FAIT
          Pow.
He takes the bag. Stows it in his jacket. When...
Suddenly, Fait's CELL PHONE RINGS. Surprising them.   Beat.
Fait answers.

                         FAIT
          Go.

INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - DAY
Su's speeding through Los Angeles streets.
                        SU

Fait just hangs up.

INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY
Tommy and Douglas hear APPROACHING SIRENS. The SIRENS STOP
outside. SWAT, cops, the works. All heading for the front
door. Tommy whispers urgently into his mike.
                        TOMMY
          Shit.  Five-0 at the do'.
                  (then, aloud to
                  Douglas)

Fait kneels, feels the track.

                  (to Miles)
          I got no idea where you should go,
          but you know where to end up.
Miles nods.
                           FAIT
          Faith.
                           MILES
          Faith.

INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - DAY

                                                                17.
Su studies a computer map of downtown as he drives.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - MILES - DAY
running like hell. Rounds a curve.      Ahead are the rear
lights of a stopped train.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - FAIT AND DARIA - DAY
Approaching the front of another train, stopped at a
station. Fait signals Daria to stay put. Then pokes his
head around the corner of the train.


FAIT'S POV - STATION PLATFORM
SWAT cops hustle passengers off the train. One SWAT GUY
helps another up to check the top of the train. The SECOND
COP jumps back down.
                          SWAT COP #2
             All clear.

ANGLE BACK
Fait turns back to Daria. Signals her to climb up onto the
top of the train. Then begins climbing after her.
As Fait reaches the driver's window, he sees ANOTHER SWAT
COP approaching the train's DRIVER, checking under seats,
etc.
Fait has to climb fast. The SWAT Guy and the Driver getting
closer. Looking up. Just as...

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - THEIR POV - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Fait's leg just clears the window.      They don't see it.
But...

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION
As Fait rolls onto the top of the train...

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The NOISE causes the SWAT Cop to react.      To the Driver --
                          SWAT COP #3
             Hold it.

                                                              18.

A moment, as they stop and the Cop looks around.    The Cop
checks the Driver's compartment. Nothing.
                         SWAT COP #3
                  (radios)
          Train's clear.
The Cop exits.    The Driver enters his compartment.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION
ANOTHER SWAT COP stands outside the Driver's window.
                         DRIVER
          Okay to go?
                        SWAT COP #4
          Just hang tight.
During which, just above them...
Fait and Daria lie very still. Daria's tense. Fait winks at
her, trying to relax her. Daria's still tense. He raises his
eyebrows slightly. Shifts his gaze down.
She doesn't get it. Finally follows his gaze. Sees her
position is giving him a full view of her cleavage. She
looks back at him in disbelief.
                         FAIT
          Nice.
That does it. She relaxes and smiles back. Under which a
voice crackles over the SWAT Cop's radio.
                         RADIO (V.O.)
          All clear.
                          SWAT COP #4
                    (to Driver)
          Okay.    Get this train outta here.
Whereupon the train jerks to a start.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - MILES - DAY
running toward the rear of the stopped train.   Leaping onto
the rear steps. When...
Out of nowhere, a foot catches him in the head, sending him
flying back down onto the rails. And... There is Su in
front of him.

                                                             19.
                        SU
          The stones.

                        MILES
          You'll have to come and get 'em.

Su moves on Miles. Miles throws a solid punch at him. Su
and Miles fight on the track behind the stopped train. The
deadly third rail making the fight even more dangerous.
Miles is a street boxer. He's good. He's ferocious. But
he's no match for Su. When Miles is subdued, Su grabs the
bag of jewels, makes sure Miles doesn't have any more, then
goes.


INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - SUBWAY CAR ROOF - DAY
Rocketing underground. The tunnel ceiling whizzes by above
Fait and Daria. Intermittent tunnel fixtures just inches
from their heads.
Every time the train takes a curve, they both slide toward
the edge. Fait places a calming hand on top of Daria's. The
car takes a wide curve.
Daria's body flips to the side. She loses her grip.
Screams as she starts to fall off the train. Fait reaches
for Daria, losing his grip on his bag, which plummets off
the train.
Fait can't grab her. The train jerks again. He starts
sliding away from her, off the opposite side. Fait thrusts
out both hands as far as he can. And...
Just snags her at the last second. Grips Daria's wrists
with all he's got. They're now draped across the curved roof
of the train. Hands in the middle. If Daria slips, or Fait
lets her go, they both die.

INT. RENTAL T-BIRD (OUTSIDE SUBWAY ENTRANCE) - DAY
Su gets in. Empties Miles' nylon bag into his lap. A
fortune in gems and jewelry pours out. Su sifts through it,
increasingly agitated. What he wants isn't there. He throws
the bag down, cursing in Chinese.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - SUBWAY CAR ROOF - DAY
Fait is at his limit. His grip starts to loosen. When the
train begins to slow. They pull into a station and stop.
Fait releases Daria, and she drops to the platform.

                                                            20.
Fait jumps down on the other side. He's lost the bag of
jewels. Knows they're gone for good. He feels for the bag
of black diamonds. Still has them.
Unseen, Fait joins Daria on the platform, and, hand in hand,
they melt into the crowd of commuters.


EXT. AIRPORT - GENERAL AVIATION TERMINAL - DUSK
A stretch limo and a Cadillac Escalade wait on the tarmac
next to a Gulfstream, which has just arrived.
The jet door opens, and a man emerges with a bodyguard. The
man, LING, is Asian, about forty. Emanates grace and power.
As Ling descends the steps, and two thugs from the SUV go to
retrieve baggage...
A woman steps out of the waiting limo to greet Ling.   She's
also Asian. Dressed in American casual. Beautiful.     SONA.
She's not smiling. As Ling approaches her --
                        LING
          Enjoying California?
CHARLES, the bodyguard, answers for himself.
                        CHARLES
          Hope we're not here long.    I hate
          sunshine.
Ling kisses Sona on the lips.    Then --
                        SONA
          We may have a problem.
Ling's mood quickly darkens.
                        LING
          The stones?
                        SONA
          The exchange was just robbed.
                        LING
          ... Let's hope that was part of the
          plan.

INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
Swarming with police. When... Su steps off the elevator.
He's carrying the bag of jewels he took from Miles. To a
COP --
                        SU

                                                            21.
          Who's in charge?
                        COP
          Who wants to know?
Su flashes I.D. We don't see it.   The Cop scopes it a
moment. He's clearly impressed.
                        COP
          Follow me.
As he leads Su toward his superiors in the vault...

INT. VANESSA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

VANESSA, eight, is in her pajamas, playing SIM Coaster on
her computer. The door opens. Fait enters. His daughter.
                        FAIT
          You know it's past your bedtime.
                        VANESSA
          Just a little longer.
                        FAIT
                  (imitating sweetly)
          'Just a little longer'... School
          tomorrow, baby. Let's go.
Vanessa sighs. Fait stands over her as she shuts down the
computer, talking her through the commands, making sure she
doesn't dawdle.
                       FAIT
          'Exit.' 'Quit.' 'Do not save.'
          'Special.' 'Shut down.' Sleepy-
          time.
Whereupon he whisks her out of her chair, flies her once
around the room and tucks her into bed.
                        FAIT
          You bag some Z's now, you hear?
                        VANESSA
          Okay.
                        FAIT
          ... Wait a second.
                        VANESSA
          What?
                        FAIT
          I think there's something behind your

                                                               22.
          ear.
                        VANESSA
          Oh, please, that is so lame.     It's in
          your hand.

She takes his right hand, opens it and turns it over.
Nothing. Takes his left hand, opens it and turns it over.
More nothing. She's stumped.
Fait smiles. Puts his hands together. When he opens them,
there is the pink diamond pendant on the chain.
                        VANESSA
          How'd you do that?

Fait slips the chain over her head and kisses her.
                          FAIT
          Good night.
Then Fait looks up.     Addresses the air above her.
                        FAIT
          Angels east, angels west, north and
          south, do your best. Guard her,
          watch her, while she rests.
A bedtime ritual. Fait goes. When she's alone, Vanessa
holds up the diamond, which catches every bit of available
light and shines in the dark.
Then she rolls over and closes her eyes.

INT. FAIT'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
Fait enters.     Vanessa's nanny, TONITA, is there.    To Tonita
--
                        FAIT
          She'll stay down now.
                        TONITA
          She won't listen to me lately.     Only
          you.
                        FAIT
          I'll have a talk with her about it
          tomorrow.
Still to the nanny --
                        FAIT
          I got some work to do in the office.
          You can go on to bed.

                                                            23.
                        TONITA
          I'm watching TV, if you need me.
Fait exits.


INT. FAIT'S BAR/LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Fait enters.    Tommy and Daria are there.

                        TOMMY
          What the hell happened?
Fait puts a finger to his lips.    Leads them across the room
to another door.


INT. FAIT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
They enter.    Fait shuts the door.
                        TOMMY
          Should we be considering a
          long vacation in a warm,
          foreign climate where there's
          no extradition?
Fait's thinking it through.
                        FAIT
          The guy who called was only
          interested in the black stones...
                        DARIA
          Christophe sold us out.
                          FAIT
          Or something.
Just then, Miles enters.
                          DARIA
          You made it.
                        MILES
          By the skin of my ass. Some
          Chinese dude kicked me around
          the motherfuckin' block. Busted
          my ear piece.
He takes the broken communication device out of his ear and
tosses it on the table.
                        MILES
          Snagged my loot, too... Maybe time to

                                                              24.
          rethink the no-gun policy.
                        TOMMY
          Little ass-whuppin's nothing. 'Least
          you didn't have to play all foxy with
          the rent-a-cop.

Fait pulls out the bag of black diamonds.
                        FAIT
          Means this is all we got.
                        DARIA
          So what do we do?
                        FAIT
          You all wait to hear from me.
                        TOMMY
          Where're you going?
                        FAIT
          To get some answers.
Miles moves to go with him.
                        MILES
          I got your back.
                        FAIT
          No. I got us into this.     I'll call
          you if I need you.
Daria moves to him.   Their eyes meet.
                         DARIA
          Be careful.
Fait gives her a kiss.   Then goes.

INT. CHRISTOPHE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Christophe's arms are   wrapped around the large fish tank,
one arm over the top,   the other through the legs of the
stand. His hands are    bound. He can't move. His beaten
face is pressed to the   glass. Large, weird fish swim past
in front of him.
The weird fish scatter as a face appears on the other side
of the tank. Ling. Looking through at Christophe.
Ling straightens and walks around the tank. Sona is with
him. So is Charles, the bodyguard. In b.g., the two thugs
stand sentry near the front door. Christophe's eyes follow
them.

                                                            25.

                        LING
          So this is Mr. Christophe?
                        SONA
          Yes. Only the handcuffs and fish
          tank are a new look.
                        LING
          Apparently we're not his first
          visitors today.
                        CHRISTOPHE
          Please, Monsieur Ling --
Ling interrupts him with a hand on the shoulder.

                        LING
          Whatever you're going to say... Make
          it the truth.

EXT. ARCHIE'S AMERICAN SURPLUS - M1A1 TANK - NIGHT
Sitting in the middle of the large lot, which is full of hot
goods and military surplus equipment. The tank's turret is
spinning around. The cannon elevating and depressing
seemingly at random. When...
The cannon stops. Having locked on...Fait, standing in
front of the tank. From inside the tank, a muffled voice.
                        VOICE (O.S.)
          Bang.
A hatch opens. ARCHIE, a fairly straight-ahead-looking man,
pops his head up out of the tank.
                        ARCHIE
          Like it?
                        FAIT
          It's cool.
As Archie climbs out of the tank and joins Fait --
                        ARCHIE
          Want it? Give you a good deal. Ammo
          included... Reactive armor, twin M240
          machine guns, 120mm smoothbore
          cannon. Guaranteed to get you
          through the rougher areas of the city
          and keep the neighbors in line.
                        FAIT
          Pass.

                                                         26.

                        ARCHIE
          How about a Marine Corps assault
          hovercraft?
                        FAIT
          I got other business.
Fait and Archie walk to a work table. Nearby, two MEN
UNLOAD HOT TVS from a truck. One Man calls to Archie.
                        MAN UNLOADING HOT TVS
          We're outta room over here, Arch.
                        ARCHIE
          Stack 'em in the office, if you have
          to.
Then Archie turns his attention back to Fait.
                        ARCHIE
          ... You weren't downtown tonight by
          any chance, were you, Tony?
                        FAIT
          Don't know what you're talking about.
                        ARCHIE
          Me either.
                        FAIT
          Ever see black diamonds before?
                        ARCHIE
          White, blue, yellow, pink. Neil
          Diamond. Lou Diamond Phillips.
          Black diamonds? Solid rocks? No.
Whereupon Fait opens the nylon bag and pours the black
diamonds out onto the table. Archie pulls out a loup.
Studies them a moment. Shrugs.
                        ARCHIE
          You got me.
                        FAIT
          Find out how much they're worth.
                        ARCHIE
          There a timetable on this, or --
                        FAIT
          Yesterday.
                        ARCHIE
          That's what I figured.

                                                                27.

Fait's heading out.
                        FAIT
          I'll be back. I gotta go fuck over a
          guy who fucked me over.


INT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Fait opens a door with an electronic lock pick.

INT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Fait enters. Stops a moment, his back against the closed
door, while his eyes adjust to the dark. Then moves quietly
out into the room. Looking for Christophe.
Fait continues moving around through the room. When he
steps in something wet. He bends down and checks it out.
Water. The carpet's soaked.
His eyes go to something. Fait finds a cord and turns on a
switch. The light in the fish tank snaps on.
REVEAL Christophe.     Stuffed inside the tank.     Sleeping with
the fishes.
                        SU (O.S.)
          Looks dead to me.
Behind him.   Fait turns around.      Sees Su.   Sitting on a
sofa.
                        FAIT
          Guess you got to him first.
                           SU
          Not me.     Someone else.
Fait does the math.
                        FAIT
          ... You're the one who called me.
          The one who took on my guy... Who the
          fuck are you, man?
                          SU
          My name is Su.
                           FAIT
          Cool.     I'm Sally.
                        SU
          I want the black stones.

                                                                  28.

                            FAIT
             Yeah?   Make me an offer.
Su stands.

                           SU
             You can walk out of here.
                            FAIT
             ... No deal.
Fait launches   himself at Su. Gonna fight     his way    out the
door. A much    better fighter than Miles.     And...    He's saved
by the bell:    the PHONE RINGS. The fight     stops.     The
phone's near   Fait. Beat. The answering      machine    picks up.

                           CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)
             Christophe here. Leave a message.
BEEP.
                           LING (V.O.)
             I know you're there, Mr. Fait.
Beat.   Fait pushes the button for the speakerphone.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Overlooking L.A. Ling and Sona. Enjoying hotel room
service. Ling's on a cell phone.
                             LING
             The man for   whom Mr. Christophe
             arranged to   have the black stones
             brought into   the country and
             deposited at   the jewelry exchange.
             The man who   wants them back. Now.
                            FAIT
             Fine.   How much?
                           LING
             Maybe you didn't understand me.    The
             stones are already mine.
                           FAIT
             I got 'em, I'm selling 'em. So get
             your bid in or go fuck yourself.

                                                               29.
                           LING
             I don't have time for this.
                           FAIT
             That your final offer?

                           LING
             I can be a very dangerous man, Mr.
             Fait.
Fait just hangs up.
                        FAIT
          Everybody think I'm the fucking
          Goodwill or something...? Look, I've
          had a shitty night, and so far, I got
          zip for all my troubles. So I don't
          know who the fuck you are, and I
          don't care. But hear this: you can
          beat my ass around the block all
          night --
          Brother, it ain't gonna get you those
          stones.
A long beat. The two men facing off. Then...
As Su stands aside, giving Fait a clear path out...

EXT. STREET NEAR CHRISTOPHE'S - NIGHT
Fait slides into his Porsche and drives off.

INT./EXT. FAIT'S PORSCHE - NIGHT
Fait's checking his rearview mirror. Sees a black Cadillac
Escalade pull away from the curb and follow.
Fait doesn't need it.
                           FAIT
             Oh, man...
He's about    to punch it. When... A cop car turns a corner
and falls    in beside him. Fait throttles back. Keeps
driving.     Until, finally... The cops turn off. And now...
Fait hits    it. Until...
Traffic ahead forces Fait to turn into an alley in a semi-
industrial area. Behind him, the Escalade tries to follow,
but is cut off by the on-coming cars.
We STAY WITH Fait. He GUNS down the alley. Reaches an
intersecting alley. Turns. GUNS it out of sight.

                                                               30.
INT./EXT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Finally forcing its way through on-coming traffic and
speeding down the alley after Fait. The ESCALADE reaches the
intersection. Turns. And... CRASHES into a DUMPSTER rolled
into its path. The dumpster forces the Escalade into a
wall.

EXT. ALLEY (SEMI-INDUSTRIAL AREA) - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Two men start to get out of the Escalade. We recognize
them: Ling's two thugs. We barely have time to realize
that Fait's escape has been blocked by construction
equipment down the alley. He's had no choice but to turn
and fight.

Which is what he does, rushing the passenger.
The battle's ferocious and fast. Ultimately, Fait's out-
muscled and out-gunned. He's forced back against the open
door of the Escalade, guns to his head.
                        LING THUG #1
          Give us the stones.
                        FAIT
          Man, how many times I gotta tell
          people: I'm a business man. Make me
          a motherfucking offer.
                        LING THUG #2
          Here's your offer.
He cocks his pistol.   Beat.
                        FAIT
          That shit ain't gonna do it, biggie.
          'Cause I ain't scared of guns, and I
          ain't got the stones.
                        LING THUG #1
          Then you're gonna tell us where they
          are.
Whereupon a...
BOTTLE
Spins through the air. The bottle knocks the gun from one
Killer's hand. The gun skids under a nearby chain-link
fence.
REVEAL

two. Using all means available. During the battle, a killer
tries to reach the gun behind the chain-link fence. Almost
gets it. When...
Two vicious DOBERMANS, guard dogs for the junkyard behind
the fence, leap out of nowhere, SNARLING and SNAPPING and
smash into the fence. The killer jumps back, barely
escaping with his arm.
The fight continues.   Fait and Su wear them down.
Behind the fence, the Dobies want flesh. Every time someone
crashes into the fence, they're right there trying to get a
piece.
Also, every time someone crashes into the old fence, we see
a series of chain-link connections loosen and break. Until
it happens one too many times. The entire fence goes down.
The dogs are out. The nearest targets: Su and Fait.Su and
Fait must now focus their attention on fighting off and
evading the ferocious attack dogs.
Finally, Su kicks one dog flying. Whip-kicks the other off
Fait. The two men run for the Escalade. The dogs are up in a
flash. Su spots an abandoned car. A rear door is open.
                        SU
          Over here.
Fait follows, right on his heels.
The dogs close in.
Su reaches the car. Dives through the open door.
Somersaults over the rear seat. Kicks open the far door and
rolls out. Fait dives in right behind him. The Dobies leap
in after Fait.
Fait's airborne completely through the back seat and out the
other side of the car. Clears the door. And... Su slams
the door shut.
We watch a two-Doberman pile-up against the suddenly closed
door as Su leaps to the car's other side and shuts that
door, too. Trapping the SNARLING, foaming DOGS inside.
The bad guys are gone. And Fait's CELL PHONE is RINGING. As
Fait digs out the phone, to Su --
                        FAIT
          Man, what the hell's up with these
          fucking stones?
                  (into phone)
          Go.

          It's Archie.    Bad news.   We got a
          problem.

CLOSEUP - VIDEO MONITOR
Surveillance camera footage of Archie's.

Five armed African-Americans, faces hidden under baseball
caps, enter Archie's place, put Archie up against a wall and
start to beat something out of him.
                        ARCHIE (O.S.)
          ... I did what you said, right? Put
          it out on the street, trying to get
          info on the stones. Next thing I
          know, the Jackson Five here show
          up... Now, there are three
          significant elements to notice here.
          One, I'm outnumbered. Two, they're
          heavily armed. Three, they're gonna
          beat me like a bongo drum...

INT. ARCHIE'S AMERICAN SURPLUS - OFFICE - NIGHT
Archie, Fait and Su are watching the monitor. On screen,
Archie surrenders immediately.

          sure -- and they coulda beat me into
          a coma or killed me or whatever --
          but then, see, I'm thinking: How
          would I be able to tell Tony what
          happened to the stones? Right? What
          good am I dead or on life-support.
          So I threw in the towel.
          Reluctantly, of course. For your
          sake.

Big question is, who's behind the

Su looks over.     Beat.
                           SU
             I'm sorry about your daughter... How
             old is she?
                           FAIT
             This ain't the Biography Channel.
             Let's just get there.
A long beat.     L.A. moving by outside.
                            FAIT
             Eight.   She'll be nine in September.
Beat.
                           SU

                                                          39.
          Mine is fifteen... Boyfriends...
                          FAIT
          Never happen.    I'll just kill
          'em.

                        SU
          I wish it were that easy.
Another beat.   Then --
                        FAIT
          About time I got the 4-1-1.
                          SU
          4-1-1?

                        FAIT
          What's this all about?
                        SU
          The stones aren't what you think they
          are.
                          FAIT
          No shit.
                  (then)
          How about the guy who has Vanessa?
                        SU
          He's exactly what you think he is --
          a thief and a killer.
                          FAIT
          Great...

INT. HANGAR - NIGHT
A battered Ford camper now sits in the middle of the hangar.
We see Vanessa inside the camper. She's screaming. Loudly.
Not scared. Pissed. As...
Ling Thug #2 covers the windows with black spray paint.

ANGLE - ACROSS HANGAR
Ling Thug #2 hands car keys to Charles.
                        CHARLES
          Where'd you get that piece of shit?
                        LING THUG #1
          Let's just say Grandma and Grandpa
          have a long walk back from the

                                                              40.
          campground.
                        CHARLES
          You're sure you cleaned it out?
                        LING THUG #1
          Everything except the denture cream
          and adult diapers.
Vanessa's still screaming.   It's getting on Charles' nerves.
                        CHARLES
          I'm sick of her already.
He marches toward the van.   Unlocks the rear door and slides
it open.


INT./EXT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Vanessa is standing inside, still yelling.
                         CHARLES
          Shut up!
                         VANESSA
          You shut up!
                         CHARLES
          Go to sleep!
Vanessa reaches over and flicks ON the camper's TV.   Turns
it UP LOUD. Giving him stink-eye defiance as...
Charles slams the door shut.   Locks it.   And...
Now that Vanessa's made her point, and Charles can't see her
anymore, her boldness begins to subside. She lies down on
the bed and curls up, alone and scared inside the dark
camper.
Vanessa holds up the pink diamond pendant and gazes at it.
A talisman. Connecting her to her father. Not making the
fear go away, but giving her strength.

CLOSEUP - FAIT
As he drives, just as if he can sense Vanessa's need for him
--
                        FAIT
          Angels east, angels west, north and
          south, do your best. Guard her,

OFF which, as Su regards him...

INT. MEDIUM SECURITY PRISON - CELLBLOCK - DAY
A prison guard escorts Fait and Su past cells, each just as
dreary, spare and institutional as the next. That is, until
they reach the last cell.
The last cell is guarded by two convict sentries.    Hanging
blankets cloak the cell entirely from view.
Fait, Su and the prison guard stop outside the cell. One
sentry blocks the way in as the other parts the blankets
covering the open cell doorway, REVEALING...


INT./EXT. CHAMBER'S CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION
After a walk through Kansas, this is the land of Oz. The
last cell is as comfy, colorful and a well-appointed as
Joel's office.
JUMP CHAMBERS, a large, brutal-looking, inner-city crime
lord has clearly used money and influence to improve the
terms of his incarceration.
Chambers puffs a Cuban as a prison trustee, WILLY CHICKENS,
sets out breakfast before him: fresh-squeezed OJ; eggs
benedict; large, juicy sausages; fresh breads and pastries;
French-press coffee; LA TIMES, NY TIMES, WSJ, Maxim, Hustler
and the daily mail.
The guard leaves Fait and Su, turns to go.
                          CHAMBERS
             Metz.
The guard, METZ, stops and looks back.
                           CHAMBERS
             D.V.D.'s broke.
                           METZ
             Get you a new one straight away, Mr.
             Chambers.
Metz goes.
Beat.   Chambers eyes Fait and Su through his cigar smoke.
                            CHAMBERS
             Thanks for your patience.   Man needs
             his nightly rest.
                     (then)
             Who's the gook?

                                                            42.

          ... Chinese guy.
                        CHAMBERS
          ... No shoes in my crib.

Then, when Fait and Su have removed their shoes --
                         CHAMBERS
          In.
The sentries move aside. Fait and Su enter. Chambers ash-
trays his Cuban and digs into b-fast.
                        FAIT
          How you doing, Jump?
                        CHAMBERS
          Don't waste my precious time.
                        FAIT
          ... I got a problem.

          ... Good.
                        CHAMBERS
          Always was good. From the moment I
          found her till the moment you took
          her away from me. Problem, you say?
                        FAIT
          ... The black stones.
                        CHAMBERS
          Bitch brought it in. Made me a lotta
          money. But that all stopped. You
          stopped that. You decided it was

          I need 'em back.
                        CHAMBERS
          Only smart thing was not pimping her
          yourself, 'cause then I'da been real
          sore-angry, and you'da both been real
          cold-dead...
                        CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
          But you don't pimp, do you? Just a

          thief in the night. Stealing what
          don't belong to you.
Chambers turns to Su.   In SUBTITLED KOREAN --
                        CHAMBERS
          You like tall white women?
Su doesn't say anything.   Back to English --
                        CHAMBERS
          He can't talk?
                        SU
          I don't speak Korean.

Chambers carves up a sausage.
                        CHAMBERS
          Bought myself this Korean club
          downtown. Packing in the Seoul
          brothers 24-7-365... Black man
          gouging Koreans, ain't that a
          switch... Motherfuckers got faces
          like walls, but they love to drink
          liquor and look at naked girls...
          Place is no shitbox, either. Got me
          an office looks like a kabuki love
          palace. My own little sanctuary --
A QUICK SHOT OF Fait, taking this in.
                        CHAMBERS
          -- just waiting for when I parole
          out... Stop by sometime, eyeball the

          ... Jump, my daughter's mixed up in
          this. I gotta have the stones, or
          she's dead.
No response.   Chambers just keeps eating.
                        FAIT
          If you need something more than that,
          here it is...
                  (this is hard)
          I'm begging you, Jump.
Still no response... Chambers finishes eating.    Wipes his
face. Finally --
                       CHAMBERS
          Big heist. Risky heist. Breaking
          news. I'm watching it wondering why.

          What's worth that kind of trouble,

          expensive.
Beat.   He meets Fait's eyes.   Holds them.

                        FAIT
          She's my little girl.
                         CHAMBERS
          Make another one... Lotta offspring
          running around. Big scores're rare
          in a lifetime.
Another beat.   That's it.   No deal.

Fait takes a sudden step toward Chambers.     Su stops him.
                        CHAMBERS
          Slope's no dope.
He indicates behind them. They turn. The two cell sentries
are wielding prison shanks. So is Willy Chickens.
                         CHICKENS
          Let me cut one of these
          motherfuckers.
                         CHAMBERS
          Your choice.
Chickens is happy.   Thrusts the knife at Fait.       When...
Su reaches out and catches the   blade.  Catches it with just
the thumb and forefinger of one   hand.  And holds it like
that. Holds it hard. Chickens     can't push and can't pull.
Doesn't know what to do next.    Finally yanks really hard.
And...
Su lets go. Chickens goes backward, ass over teakettle. A
beat. Then, to Fait --
                        CHAMBERS
          Say hey to Daria. And don't forget
          your shoes.

EXT. PRISON - DAY
Fait and Su walk toward the Porsche.
                        FAIT
          I used to look up to that guy.      All I
          wanted was to be like him.

                                                            45.
                       SU
         In Taiwan, I could force him to talk.
                        FAIT
         This ain't Taiwan.
                 (then)
         Only thing we can do now is find out
         where the stones are and go take 'em.
                       SU
         You make it sound easy.
                        FAIT
         It won't be.
They're about to get in the car. Fait stops.     Looks back at
the prison. Suddenly realizing something.
                       FAIT
         ... They're at his club.
                       SU
         How do you know?
                        FAIT
         I know. I can feel it.      That ever
         happen to you?
                        SU
         No.
                       FAIT
         I thought Chinese people were all
         mystical and shit.

         We like to gamble.     Not guess.
                       FAIT
         It's no guess... But I could be
         wrong... We'll hit the club. You
         gotta see Archie.
                        SU
         Archie?
                       FAIT
         He's gotta remember something about
         the guys who took down his place.
                       SU
         What if he can't?
                       FAIT
         Pretend it's Taiwan.    Make him
         remember.

INT. HANGAR - DAY
RUSSELL, the science and technology end of Ling's operation,
carries a piece of equipment from the back of a five-ton
truck and approaches some kind of strange contraption, which
he's in the process of erecting in the middle of the hangar.
He puts down what he's carrying next to the contraption and
starts back for something else, when he sees Charles is
looking in the back of the truck.
                          RUSSELL
          Hey!    Get away from there!
Russell hurries over, extremely edgy, almost manic.

                        RUSSELL
          What are you doing?!
                        CHARLES
          Whoa. Take it easy. Just seeing if
          I could help with something.
                        RUSSELL
          You can't! It's very delicate
          equipment! Stay away! Just stay
          away from my truck!
                         CHARLES
          What?
                        RUSSELL
          Stay away from my truck!
                         CHARLES
          What?
                        RUSSELL
          Stay away from my truck!
                         CHARLES
          What?
Sona's emerging from a trailer/office nearby.
                         SONA
          Stop it.
Charles does. And now we can hear Vanessa, who's begun
screaming inside the camper.
                        VANESSA (O.S.)
          I want my daddy!
Charles backs up, continuing to address Russell --

                                                            47.

                        CHARLES
          I'm backing away... I'm backing
          away...
                        VANESSA (O.S.)
          I want my daddy! I want my daddy!
Charles joins Sona.   Re:   Russell --
                        CHARLES
          Someone give the geek his Ritalin.
                        SONA
          At least he's doing his job. Which
          is more than I can say for some
          people.
                        VANESSA (O.S.)
          I want my daddy! I want my daddy!
Sona tosses Charles a roll of duct tape.
                        SONA
          Tape her up and gag her.
As Vanessa continues to SCREAM, Charles moves to the van,
unlocks the rear door with the key/remote and pockets it.
Then opens the door. And...
Vanessa bolts out, crying, and clamps her arms around his
waist.
                         VANESSA
          I want my daddy! I want my daddy!    I
          want my daddy!
                        CHARLES
          Get the hell off me.
He pries loose her arms from around him. Keeping a grip on
her wrists with one hand, Charles turns her around to face
away from him. He's about to start duct-taping her wrists.
                        CHARLES
          ... Waste of time... I can think of a
          better way of shutting you
          up --
Vanessa back-kicks him hard in the 'nads.   Charles howls in
pain and lets her go.
Quickly, Vanessa jumps back inside the camper.

INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION

                                                           48.

Vanessa slams the sliding rear door shut. And now... We
suddenly realize she has the key and remote! The crying
just an act she put on to pickpocket Charles. Vanessa pushes
the remote. And...


EXT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
THUNK go the DOOR LOCKS. Charles, still in pain, is
surprised to hear this. Feels his pocket. Realizes the key
and remote are gone.
                        CHARLES
          Shit.
                  (yells to Sona)
          She got the key!

INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Vanessa climbs into the driver's seat. Puts the key into
the ignition and STARTS the ENGINE. Puts it in "D."

CLOSEUP - ACCELERATOR PEDAL
To reveal Vanessa's rigged a soda can to the pedal. An
extension for her short legs. As her foot tromps down on the
can...

ANGLE - CAMPER
takes off. The windows are blacked out and Vanessa can't
see where she's going. But she's going.

INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The camper careens around the large space.   Charles
scrambles after.

INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Vanessa keeps driving blind, pedal to the metal.

INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The CAMPER veers toward the rear wall.   And...
... CRASHES into a support post.
As Charles yanks Vanessa from the wrecked van, unhurt...

                                                           49.


INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY
A hostess bar, but very high-end. Beautiful women. Elegant
decor. Pumping MUSIC. No strip-club cheese. For extra
money, private rooms for private pleasures. It's day, but
the place is wall-to-wall with Korean men.
Chambers' African-Americans maintain low visibility:   at the
door, behind the scenes, counting the register, etc.
ODION, a dangerous-looking Chambers main man, moves through
the crowd to Daria, waiting near the front door.
                        ODION
          Delicious Daria.
                         DARIA

                        ODION
          Long time no see.
Then, checking her out --
                         ODION
          Like cognac. Just getting better.
                  (then)
          So what brings you around?
                        DARIA
          ... Sometimes you need an old friend,
          y'know?
                         ODION
          Got trouble?
                        DARIA
          ... With a capital 'T.'
                       ODION
          Tony Fait? Thought you and him were
          tight. Bonnie and Clyde.
                        DARIA
          Used to be that way. Not treating me
          right these days. The kid's all he
          cares about.
                        ODION
          ... What do you want me to do?
                        DARIA
          ... Man, I don't know. Probably
          nothing you can do. I just

                                                     50.
          thought...
                  (then)
          Hey, y'know, this is crazy. I don't
          know what I was thinking. I
          shouldn't even be here like this.
          Sorry, Odion.

Daria starts to go.   Odion stops her.
                        ODION
          Nah, hey, hold up. It's okay.
                        DARIA
          Back in the day... Just always seemed
          like you and I had something special
          between us.

                        ODION
          Didn't know you thought so.
                        DARIA
          I always cared for you, Odion.
          That's why I'm here.
                        ODION
          ... You looking for a job?
                        DARIA
          I need something.
                        ODION
          ... So maybe you could work here.
                        DARIA
          Here?... Oh, man, I don't know.
                        ODION
          You were the best. Not many girls
          pulling in two g's a night.
                        DARIA
          Yeah, but it's been a while for
          that... Might not remember how.
                        ODION
          Just like a bicycle, baby.     You don't
          forget that stuff.
Daria considers it a moment.
                        DARIA
          Don't know how Jump'd feel about it.
          Having me back.
                        ODION
          Hey, you let me worry about Jump,

                                                            51.
          okay?
                  (then)
          Meantime, why don't you come on in,
          and you and me can, y'know, talk some
          more about it.

Beat.   Daria knows the look in his eyes.   Gets the subtext.
                         DARIA
          ... Just talk?
Odion's drinking her in.
                         ODION
          ... No.

A beat. Then, as Daria reaches out and slips her hand into
Odion's, smiling at him --

INT. SU'S T-BIRD - DAY
Su and Archie.
                        SU
          They have boxing matches in the day?
                        ARCHIE
          Not exactly boxing. More dangerous.
          No gloves. No rules. Big money.
          Very illegal... Started holding 'em
          during the daytime to fool the cops.
                        SU
          The man you remembered -- how do you
          know he will be here?
                         ARCHIE
          I don't. But Chambers owns the
          operation, so I figure it's a good
          place to start.
                  (then)
          This is it.
They turn into...

EXT. FIGHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS ACTION
A cavernous industrial building.   Cars parked on the
perimeter.

INT./EXT. SU'S T-BIRD - CONTINUOUS ACTION
As they park --

                                                            52.

                        SU
          How will you recognize him?
                        ARCHIE
          I didn't see his face.   But I'll know
          his pinkie ring when I  see it. Ten
          carats. Round cut with   square mount.
          Good color and clarity.   I remember
          thinking what it would  do to my face
          if he hit me.
OFF Su's dubious look, as Archie crams on a baseball hat to
help disguise himself...


INT. FIGHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Archie and Su exit the car and approach a GUARD manning a
gate to the fight arena beyond.
                        SU
          How do we get in?
                        ARCHIE
          Leave that to me.
Then, to the Guard --
                        ARCHIE
          Hey, man, how you doing? Got a
          fighter here I want to enter.
Su shoots him a surprised look.
                        ARCHIE
          My man's gonna put the rest of these
          bums to beddy-bye. He'll go in there
          and get all Chinese on 'em -- the
          teeth are gonna fly, the blood's
          gonna run... Gonna be fun.
                        GUARD
          Whatever... You're number twelve,
          Bruce.
He hands a card reading "12" to Su. As Archie and Su make
their way toward the arena --
                        SU
          I didn't come here to fight.
                        ARCHIE
          You won't have to. That was just to
          get us in.

                                                                  53.
They reach the arena. It's also huge. Packed with men.
Hazy with smoke. Loud with betting, cheers and boos.
A large, chain-link cage stands at the center of the room.
Inside, two battered and bloodied fighters are beating the
shit out of each other.

Like at    a Gallagher concert, front row fans have sheets of
plastic    over their laps. Whenever a hard kick or punch
lands,    the nearest fans quickly raise the plastic sheets to
shield    themselves from flying blood.
                          ARCHIE
            Good day, over a million dollars'll
            pass hands in here.

                             SU
            Find the ring.
                             ARCHIE
            Yeah.    Okay.
He looks around.      Lotta African-American males.
                          ARCHIE
            Could take a little while.
As Archie starts moving through the crowd, looking at hands,
and Su follows...

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY
Daria and Odion enter, and Odion closes the door. He starts
to take her in his arms. Daria slows him up. Guides him
back toward a sofa.
                             DARIA
            Sit down.
Odion sits.
                          DARIA
            Put on some music.
Odion puts a DISC in the STEREO.        Cranks up some HIP-HOP.
                            DARIA
            Nah.    Something slower.
Odion SWITCHES MUSIC.        A SLOW TUNE fills the room.
                          DARIA
            That's good... Now just relax... And
            watch...

                                                            54.
Daria just stands there a moment, getting her body into the
music. Then starts dancing for him. Slow and sexy.
And Odion's eating it up.


EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
Fait and Miles climb onto the roof with gear bags.   Via
earwig mike --
                            FAIT
          Tommy.

INT./EXT. PEST CONTROL TRUCK - DAY

Tommy's behind the wheel, wearing a pest control uniform.
                        TOMMY
          Here come da bug man.

EXT. KOREAN CLUB - STREET IN FRONT - DAY
The DOORMAN watches Tommy drive up in the pest-control
truck, put on a respirator, get out, unreel 20 feet of pest
spray hose from the truck and advance toward the door.
                            TOMMY
          Hey.    Howzit?
                        DOORMAN
          What the hell you doing?
                        TOMMY
          Pest control. Don't tell me you
          didn't get your notice.
                            DOORMAN
          What notice?
                        TOMMY
          See, that burns my ass right to the
          bone. I mean, hey, I'm here doing my
          job... Anyway, putting that aside, if
          you had gotten your notice, you'd
          know there's a new city ordinance
          saying all businesses catering to
          foreigners gotta be sprayed.
                          DOORMAN
          Yeah?    How come?
                        TOMMY
          'Cause foreign people're bringing all

                                                     55.
          their scary-assed foreign bugs over
          here. Y'know, in their luggage and
          shit. And then the bugs're getting
          loose and fucking everything up --
          eating all the trees and everything,
          y'know, making people sick... Anyway,
          city says we gotta spray to prevent
          any infestation and possible spread.
                        DOORMAN
          We're doing business inside. Can't
          let you just start hosing the place
          with bug spray.
                        TOMMY
          Yeah, well, maybe you should at least
          ask the manager about it.
                        DOORMAN
          Manager's busy.
                        TOMMY
          ... Okay. Your call. Just know the
          city quarantine people'll be here
          first thing tomorrow.
                        DOORMAN
          Quarantine people?
                        TOMMY
          They'll be shutting you down for non-
          compliance... Peace out.
Tommy starts to go.
                        DOORMAN
          Wait, wait, wait.
Tommy stops.
                        DOORMAN
          City's really gonna come and close us
          up?
                        TOMMY
          Quicker'n a Zip-loc.
                        DOORMAN
          ... You sure you're not fucking with
          me?
                        TOMMY
          I'm a licensed exterminator.   Why
          would I be fucking with you?
The Doorman considers it another moment.   Then --

                                                              56.

                        TOMMY
          Look. Let's do this. You let me
          start with a couple small rooms,
          y'know, offices or something,
          someplace you don't have customers.
          Upstairs, so the fumes don't bother
          anybody. I'll pop off a couple bug
          bombs, and then we'll do the rest
          later. How's that?
The Doorman considers a moment.     Then --
                        DOORMAN
          ... Yeah, okay. Get the bombs, and
          come on.


INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY
Daria keeps dancing. Peeling off layers now.    Showing skin.
Odion's starting to salivate.

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
What Chambers' cell is to a normal cell, this place is to a
normal office. No expense spared. (Think Joel again.) A
large, "Zen" FOUNTAIN BURBLES meditatively in the center of
the room.
The door opens.   The Doorman admits Tommy, who looks around
in amazement.

                          TOMMY
          ... Look.   At.   This.
                        DOORMAN
          Just do your thing and go,
          bro.
                          TOMMY
          Roger that.
He positions the BUG BOMBS. Then.... PFFFT.     He sets off
one. PFFFT. The other. As he goes --
                        TOMMY
          Just keep the door closed and be sure
          to give this shit a full hour before
          anyone comes in.
OFF the closing door...

                                                              57.
EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
Fait and Miles grab gear bags and mobilize. Clip onto
ascender/descenders and lower themselves to a second-story
window. A window into...


INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Where the BUG BOMBS HISS away.
Fait tries the WINDOW. Locked shut. He quickly tapes it.
BREAKS it. He and Miles climbs inside. Grab the bug bombs
and toss them out.
As Miles locks the door, Fait opens a gear bag and pulls out
a folding metal detector. Uses it to scan the entire room
quickly: floor, walls, ceiling... Gets LOW-VOLUME RING-OFFS
from various hidden metal. But he's looking for something
bigger.
BLEEE.   He gets it when he sweeps past Chambers' big desk.
                             FAIT
             Safe.
He kneels.     Removes a desk panel.   And...
There it is.     The safe is small but highly secure.
                             FAIT
             Take it down.
Miles finishes assembling a Barrett .50 caliber rifle. A
big gun. Opens an ammo box labeled "Depleted Uranium. .50
cal."

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY
Daria's down to bare essentials -- still dancing slow and
sexy for Odion.

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
Miles loads one of the massive D.U. cartridges into the
Barrett.
                           MILES
             Even with the music, they're gonna
             hear it when I fire this tank buster.
                             FAIT
             Daria.   Get ready to move.
                      (then)

                                                                58.
          Do it.
Miles aims the BARRETT directly at the safe lock.      Miles
FIRES. BIG BANG.


INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY
Odion starts.
                          ODION
          What was that?

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY

Basically, the lock's just gone. Melted. Burned through by
the DU slug. Fait swings the safe door open.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT
Odion's heading out the door. When he stops.       Looks back at
Daria. A realization dawning.
                        ODION
          'Sometimes you need an old friend'...
He steps toward Daria.    Backhands her.   Hard.   Then opens
the door.
A CHAMBERS MAN outside the door addresses Odion.
                        CHAMBERS MAN
          It came from the office.
                         ODION
          Watch her.   Don't let her leave.
Odion goes. The Man enters. Shuts the door, leering at
Daria, who starts putting on what she's taken off.

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
Fait's tossed the safe.     No stones.
                          MILES
          Not here?
                          FAIT
          They're here.    Somewhere else.
                        MILES
          What're you talking about?

                                                              59.
                         FAIT
           I'm telling you, they're here.
                         MILES
           What're we gonna do?

                           FAIT
           Everyone out.
Fait's started searching the room.       Tearing it apart.
                         MILES
           What about you?
                         FAIT
           I gotta save Vanessa.     I gotta find
           'em.
                         MILES
           I'm not leaving you.
                           FAIT
           Yes, you are.    Go.   Now.
Someone starts RATTLING the LOCKED DOOR.      Fait doesn't stop.
                        MILES
           T. Come on, man. They're outside.
           Give it up.
                         FAIT
           Shut up and get the fuck outta here!
           That's an order!
Miles hesitates. Fait's unreachable. Chambers' men are
trying to break down the door. Miles goes. Out the window.
Onto the ascender-descender. And gone.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT
Daria finishes dressing.     When...
                         CHAMBERS MAN
           ... Y'know, I got the big one...
Her response is a front kick to the head. Followed by a
spin kick, knocking him out. Then, stepping past him --
                         DARIA
           Keep it in your pants.

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
CRASH!   Odion and his men break down the door.

                                                               60.

Fait's still searching. Desperate to find the stones.
Desperate to save his daughter. He fights off the first
men to reach him. A wild animal. Fights off another. And
then...

The guns are out.     All pointed at Fait. No stones. No exit.

INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY
Daria walks out the front door.

INT. CHAMBERS' CELL - DAY

Willy Chickens hovers near Chambers, who is talking as he
eats another meal. Lobster. At first, we don't realize who
Chambers is addressing.
                        CHAMBERS
          ... If you're willing to pay five,
          you're willing to pay ten.
                           CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
          You're    willing to pay ten, you're
          willing    to pay twenty. Twenty,
          forty.     Forty, eighty... I'm not
          selling    till I know exactly where the
          ceiling    is.
Whereupon we see who he's talking to:     Ling.
                        CHAMBERS
          You like foreplay?
                        LING
          How much money do you want for the
          stones?
                         CHAMBERS
          I hate foreplay. Fuck the warm-up
          drills -- girl's gotta get in there
          and be ready to score points. Bring
          it straight to the motherfucking
          hoop. You understand?
                  (beat)
          So, instead of us going back and
          forth doing warm-ups, my idea's for
          you to think of a number. A very
          high number. A very final number. A
          number so high and final it'll get me
          off good, bam, right when I hear it.
Chambers hasn't looked at Ling the whole time.       Still isn't
looking. Forks up some lobster meat. When...

                                                             61.

Chickens' face suddenly appears in front of him. And...
Ling slams a lobster claw deep into Chickens' neck. Chambers
doesn't wait for whatever's next. Jumps back. Fast for a
big man.

But Ling is much faster. Stronger. Deadlier. Quickly, and
quietly beats Chambers like a drum. Chambers knows when it's
finally tent-folding time. Croaks surrender through the
blood and swelling --

                          CHAMBERS
          Okay, okay...
Ling stops.

                        CHAMBERS
          Ain't worth my life... I'll take the
          five and call it a game.

INT. CELLBLOCK - OUTSIDE CHAMBERS' CELL - MOMENTS LATER
Ling emerges from the cell through the blankets. Closing
the blankets behind him. To the sentries, who've heard
nothing --
                         LING
          Mr. Chambers is resting.   He says not
          to bother him.
OFF which, as Ling walks away...

INT. CHAMBERS' CELL - DAY
FIND Chambers. No one will bother him. Ever.       The lobster
fork driven deep into the base of his skull.

INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
Archie still looking for the man with the diamond
pinkie-ring. Su still following.
                        ARCHIE
          ... By the way, when we do find him,
          what then?
                        SU
          I'll handle it.
In the cage, a fight has just ended. The loser's
unconscious and looks like he stepped into a spinning
airplane propeller. The winner doesn't look much better.

                                                            62.
The midget RING ANNOUNCER steps in with a mike.
                        RING ANNOUNCER
          Seven advances, eleven's out...
          Next up, eight versus twelve. Eight
          versus twelve. Fighters report to
          the cage.
As Archie and Su continue the search --
                        ARCHIE
          You're after the stones, too, huh?
No response from Su.   Beat.
                        ARCHIE
          ... I did some more checking around
          to see what anyone knows about 'em...
          Guess who get back to me? My Defense
          Department connection. Now, I think
          he's calling me about this surplus F-
          14 Tomcat I'm trying to get my hands
          on. But no. Turns out he's calling
          to tell me about a rumor outta Taiwan
          about black stones --
In the ring, we see another bruiser waiting to fight as the
midget calls out --
                         RING ANNOUNCER
          Number twelve!
                        ARCHIE
                  (to Su)
          -- only they're not jewels --
                         RING ANNOUNCER
          Number twelve!
                         ARCHIE
          They're --
Suddenly, seeing the "12" card in Su's hand, a FIGHT CLUB
FAN grabs his arm and raises it. Yells out --
                        FIGHT CLUB FAN
          Twelve's right here!
Su pulls his arm back.
                        FIGHT CLUB FAN
          I'd be scared of him, too.
Su glances into the ring, seeing the BRUISER for the
first time. The Bruiser's beckoning.

                                                            63.
                        BRUISER
          Let's go, chickenshit!
Su waves them off.
                          SU
          Not today...
The catcalls start.    Archie leans into Su.
                           ARCHIE
          I know it    wasn't the plan. But if
          you don't    fight, they're gonna toss
          us out on    our asses. We might never
          find the    guy.

A long beat.    Su hates this place.   Su hates Archie.

INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY
Fait's in handcuffs. A big cut on his head. Being escorted
by two COPS to the stairs leading out of the club. To
Odion, as they pass him --
                        COP #1
          He's pretty beat up.
                        ODION
          Yeah. Fell down the stairs... Enjoy
          the jail sex, Fait.
As they continue up the stairs --
                        COP #2
          Better have the E.M.T.s look at his
          head.

EXT. HOT DOG STAND (NEAR KOREAN CLUB) - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Near, but not too close. The club visible in b.g. Daria,
Miles, and Tommy watch as Fait is led into an ambulance.
Via earwigs --
                        DARIA
          We're still here to help you, T.
                        MILES
          Anything you want us to do?

INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Fait's heard.
                          FAIT

                                                               64.
          Not yet.
The PARAMEDIC treating him doesn't understand.
                         PARAMEDIC
          What?

                         FAIT
          Nothing.

CLOSEUP - BEHIND FAIT'S BACK
His cuffed hands.    Fingers feeling the inside of his belt.
Finding a spot where a small rectangle has been cut into the
leather. Popping out the rectangle to reveal a hollowed-out
recess in the belt. Where...
Fait has a hidden handcuff key.

CLOSEUP - ANOTHER SET OF HANDS
struggling against their duct-tape bonds.   REVEAL...

INT. CAMPER - DAY
Vanessa's hands are taped together behind her back. There's
tape around her feet. Tape over her mouth. The TV is ON
nearby, but she's not watching.
Vanessa struggles a moment longer, but can't break the tape.
Finally gives up trying. Just lies there. Tired and
scared.

INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
DING! The crowd's yelling and betting as number eight
leaves his corner and advances on Su.
Su has nothing against number eight. He's just trying to
buy time. So he dodges his opponent. Not exactly
running. Fighting by not fighting. A target one moment,
gone the next. Again and again, number eight swings and
misses. Until...
Number eight delivers a knockout blow. Unfortunately
it's against himself. The momentum of a missed punch
carries him headfirst into a metal post.
Number eight drops. As the referee counts over number eight,
Su uses the chance to find...

                                                             65.

ARCHIE
still checking out the hands of African-American men in
the crowd. Not making any friends as he does it.


SU
Number eight's on his feet.    Moving in again.   When...

ARCHIE
Suddenly, he sees it.    The ring.


SU
dodges number eight again. Then... Sees Archie signaling
he's found the guy. And... Gets nailed by number eight. A
solid hit. Exciting the crowd and pumping up number eight.
Whereupon... Su turns to him and bows.
                          SU
          You win.
Su turns, heads out of the cage. The crowd roaring its
disapproval. As... The midget Ring Announcer bars Su's
path.
                          RING ANNOUNCER
          No quitting.    Get back in there.
Su moves him aside. The midget resists. Five other waiting
fighters come to the midget's aid. Forcing Su back into the
cage. Where... It's now Su against them all.

HOT DOG STAND - DAY
Daria, Tommy and Miles wait. Two     extreme MOTO-RIDERS
dressed in leathers have pulled up    in a truck and gotten out
to eat. In the back of the truck     is a motorcycle and a
four-wheel ATV. The two men Ogle     Daria. To her --
                          MOTO-RIDER #1
          Looking good.
She ignores them.     To each other, so she can hear --
                          MOTO-RIDER #2
          Nice rack.
                        MOTO-RIDER #1
          Like the upstairs, like the basement,

                                                              66.
          too.
                        DARIA
          Shut up, assholes...


INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Fait's heard. Looks past the Paramedic. Past the Cops
talking outside. Sees the hot dog stand in b.g. Sees the
truck with the motorcycle and ATV parked near the stand. The
Paramedic finishes bandaging Fait. To the cops outside --
                        PARAMEDIC
          He's all patched up.

A Cop calls inside to Fait.
                           COP #1
          Let's go.
Fait stands.     Starts out.   Into his mike --
                        FAIT
          Get ready to move.
And we see...
The handcuffs aren't on him anymore.

EXT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Fait reaches the rear doorway.      When...
He jumps. Knocks one Cop down.      Shoves another aside.   And
takes off running.
Fait's caught the cops completely by surprise. It takes a
few moments before the cops give chase, some on foot, others
by car.

ANOTHER ANGLE
Fait runs toward the truck parked by the hot dog stand.
To Daria, Miles and Tommy, looking on --
                           FAIT
          Get the car.     Stay close.
As Daria, Miles and Tommy quickly mobilize, Fait jumps into
the bed of the truck. Jumps on the ATV. IGNITION.
The Moto-Riders suddenly realize what's happening.

                                                           67.

                          MOTO-RIDER #1
          Hey!
Too late. Fait blasts out of the rear of the truck.   Right
through the nylon mesh tailgate.

Fait flies from the truck bed. Lands on the hood of a
police car. Gets big air off the windshield. Clears the
rest of the car and grabs pavement with all four wheels.
As Fait tears off, and cop cars follow, one of the Moto-
Riders jumps into the bed of the truck and climbs aboard the
remaining motorcycle. His friend calls to him --
                        MOTO-RIDER #1
          Don't let that fucker get away!
The Moto-Rider FIRES UP the MOTORCYCLE. Drops it into
first. Dittoes Fait's leap out the back and SCREAMS off in
pursuit.

INT. CAMPER - DAY
Vanessa still taped up.    TV still ON.   When...
                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
          ... We go now to this breaking
          story...
ANGLE TO INCLUDE TV
Airing a chopper shot tracking Fait on the ATV.
                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
          ... You're watching a man on an all-
          terrain vehicle leading police in a
          high-speed chase through downtown Los
          Angeles. An L.A.P.D. spokesman says
          the man, Anthony Fait --
Vanessa looks over in surprise.
                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
           -- commandeered the A.T.V. after
          escaping from police officers while
          being treated at a local hospital for
          injuries resulting from his earlier
          arrest for robbery... And this is
          certainly one of the wildest chases
          we've witnessed here in L.A...

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

                                                               68.
WHOOOM! Fait's flying. Seventy-plus. Down streets,
sidewalks, squeezing through places police cars can't.
Over, under, around, through -- doesn't matter. The ATV's
fast, strong and maneuverable.


One problem: so is the moto-cross bike.     The guy's right on
Fait's ass. Matching move with move.
Overhead, police choppers follow Fait's every move. While
on the ground other police vehicles move to block his path.
But whenever Fait meets a roadblock, he somehow finds an
escape. At one point, he uses an outdoor escalator. At
another point he blasts through the Hotel Bonaventure.
This'll be a news highlight for days to come.


INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
The place is bedlam. In the crowd, bets are going down on
the battle royal, now in full effect inside the cage. Su
versus the five fighters. And the midget.
The different fighters use different fighting styles against
Su. Kickboxing, grappling, aikido, kali, American street
fighting...
Su uses all his own skills and whatever's at hand. At one
point he engineers it so one opponent turns on another
opponent. At another point, Su wields the midget like a
fighting staff.
One by one, Su starts reducing the opposition.

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
Fait's everywhere.   And so is the moto-bike.   Still on his
tail.
Fait veers inside a building.   The bike follows.

INT. BUILDING - VARIOUS SHOTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Fait and the moto-bike ascend the stairs.   One floor.   Two
floors. Up and up.
Fait reaches the top-floor hallway.   Nowhere left to go
except...
Out the window at the end.   And...
That's just where he goes.

                                                              69.
And where he goes, the moto-bike goes.

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS
The ATV and the moto-bike make the first leap.    Onto the
roof of a next-door building.
From there, it's rooftop to rooftop.    Jump after jump.
Longer and longer. Until...
The MOTO-BIKE eats it in a spectacular CRASH.     The moto-
rider walks away, but his chase is over.

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

Fait's ATV SCREAMS down another street, still chased by
cops. Into his mike --
                          FAIT
           Yo.

INT. DARIA, MILES AND TOMMY'S CAR - DRIVING - DAY

                          FAIT
           Get there.

INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
It's down to Su and the kick boxer.    The kick boxer spins
and kicks and punches, and...
Su just ties the guy up in his own clothes.    Ties him into a
pretzel. Cinches him tight. Then...
Looks for Archie.     Can't find him. Can't find the guy
wearing the ring.     And hurries out of the cage.

EXT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY
Fait jukes the ATV in the entrance.    Up the spiral ramp.

                                                             70.

Moments later, police CARS SKID up and seal the entrance.

INT. CAMPER - DAY

On TV, a chopper shot of the garage surrounded by police.
                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
          ... And it looks like this chase will
          end here, as police seal off the
          building...
OFF Vanessa, watching...


INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
Su runs into the parking area. Archie's in the T-bird.
Sitting, a little unnaturally in the front.
                         SU
          Where is he?
                        ARCHIE
          Decided to leave early.
                         SU
          Where'd he go?
                         ARCHIE
          Right here.
Su looks inside the car.

ANGLE - CAR
Where Archie sits atop the man with the diamond pinkie ring.
Holding a STUN GUN to the guy's cheek.
                        ARCHIE
          Good thing I brought my stunner.
He ZAPS the air.    Then puts it back to the guy's cheek.
                        ARCHIE
          Okay, bud, wanna start the Q and A?

INT. CAMPER - DAY
On TV, the chopper zooms in on a familiar car, as it rolls
down the exit ramp toward the police barricade.

                                                                71.
                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
          ... Here's a car coming down the exit
          ramp...
We see the police approach the car.

                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
          ... The police apparently talking to
          the driver...
The police let the car pass.
                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
          ... Now letting this car drive on as
          the search inside continues...

Vanessa notices something about the car.     Looks carefully.
When...
The car turns, giving the news chopper a better zoom angle
of the people inside, and...
Vanessa sees Daria, Miles and Tommy.
Which could mean only one thing:    her daddy's safe.   And
soon he'll be coming to get her.
With a rekindled hope inspired by her father's escape,
Vanessa now looks for a way to free herself from her duct-
tape bonds. When, just as it's about to seem hopeless
again, her eyes go to...
Her necklace.   The chain and pink diamond pendant.
Vanessa bends over    and lowers her head until the necklace
slides off onto the    bed. Then turns around and  picks up the
necklace behind her    back. Holding it as taut as  she can
between her hands,    she begins sawing away at the tape around
her wrists.

EXT. NEAR KOREAN CLUB - HOT DOG STAND - NIGHT
The gang's all here.    All eyes on the club.
                        FAIT
          I knew the stones were in there.
                        TOMMY
          Question is, how do we get 'em out?
          Place is slamming nonstop.
A long beat.    Fait doesn't answer.
                        SU
          Something isn't right.

                                                                  72.

                         FAIT
          Yeah.   That's what I'm getting.
                          SU
          The doorman.


                         FAIT
          ... Where the hell is he?
                  (then)
          Everyone stay put.
OFF which, as he and Su go --


INT. KOREAN CLUB - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
MUSIC pumps downstairs as Su and Fait cautiously move down
the hall toward Chambers' office.
                        FAIT
          No Chambers' guys.     I don't get it.
They reach the closed office door, where they stop and
listen. Hear nothing.
Su and Fait exchange a "ready-ready" look.     Then Su opens
the door.

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Su and Fait enter, unchallenged, to find...
Odion and the other Chambers' men.    Dead.   Skull shot.
                          FAIT
          I get it now.
Su ignores the bodies, quickly moves to the Zen fountain,
where he reaches into the water and begins searching the
rocks lining the bottom. Beat. Then --
                        FAIT
          Are they there?
Su doesn't answer, still searching.
                        FAIT
          No. This can't fucking happen.      They
          gotta be there.
Another beat. Then, at last, Su holds something up:         one
black stone. It takes Fait a moment to understand.

                                                                 73.
                              FAIT
             ... What?     That's it?
                           SU
             The rest are gone.

Fait can't believe it.
                           FAIT
             ... What the hell happened?        Who got
             'em?
                             SU
             ... Ling.
                           FAIT
             How do you know?
                             SU
             I know.
                           FAIT
             ... How'd he get here before us?
                             SU
             He's good.
Beat.   Failure.       Summed up in one word:
                           FAIT
             Vanessa...
                     (then, trying)
             He has the stones. There's      no reason
             to keep her. Hell, she's a      little
             girl, she's eight years old     -- she
             can't hurt him. He can let      her go...
             He can just fucking let her     go...
Su just looks at him.        Not a chance.   And he knows Fait
knows it, too.
It's over.     For Fait, it's as if his life just ended.
                           FAIT
             ... What the hell am I gonna do?
                           SU
             ... We need to go.
Fait doesn't move. Then, suddenly, it all explodes as rage,
and Fait picks up the large, stone ball spinning atop the
fountain and, screaming, hurls it into a large display of
exotica, destroying it.
Beat.   Fait looks at Su, who meets his eyes.          Then --

                                                            74.
                         SU
          Come on.
OFF which, as Su mobilizes him, and they go...


INT. HANGAR - NIGHT
Ling pours the black stones out on a table.   To Sona and
Charles --
                        LING
          We're back in business.
                       CHARLES
          Good. I don't have to baby-sit much
          longer.
                         SONA
          I hate kids.
                        LING
          Is everything else ready?
                        SONA
          We just have to test the device.
Russell, who's been working on his scientific contraption
nearby, speaks up.
                         RUSSELL
          Dye master oscillator. And not test,
          calibrate. Which I'm now ready to
          do... Goggles.
When the goggles are on, Russell hits a switch.   And...
Inside the contraption, brilliant green laser BEAMS begin
bombarding a sensor. OFF which...

INT. CAMPER - NIGHT
Vanessa succeeds in using the necklace   as a saw to free her
wrists from the duct-tape. She quickly    rips the tape from her
mouth. Untapes her ankles. Then tries     to figure out what to do
next. Begins searching the camper for    anything that might help
her escape or fight. When...
Looking through the glove box, she finds a cell phone. An
old model. So old, it takes her a moment to figure out
exactly what it is. Then she pushes "Power," and...
The phone turns on.    Sort of.

"Low Batt" flashes on the screen.
INT. FAIT'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Rock bottom.

Fait's desolate, sitting on the sofa, staring off.      Daria
tries to comfort him, but it doesn't help.
Miles and Tommy stay close and stay silent.
Even Archie's quiet for once.
The only noise is Su, speaking into a cell phone in Chinese
to someone who is obviously his superior.

                        SU
          ... I lost the stones. Ling has
          them... I don't know where he is... I
          have no way to find him... What do
          you want me to do?
Under which, the PHONE begins to RING.    And...
Fait's too upset to care about answering.

INT. CAMPER - NIGHT
Vanessa's on the old cell phone.    We hear RINGING on the
other end.
                        VANESSA
          ... Answer, Daddy, answer...

CLOSEUP - PHONE
"Low Batt"... "Low Batt"...

INT. FAIT'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
The PHONE'S still RINGING.    After another moment...
                        MILES
          Want me to get that?
Which finally mobilizes Fait to reach over and answer.
                        MILES
          Hello.
INTERCUT WITH:

                                                               76.

INT. CAMPER - NIGHT
Vanessa whispers urgently.
                         VANESSA
          Daddy?
                         FAIT
          Vanessa!
Which gets everyone's attention.
                         VANESSA
          Come get me!   Please!   I want to go
          home!

                        FAIT
          Okay, baby, okay. Just calm down.
Under which, in b.g., Su quickly ends the phone call to his
superior. Still in Chinese --
                        SU
          I'll call you back.
                         FAIT
                  (continuing, to
                   Vanessa)
          Where are you?
                        VANESSA
          I don't know. I'm in a van inside a
          big building. They painted the
          windows. I can't look out.
                         FAIT
          Try.   Try to see something.
Vanessa puts her eye to the window.    Finally finds a small
gap in the paint.

VANESSA'S POV
Few details. Just some chairs and bright green light from
Russell's contraption.

                                                77.
                          VANESSA
          I see chairs.    And there's green
          light.
Fait repeats for the others' benefit.

                        FAIT
          You see chairs and green light?
          Where's the light coming from?
                          VANESSA
          I can't tell.
                          SU
          Is it bright?

                        FAIT
          The green light, baby -- is it
          bright?
                         VANESSA
          Yeah.   Really, really bright.
                        FAIT
                  (to Su)
          It's real bright.
                          VANESSA
          Daddy, hurry!    I'm scared!
                          FAIT
          I know, baby.    Just hang in there

END INTERCUT.
                        FAIT
          ... Vanessa?... Vanessa!... Shit!
Fait slams the phone down in frustration.
But Su's mind is on what she told them.
                        SU
          ... He's doing it here.    Tonight.

                                                  78.
                        TOMMY
          What?
                         SU
          Selling the stones... A dye laser
          emits green light. He needs it to
          activate them.
                        MILES
          What the hell you talking about?
                        DARIA
          What are these stones?
Archie answers it.

                        ARCHIE
          Doomsday in disguise.
All eyes go to him.
                         ARCHIE
          They're some kinda new synthetic
          plutonium. Small and portable, but
          mega-powerful.
                        TOMMY
          This fucker's making bombs?
                        SU
          Not making them.
                        ARCHIE
          Yeah, he'd need a big operation for
          that. Why bother? Just demonstrate
          the stones work and sell 'em to
          whichever international scumbag
          offers the highest bid. He makes
          millions, they make the bombs,
          then... 'look out, world.'
                        FAIT
          ... Okay, so we know what he's up to.
          How's it get us to Vanessa?
Su considers it a moment.
                        SU
          The buyers will want to arrive and
          leave quickly... Somewhere private...
          Accessible by aircraft.
                        FAIT
          Vanessa said she's inside a big
          building. Could be a hangar.

                                                             79.
                        MILES
          Man, there's dozens of little
          airports around here. We'd never get
          to 'em all.
                        SU
          ... Flight plans.
                        ARCHIE
          Hey, yeah. Flight plans show
          destinations. All aircraft file 'em
          with the Aviation Administration. If
          we could get a list, we could maybe
          figure out where the sale's going
          down.

                        FAIT
          ... Daria, call the aviation people.
          Use our L.A.P.D. credentials. We
          need flight plan info for all private
          aircraft in this area tonight...
          Everyone else get ready to move...
          Miles, the no-gun policy's revoked.
          You break out the heat... Tommy, you
          gotta get us a diversion.
                        ARCHIE
          I can help with that.
                        FAIT
          ... Do it all fast.

INT. HANGAR - NIGHT
Ling, Sona, Charles, and Russell.
Russell finishes testing his contraption.    Switches it OFF.
Then, removing his goggles --
                        RUSSELL
          We're operational.
The others remove their goggles.    Sona checks her watch.
                        SONA
          The buyers arrive in less then an
          hour.
Beat.   Ling holds up a black stone and examines it.
                        LING
          ... So small. So deadly... We're
          selling conscience for money...
A look at the others.   Serious.   Then a broad smile of

                                                             80.
consummate satisfaction suddenly spreads across his face.
                         LING
           ... But it's a lot of money...
Beat.   He puts down the stone.    A glance at the camper.

                         LING
           Be ready to kill the girl and go as
           soon as the sale's over.

           Sounds like our best shot.
                         FAIT
           .. It better be, or my baby's dead.
He and Su exchange a look.     Then --

           Let's go.

CORPORATE HELICOPTER - NIGHT
Noselight beaming, the chopper lands next to four other
high-end biz copters, including an Agusta A109, outside the
hangar, where the bruised Ling killers stand guard.

Vanessa peeks through a void in the paint covering the
windows.

                                                            81.

An internationally-diverse group of men -- some occupying
the chairs, some studying the contraption, some clearly
muscle. Across the room, Sona and Ling greet the new
arrivals.

In all, sixteen men have arrived for the sale. There are
five buyers -- one RUSSIAN, one AFRICAN, one PAKISTANI, one
EGYPTIAN, one FRENCH. The French Buyer is in a wheelchair.
Each buyer has brought with him one right-hand man and one
to three bodyguards.
Vanessa SHIFTS her VIEW, REVEALING...
Charles standing nearby.    Too close for her to escape.

Charles turns, and...

BACK TO VANESSA
Quickly, before Charles can see her, she steps away from the
window.
There's no way out.

EXT. FAIT'S PORSCHE - NIGHT
Driving.   Daria and Miles following in their car.
                         FAIT (V.O.)
           So tell me... How the hell's Taiwan
           fit into all this?
                         SU (V.O.)
           One of our scientists made the
           stones. Tried to go into business
           for himself. We stopped him.
           Recovered the stones... Ling betrayed
           us. He took them.
                          FAIT (V.O.)
           Ling?   He was one of you?
                         SU (V.O.)
           We were partners. Six of us. He
           killed the others. He thought he
           killed me, too.
                          FAIT (V.O.)
                   (beat)
           So what're you really after -- the
           stones or the payback?
                         SU

                                                            82.
          Both.
                        FAIT (V.O.)
          ... Yeah... Let's get it all.


INT. HANGAR - NIGHT
                        LING
          You're the world's foremost arms
          dealers. You all know that weaponry
          equals power. And in the world of
          weaponry, nukes rule.

                        LING (CONT'D)
          But nuclear material is hard to
          obtain and difficult to handle... But
          what if it weren't?... That's the
          question that brought you here
          tonight... And here's the answer.
Ling holds up a single stone.
                        LING
          In its present state, it's completely
          inert. Zero radiation, zero
          volatility...
Whereupon Ling places the stone on a piece of velvet on a
table. Folds the velvet over. Then, whack, hits it hard
with a mallet.
He unfolds the velvet.   The stone's smashed to pieces.
Ling picks up a sliver of stone and hands it to Russell, who
places the sliver inside a small ceramic capsule, then
inserts the capsule into his contraption.
                         RUSSELL
          Goggles on.
Everyone puts on goggles. Then Russell hits the switch, and
the green lasers bombard the capsule containing the sliver
of stone, which begins to glow.
Russell announces each passing threshold as a numerical
readout on the contraption races up the scale --
                        RUSSELL
          ... Firecracker... .44 magnum...

           ... New World Order.
As the buyers absorb this...

Russell shuts off the beams.
                           RUSSELL
           Goggles off.
Russell removes the capsule and hands it back to Ling, who
holds it up.
                            LING
           One small    fragment. Transformed into
           a source    of immense energy. More
           powerful    than weapons-grade plutonium
           a hundred    times its size.
A beat as this sinks in.
                         SONA
           The purpose of today's sale is to
           begin trading a new commodity on the
           black market and establish its
           value... There are fifty stones
           available in the first sale. The
           opening price is one million per
           stone... Bids, please?
The buyers indicate their bids both aloud and by using hand
signals a la traders in a commodities exchange pit. At the
same time, they're all crunching the numbers on calculators.
Ling looks on as Sona runs the sale, and Russell uses a
laptop to input data and develops supply and demand market-
analysis for Sona to consult.
The pace starts out slowly and unevenly as the buyers feel
out the situation.

           Five at one million.

When suddenly...
KA-WHAM! Archie's Abrams TANK BLASTS through a wall and
into the hangar.
Archie's head pops out of the driver's hole. At the same
time, Tommy pops up out of the turret and trains a mounted
machine gun on the stunned group.
                         TOMMY
           Freeze, motherfuckers!

                                                             87.

INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Vanessa peers out through a gap in the paint to see what's
happening.


VANESSA'S POV
Charles is drawn away by the advancing tank.

BACK TO VANESSA
She looks back into the camper. Finds a heavy iron skillet
amid the stove utensils. Swings it. And...
SMASH!    She SHATTERS a side WINDOW.

MILES' SNIPER-SCOPE POV (NO NIGHT VISION)
We FIND Vanessa, jumping out of the camper.
                          MILES (V.O.)
            Vanessa's out of the camper.   Running
            this way.

INT. HANGAR - FAIT AND DARIA
To Daria --
                          FAIT
            Stay.
And he's gone, sprinting after her just as...

VANESSA
reaches a button for opening and closing the giant hangar
doors. She jabs a button, and the nearest door begins to
motor open.

                                                              88.

CHARLES
hears the OPENING HANGAR DOOR.    Turns.   Sees Vanessa and
goes after her.


SNIPER-SCOPE POV (NO NIGHT VISION)
Vanessa rolls out under the rising door and runs.
                          MILES (V.O.)
          She's out.
Then, FINDING Charles coming after her --

                        MILES (V.O.)
          There's a guy after her.
PHUT!

INT. HANGAR - CHARLES
A BULLET rips through the collar of his leather coat. Just
behind his neck. Just missing him. But he keeps coming.

SNIPER-SCOPE POV (NO NIGHT VISION)
Charles rolling out under the door.

MILES
SHOOTS again.   PHUT!

CHARLES
The BULLET RICOCHETS off the PAVEMENT right next to him. In
a flash, he's up and running. Heading out into the darkness
of the airfield after Vanessa. Meanwhile, back inside...

INT. HANGAR
In here, the hangar door continues to open as the tank makes
its slow approach. Archie's not a great driver. Tommy
sweeps the muzzle of the machine gun across the group.
                          TOMMY
          Just be cool!
At which point, Russell breaks for his five-ton truck.

                                                             89.
                        TOMMY
          I said don't move, motherfucker!
Russell just keeps going. Slides open the side door in the
back of the five-ton, revealing... A twin-fifty machine gun.
Two barrels, .50 caliber. Dangerous even for a tank.
Russell vaults in and takes aim.
                        RUSSELL
          Fucking amateurs!
He starts FIRING. People start running. .50 CAL. ROUNDS take
big CHUNKS out of whatever they hit.
                        TOMMY
          Shit!   What do we do?

                          ARCHIE
          Shoot back!
                          TOMMY
          How?
The question's answered for him.   He somehow does the right
thing. And...
Tommy's MACHINE GUN begins RIPPING CHUNKS out of the FIVE-
TON and EVERYTHING near it. Tommy's a horrible shot; the
gun's more in control of him. But...
Russell finally dies under a HAIL of HEAVY LEAD.
                        ARCHIE
          Twin .50's some major firepower.
          How'd that little shit get one?
                          TOMMY
          Motherfucker.    Couldn't fucking
          listen.
INTERCUT WITH which...

ACROSS HANGAR
Ling and Sona are moving toward the limo. Ling has the
stones. When... Su is there. Blocking the way. Sona
attacks. Su easily blocks the counters. Knocking Sona back.
Never taking his eyes off Ling. When...
Sona, who's fallen back against a buyer's bodyguard, quickly
takes the bodyguard's small, full-auto SCORPION and turns
the gun on Su.
Su dives for cover as the BURST SHREDS the AREA where he'd
just been standing. As Sona continues hunting Su... Su sees

                                                              90.
Ling getting into the limo.    To Archie and   Tommy, as he
signals --
                        SU
          Don't let him get away!

As a result of which...

TOMMY AND ARCHIE
Having just waxed Russell, see Ling in the limo. Tommy's .50
is out of ammo. He switches to the .30 cal. tank's machine
gun. As Archie steers toward the limo, Tommy begins BLASTING
away.


LIMO
Ling's trying to drive out, when the .30 CAL. SLUGS PUNCH
HOLES in the LIMO. The tank keeps coming. Ling bails out as
the TANK CRUSHES the LIMO.
INTERCUT WITH which...

SU AND SONA
Play cat and mouse. Su rapidly runs out of room to hide.
He can't get away. Su stands. Faces her. Faces the
inevitable. When...
WHAM! Daria appears from nowhere. Kicks the gun from
Sona's hand. To Su, re: Ling, now running from the crushed
limo
                          DARIA
          Get him.
Su goes after Ling.
And now it's Daria vs. Sona.
Sona's a better fighter, but Daria's got passion on her
side. It's a good fight. Until, at last, Sona finds the
Scorpion. She swings it up. And...
Daria executes a sudden, improvised double move that strikes
Sona's arm in such a way as to cause her to point the
SCORPION at herself, just as she FIRES. The burst rips
through her chest and kills her.
And now, here's what's been going on outside...

EXT. AIRFIELD

                                                                91.

As Charles runs from the hangar, chasing Vanessa across the
tarmac into the darkness of the airfield...

MILES

flips to NIGHT VISION on the sniper-scope.    And...

SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION
Charles and Vanessa become clearly visible. Charles is
closing in on her. Cross-hairs FIND him. PHUT!


CHARLES
The BULLET knocks his gun from his hands.    Charles is slowed
but keeps going.

SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION
Charles reaches the flight line. Parked planes, a gas
truck, a shed, etc. He disappears behind the equipment.

MILES
sweeps the rifle, looking for Charles and Vanessa.     He comms
Fait.
                        MILES
          Lost 'em behind the gas truck.

CHARLES
stops behind the gas truck.   Looks around for Vanessa.    No
sign of her. Until...
Charles notices the door to the gas truck isn't closed all
the way. He whips it open. And...
There's Vanessa, hiding inside.
Charles grabs her.   Yanks her out struggling and kicking.
                        CHARLES
          Time to end this my way.
And then...
                        FAIT (O.S.)
          Drop the girl.

                                                              92.

Charles looks over.    Fait is there, holding a gun on him.
Vanessa's relieved and excited to see her father.
                          FAIT
          Put her down.
Charles lowers Vanessa to the ground.    He releases her.
                          VANESSA
          Daddy!
Vanessa runs to her father. Dives into his arms. It's a
little more energetic than Fait was expecting. And...

Suddenly, Charles uses the distraction to rush in behind
her. He hits Fait hard. A kick sends the gun flying.
Charles keeps coming. Charles keeps pounding.
Fait's hampered by Vanessa. She won't let him go. Fait
stays between Charles and Vanessa. Guarding his little
girl. Barely managing to fend off Charles, a seemingly
unstoppable force.
The fight winds through the planes, under wings, through
struts.

SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION
Fait, Charles and Vanessa.    No clear shot.

MILES
comms Fait.
                          MILES
          No shot.

FAIT, CHARLES AND VANESSA
The fight continues.   Fait's suffering under Charles' brutal
attack. When...
Vanessa causes Fait to stumble near a plane.   They fall.
Charles moves in. And...
Fait's hand goes to a set of chocks set against the plane's
wheel. The chocks are two heavy wooden blocks connected by
a length of nylon rope.
Fait turns to Vanessa.

                                                            93.
                         FAIT
          Don't move.
Fait jumps to his feet. Swinging the chocks. Not quite
like nunchakus; more like a medieval mace. And now, all of
Fait's fury comes pouring out as he uses the chocks to beat
the living shit out of Charles. Charles tries to fight
back, but he's out-matched by the chocks and Fait's emotion.
The punishing blows land like Thor's hammer. Until...
A mighty swing nearly takes Charles' head off. Charles is
unconscious before he hits the ground. Fait stands over
Charles. Tosses the chocks down.
                          FAIT
          Wrong kid.    Wrong dad.

Fait turns. He moves back to where Vanessa's still hiding.
He scoops her up. And... Father and daughter hold each
other tight. Forever. During all of which, also INTERCUT...

EXT. HANGAR
Ling, having just escaped being crushed in the limo, runs
out just as... Four helicopters take off, one after the
other, carrying the buyers away.
The fifth chopper, an AGUSTA A109, is POWERED UP, waiting
for the wheelchair-bound French Buyer, being helped by a
bodyguard.
Ling intercepts them. Knocks out the bodyguard and tips
over the Frenchman's chair. Then jumps into the Agusta.

INT. AGUSTA - COCKPIT
Ling puts a gun to the pilot's head.
                         LING
          Go!

EXT. HANGAR
Su, having left Daria to fight Sona inside, runs out.

EXT. AIRFIELD
The Agusta begins to lift off. Su starts running toward the
helicopter. Runs under the rising aircraft. Jumps. Just
in time to... Grab onto one of the retractable rear wheels.

                                                                 94.
EXT. AGUSTA
As the chopper transfers to forward motion, Su struggles to
get a foot hooked on something, anything. In the process,
he kicks against the helo's sleek underbelly.


INT. AGUSTA
Ling hears the THUMPS.    Looks out.

LING'S POV - SU'S LEG
swinging beneath the Agusta.


LING
To the pilot --
                          LING
            Retract the gear!

CLOSEUP - CONTROL PANEL
The pilot hits the wheels-up switch.     And...

SU
The gear begins to retract. Disappearing into the bottom of
the chopper. In a second, there'll be nothing left to hold.
                          SU
            Shoot it down!   Now!
And then... Su lets go.      Drops fifteen feet to the ground.
As...
Behind him, having clanked out of the hangar, the Abrams
tank is stopped. The turret swivels toward the Agusta.

INT. TANK
Archie aims the cannon.
                          TOMMY
            Can you hit it?
                           ARCHIE
            No problem.   Absolutely... Load.
Tommy slides a shell into the breech.

                                                                95.

Archie's locked on.     He hits the trigger.   And...

ABRAMS TANK

BOOM!   The big CANNON FIRES.      And...

The Agusta's tail is BLOWN AWAY by the CANNON SHELL.

INT. TANK

Archie and Tommy exult.
                          TOMMY
            Shot him right in the ass.
                           ARCHIE
            I did it.   I can't believe it.
                          TOMMY
            Thought you said it was no problem.
                          ARCHIE
            What do I know?

INT. AGUSTA - COCKPIT
The pilot hopelessly fights to keep the chopper from
crashing.

EXT. AIRFIELD
The out-of-control AGUSTA swings back toward Su and the
hangar, losing altitude. Then SMASHES into the tarmac,
ripping open the fuel tank, spilling fuel behind it as it
caroms off the hangar and inscribes a large, skidding circle
around Su before CRASHING into another CHOPPER and BURSTING
INTO FLAMES.
The spilled fuel ignites.    A circle of intense fire.   With
Su in the middle.
The Agusta pilot, still alive, has been thrown outside the
circle. But Ling's only path of escape takes him inside.
Into the circle. He emerges with the bag of stones.
Su is waiting.
                          LING

                                                          96.
          You were lucky last time.   You
          Won't be lucky again.
The final fight begins.
The two martial arts masters battle in the circle of fire,
using everything they can lay their hands on. Each the
equal of the other. Each knowing it's a fight to the death.
For a long time, the fight could go either way. Until...
Ling gets an arm around Su's neck. Like Charles, Su thrashes
and flails. Like Charles, he can't get away.
                        LING
          I'll kill you fast.    You won't
          Feel a thing.

                          SU
          ... I won't.    You will
What happens next happens in an instant:
Su breaks the hold. Hooks one of Ling's arms.   Wrenches it.
A direction it can't go.
Ling's ARM BONES SNAP, TISSUES RIP.
Ling screams in pain. Just as... Su pulls the ceramic
Capsule containing the activated sliver of stone from
Ling's pocket. And...
Slams the capsule deep into Ling's open mouth. Ling gags,
choking on the capsule lodged in his throat. His horror-
stricken eyes meet Su's. Su lets him suffer another moment.
Then, in SUBTITLED Chinese --
                        SU
          This is for our friends.
And Su strikes him in the throat. A spearing, open-hand
blow with his fingertips. Hard. Hard enough that...

INSIDE LING'S THROAT
The CERAMIC CAPSULE SHATTERS. Releasing the hot, glowing
white sliver of stone into Ling's windpipe. The fragment's
super high-energy radiation instantly beginning to cook
Ling's body from within. The power of a few thousand
microwave ovens turned on all at once.
Ling's bodily fluids instantly start boiling dry as...

ANGLE BACK ON LING

                                                             97.

As, light beaming from his eyes and mouth, Ling flash-cooks
from the inside out.
Not simply burned. Horribly desiccated. His seared and
darkened skin shrink-wrapped, mummy-like, around his
skeleton. Human jerky.
In a moment, it's finished. Ling's dry-roasted remains
topple over. Su has closed a chapter.

SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER
Su and Fait meet on the tarmac. Su has the stones. Fait's
holding Vanessa, asleep in his arms. SIRENS APPROACH in
b.g.
The two men regard each other a moment.
                         FAIT
          We got it all.
                  (then)
          What happens to the stones?
                        SU
          They'll be destroyed.
They see police and emergency vehicles beginning to arrive
in b.g.
                        FAIT
          Looks like I'll be doing some jail
          time.
                       TOMMY
          Jail? Man, you just helped save the
          planet. Law's gotta allow for that.
A look between Fait and Su.   Su nods.
                        SU
          I'll do what I can.
                        ARCHIE
          That's good, 'cause I mean, we make a
          helluva team, y'know?
                  (to Su)
          Well, not you, 'cause you're law
          enforcement. But the rest of us
          -- look, a white guy comes in handy
          now and then. Y'know, if you're
          pulling a job in Beverly Hills or
          ripping off a country club or
          whatever... What kind of percentage
          are we talking?

                                                                98.

                         FAIT
          We're not.
Fait looks at Vanessa again.     Finding a new purpose in her
eyes. Beat.

                        FAIT
          Time I got real.
He regards the others.
                        FAIT
          Time we all did.
                          ARCHIE
          Get real?    What's that mean?
                        TOMMY
          ... Means we're through with that
          life.
Fait's eyes meet Tommy's.     Beat.   Tommy nods.
Fait looks to Daria for her answer.
                        DARIA
          I'm with you, T.
He looks to Miles.
                        MILES
          Whatever you say, man.
Fait looks back to Su.   They hold the look.
                         SU
          ... Good luck.
                         FAIT
          ... Faith.
Another beat. Then they turn and start walking toward the
arriving cop cars. Daria and Miles follow. Archie and
Tommy lag behind. As they all walk away from us --
                        ARCHIE
          What, you're all gonna go straight,
          just like that?
                        TOMMY
          Maybe oughta try it yourself.
                        ARCHIE
          Me? Are you kidding? I've had
          straight jobs. You ever had a

          straight job?
                        TOMMY
          I had plenty of straight jobs.
                          ARCHIE
          Name one.
                        TOMMY
          I sold Avon door-to-door.
                        ARCHIE
          ... You were an Avon lady?
                        TOMMY
          I was an Avon man. You got a problem
          with that?
                        ARCHIE
          No, it's just, well, uh...
                         TOMMY
          Nah, I'm just fucking with you.
                  (then)
          But my momma did it, and don't you
          dare start disrespecting my momma...
And so on... OFF which, we...

              gobbling dots.

              reveal that unlike the old arcade game, this game screen goes
              E forever, an infinite maze ... and instead of the original
              on four there are thousands of ghosts at all sides, closing in.

              CHEV CHELIOS, wakes up in his apartment to a RINGING CELL

               a present.

               We stay with CHEV'S POV as he flashes a frantic glance around
               the room. The LUBDUB of the HEARTBEAT is much LOUDER AND
               FASTER NOW; we really begin to notice it.

                            of watching you squirm out your last

                         Hey, it's been real. Probably should've
                         thought twice before you whacked Don Kim.
                         Experiencing a little 20/20 hindsight? I

               Finally the CAMERA reverses to reveal CHEV'S slack-jawed          6
               face, staring at the TV. CHEV is in his late 20s, handsome
               in an offhanded way. All of the background noise - the
               HEARTBEAT, the CELL PHONE - cuts to dead silence... and
               through the silence, a SINGLE WORD:

               Finding a drunken man's strength, CHEV flips out. He rips
               the TV out of the stand, TEARING THE WIRES FROM THE GUTS OF
               THE WALL. He launches it straight into the floorboards with
               a BONE-BREAKING CRUSH.
          
               He KICKS over the rest of the entertainment system, JUMPS on
               it and heads out of the room.
          
               ROLLER DOLLY follows him on a STUMBLING RAMPAGE through the
               apartment and down the hall.
          
               By the door, in an ashtray with his car keys, he finds it:
               his God-damned CELL PHONE. Of course it stops ringing just
               as he picks it up. He pockets it, BANGS OPEN the front door
               and is out.

               ROLLER DOLLY still on CHEV. He jumps up on the hood of a
               moving RED SPORTSCAR as it backs out of it's parking spot,
               walks right over it and hops off, clicking the keyless lock
               button on his chain in mid-air ... the door to his BLACK AUDI
               pops open ... he gets in.
          
               RED SPORTSCAR GUY is the sort of classic intolerable LA
               ASSHOLE we love to hate: platinum hair, suspenders, designer

               CHEV backs out, runs him right over. CH-KUNK, CH-KUNK.
               CHEV'S AUDI blasts out of the garage and down the street.

          SOUND - BOOMING: ... LUB DUB, LUB DUB...
          
          The CAMERA SWOOSHES down to CHEV'S FOOT as he STEPS ON THE
          GAS... then back up to the HEART as the ADRENALINE CRANKS HIM
          UP... the BEATING SPEEDS UP -
          
          SOUND: ... LUBDUB, LUBDUB, LUBDUB..!
          
          ... and the CAMERA SNAPS back out to CHEV'S FACE as he seems
          to come to his senses.
          
          CHEV takes the cell. One-clicks, and sticks the phone in the
          cigarette adapter. Four rings. Finally someone picks up.

               The continuous ROLLER DOLLY move takes us inside and KEEPS
               GOING. Eight or ten BROTHERS, some wearing motorcycle
               leathers, are scattered around the room, shooting stick,
               drinking, etc. CHEV BARGES IN, drawing a GLOK .45 from his
               coat and goes straight at ORLANDO - black, hip, 30's, better
               dressed than the others - who is at the center of a group of
               BADASSES.
          
                efore anyone has time to react CHEV has the GUN PRESSED INTO
               ORLANDO'S FOREHEAD and is pushing him through the place into
               the bathroom. Everyone scatters and takes cover at the site
               of the GLOK; firearms appear.

          crowd into the tiny room.
          
           otal mad chaos ensues, CHEV, ORLANDO and the BROTHERS packed
          in like sardines, everyone pointing guns at every one else's
          head, shoving each other back and forth, everyone screaming.
          The situation teeters at the very edge of an explosion of
          bloody violence.
          
          Finally ORLANDO cuts through the din with a booming voice.

                     Now Chevy here has something he would
                     like to discuss. So we are going to
                     discuss it. In a civilized manner.
                     Chevy? I believe you had a question, or
                     some point you were trying to make?

                     OK. I am not affiliated with Ricky

                    Easy ... easy ... now things are
                    beginning to clarify ... you see how that
                    works? How discussion can lead to
                    clarity?
          
           HEV is running out of patience.
          
                              ORLANDO (CONT'D)
                    Clearly you are operating under a false
                    pretense. Ricky Verona and myself did
                    not "pull the Anselmo job together." In
                    fact, Ricky Verona fucked me on the
                    Anselmo job. In fact, Ricky Verona owes
                    me seventy five hunna dollars.
          
                              CHEV
                    That's not how I heard it.
          
                              ORLANDO
                    But that's the way it is. That's the way
                    it is. So you see, I don't know where
                    Ricky Verona is. Because if I knew where
                    he is, I would probably be there right
                    now, beating his Gucci ass down.
          S
           tandoff. CHEV holds the gun with an unsteady hand, studying
          ORLANDO'S eyes, evaluating.
          
           hen, as much from exhaustion as from a sense that he's
          telling the truth, he lets his gun hand drop.
          
                               CHEV
                    Alright.
          
          The room lets out a collective exhale. The BROTHERS mutter
          amongst themselves - damn right you better put that shit
          away, crazy bitch ass mother ...
          
                              ORLANDO
                    Thank you. That's what I'm talking
                    about. That resembles civility.
          
          LUB DUB ... LUB DUB ... LUB ... DUB
          
          CHEV begins to fade again. He slumps back, looking as though
          he might pass out. One of the BROTHERS catches him, holds
          him up and shoves him away.
          
                              ORLANDO (CONT'D)
                    Shit dude, what's the matter with you?

                    Verona, that little bitch ...
          
                              ORLANDO
                    I understand that. You've made that
                    point abundantly clear to all of us.
          
          He takes pity on him - CHEV really looks like shit. A few of
          the BROTHERS lose interest, begin to filter out of the room.
          
                              ORLANDO (CONT'D)
                    Now what can I do to help you?
          
                              CHEV
                    Look, just give me some coke, OK?    You
                    got any coke?
          
          ORLANDO gives him the look.
          
                              ORLANDO
                    OK, now you're insulting me.
          
                              CHEV
                    Come on, man, I know you got coke.
          
                              ORLANDO
                    You think every brother is carrying, is
                    that it?
          
                              CHEV
                    Come on, I don't have time for this, just
                    give me something ... I'm really dying
                    here ...
          
                              ORLANDO
                    I can see that.
          
                              CHEV
                    No. You don't understand, I'm really
                    fucking dying ... if I don't ...
                        (losing it again)
                    May I just have some coke, please?
          
                              ORLANDO
                    So this is medicinal use coke, that's
                    what you're telling me.
          
                              CHEV
                    That's right.

                              ORLANDO
                    You got something for me, or what?
          
          CHEV shoves his gun into his belt, pulls out a wad of tens,
          tosses it into the sink. He's visibly fading.
          
          ORLANDO takes a quick look over the wad, pulls a little
          plastic bag out of his vest pocket, tosses it to CHEV. The
          bag hits CHEV square in the forehead, hits sweat and STICKS.
          CHEV reaches for it lamely - it slides off and lands on the
          floor. His reflexes are not the best at this point.
          
          CHEV collapses to his knees, breaks it open and snorts it
          right out of the bag like a pig on his elbows and knees. The
          BROTHERS find this hilarious.
          
          ORLANDO shakes his head in disgust.
          
                              ORLANDO (CONT'D)
                    Chevy ... come on, man...
          
          We hear CHEV'S heart rate start to build, increase in volume.
          
          Suddenly he pops up to his feet, almost slips and falls,
          steadies himself. A new man.
          
                              CHEV
                    OK, that's good.    That's good.
          
                               RLANDO
                    Oh that's good, right?
          
          CHEV pounds rhythmically on chest, keeping time with his
          beating heart.

               CHEV turns to the biggest, meanest looking BROTHER in the
               room, pats him on the chest in a mock friendly way, then,
               without warning, slams his head forward into the BROTHER'S
               face, knocking him backwards into the hallway, sending all
               the other BROTHERS sprawling like tenpins.

               CHEV has a pool cue in his hands.   He moves out into the
               hallway, eyes wild.

               A calm exterior of the building: single window, bars over it,
               single door closed.
          
               SUDDENLY THE WINDOW SMASHES OUTWARD; the two arms of one of
               the BROTHERS poke out through the bars as though he's been
               thrown into the window frame from inside. One hand holds a
               cue ball, which drops and hits the sidewalk.
          
               A second later THE DOOR BLOWS OFF IT'S HINGES as CHEV is
               tossed, upside down, through it to land on the cement in a
               jumble of glass and wood. The door falls on him. The
               BROTHERS chase him out into the street, shouting him down.
          
               STILL BRANDISHING THE POOL CUE, HE SOMEHOW HOLDS THEM OFF AS 22
          22
               HE STUMBLES TO HIS CAR, PEELS OUT AND BLASTS OFF DOWN THE

               JACKHAMMER.

                behind him, cherry top flashing, broadcasting a warning to
                "PULL OVER" out of its intercom.

          CARLITO'S POV - We are under water swimming towards the edge
          of the pool. As we look up, we see a water-distorted figure
          above the water, looking down into the pool. The classic
          shot made famous in The GRADUATE and used a thousand times
          since ... only this time the guy outside the pool JUMPS IN.

               down to keep the heart pounding ... he heads over to the cab
               waiting out front.
          
               The same ARAB CABBIE is waiting inside.

               CHEV goes to the driver side of the car, pulls the CABBIE out
               of the cab and tosses him into the road. The lunch crowd at

               ALEX enters the kitchen. The COOKS all hustle by him - they

                LEX continues through the kitchen with a distinct lack of
               caution - everyone's been afraid of the big man all his life -
               drawing a gun from inside his coat as he goes.

               BUTCHER KNIFE.

               closed. He advances.
          
               The back door opens onto an alley. He comes up to it, brings
               the gun up by his head, shoulders up to the cracked door and
               tries to peer around it into the alley.
          
               Just then, behind him, CHEV emerges from the kitchen with the
               BUTCHER KNIFE.
          
                efore ALEX can react, CHEV lets swing with the knife and
               neatly cuts off ALEX'S gun hand at the wrist. The hand, gun
               and all, hits the ground. CHEV kicks ALEX out the door and

               front of his face. He tries to talk, or scream, but all that

           HEV picks up ALEX'S disconnected hand, which is still
          clutching the gun, and walks back over to the action. He

                         tweaked, man.
          
               CHEV looks from the kid to the display and back, then through
               the glass window, where the PHARMACIST is talking to someone
               on the telephone, looking out at him suspiciously.
          
               He picks up a handful of the little spray bottles and gets
               out of there. The OLD MAN gives him a sour look; CHEV makes
               him FLINCH with a sudden jerk toward him.

               CHEV wanders through the trauma ward, trying to look
               inconspicuous, avoiding eye contact, knocking things over,
               trying doors, inhaling blast after blast of nasal spray,
               tossing the empty bottles, eyes watering.
          
               He rounds a corner and freezes in his tracks: three COPS are
               at the admissions counter ... a NURSE is gesturing in CHEV'S
               direction. They look up toward him.
          
               He ducks back into the corridor, finds a recovery room and
               slips in.

               The room is quiet, save for the steady labored wheezing of an
               OLD MAN in the only bed. The OLD MAN'S eyes stare vacantly
               at the ceiling - CHEV can't tell if he's asleep or awake. He
               watches the OLD MAN for a stolen moment, hypnotized ...
          
                .. then glances over at the half open closet.

               The COPS come up on the corridor where CHEV disappeared.
               They advance, hands on weapons, checking each room.
          
                hey reach CHEV'S room. The door is slightly ajar.     One of
               the cops pushes it open with his foot.
          
               The OLD MAN is there, motionless.   No sign of CHEV.

               The COPS continue down the hall. Behind them, from the door
               they checked, CHEV tiptoes out wearing a blue hospital
               johnnie, tied in the back with his ass hanging out, trying to
               blend in.
          
               One of the COPS notices this.

                            Hey!
          
               CHEV takes off, walking faster, around the corner.        The COPS
               head after him.
               T
                he COPS turn the corner.        CHEV is still trying to play it
               off.

               CHEV busts into the stairwell and starts heading down. He's
               been holding his gun awkwardly in his armpit; now he whips it
               out. A few flights above he hears the door bang open as the
               COPS pick up the chase.
          
               He exits into the ...

               The busy ER is buzzing with activity. CHEV looks around
               desperately. The COPS are right on his tail.
          
               Suddenly the entrance doors BURST OPEN ... a patient is
               wheeled in at a dead run by a small group of emergency TECHS,
               all shouting instructions back and forth and barking at
               people to get out of the way as they race toward the far
               corridor. The FAT MAN on the gurney has his shirt open ...
               he's pale, glassy eyed and lathered in sweat ... they have
               the DEFIBRILLATOR PADDLES out ...

                ehind the gurney a RESIDENT pushes a CRASH CART along with

               supplies ...
          
               CHEV takes off after them, BOWLING PEOPLE OVER, flashing the
               gun.

                       Hold it right there, bro!
          
          The group is galloping      down the long corridor toward the
          elevators that connect      to the O.R. ... three DOCS, the
          RESIDENT, CHEV and the      FAT MAN on the gurney ... the COPS in
          hot pursuit, trying to      get a bead on CHEV.
          
          CHEV is holding his gun to the RESIDENT'S head while pushing
          him and the cart forward. The RESIDENT blubbers in panic.
          The DOCS, in all the confusion, haven't noticed CHEV yet.
          
                                 CHEV
                       You've got epinephrine on this cart!    I

                       He's dropping! Stand by to defibrillate!
          
          The gurney slows down and the cart, shoved forward by CHEV,
          crashes into it. Bodies fly, shit spills everywhere. The
          FAT MAN lets out a groan, makes EYE CONTACT with CHEV.

                       Yeah, yeah.
          
          CHEV spins around wildly and FIRES A FEW SHOTS over the COPS
          heads. They hit the deck.

          himself against the wall.

                    right?
          
          CHEV nods weakly. The RESIDENT, on his hands and knees,
          starts digging through the supplies spilled all over the
          floor. The COPS, sensing weakness, start to tense. CHEV
          snaps out of it momentarily.
          
                              CHEV
                    DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!
          
          The RESIDENT approaches him cautiously, on his knees, holding
          out a handful of small white boxes.
          
                              CHEV (CONT'D)
                    Give me that.
          
          He snatches them, cradling them against his stomach, and
          backs up past the DOCS toward the elevator just as the chime
          sounds and the doors slide open. He tosses the boxes inside.
          The FAT MAN lets out another agonized groan.
          
                               AT MAN
                    ... asshole...

                    Not going to tell you again.
          
          He grabs a DEFIBRILLATOR paddle out of TECH 2's trembling
          hands and holds it to his chest.

               begins to charge ... CHEV holds the paddle to his chest with
               one hand, the gun out with the other ... finally ...
          
               ZAPPP!!!! CHEV flies backwards, bouncing off the wall like a
               pinball. The COPS leap forward, trying to take advantage,

               CHEV collapses on the floor of the elevator. He fumbles with

               from the tip of the needle and pops the thing right in ...
               pushes the plunger ALL THE WAY, plucks it out and tosses it
               in the corner.
          
               CHEV sits patiently against the wall, staring blankly
               straight ahead. Suddenly a curious look comes over him.

                                      CHEV
                                (tossing the gun up and
                                 catching it)
                            You want it? You want this?
          
                he COP jumps off the bike and tries to make a go at him, but
               jerks back when CHEV catches the gun. CHEV holds the gun up
               like a fetch stick, gluing the COP'S eyes, then flings it 40
               feet through the air to splash into a plaza fountain.
          
                he COP starts after it, then stops short as he sees CHEV
               dart past him and hop onto his still idling motorcycle. He
               kicks up the stand and REVS IT.
          
                                      COP
                            You son of a bitch!
          
               The COP makes a dive for CHEV, grabbing him by the waist as
               the bike jerks forward.
          
                HEV starts to burn the bike out as the COP hangs on,
               dragging. SMOKE ERUPTS; black bits of rubber spray like
               buckshot, pelting the COP. CHEV does a 360 DEGREE BURNOUT,
               kicking with his leg to keep the bike under control, then
               jerking, skidding, BLASTS OFF. The COP hangs on, cursing,
               dragging, boots smoking, for a half block before he bails
               out.

               CHEV cruises in an out of traffic and people like a Sunday
               drive, ignoring traffic lights, stop signs, pedestrians. (We

               From the rear pegs at about 30 mph he JUMPS UP TO THE GAS
               TANK, feet first, STANDS STRAIGHT UP ON THE MOVING BIKE and
               puts his hands out to his sides in a Jesus Christ pose,
               flashing a silhouette in the sun. His HEART POUNDS as he
               flies by crowds of astonished bystanders ...
          
                .. and CRASHES straight into a patio restaurant full of
               people.
          
               CHEV flips through the air and lands in a cacophony of
               overturned tables and busted dishes. A table spins like a

               Stunned silence hangs in the air; a few food-covered people
               wander around in dazed shock. CHEV'S arm, hand still
               clutching his cell phone, sticks out from under a table. The
               phone starts to ring:

               From under the table we see CHEV'S eyes blink as he comes to
               his senses.
          
               He shakes off the debris, struggles to his feet and clicks to
               answer the phone.

               works. He couldn't look more out of place in EVE'S mellow

          her sides as if touching the JOGGING SUIT would kill her.
          
          Without making eye contact, he breaks away and pushes into

          CHEV goes to the window, peaks through the curtains.
          
                                 EVE (CONT'D)
                       Actually, I'm glad you're here. Can you
                       change the clock on the microwave?
          
                                    CHEV
                       What?
          
                                 EVE
                       I never changed it back.

                              EVE
                    Yeah. I never changed it back.   You
                    know, daylight savings time.

                               HEV
                    I bought you some flowers, but they got
                    fucked up on the way over here.
          
                              EVE
                    That's sweet. Are you OK? You look like
                    you're on drugs or something.
          
                              CHEV
                    You love me, right?
          
                              EVE
                    Yes.
          
                              CHEV
                    Then I need you to do something for me.
          
                              EVE
                    What is it? What's wrong?
          
                              CHEV
                    I need you to put some clothes on and
                    come with me right now.
          
                              EVE
                    But ... I ...
          
                              CHEV
                    I'll change the clock on the microwave.
          
                              EVE
                    OK.
          
          Confused, she pads off to the bedroom to change.
          
          CHEV goes into the kitchen. He peeks out the kitchen window,
          looks around nervously, glances at the microwave, walks up
          and punches two buttons.
          
          EXTREME CU: in ULTRA SLO-MOTION the digital readout on the
          clock switches from 11 to NOON with a sound like an 18-
          wheeler being dragged on it's side through a cathedral.
          
           HEV'S vision starts to blur. He slumps forward, head
          pressed against the microwave, trying to hold himself up.

          We hear his HEART skip, hang for a long moment, then thud
          again, heavily.
          
                               HEV
                        (to himself)
                    That shit's wearing off ...

                        (calling to him)
                    Oh darn! I forgot, the waffle iron's on
                    if you want to make one.
          
                              CHEV
                        (calling back)
                    Great, great ...
          
          He lurches over to the other side of the kitchen ... where an
          old fashioned-style waffle iron sits, plugged in and starting
          to smoke.
          
          He takes a deep breath, opens the lid, PUTS HIS HAND IN AND
          PRESSES THE THING CLOSED.
          
           OUND: a stomach churning SEAR AND SIZZLE.
          
           e screams under his breath, stomping on the kitchen floor in
          agony ... but his HEARTBEAT rockets up again. He pulls out
          his pink, smoking hand and jams it under his armpit, hopping
          up and down.
          
                              EVE (O.S.)
                    You're so stressed out, do you want some
                    pot?

                        (fighting to get the words out)
                    Yes. No! ... thanks ...
          
          The waffle iron starts to SPARK from the plug. He yanks it
          out of the wall as EVE walks in wearing a sun dress and a
          ribbon in her hair.
          
                              EVE

               She turns, grabs her purse and walks out the front door in a
               huff.
          
                HEV is about to follow her when he notices something out the
               window - DOUBLE TAKES, then parts the blinds to get a better
               look.
          
          
          
               A SEDAN has pulled up outside. TWO HOODS hop out and split

               up, one coming up the front way, the other around back. Each
               one has a right hand tucked into his blazer - they're
               PACKING.

               CHEV comes up behind EVE, grabs her by the shoulders and

               EVE stops suddenly in front of her door - CHEV practically
               PILES into her.

                            off.
          
                he opens the door and walks in. CHEV tries to speak, coughs
               up some unintelligible stacato nonsense.

               gun -

               CHEV is waiting by the door, blocking her view of the front
               entrance, smiling somewhat crazily.
          
                                   CHEV
                         You trying to burn down the building?
          
               She gives him a look, then turns and heads down the hall.
               CHEV hustles after her.

                he building opens out back into a small parking area. Trash
               bins line the brick wall, ready for pick up. CHEV and EVE are
               leaving when CHEV sees the other HOOD coming around the
               corner, LESS THAN TEN FEET AWAY.
          
               CHEV grabs the back of EVE'S purse and turns it upside down,
               spilling the contents all over the concrete. She spins
               around, just missing C
                                    sight of the HOOD.

               She drops down to gather up her things, as the HOOD comes
               fully around the corner and MEETS EYES with CHEV.
          
                ithout hesitation, CHEV hurdles EVE and catches the HOOD'S
               wrist as he pulls out his GUN.

                            working for you...
          
               CHEV wrestles himself around the HOOD, keeping the gun at a
               distance with one hand, his other hand cupped over the HOOD'S
               mouth, head-locking him. Their legs interlock, jostling for
               leverage.
          
                he GUN drifts down toward EVE - CHEV wrenches it up as THE
               TRIGGER SQUEEZES.
          
               SILENCER. The shot whizzes over EVE'S head and through a

                            You know, I could use a little help here.
          
               CHEV shoves the HOOD'S body into a dumpster just as EVE
               turns... CHEV snatches up the first thing he sees - a grime
               encrusted plastic SHOWER CAP - and holds it up lamely.

               CHEV pulls a little bottle of NAS-ALL out of his pocket and

               EVE storms out of the restaurant, letting the door slam
               behind her. CHEV follows, staggering like a drunk man.
          
               He catches up to her and grabs her arm.

               POISON'S PROGRESS moves another clock tick forward.

           hey roll around on the ground, scratching and clawing at one
          another. A curious crowd gathers round. EVE starts to flip

           ext thing you know she's kissing and biting his mouth,

          CHEV'S HEARTBEAT starts to pick up. He lifts her dress and

          over to a newspaper machine on the street - the crowd parts
          to let them through - and bends her over it.

          portion of the crowd spontaneously breaks into applause.
          CHEV picks up the pace. EVE begins making primal cries.
          
            busload of JAPANESE GIRLS pulls up - tourists in matching
          red uniforms - gaping out the window with slack jawed
          amazement.
          
           ith the crowd cheering and traffic stopped, CHEV gets a shot
          of adrenaline and goes for broke. EVE shrieks like a banshee

                looking straight up as a bag is thrown over KAYLO'S head and
                two unidentifiable men close in on him, lifting the chair off
                the ground ... then takes its time moving slowly down to

               lap the whole time, pulls out a fifty and hands it to the

                the fire escape streams sunlight. A SUPERVISOR, Korean,

                CHEV ducks behind a big ventilation duct. HOOD #2, mid 40's,
                stocky, is leaning over the edge of the building on the
                opposite side, looking for something - presumably CHEV -
                holding a cell phone up to his ear. His folded jacket and
                gun sit on the ledge beside him.

                under his chin.

                       You've totally lost your shit, dude ...
                       you're all over the TV ... destroying
                       property, making unauthorized hits ...
                       you're causing the organization a great
                       deal of embarrassment.
          
          CHEV gestures toward KAYLO in disbelief.
          
                                 CHEV
                       Carlito ordered this?
          
                                 HOOD #1
                           (ignoring it)
                       Look, forget about Verona. We'll take
                       care of him. The best thing for you to
                       do is to find a nice, dark, quiet place
                       and just ... die.
          
                                   CHEV
                       Just die.
          
                                  HOOD #1
                       Yeah.   Just ... die.
          
          CHEV'S HEARTBEAT starts to slow. The wooden elevator starts
          down. He looks around, making eye contact with the other
          HOODS ...
          
                                 CHEV
                       Maybe you're right.
          
          ... then down to KAYLO'S crumpled body. He sees the stocking
          feet, the pumps ... his HEART starts to jitter - THUDUB ...
          LUB ... THUDUB ... his vision doubles ... he starts to swoon
          ...
          
                                 HOOD #1
                           (rationalizing)
                       I mean we all gotta die sometime, right?
          
          HOOD #1 snickers.     The others share a tense laugh.
          
                                 CHEV
                       That's true ... we all gotta die ...

                CHEV stumbles, props himself up with one hand.
          
                                    CHEV (CONT'D)
                          Right ... so ... let's all die ...

                          Eh?
          
                CHEV brings up his gun in the blink of an eye, draws a bead
                on HOOD #1 and is about to set off a SHOOTING GALLERY, when
                the ELEVATOR BELL CHIMES and the door SLIDES OPEN.
          
                EVE WALKS IN... looks around, and FREEZES.
          
                They all turn to look.
          
                                    HOOD #1 (CONT'D)
                          What the...?
          
                CHEV affords himself about a second and a half of BUG-EYED
                SHOCK before snapping out of it and DROPPING HOOD #1
                INSTANTLY WITH A SHOT TO THE HEAD.
          
                 HAOS BREAKS OUT as the others dive for cover and start
                blasting. CHEV yanks KAYLO'S chair up and shoves it toward
                the HOODS - then makes a break for the elevator shaft,
                grabbing EVE as he goes.
          
                 AYLO'S body screens CHEV and EVE as they run, taking hits,
                finally toppling over again. CHEV takes out another HOOD on
                the run, nailing him right between the eyes.
          
                 HEV turns his back on the hoods, covering EVE, as they make
                a dive into the open elevator shaft and takes a BULLET IN THE
                ASS.
          
                                    CHEV
                          OW!
          
                He spins and empties his clip at the HOODS, who hit the deck.
          
                EVE holds his ass as CHEV looks down the open elevator shaft.
                The elevator is half a floor down, moving slow. He grabs
                EVE, then the cable... they jump for it.

                CHEV and EVE hit the floor of the moving elevator with a
                CRASH and roll out onto the 4th floor. The workers are all
                in a panic, standing by their sewing machines - they've
                obviously heard the shots. The SUPERVISOR is walking around,
                shoving them back into their seats, screaming at everyone in
                Korean to keep working.
          
                                                                  (CONTINUED)

                The SUPERVISOR, all of five feet, walks right up to CHEV and
                EVE, and starts screaming at them in broken English.
          
                                         SUPERVISOR

                EVE completely FLIPS OUT and starts SHOUTING DOWN the little
                man.
          
                                       EVE

                             KILLS PEOPLE!!!

                             Nice.
          
                The door on the far end of the room BUSTS OPEN and HOODS pour
                in from the stairwell. They spot him.
          
                CHEV and EVE duck low and start hoofing it down the rows of
                machines toward the windows. The HOODS fan out. They play
                cat and mouse in the maze of sewing machines and Koreans
                while the SUPERVISOR, oblivious, continues screaming and
                forcing the workers back into their chairs.
          
                CHEV puts a finger to EVE'S lips, calming her momentarily...
          
                ... then comes up behind a youngish HOOD and shoves the
                HOOD'S gun hand under a vicious looking sewing machine at
                least fifty years old, operated by a Korean woman even older.
                THE RUSTY THING PUNCTURES HIS HAND OVER AND OVER AS HE
                SCREAMS, JUMPING UP AND DOWN, UNABLE TO GET FREE.
          
                 HEV grabs the gun. They make for the fire escape.

                They reach the bottom of the ladder and are PINNED DOWN by
                gunfire from above.
          
                CHEV gives her a LOOK that says it all.
          
                                       EVE
                             I had to see if you were telling the
                             truth... oh, and you have my purse.
          
                CHEV notices the purse still over his shoulder, takes it off
                and hands it to her. With a quick upward glance he breaks
                cover and squeezes off 4 SHOTS, nailing two HOODS on the fire
                escape.
          
                                       CHEV
                             Come on! Wait -
          
                                                                     (CONTINUED)

          She freezes - one of the DEAD HOODS lands with a THUD in the
          spot she would've been -
          
                                 CHEV (CONT'D)
                       ... OK, now come on.
          
          EVE is pale as a sheet. She steps over the body like she was
          avoiding a particularly large pile of cow shit... CHEV grabs
          her hand and yanks her along.
          
          He spots EVE'S CAR parked BACKWARDS across the street and
          they make a desperate RUN FOR IT as more shots WHIZ AND
          RICOCHET off the pavement.
          
          EVE is rifling through her purse as they run. Naturally CHEV
          assumes she's looking for the CAR KEYS.
          
                                 EVE

                       control pill.
          
          CHEV answers the gunfire with shots of his own, buying them a
          few seconds, then grabs the purse and shakes the contents out
          onto the ground.
          
           o keys.
          
                                 CHEV

          She looks like she's about to wander around, gathering up her
          things, when another volley of shots BLOWS OUT THE PASSENGER
          WINDOW of the car.
          
          CHEV picks EVE up like a sack of grain and THROWS HER, HEAD
          FIRST, THROUGH THE PASSENGER WINDOW, INTO THE CAR, then runs
          around the other side, hops in and PEELS OUT.

                    WHAT?
          
                              EVE
                    Come on, let's finish what you started.
          
          CHEV'S eyes flash to the rearview mirror and GO WIDE. He
          grabs the back of EVE'S head and PUSHES IT DOWN INTO HIS LAP -
          just as a BULLET SLICES THROUGH THE REAR WINDSHIELD and out
          the front.
          
          EVE'S head STAYS DOWN.
          
                                 CHEV
                    Oh boy...
          
          CHEV is straining against the seat, EVASIVE DRIVING as she
          GOES DOWN on him.
          
                              CHEV (CONT'D)
                    Oh yeah, that's... that's really working
                    for me...
          
          EVE'S head pops up. E

                    Stay down.
          
          He pushes her head back down.
          
          CHEV'S heart is POUNDING like a jackhammer. He's got himself
          arched into a crazy position, making it happen.
          
                              CHEV (CONT'D)
                    That's it that's it that's it... just a
                    little...
          
          EVE'S head quickly pops back up. She PUSHES AWAY.

          CHEV loses his mind.
          
          He SLAMS THE BRAKES to put the car into a SLIDE, exposing his
          driver side to the pursuing sedan - punches his gun hand out
          the window and BLASTS AWAY.
          
          He NAILS THE DRIVER BETWEEN THE EYES... the window
          DISINTEGRATES... The SEDAN full of HOODS skids into the
          sidewalk. Steam pours from the radiator.
          
           XT. CITY STREET - DAY
          
          CHEV gets out and walks DIRECTLY UP TO THE SEDAN, one hand
          holding his gun straight out in front of him, the other
          PULLING UP HIS JOGGING PANTS, which are bunched up around his
          knees.
          
          CHEV unloads the entire clip into the SEDAN before any of the
          HOODS can react.
          
           e walks back to EVE'S CAR, cool as a cucumber, gets in and
          pulls away.
          
           NT. EVE'S CAR - DAY
          
          EVE'S face has turned a distinct shade of PALE GREEN.
          
                              EVE
                    Are they... OK?
          
          CHEV looks at her like she's nuts.
          
                              CHEV
                    They're dead.
          
          EVE is overwhelmed.
          
                              EVE
                    How can you... how can you do that...?
          
          CHEV barely hears her - he's become DISTRACTED, flexing his
          left hand and feeling around his legs.
          
                              CHEV
                    I told you, baby... I quit.
          
          He spots something, hits the brakes.
          
                                 CHEV (CONT'D)
                    Wait here.

                CHEV almost COLLAPSES when his feet hit the ground. It seems
                like the left half of his body has simply stopped working.
          
                                    CHEV
                          Jesus Christ! Now what...?
          
                He unsnaps the buttons of the warm-up pants to reveal that
                his left leg has TURNED GREY.
          
                He's HALF DEAD.
          
                                    EVE
                          What's the matter?
          
                                    CHEV
                              (pointing at her)
                          Stay.
          
                They've pulled up across the street from a HARDWARE STORE.
                CHEV drags his carcass across the street, oblivious to the
                traffic swerving and braking to avoid him, and stumbles in.
          
                EVE stays in the car for a few seconds, looking lost, then
                pulls herself together and gets out.
          
                She follows CHEV'S path, crossing the street through traffic.
          
                 TORE EMPLOYEES and CUSTOMERS start bailing out of the store
                in a PANIC as she approaches the front doors. She walks
                through them and INSIDE.

                EVE dream-walks through the store, past the registers,
                following CHEV'S trail of BLOOD-SMEARED FOOTPRINTS.
          
                A pimple-faced STOCK CLERK blows by her, not looking back.

                          He's got a gun!
          
                She turns the corner and there's CHEV - he's propped up in
                the middle of an aisle in front of a bin of NAILS, HAMMER in
                one hand...
          
                 e's already hammered SIX FRAMING NAILS INTO HIS LEG and is
                busy POUNDING IN NUMBER SEVEN.
          
                He looks up at her, eyes wild.

                SOUND: BEE-DEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEE-DUM.
          
                At first CHEV doesn't understand where the SOUND is coming
                from ... he looks around as if a RED GHOST might glide around
                a random corner any second ... then realizes his CELL is in
                his pocket. He answers it.

                CHEV meets her gaze.
          
                                       CHEV
                          I promise.
          
                                                                         CUT TO:

                CHEV bangs through the revolving glass doors to the hotel.
          
          
                                                                     (CONTINUED)

                The CAMERA shifts to a ROUGH HANDHELD POV, similar to the
                shot that starts the film. The MUSIC is replaced by the
                SOUND of CHEV'S labored BREATHING and HEARTBEAT. The POV
                doubles, goes in and out of focus.
          
                 n one continuous shot he approaches the STANDARD HOTEL and
                walks past the valets into the RETRO-MOD LOBBY.

                The shot continues as CHEV moves through the LOBBY and makes
                a beeline for the RESTROOM. Scattered around are hard
                looking DUDES pretending to read newspapers ... he passes
                them by, avoiding eye contact.
          
                INT BATHROOM, STANDARD HOTEL - CONTINUOUS
           33                                                                 133
                The bathroom is empty. He walks into a stall, shuts the door
                and opens his coat - we see a PAGER-SIZED device clipped to
                his belt - a green LED is illuminated.
          
                 EVERSE: CHEV adjusts a tiny knob on the device.   His face is
                shiny with perspiration.
          
                He pulls out his shirt tails ... we see that a small tube
                runs from the device to a needle inserted in the base of
                C
                spine, taped up with white adhesive.
          
                 HEV tucks the shirt back carefully, takes a series of deep
                breaths and leaves the stall.

                He bangs open the door to the restroom and pushes past three
                of the DUDES, who were about to go in. They let him pass,
                trying to avoid attention.
          
                CHEV makes his way to the ELEVATORS, hits the UP button.    The
                doors open, he gets on. The DUDES watch from the LOBBY.

                A JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN - early 50s, compact and under five
                feet, immaculately groomed - hustles on as the doors slide
                shut. He stands opposite CHEV against the wall and stares at
                him, expressionless.
          
                                       CHEV
                             What's happening, brother?
          
                Silence.

          CHEV takes a small bottle of PILLS from his coat pocket and
          swallows them dry.
          
          He closes his eyes and leans against the wall to steady
          himself as the effect of the pills washes over him.
          
           n UNEXPECTED VOICE breaks the silence.

                       Where did I go wrong?
          
          CHEV'S eyes SNAP OPEN.    The JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN stares back,
          impassively.
          
                                 CHEV
                           (weirded out)
                       Did you say something?
          
          Now the JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN answers - but when he moves his
          lips, it's the voice of A WOMAN IN HER 40s.

                       mother.
          
          CHEV shakes his head in disbelief, tries to clear his eyes,
          but the HALLUCINATION persists.
          
                                 KAREN CHELIOS (CONT'D)
                       You never call, you never write... I
                       haven't seen you since you ran out at

                                 CHEV
                           (falling right into it)
                       Right, with you popping Valium like Tic
                       Tacs and balling some new asshole every
                       two weeks... why wouldn't I stick around
                       for entertainment like that?
          
                                 KAREN CHELIOS
                       That's hurtful.
          
          CHEV is an instant ball of regret.

          The JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN cuts him off - this time the voice
          is ORLANDO'S.

                              ORLANDO
                    But you know this has got to stop
                    sometime. What do you think you are,
                    Michael Myers? They pop you and you just
                    keep gettin up?

          The JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN does another transformation - this
          time into ALEX.

                    didn't you guys just cut me up alive when

           s he speaks, ALEX'S voice transforms again, this time into

                              MIRROR CHEV
                    Bipolar. Sadomasochistic tendencies.
                    Adrenaline junkie. Addicted to
                    violence... probably spends every day of
                    his life looking for the big thrill, the
                    big rush. Cutting up a guy like that
                    while he screams in his own blood and
                    excrement would be like... like a GIFT...
                    a warrior's death... hell, you'd probably
                    get off on it...

                              MIRROR CHEV
                    No, this was the best way for a guy like
                    you: a slow, ticking clock... winding
                    down... inevitable... non-negotiable...

                The GOONS lead CHEV through a posh dining area, down a dark
                corridor.
          
                They frisk him, finding the obvious .45 in the shoulder
                holster, yank it out and push him into a SMOKING LOUNGE.

                CARLITO and RICKY VERONA sit side by side at the table. An
                iced bucket of champagne, good cigars. GOONS chill in the
                corners. The whole floor has been cleared out - they've got
                the place all to themselves.

                       Pat him down again. He's carrying
                       something.
          
          The GOONS give him another look. This time they reach down
          his pants and produce a second small, concealed handgun ...
          then discover the pager-like device. One of the goons rips
          the tube from CHEV's back - CHEV winces in pain. His
          HEARTRATE starts to slow almost immediately.
          
                                 CARLITO
                       Let me see that.
          
          A GOON tosses it to him.
          
                                 CARLITO (CONT'D)

                       What the fuck is insulin?
          
          CARLITO shuts him up with a look.

                           (holding the device up)
                       Ephedrine, right?
          
          CHEV nods. CARLITO places the device carefully on the table.

          CARLITO unlatches a 2'x6" beautifully crafted mahogany wood
          case sitting on the table in front of him. It contains
          several SYRINGES and bottle of MILKY FLUID. He removes one
          SYRINGE from the box with a gloved hand. It almost glows in
          the soft light.      C

          In a flash, CHEV WHIPS OUT A GUN - everyone FLINCHES... but
          no, wait: he's just holding out his fist, pointing the STICK-
          EM-UP FINGER right between CARLITO'S eyes.
          
                              CHEV
                    Not so fast, motherfucker.
          
          For a beat, no one knows quite how to react. VERONA chuckles
          nervously.

          CHEV whips the finger toward VERONA, shutting him down mid-
          word. VERONA shrugs it off with less than 100% confidence...
          the room EXHALES.

          A GOON makes a move for CHEV... but CHEV spins on him,
          leveling the finger at the GOON'S forehead, and pulls the
          "trigger"...
          
                              CHEV

                    Booosh!
          
          The GOON'S head is rocked back, a NICKEL-SIZED HOLE popped
          right through the cranium... a GLORIOUS FOUNTAIN OF CRIMSON
          arcs from the GOON'S forehead across the table, splashing
          into the ice bucket.

          DON KIM,   in a Ralph Lauren polo shirt and white slacks, is
          standing   at the entrance of the bar. He's got an ASIAN
          GANGSTER   on each side, one of them holding out a smoking,
          silenced   GLOCK .9mm.
          
          More ASIAN GANGSTERS appear all around, moving in, taking
          position. The GANGSTERS all look about 16 years old, dressed
          for a hot night at the FLORENTINE GARDENS... but their eyes
          are dead-blank COLD AS HELL.

                      Presto.
          
          One of CARLITO'S GOONS points an UZI at DON KIM... and is
          FILLED FULL OF LEAD in the blink of an eye by a pair of
          ASIANS on his blind side... who are CUT TO RIBBONS by another
          of CARLITO'S MEN... and ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.
          
          CARLITO scrambles away from the table and grabs one of his
          GOONS, using him as a shield as he makes his way behind the
          bar... the GOON absorbs a hail of bullets...
          
          VERONA whips out a .357 MAGNUM, turns toward CHEV...
          
           ummoning a surge of strength from out of his ass, CHEV kicks
          the table forward, pinning VERONA'S legs to the bench - the
          ICE BUCKET slides into CHEV'S lap...
          
           e snatches out a bottle of Dom Perignon and fastballs it at
          VERONA'S GUN HAND... the bottle SHATTERS... VERONA bobbles
          the .357... it hits the ground - GOES OFF - and the four
          fingers of VERONA'S right hand are VAPORIZED.
          
          VERONA SHRIEKS like a ten year old girl at a JUSTIN
          TIMBERLAKE concert.
          
          Behind the bar, CARLITO quickly punches up his cell phone.

          CARLITO'S and DON KIM'S MEN have backed into opposite corners
          of the room, and are firing back and forth.
          
          VERONA crawls along the floor, gathering up what's left of
          his fingers... comes across a SYRINGE and grabs it in his
          teeth like a PIRATE'S KNIFE.
          
          DON KIM stands amidst the chaos, completely unperturbed.
          
                              CARLITO
                        (from behind the bar)

                    Too late!
          
          CHEV swoons, almost passes out... catches sight of a GUN and
          pries it from the hand of a dead GOON... he spots VERONA'S
          FEET disappearing behind a wall, takes a bead and fires -
          blowing off a set of toes to go with the fingers.
          
          An ASIAN GANGSTER runs up and lobs a GRENADE behind the
          BAR... it bounces along and comes to rest next to CARLITO.
          
          CARLITO thinks quick, grabbing one of his GOONS - a 265
          pounder - from behind...
          
                                CARLITO
                    Get down!
          
          He BODY-TACKLES the BIG MAN onto the floor, right on top of
          the live grenade, and brings his weight down on top of him.
          
                              GOON
                    Thanks, boss.
          
          BOOM!
          
          The BIG GOON'S body absorbs the blast, which picks them both
          up five feet in the air... CARLITO, momentarily airborne,
          pops up from behind the bar like a JACK IN THE BOX, then
          drops back down with a THUD...

EXT. YUAN COMPOUND - DAY

Security men and porters are loading wagons for a convoy.
As they work, we see across the lake a lone horseman entering
the village.  One of the men recognizes him.

				WORKER
		Master Li is here!

ANGLE ON: Li Mu Bai, thirties, powerful and handsome.

In the background, old Aunt Wu, at the sight of Li Mu Bai,
drops her parcels and runs excitedly into the building.

INT. YUAN HALLWAY - DAY

Aunt Wu runs hurriedly through the halls.

				AUNT WU
		Shu Lien!

INT. YU'S ROOM - DAY

Yu, a beautiful woman in her early 30s, is finishing packing
for the convoy, wrapping a few small items in a linen
wrapper, as Aunt Wu bursts in.

				AUNT WU
		Li Mu Bai is here!

INT. YUAN PRACTICE HALL - DAY

				LI
		How's everything?

				AUNT WU
		Fine.  Please come in.

Yu sits, composed, as Aunt Wu ushers Li in.  Li carries a
large object, wrapped in silk.

Yu smiles.

				YU
		Mu Bai...It's been too long.

				LI
		It has.
			(he glances around
			the room)
		How's business?

				YU
		Good.  And how are you?

				LI
		Fine.

An awkward pause.

				YU
		Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan
		Mountain.  He said you were
		practicing deep meditation.

				LI
		Yes.

				YU
		The mountain must be so peaceful...
		I envy you.  My work keeps me so
		busy, I hardly get any rest.

				LI
		I left the training early.

				YU
		Why?  You're a Wudan fighter.
		Training is everything.

				LI
		During my meditation training... I
		came to a place of deep silence...
		I was surrounded by light... Time
		and space disappeared.  I had come
		to a place my master had never told
		me about.

				YU
		You were enlightened?

				LI
		No.  I didn't feel the bliss of
		enlightenment.  Instead... I was
		surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I
		couldn't bear it.  I broke off my
		meditation.  I couldn't go on.
		There was something... pulling me
		back.

				YU
		What was it?

				LI
		Something I can't let go of.  You
		are leaving soon?

				YU
		We're preparing a convoy for a
		delivery to Peking.

				LI
		Perhaps I could ask you to deliver
		something to Sir Te for me.

Li unwraps the object.  It is an ancient, astonishingly
beautiful sword.

				YU
		The Green Destiny Sword?  You're
		giving it to Sir Te?

				LI
		I am.  He has always been our
		greatest protector.

				YU
		I don't understand.  How can you
		part with it?  It has always been
		with you.

				LI
		Too many men have died at its edge.
		It only looks pure because blood
		washes so easily from its blade.

				YU
		You use it justly, you're worthy of
		it.

				LI
		It's time for me to leave it behind.

				YU
		So what will you do now?

Li doesn't reply.

				YU
		Come with me to Peking.  You can
		give the sword to Sir Te yourself.
		It'll be just like old times.

				LI
		First I must visit my master's
		grave.  It's been many years since
		Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet
		to avenge his death.  And yet I'm
		thinking of quitting.  I must pray
		for his forgiveness.

				YU
		Join me once you have finished.  I
		can wait for you in Peking.

				LI
		Perhaps.

EXT. THE GATE TO PEKING. DAY

Customs officials have just finished checking the contents
in a row of carriages bearing the Sun Security insignia.
The caravan slowly passes through the checkpoint into the
boundaries of Peking.  Yu, riding a handsome horse and
clearly the leader, watches as her crew clears inspection.

				GUARDS
		Ok.  Pass.

				YU
		Thanks.  Let's go into the city.

EXT. OUTSIDE A DEPOT. DAY

Workers are busy unloading the contents from the carriages.
Boss Giao is checking off the merchandise -- a cargo of
medicinal herbs.

				GIAO
		Everything got here safely.  I'm
		much obliged.

				YU
		Just doing my job.

				GIAO
		Sun Security has been the best
		since your father started it.
		You're a credit to his memory.

				YU
		Thank you.

				GIAO
		I mean it.

EXT. DAY. PEKING

From a gray tiled roof, we can see Peking's magnificent grid
of houses extending miles and miles out, freshly painted by
the morning sun.

EXT. PEKING STREET. DAY

Dusty and congested as always, people, horses, and carriages
are fighting to get through the boulevards.

A group of jugglers perform at a corner.

Yu surveys the busy street from on top of her horse.

INT. TE'S GREAT HALL - DAY

Yu presents the sword to Sir Te.

				SIR TE
		This is Li's personal sword, a
		great hero's weapon!  He is the
		only one in the world worthy of
		carrying it.  It's too fine a gift.
		I cannot accept it.

				YU
		Sir Te!  It has brought him as much
		trouble as glory.  Help him to
		leave these troubles behind.
		Otherwise, he'll never be able to
		start anew.

				SIR TE
		All right.  I'll act as the sword's
		custodian.

De Lu, the head servant, enters.

				DE LU
		Governor Yu has arrived.

				SIR TE
		I must change.

				YU
			(getting up)
		You've always been so good to Li Mu
		Bai and me.  Please accept our
		thanks.

				SIR TE
		Please do not be such a stranger.
		You'll stay the night as my guest.
		Now, Shu Lien... tell me something.
		And forgive me for prying.  Your
		father was a great friend to me,
		and I think of you as my own
		daughter.

				YU
		Please, Sir Te, what is it?

				SIR TE
		Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and
		his warrior days... maybe he's
		trying to tell you something?

				YU
		I don't know...

				SIR TE
		Don't be coy.  I've always known
		about your feelings for each other.
		All these years, it's a shame...
		neither of you is brave enough to
		admit the truth to the other.
		You're both wasting precious time.

				YU
		I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I
		aren't cowards.

				SIR TE
		When it comes to emotions, even
		great heroes can be idiots.  Tell
		me if Li Mu Bai is not more open
		the next time you see him.  I'll
		give him an earful!

INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY

Yu and De Lu approach the study.

				DE LU
		Sir Te said to leave the sword in
		here.

De Lu opens the door and is startled to find a young woman
inside.  The woman is studying the sheets of calligraphy
hanging on the walls.

				DE LU
		Who are you?

				JEN
		I'm your guest today.  I am Governor
		Yu's daughter.

				DE LU
		This is Sir Te's study.  You are
		here to...

				JEN
		I was looking for a quiet corner.

				DE LU
		I am Sir Te's head servant.  And
		this is another of our guests.

INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY

Yu gently lays the sword, still in its sheath, in Jen's hands.

				JEN
		It's heavy for such a thin piece of
		metal!

				YU
		The handle is heavy.  And the blade
		is no ordinary metal.  Still, the
		sword is the lightest of weapons.
		You're just not used to handling it.

				JEN
		But I have had much practice.  As a
		child in the West, a platoon lived
		with us.  They'd let me play with
		their weapons.  The scabbard is so
		beautiful.

				YU
		Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you
		see it tainted with blood, its
		beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400
		years old.

				JEN
		Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...

				YU
		My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it
		to Sir Te as a gift.

				JEN
		Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior?
		Why would he give his sword to Sir
		Te?

				YU
		You're too young to understand.

				JEN
		You're a sword fighter too?

Yu yanks the sword out of the sheath.  An eerie sound
resonates within the study.  Jen is even more impressed.

				YU
		Yes, I am.  But I prefer the
		machete.  Certain moves, however,
		call for a sword.

				JEN
		Really?

Yu puts the sword back in the case.

				JEN
			(longingly)
		It must be exciting to be a fighter,
		to be totally free!

				YU
		Fighters have rules too: friendship,
		trust, integrity... Without rules,
		we wouldn't survive for long.

				JEN
		I've read all about people like you.
		Roaming wild, beating up anyone who
		gets in your way!

				YU
		Writers wouldn't sell many books if
		they told how it really is.

				JEN
		But you're just like the characters
		in the stories.

				YU
		Sure.  No place to bathe for days,
		sleeping in flea-infested beds...
		They tell you all about that in
		those books?

				JEN
		You know what I mean.  I'm getting
		married soon, but I haven't lived
		the life I want.

				YU
		So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's
		the most important step in a
		woman's life, isn't it?

				JEN
		You're not married, are you?

				YU
		What do you think?

				JEN
		No!  You couldn't roam around
		freely if you were.

				YU
		You're probably right.

Yu studies Jen.  The room falls silent for a moment.

EXT. SIDE COURT YARD - DAY

It's dusk and the sky is beautiful orange and purple.  Jen
is leaving the study escorted by her maid.  She turns to Yu
for a final good-bye.  Yu seems intrigued by the encounter.

EXT. SIR TE'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Two lighted lanterns are raised up.

INT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT

Sir Te hands the sword to Governor Yu.

				SIR TE
		Go ahead, Governor Yu.

Governor Yu is impressed by the opulence and elegance of the
sword.  He closes his eyes to guess the weight of the sword.
Te snubs out the flame from a candle, then slides the sword
out from its sheath.  The sword gives off a luminous blue
glow in the dark.

				SIR TE
		Two feet 9 inches long.  1 inch
		wide.  The handle is 1 inch deep,
		2.6 inches wide.  Seven-tenths of
		an inch thick.  With seven rubies
		missing from the hilt.  You can
		tell the design dates back to
		before the Chin era.  Engraved with
		a technique lost by the time of the
		Han Dynasty.

				GOVERNOR YU
		Your knowledge is remarkable, Sir Te.

				SIR TE
		A sword by itself rules nothing.
		It comes alive only through skillful
		manipulation.

				GOVERNOR YU
		I see your point.  Please continue.

				SIR TE
		The Imperial Court isn't the
		problem.  With royalty and officials
		everywhere, the Royal Guard keeps
		security tight.  But Peking is not
		like the West.  Here, you'll find
		all sorts of characters.  Proceed
		with caution in your quest for law
		and order.  Don't depend only on
		the court.  Contacts in the Giang
		Hu underworld can ensure your
		position.  Be strong, yet supple.
		This is the way to rule.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

A maid warms her hands in a basin of hot water for Jen, then
walks over to Jen and helps remove her earrings.  Someone
knocks and the maid goes to answer the door.

				MAID
		Governess...

				GOVERNESS
		Let me do it.

The maid leaves as the governess enters the room.

				JEN
		Please sit.

				GOVERNESS
		I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you
		want to change into them?

				JEN
		Put them down.

				GOVERNESS
		I heard you met Shu Lien today.

				JEN
		Do you know her?

				GOVERNESS
		She's one of those.  Your mother
		would not want you consorting with
		her kind.

Jen shoots her an angry look.

				JEN
		I'll socialize with whomever I
		please.

				GOVERNESS
		Don't invite danger into your
		father's house.

She's about to say something, then thinks better of it.

				JEN
		I'm tired now.

				GOVERNESS
		Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up,
		and is getting married soon.  God
		knows what the future will bring.

				JEN
		It will be just the same.  Enough!
		I'm tired.

				GOVERNESS
		Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the
		windows for you.

The governess leaves.  Jen sits on the side of her bed,
thinking.

EXT. TE'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

A wide shot of the compound.  A patrol man greets Master Bo,
Sir Te's head of security.  The place is serene.

				MASTER BO
		Chilly, eh?

				NIGHTMAN
		Yes, Master Bo.

As Bo walks on, shadows rustle in a treetop in the background.

EXT./INT. INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF TE'S STUDY - NIGHT

A masked figure silently opens the window and enters the
room.  It moves swiftly to the sword case, opens it, and
wraps the sword.

Bo enters, sees the thief, who leaps up to the ceiling.  The
thief steps over Bo and out into the courtyard.  Bo tries to
stop the thief, who easily outwits him, jumping onto the
roof as Bo yells out.

				BO
		Someone help!  Stop him!  He's on
		the roof!  The sword's been stolen!
		Stop thief!  Stop him!

The thief skips a few times and jumps off to a side street.

Bo grabs a pole and runs, as gongs begin to sound, alerting
people to the theft.  People rush outside, Yu Shu Lien among
them.

EXT. PEKING STREET - NIGHT

Bo runs through the streets.  The thief is nowhere in sight.
Suddenly, there are sounds of weapons clashing.  Bo hurries
towards the source.

EXT. AN ALLEY OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Bo is surprised to see the hooded figure battling with two
other fighters -- Tsai (male, 40s) and May, his daughter.

				TSAI
		It's Jade Fox!

				MAY
		We must avenge mother!

The hooded figure does a gravity defying flip and soars over
a wall, just as Bo arrives.

				BO
		Do something!  He's getting away!

EXT. PEKING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

The thief runs atop a roof -- right into Yu.  Yu and the
hooded figure face off.

				YU
		Return the sword, and I'll let you
		go.

The figure just regards her, slightly shifting weight.

Yu attacks, but the figure repels her.

				YU
		You've been trained at Wudan?

The figure answers by leaping to another rooftop.  Yu
catches up, and resumes her attack with a relentless series
of lightning-quick blows.

EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Bo follows Tsai and May, who are quickly walking away.

				TSAI
		You're mistaken.  We're just street
		performers.  We were rehearsing.

				MAY
		Father!

				BO
		You were rehearsing?  Who are you
		trying to fool?

May wants to respond but is again cut off by Tsai.  They run
off.

				BO
		Where did that thief go?

Bo looks around and discovers he had chased the thief into
Governor Yu's compound.

				BO
		Governor Yu's house!

EXT. ROOF TOP

Yu and the Black Figure continue to fight.

				YU
		Get down here!  Give back the sword!

EXT. GOVERNOR YU'S - NIGHT

Yu slowly gets the upper hand in her fight with the thief.
A small arrow cuts across the night and flies toward Yu.
She catches it, but the masked figure takes the opportunity
to get away.

Yu pauses to feel the arrow in her hand, standing in the
empty courtyard.

EXT. TE'S SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY

De Lu escorts Yu into Te's.

				DE LU
		Sir Te awaits you.

INT. TE'S GREAT HALL - DAY

Men are standing at attention.  Bo is giving his account of
what happened, as Yu enters.

				BO
		I'm sure the thief is in the Yu
		household.

				SIR TE
		How dare you imply?

				BO
		But I say --

				SIR TE
		-- Enough.

The men hustle out.  Bo can barely contain his frustration.

				YU
		Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?

				SIR TE
		Yes, though I doubt he's involved
		in this.

				YU
		But the sword could be in his
		compound.

				SIR TE
		Then someone's trying to set him up.
		We should inform Li Mu Bai.

EXT. OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Madam Yu is returning from temple.  The governess is helping
her out of the carriage.  Servants are peeling bills off a
wall across the street.

				MADAM YU
		What is it?

				MAID
		Madam Yu, someone's put up posters.

A partially torn flyer with the words "Jade Fox will not
escape justice!" is seen on the ground.

				MADAM YU
		Let me see.

				GOVERNESS
		Someone is after Jade Fox.
		Preposterous, looking for her here!

Madam Yu nods and walks inside, as the Governess tosses the
flyer away and follows her.

A hand scoops up the flyer -- it is Yu.  She studies it,
then puts it in her pocket, and moves on.

EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

Bo is searching for the Tsais.  The bridge is full of
jugglers.  But the two are nowhere to be found.

EXT. PEKING STREET - DAY

Bo quizzes a homeless man.

				BO
		Where are they?

				HOMELESS MAN
		I don't know.  I haven't seen them
		in two days.

Bo is about to give up when he looks up and sees May walking
quickly into an alley.  Bo follows her.

EXT. IN FRONT OF TSAI'S HOUSE

May walks into a dilapidated house surrounded by a broken-
down bamboo fence.  Bo inches closer and sees May and Tsai
oiling their weapons.

INT. BO'S ROOM - DAY

Jen practices calligraphy.  The governess is by her side
embroidering and throwing occasional glances at Jen.  The
maid enters.

				MAID
		There is a Miss Shu Lien here to
		see you.

Jen stops and looks up at them.

				GOVERNESS
		Miss is busy right now.

				MAID
		I'll tell her.

				JEN
		Show her in.

The governess shoots her a look.

				GOVERNESS
		This spells trouble.

				JEN
		I have a guest.

The governess gets up to leave just as the maid shows Yu in.

				MAID
		This way please.

The governess and Yu exchange quick glances.  The governess
bows slightly and departs.

				JEN
		I've missed you.

				YU
		How so?

				JEN
		I'm bored.

Yu sees the calligraphy.

				YU
		You're doing calligraphy?

				JEN
		I'll write your name.  Just for fun.

Jen writes Yu's name with great confidence and swiftness.

				YU
		I never realized my name looks like
		"sword."

Jen freezes slightly.

				YU
		You write gracefully.  Calligraphy
		is so similar to fencing.

				JEN
		Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.

The maid enters with tea.

				JEN
		Please.

				YU
		Thank you for seeing me.  I hear
		your wedding day is near.  You must
		be overwhelmed by the preparations.

				JEN
		I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less
		I think of it the better.  My
		parents are arranging everything.
		The Gous are a very powerful family.
		My marrying one will be good for my
		father's career.

				YU
		You are fornuate to marry into such
		a noble family.

				JEN
		Am I?  I wish I were like the
		heroes in the books I read.  Like
		you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm
		happy to be marrying.  But to be
		free to live my own life, to choose
		whom I love... That is true
		happiness.

				YU
		Do you think so?  Let me tell you a
		story.

				JEN
		About you and Li Mu Bai?

				YU
		Yes.  Did you know I was once
		engaged to be married?

				JEN
		No, really?

				YU
		His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was
		a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath.
		One day, while in battle, he was
		killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's
		enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went
		through a lot together.  Our
		feelings for each other grew
		stronger.  But how could we dishonor
		Meng's memory?  So the freedom you
		talk about, I too desire it.  But I
		have never tasted it.

				JEN
		Too bad for Meng, but it's not your
		fault, or Li Mu Bai's.

				YU
		I am not an aristocrat, as you
		are... but I must still respect a
		woman's duties.

				JEN
		Don't distance us.  From now on,
		let's be like sisters.

				YU
		Then as a sister, let me wish you
		happiness in your marriage.

EXT. YU'S GARDEN - DAY

The maid escorts Yu out.  Yu pauses, looks around, and sees
the profile of the Governess peering at her from around a
corner.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Moonlight spills into the room, as Jen rises sleeplessly
from bed and looks out the window.  A light breeze stirs her
hair.  The sound of the wind rises, and slowly her face
dissolves, into...

INT./EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY

...the face of a younger, less sophisticated Jen, as she
lets the dry desert air flow through her hair.  She sits in
a carriage, part of a caravan, with guards on horseback,
that is traveling through the spectacular desert.  Across
from her sits her mother, of whom she is barely cognizant.

				MADAM YU
		What a godforsaken place!  Can't
		your father be appointed closer to
		civilization?  Jen... are you
		listening to me?

Jen is still looking out the side of the carriage, at a
beautiful mountainside.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jen sighs, and turns back toward her bed.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Tsai and May have been sitting, hidden in the branches of a
tree, watching Jen.

				TSAI
		Let's go!

They drop down silently and walk away.  From another rooftop,
Lo looks silently on.

EXT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Tsai and May enter the house.

INT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Inside the tiny house, they discover a hooded figure going
through their belongings.

Immediately Tsai throws a knife, which rips off the figure's
mask -- revealing Bo.  Tsai has another long knife at his
throat.

				TSAI
		Who are you?

				BO
		Wait!  I'm a friend!

Tsai pauses.

INT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)

May fans a small coal-fired grill that is boiling a sizzling
pot of vegetable and meatball soup.  Her father and Bo are
now friendly dinner companions, much to May's delight.

				TSAI
		I don't care about your sword.

				BO
		Why were you spying on the Yus?

				TSAI
		I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox.
		I'm a police inspector from Shaan
		Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a
		master criminal.  I hear she
		infiltrated the Yus.  She must have
		come with them when they transferred
		here.  But with Yu's reputation, I
		can't just go in and accuse her.

				BO
		This Jade Fox is a woman?

				TSAI
		Yes.

				BO
		Then leave her to me.

				TSAI
		Pardon me, but I doubt you can
		handle her.  My wife was quite a
		martial arts expert.  Jade Fox
		killed her.  So you see, this is
		personal.  Leave her to me.

				MAY
		It's ready!
			(re: the soup)


				BO
		I'm ready for anything!

Bo fishes into the pot with his chopsticks.  May intercepts
him with her own chopsticks.

				MAY
		Father gets first dip.

Tsai stiffens and snaps his chopsticks, not to pick up a
meatball but to catch an incoming dart.  A dart wrapped with
a note.  Bo jumps up.

				TSAI
		They're gone.

				MAY
		What does it say?

				TSAI
		"We'll settle this at midnight on
		Yellow Hill."  Good, the fox is out
		of her hole.

INT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT

Yu is ushered into the room, to discover Sir Te talking to
another man, whose back is to her.

				SIR TE
		Shu Lien, look who's here.

The man turns around -- it's Li Mu Bai.

EXT. TE'S HALL - NIGHT

Yu and Li Mu Bai sit together.

				LI
		Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast
		suspicion on Governor Yu.

				YU
		But something is going on at the Yu
		household.

				LI
		What have you discovered?

From her sleeve, Yu removes the flyer.  Li takes it, his
face darkening.

				LI
		Jade Fox?  Impossible.

				YU
		You always suspected she'd fled to
		the West.

				LI
		I didn't think she'd dare come back
		to Peking!

				YU
		Is there any place safer than under
		the nose of Governor Yu?

				LI
		So I shall avenge my master's death
		after all.

				YU
		Be careful.  Sir Te requires
		discretion.  Official business is
		difficult enough.  Don't let
		personal feelings make it worse.
		And I don't know... even this
		poster... could be some sort of trap.

				LI
		Did you see who posted it?

Yu pauses.

				YU
		No.

				LI
		It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's.
		On the night of the theft there was
		a brawl near Yu's.  Were you
		involved?

				YU
		It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he
		followed the thief to the Yus'.

				LI
		Have you questioned him yet?

				YU
		No, not yet...

				LI
		But your men are watching over Yu's
		compund?

				YU
		No, I'd already sent them home.
		You can blame me for losing the
		sword, but please trust that I'll
		get it back soon using my own
		methods.

				LI
		That's not what I meant.  I don't
		care about the sword.

				YU
		What do you mean?  Didn't you come
		back here for it?

				LI
		I don't know it was stolen until I
		got here.

				YU
		Then, why did you come?

				LI
		Well, we had talked...

De Lu enters.

				DE LU
		Pardon my intrusion.  Master Li,
		your room is ready.

				LI
		Thank you.  Please lead the way.

EXT. YELLOW HILL - NIGHT

Tsai, Bo, and May wait under an ancient tree.  Bo stifles a
yawn.

				BO
		The fox doesn't care much for
		punctuality.  Still no sign of her.

An old lady struggles up the hill, wearing a floppy hat over
her face, holding a cane.  The three exchange glances.

				TSAI
		Enough!  Show yourself.

The old woman shrinks in fear, but then throws off her
disguise and unveils herself -- the Governess.

				FOX
		Tsai... you dog!  You will pay for
		your stubbornness.

				BO
		That's what you think, old witch!

				TSAI
		If you surrender now, you'll suffer
		less.  But if you resist, I won't
		stop until you're dead.

				MAY
		Father!  Let me avenge my mother's
		death.

				FOX
		You'll soon end up like her, you
		little whore!

				BO
		You'll pay for that!

A fierce battle begins, the main fighting between Tsai and
Fox, with May and Bo getting a stab in occasionally, when
the opportunity presents itself.

				TSAI
			(to Bo)
		She's going to paralyze you!

Using acupressure, Fox disables Bo.  May shoots an arrow at
her, but she catches it and flings it back, hitting May.

				TSAI
		May!

Fox then disables Tsai, but just as she goes for the kill,
Li Mu Bai flies down from the treetops and steps between them.

				FOX
		Tsai, you filthy mongrel!  An ambush!

				MAY
		Father, are you all right?

Li addresses Fox.

				LI
		Wudan should have gotten rid of you
		long ago.  It's been a long time,
		Jade Fox!  You don't remember me...
		But you should remember my master.
		You infiltrated Wudan while I was
		away.  You stole our master!  Now
		it's time for you to pay!

				FOX
		Your master underestimated us women.
		Sure, he'd sleep with me, but he
		would never teach me.  He deserved
		to die by a woman's hand!

				LI
		You stole the secrets of Wudan's
		highest martial arts.  But after
		ten years of training, your moves
		are still undisciplined.  And
		today, under a Wudan sword... you
		will die!

Li easily brings Fox to the ground.

Li raises his sword to the prostrate Fox.  A figure masked
in black appears next to Fox, sword extended, saving her.

				FOX
		Disciple, we'll kill them all!

				FIGURE IN BLACK
		Let's go!

				BO
		Another one!

				FOX
		I must get rid of Tsai!

Fox fights Tsai, Bo, and May, as Li addresses the masked
figure.

				LI
		Who are you?  Why is the Green
		Destiny in your possession?

				FIGURE IN BLACK
		What's it to you?

				LI
		My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green
		Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be
		your master.  Where did you learn
		that "Xuan Piu" move?

				FIGURE IN BLACK
		I'm just playing around.

				LI
		Tell me, who is your master?

				FIGURE IN BLACK
		Let's go!

				FOX
		We must kill them!

Tsai throws his blade at Fox, who catches it and throws it
back, hitting him in the head.  Fox and the masked figure
leap away.

May drops to the ground, cradling her dead father's head.
Bo kneels beside her.

				MAY
		Father!

EXT. TE'S - DAY

Te and a group of his men look down as a cloth is removed
from over the body of Tsai.  Bo and May stand before them.

				TE
		This is Tsai?

				MAY
		My father.  Police Inspector from
		Shaan.

				TE
		This should be reported to Governor
		Yu.  The victim is an officer.  You
		believe the killer is hiding out in
		his compound.

				YU
		I'd bet my life on it!

				TE
			(to Li and Yu)
		Come with me.

He exits the room.

INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY

Te, Li, and Yu are seated.

				SIR TE
		This needs to be resolved, and
		quickly.

				LI
		I'll get into the Yu household and
		get her.  I'll ferret out Fox and
		her gang.

				YU
		We must be careful.  Governor Yu is
		a court official, and in charge of
		security.  Any disturbance will
		cast suspicion on him.  It might
		get Sir Te in trouble.

				SIR TE
		This is a delicate matter.

				YU
		Sir Te, can you find some excuse to
		invite Madam Yu and her daughter?

				SIR TE
		What do you have in mind?

				YU
		The best way to trap a fox is
		through her cubs.

Sir Te and Li look puzzled.

EXT. SIR TE'S GARDEN - DAY

Yu sits with Madam Yu and Jen.  They busy themselves with
various items for her trousseau.

				MADAM YU
		Madam Te is certainly spoiling us
		with these wedding gifts.  She's
		being so considerate.

				YU
		I'm sorry she's not feeling well
		enough to receive you today.

				MADAM YU
		I heard Sir Te lost something.  And
		now Madame Te's not feeling well...

Jen sits silently reading.

				YU
		We know who stole the missing item.
		If the thief returns it, I'm sure
		Sir Te will pursue the matter no
		further.

				MADAM YU
		That's good.  Sometimes the help
		can't keep their hands to themselves.
		It's very embarassing.

				YU
		Sir Te knows that even well-meaning
		people can make mistakes... that
		can bring ruin to themselves and
		their families.

				MADAM YU
		But don't be too lenient.

				YU
		No mercy will be shown toward the
		murderer who turned up in Peking.

				MADAM YU
		A murderer?

				YU
		Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu
		Bai's own master.  Last night, she
		killed a policeman who had tracked
		her down.

				MADAM YU
		A female criminal!  Now that's news!

Jen becomes visibly upset.

				JEN
		You say she killed a policeman?

				YU
		Yes, from the West.  He went
		undercover and and followed her
		here,

				MADAM YU
		Maybe the murderer and the thief
		are one and the same.

				YU
		I doubt it.  This thief... it very
		unusual...

As Yu speaks, she lifts the tea pot to pour Jen some tea.
As she finishes speaking, she looks into Jen's face and the
pot slips from her hand.  Without even looking down, Jen
instinctively catches the pot with a lightning-fast move.

				YU
		...And most likely smarter than a
		mere killer.

Sir Te and Li Mu Bai walk by.

				JEN
			(formal)
		Greetings, Sir Te.

				SIR TE
		Hello, Madam Yu.  This is Li Mu
		Bai, the renowned swordsman.

				LI
		Delighted to meet you.

Li sizes Jen up.

				TE
		Miss Yu is soon to be married.

				LI
		Congratulations.

EXT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT

May opens her door, only to find Bo standing guard.

				MAY
		Why don't you come in?

				BO
		I'm standing guard.

				MAY
		Come in.  It's cold.

She turns back inside, hesitates, then turns back to him.

				MAY
		Come in.  We don't have to fear
		Jade Fox if we're together.

EXT. TE COMPOUND - NIGHT

A still, dark night.

EXT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT

Something moves in the moonlight.  A hooded figure jumps down.

Li Mu Bai, who had been hiding in the shadows, comes forward.

				LI
		Isn't it a bit too late to be out?
		You've brought me the sword?

				FIGURE
		I do as I please.

The masked figure lunges away, but Li Mu Bai leaps with
incredible speed and grabs the sword from her.

				LI
		Where's your master?

				FIGURE
		What's it to you?

The figure floats away.  Li chases after her.

EXT. PEKING STREET - NIGHT

The two fly over houses and bounce off of rooftops,
displaying amazing floating skills.

INT. ABANDONED MONASTERY - NIGHT

The figure bounces into an old monastery.  Li is already
there.

				LI
		Had enough flying?  You've got
		potential.  You've studied the
		Wudan Manual but you don't
		understand it.  You need a real
		master.

The figure doesn't respond, but we sense the pride in her
eyes.

				FIGURE
		Do you think you are a real master?

				LI
		Like most things, I am nothing.
		It's the same for this sword.  All
		of it is simply a state of mind.

				FIGURE
		Stop talking like a monk!  Just
		fight!

				LI
		Then tell me where Jade Fox is.

				FIGURE
		On guard!

				LI
		Real sharpness comes without effort.

EXT. MONASTERY - NIGHT

The figure leaps into the garden, but again, Li is ahead of
her.

The figure attacks Li, who uses his agility to evade her.
Frustrated, the figure intensifies her attack.

The figure, losing composure, attacks wildly.  Li gets even
more elusive, using a branch to repel her.

				LI
		No growth without assistant.  No
		action without reaction.  No desire
		without restraint.  Now give
		yourself up and find yourself again.
		There is a lesson for you.

Li now holds the stick to her mask, gently raising it
slightly.

				FIGURE
		Go ahead.

				LI
		Why should I?  You need practice.
		I can teach you to fight with the
		Green Destiny, but first you must
		learn to hold it in stillness.

				FIGURE
		Why do you want to teach me?

				LI
		I've always wanted a disciple
		worthy of Wudan's secrets.

				FIGURE
		And if I use them to kill you?

				LI
		That's a risk I'm willing to take.
		Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade
		Fox couldn't corrupt you.

The figure's eyes cloud with tears.

				FIGURE
		Wudan is a whorehouse!  Keep your
		lessons!

The figure swirls and takes off, leaving a rueful Li standing
alone in the monastery.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jen slips in through the window.  She pulls off her mask, as
she spots the Governess/Fox sitting and sewing.

				FOX
		You're home late... or should I say
		early?

				JEN
		Why are you still here?  You killed
		a policeman.  You should leave!
		You'll bring ruin on my whole family.

				FOX
		They wouldn't have found me if you
		hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a
		little girl, you thought stealing
		would be fun?  You, too, are
		responsible for that death.  Come
		with me.  You don't want to waste
		your life as the wife of some
		bureaucrat.  Denied your talent...
		As a master and disciple we will
		rule.

				JEN
		I'll never live as a thief!

				FOX
		You're already a thief.

				JEN
		That was just for fun.  How can I
		leave?  Where would I go?

				FOX
		Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of
		anyone in our way.  Even your father.

				JEN
		Shut up!

				FOX
		It's the Giang Hu fighter
		lifestyle... kill or be killed.
		Exciting, isn't it?

				JEN
		I owe you nothing.

				FOX
		Yes, you do!  You are still my
		disciple.

Jen lunges at the Governess, and the two exchange a few
blows.  Jen presses her finger against one of the Governess's
pressure points, disabling her.  Jen pushes her across the
room.

				JEN
		You think you've been teaching me
		all these years from the manual?
		You couldn't even decipher the
		symbols!

				FOX
		I studied the diagrams.  But you
		hid the details!

				JEN
		You wouldn't have understood, even
		if I had tried to explain.  You
		know... you've gone as far as you
		can go.  I hid my skills so as not
		to hurt you.

				FOX
		If I hadn't seen you fight with Li
		Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of
		all you've hidden from me.

				JEN
		Master... I started learning from
		you in secret when I was 10.  You
		enchanted me with the world of
		Giang Hu.  But once I realized I
		could surpass you, I became so
		frightened!  Everything fell apart.
		I had no one to guide me, no one to
		learn from.

				FOX
		Believe me, I've a lesson or two
		left to teach you!

Fox exits.

EXT. GOVERNOR YU'S GATE - DAY

The Governess leaves, a small sack over her back.

EXT. TE'S COURTYARD - DAY

Li practices fluently with Green Destiny in hand, beautifully
at ease with the weapon.  He spins around to find Yu standing
in the doorway.

				YU
		The sword is back... are you happy?

Li smiles.

				LI
		I admit, getting it back makes me
		realize how much I'd missed it.

				YU
		But it's not your sword anymore.
		You gave it to Sir Te.

				LI
		True.  But I must borrow it for one
		last mission.  Jade Fox must die at
		its edge.  Did you know what you
		were hiding when you covered for
		that girl?

				YU
		My job was to get the sword back,
		without embarassing anyone.  I
		wasn't about to ruin her life, or
		her father's.

				LI
		You did your job well.  But, this
		girl... I saw her last night.

				YU
		I knew she would intrigue you.

				LI
		She needs direction... and training.

				YU
		She's an aristocrat's daughter.
		She's not one of us.  In any case,
		it will all be over soon.  You'll
		kill Fox, and she'll marry.

				LI
		That's not for her.  She should
		come to Wudan and become a disciple.

				YU
		But Wudan does not accept women.

				LI
		For her, they might make an
		exception.  If not, I'm afraid
		she'll become a poisoned dragon.

				YU
		It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan
		accepts her, her husband might
		object.

				LI
		I thought by giving away the sword,
		I could escape the Giang Hu world.
		But the cycle of bloodshed continues.

				YU
		I wish there were something more I
		could do to help you.

				LI
		Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jen is asleep.  A noise awakens her.

Lo opens the window and sneaks in -- right into the point of
Jen's waiting sword.

Jen's sword drops to the ground.

				JEN
		Lo?

				LO
		Jen!

Lo grabs her by the wrist.

				JEN
		You shouldn't have come.

				LO
		With all the traffic on your
		rooftop these days... it took me a
		while to get in here.  I can't wait
		any longer.  I was wrong to let you
		go.  Come back with me.  You'll be
		happy in the desert.  You'll be
		free there.

Jen turns back to him and rests herself briefly in his arms
again.

				JEN
		You've been looking for me all this
		time?

FLASHBACK: FOUR YEARS EARLIER

INT./EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY

Jen holds up a comb, with daylight shining through it.  Jen
admires the piece, her most prized possession.

Madam Yu sits opposite her.

				MADAM YU
		Jen... stop playing with it.

Jen looks out over the desert, as the wind picks up and the
sky darkens.

				JEN
		I won't break it.

EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY

Lo and a group of armed bandits descend on the caravan.

				GUARD A
		It's Dark Cloud!  Dark Cloud is
		coming!

His warning is useless.  From Jen's pov, we see the guards
slaughtered in a hail of arrows and swords.

				MADAM YU
		Lower the shade, don't let them see
		you!

				DARK CLOUD (LO)
		Don't touch the women!

Though unharmed, Madam Yu immediately faints.  Lo approaches
the carriage and grabs the comb from Jen's hand.

She bolts from the carriage, and, once outside, bends down
and grabs a lance from the body of a dead guard, whose horse
flails beside him.

She looks up to see the gang of bandits already making their
escape on horseback.

				LO
		Let's go!

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Jen and Lo ride across the desert floor at breakneck speed.

				LO
		Come get your comb.

She tries to jab him with the lance, but he grabs it and
flings her off her horse.

				LO
		Hurry back to your mother.

Lo rides on as she charges after her horse.

EXT. DESERT BLUFF - DAY

A group of bandits is dividing up the loot, as Jen rides up,
keeping a respectable distance.  They notice her and rise as
she dismounts.

One of them saunters over to her and stands, grinning, a few
feet away.

In a second, she's slammed his balls into his stomach and
knocked his nose into his face.  He crumples to the sand.

The other bandits stop laughing, quickly exchange glances,
and charge her at once.

In a matter of seconds, they're either on the ground or
dragging their fallen comrades back.

Lo calls out and stops the fight.

				LO
		She's mine.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Lo and Jen ride, if not side-by-side, then parallel, about
20 feet apart.  Their pace has slowed considerably.  In
fact, they're dead tired.

				LO
		Let's stop a moment.

				JEN
		Give it back!

				LO
			(shouting a bit)
		You're tired.  You need rest.  Your
		horse needs water.  There's a creek
		up here.

He dismounts, looks down at the dry creek bed.

				LO
		Well, there used to be!  What's
		your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call
		me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall
		or big, but I'm quick as lightning.

				JEN
		My comb!

She kicks him.  They fight ferociously until Lo, exhausted,
collapses.  She kicks him a few times, then collapses too.

INT. CAVE - DAY

Jen comes to and finds herself wrapped in a blanket of
animal fur.  She sits up with a start and checks her clothes.
Looking around, she realizes she's in a cave.  Next to her
are a lamp, some hunting equipment, and a neat row of sharp
arrows.  She quickly grabs one of the arrows.

				LO
		If you like that arrow, I can make
		you a bow.  Great for hunting wild
		chicken.  They're delicious.

Jen raises one of the arrows, going on the attack again, but
her legs betray her and she falls.

				LO
		You need to eat, understand?  Then
		you'll have the strength to fight.
		Understand?

He helps her up, then pours her some horse milk from a sac.
He hands her a small chunk of food, which she first accepts
grudgingly, then, her hunger getting the better of her, she
starts to wolf it down.

				LO
		You're eating too fast.  Slowly.

EXT. CAVE - DAY

Lo walks out into a barren mountain landscape.  A chicken
roasts over a fire.  Lo whistles.

Jen appears suddenly with a rock and knocks it over his head.
Lo passes out as Jen scurries away.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE AND DESERT - DAY

Jen tries to find her way among the treacherous stony
terrain, her lips chapped and fingers bloody and blistered.
But soon she passes out.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

Jen again awakes inside the cave.  Lo tries to feed her some
water, but she chokes, and tries to push him away, only to
find that her legs and hands are tied up.

				LO
		You've got quite a temper.  It's
		better this way.

				JEN
		You coward!

				LO
		Still in a bad mood?  At least
		you're speaking.  What's your name?

Jen spits at Lo.

				LO
		I didn't think the Hans had names
		like that.

Later: She weaves in and out of consciousness.  In the
flickering lights, she sees Lo sharpening his arrows.

Later, he pulls back an opaque curtain to reveal a makeshift
bathroom -- a water-filled cavity serves as a tub.

He rises as Jen sobs at the sight of her imprisoned and
dishevelled body.  He comes over and unties her.

				LO
		Relax.  If I had wanted to, I would
		already have done it.  You must be
		dying for a bath.  Fresh water's
		hard to get here.  But I managed to
		bring some up.  You can wear my
		clothes when you're done.  They're
		clean.  Don't worry.  I'll sing, so
		you'll know where I am.  After the
		bath, you'll be calmer.

Jen nods and the bandit releases her.  He starts to sing as
he walks out.  Jen waits until the sound recedes before
closing the curtain behind her and dipping into the pit.
While she bathes, she listens to his singing, a loud
rendition of a tribal song.  Lo apparently doesn't remember
all the lyrics, and la-las his way through more than a few
passages.  Jen smiles.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

Jen grimaces as Lo pulls the last of some cactus needles
from the soles of her feet.

				LO
		No more hitting on the head!  All
		this trouble for a comb?

				JEN
		It's mine.  It means a lot to me.
		A barbarian like you wouldn't
		understand.

				LO
		Not true.  I can use it to pick
		fleas from my horse.

				JEN
		By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.

				LO
		I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I
		though you were a Han.

				JEN
		Give me back my comb.

				LO
		I don't take orders from anyone.

				JEN
		Give it back.

Jen impulsively grabs an arrow and stabs Lo, drawing a
little blood from his chest.  Furious, Lo lunges at her and
they tussle briefly.  Finally, Lo gets on top of Jen, and
the scuffling becomes more like foreplay.  Violence turns
into unleashed passion.

EXT. DESERT OASIS - DAY

Lo and Jen ride across the desert.  Jen holds tightly to him.

EXT. CAVE - NIGHT

Lo and Jen lie in the bath together.

				LO
		When I was a boy, one night, I saw
		a thousand shooting stars.  I
		thought, where did they all go?
		I'm an orphan.  I used to look for
		stars alone.  I thought if I rode
		to the other end of the desert, I'd
		find them.  I've been riding in the
		desert ever since.

				JEN
		And so, the little boy became a
		fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find
		the stars, so he stole my comb.

Lo pauses.

				LO
		Out here, you always fight for
		survival.  You have to be part of a
		gang to stand a chance.  Slowly,
		your gang becomes your family.  All
		that Dark Cloud stuff is just to
		scare people and make my life easier.

				JEN
		So you're still that little boy
		looking for shooting stars.

				LO
		I am a man.  And now I've found the
		brightest star of all.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Lo sees uniformed men through his binoculars.

				LO
		Your father's men are looking for
		you.

Jen doesn't respond.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Lo and Jen ride through a mountain pass.

EXT. CLIFF - DAY

Lo and Jen stand at the crest of a cliff.  Lo looks over,
viewing the desert valley below, as Jen joins him.  They see
a troop of uniformed men riding by in the distance.

				LO
		Your father's men are still looking
		for you.  They're still out there,
		circling closer.

				JEN
		Let them look.

				LO
		It is trouble for me.

Jen bites her lip.

				JEN
		Don't send me back!

				LO
		You must decide.  You might get
		tired of this life.  You might
		begin to miss your family.  If it
		were our daughter, we'd look for
		her too.  She would miss us.  Jen...
		I want you to be mine forever.  I
		will make my mark on the world.  I
		will earn your parents' respect.
		We have a legend.  Anyone who dares
		to jump from the mountain, God will
		grant his wish.  Long ago, a young
		man's parents were ill, so he
		jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't
		even hurt.  He floated away, far
		away, never to return.  He knew his
		wish had come true.  If you believe,
		it will happen.  The elders say, "A
		faithful heart makes wishes come
		true."

INT. TENT - DAY

Jen and Lo kiss.  Jen takes the jade comb out of her hair
and presses it into his palm.  Jen starts to cry.  They
embrace.

				JEN
		Keep it safe.  Return it to me when
		we are together again.

				LO
		I will.

				JEN
			(smiling painfully)
		If you don't, I'll come after you.
		And I won't let you off so easy.

EXT. TENT - DAY

Jen quietly walks out and stands sadly in the early morning
light.

End of flashback.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

				LO
		Wherever I went, someone always
		recognized me.  I really tried.
		Later, I heard you came to Peking.
		I was afraid I'd never see you
		again.  So I came.  I can't let you
		marry.

Jen is about to respond when a servant's voice is heard from
outside the door.

				JEN
			(whispering)
		Go.

				LO
		Jen...

				JEN
			(through her tears)
		Don't ever come back.

Lo hovers at the window frame.

				LO
		So it's over?

Jen pauses.

				JEN
		Yes.

Lo thrusts a small object in her hand.

He lifts his legs through the window, and drops out of
sight, just as Jen's door is opened from the hall.

				MAID
		We heard noises.

				JEN
		It was just a cat.

The maid pauses, then dutifully exits, closing the door.

Jen opens up her palm; gasping, she sees the comb that Lo
has given her.

EXT. WEDDING PROCESSION - DAY

The noise and color of a wedding procession.  A marching
band heralds the occasion, as throngs of onlookers fight to
get a glimpse of the groom, Gou Jun Pei, who trots by on a
handsome white horse.

INT. WEDDING CARRIAGE - DAY

Jen's head is completely covered in red cloth, as she rides
silently in the bride's carriage.

EXT. BALCONY OVERLOOKING WEDDING PROCESSION - DAY

Li and Yu watch the festivities from a balcony of the city
gate.

				YU
		You think Jade Fox will show up?

				LI
		She's out there, but I doubt she'll
		show herself.  We'll keep our eyes
		open.  Sooner or later, she'll come
		for the girl.

INT. WEDDING CARRIAGE - DAY

A small arrow flies into the carriage.  Jen calmly lifts the
red cloth from her face and pulls the arrow out of the
panelling inside the carriage.

We hear Lo's voice from outside the carriage, but Jen
doesn't seem to notice.

				LO
			(v.o.)
		Jen!  Come with me!  You're mine!

Lo runs wildly into the crowd.

				LO
		Come with me to the desert!  Jen!
		Come with me to Xin Jiang!

The guards surround Lo, but he escapes.

EXT. BEIJING STREET - DAY

Lo leaps and lands right in front of Li Mu Bai, his fingers
pressed against Lo's neck.  Yu comes running around the
corner and sees them.

				LI
		Where is Jade Fox?

Yu jumps in and pushes Li away.

				YU
			(to Lo)
		Come with me!  Hurry!

INT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Lo sits dejectedly, having told his story to Yu and Li, who
look him over.

				YU
			(to Lo)
		You thought she'd give it all up
		and go back West with you?

				LO
		She's mine.

				LI
		Either way, you are no good to her
		dead.  With the Gou and Yu clans
		hunting you, you'll soon be in
		their hands.

				LO
		I don't care anymore.

				LI
		If you truly loved her, you wouldn't
		say that.

				YU
		Don't you want to see her again.

				LI
		All right.  I'll write you an
		introduction.  Take it to Wudan.
		Wait there for news from me.

				LO
		All right.

EXT. TE COMPOUND - NIGHT

Yu and Li enter, as other men and women race through the
compound, a sense of panic in the air.  Yu gives Li a look.
Li shrugs.

INT. TE'S HALL - NIGHT

A crowd, including Li and Yu, stand by as Te opens the empty
sword case, his voice rising.

				SIR TE
		When will this end?  They take it,
		they put it back, they take it
		again.  My home is turning into a
		warehouse.

Bo bursts into the hall, bows to Te.

				TE
		Speak!

				BO
		Jen has run away!  Gou found the
		wedding chamber empty.  Governor Yu
		requests your assistance.  You know
		the Giang Hu underworld.  He wants
		to find her, and keep her from harm.

				LI
		Sir Te, leave this to us.  Don't
		worry.

INT. TEA STALL - DAY

Jen arrives at the tea stall.  She places her sword on the
table, which catches the attention of a couple of Giang Hu
martial arts characters sitting nearby.

				WAITRESS
		What can I serve you?

As the waitress turns to leave, Jen grabs her by the arm.

				JEN
		The cup is dirty.

The flustered waitress apologizes and takes the cup away.
The men approach Jen.

				GANGSTER A
		Hello.  What is your name?

				JEN
			(without lifting her eyes)
		Long.

				GANGSTER B
		It's young Master Long.  My
		apologies.  I'm Iron Eagle Sung and
		this is my brother in arms, Flying
		Cougar Li Yun.  What brings you to
		Huai An, and where are you headed,
		Master Long?

				JEN
		Anywhere there's action.

The two men exchange glances.

				GANGSTER A
		In that case, perhaps we could be
		of assistance.

				JEN
		Don't bother.

				GANGSTER A
		You don't seem to understand.

				JEN
		So what if I don't?

				GANGSTER B
		We have ways of helping you
		understand.

The two pull out their weapons which are immediately chopped
into scraps by Jen.

				GANGSTER A
			(stunned)
		Are you related to Li Mu Bai?

				JEN
		He is my defeated foe!

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Li and Yu pass a cup back and forth as Bo tends to the
horses in the background.

				YU
		Have some tea.

As Yu passes the cup to Li, their fingers touch.
Embarrassed, Li pulls back.

				LI
		Shu Lien... The things we touch
		have no permanence.  My master
		would say... there is nothing we
		can hold on to in this world.  Only
		by letting go can we truly possess
		what is real.

				YU
		Not everything is an illusion.  My
		hand... wasn't that real?

				LI
		Your hand, rough and callused from
		machete practice... All this time,
		I've never had the courage to touch
		it.

Li takes Yu's hand and presses it to his face.

				LI
		Giang Hu is a world of tigers and
		dragons, full of corruption... I
		tried sincerely to give it up but I
		have brought us only trouble.

				YU
		To repress one's feelings only
		makes them stronger.

				LI
		You're right, but I don't know what
		to do.  I want to be with you...
		just like this.  It gives me a
		sense of peace.

Li Mu Bai smiles.

INT. STAR RESTAURANT - DAY

Jen walks upstairs.  A waiter greets her.

				WAITER
		Please follow me.

				JEN
		I want a clean room.

				WAITER
		We have plenty.  Your order?

Jen again sets her sword on the table as she sits down.

				JEN
		Steamed whole cod, bite-size
		meatballs, a little starchy, but
		keep the sauce light, shark fin
		soup, mixed vegetables, and some
		warm wine.

				WAITER
			(dazed)
		I have to order from a bigger
		restaurant.

				JEN
		Hurry then.

The waiter gauges Jen for an instant before bouncing off to
place the orders.  Jen checks her pouch and sees there's not
much money left.

A large group of Giang Hu characters enters.  They survey
the restaurant and quickly find Jen upstairs.

				GIANG HU A
		That's him.

				MI BIAO
		I am Iron Arm Mi.  I heard a true
		master has arrived.  I have come to
		seek a lesson.

Jen ignores him.

				MI BIAO
			(bristles)
		You asked for it!

Mi charges and attacks Jen, who is still sitting sipping tea.
Jen barely lifts a finger and disposes of Mi with a poke at
a sensitive pressure point.  This provokes a reaction from
the other men.

				JEN
		What kind of Iron Arm are you?

				FLYING MACHETE CHANG
		You have amazing technique!  I am
		Flying Machete.  Are you related to
		Southern Crane?

				JEN
		Southern Duck?  I don't eat anything
		with two feet.  Who could remember
		such long-winded names?

				GOU JUN SIHUNG
		Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe, and
		you don't know his master, Southern
		Crane?

				JEN
		Who are you?

				GOU JUN SIHUNG
		I'm Shining Phoenix Mountain Gou.

				JEN
			(furious)
		Gou?  I hate that name.  It makes
		me puke!  Too bad you're named Gou.
		You'll be the first to feel my
		sword today.

Jen leaps up and dives into battle.  The men all use
different kinds of weapons, but they all succumb to the
powerful Green Destiny.

				MONK JING
		Hold it!  Don't you know Monk Jing?

				JEN
		A monk, in a place like this?  You
		need a lesson!

				MONK JING
		Who are you?

She smiles, and leaps again into action after unsheathing
the Green Destiny.

				JEN
		Who am I?  I am... I am the
		Invincible Sword Goddess.  Armed
		with the Incredible... Green
		Destiny.  Be you Li or Southern
		Crane... lower your head... and ask
		for mercy.  I am the desert dragon.
		I leave no trace.  Today I fly over
		Eu-Mei.  Tomorrow... I'll kick over
		Wudan Mountain!

Jen is in a frenzy, slashing and maiming as she speaks.

INT. STAR RESTAURANT - DAY

Yu and Li are surrounded by the variously bandaged men who
battled with Jen.

				FLYING MACHETE CHANG
		We politely asked for a friendly
		match, but she showed no respect,
		and attacked us.  Everyone came by
		to teach her a lesson.

				MI BIAO
		Her sword was just too powerful.

				MONK JING
		I've traveled everywhere, but never
		met anyone so uncivilized.

				SHINING PHOENIX MOUNTAIN GOD
			(heavily bandaged)
		She kept accusing me of being Gou
		Jun Pei's brother.  Who is this
		Gou, anyway?

				YU
		Her husband.

The men all nod their heads.

EXT. OUTSIDE HWAI AN - DAY

Li and Yu ride together.

				LI
			(to Yu)
		We're close to your headquarters.
		Go home and check in.

				YU
		What about you?

				LI
		I'll look around and catch up later.

				YU
		Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get
		a good night's sleep at headquarters.

Yu takes a fork off the road.  Thunder can be heard in the
darkening sky.

EXT. SUN COMPOUND - DAY

A group of security men are practicing Kung Fu in the front
yard of Sun Security.  They stop when Yu enters.

				SECURITY MAN A
		Mistress, you're back.

				YU
		It's you!  How's everything here?

				CAPTAIN
		Fine.  You've been gone a while.

				YU
		Yes, and I leave again tomorrow.
		Your wife was due?

				AH WAI
		Yeah, a baby girl.

				YU
		Good!

				AH WAI
		I'll be happy if she's half as
		strong as you.

				YU
		Mrs. Wu...

				AUNT WU
		You're back!

				YU
		How's the arm?  Still sore?

				AUNT WU
		Much better.  You've been gone so
		long.

				YU
		Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the
		night.

				AUNT WU
			(excited)
		I'll go and make up his room!

Aunt Wu hustles out.  Yu goes into her own room.

INT. HALL OF ANCESTRAL WORSHIP

Yu lights incense for her former fiancé Meng.  Hearing
something, she turns to see a dishevelled Jen standing
outside downstairs.

				JEN
		Sister Shu Lien...

INT. YU'S ROOM - DAY

Yu eases her guard, then opens a drawer, and takes out some
clothes.  Jen, wearing just white underclothing, sets
herself on the edge of Yu's bed.  Yu brings over the clothes.

				YU
		Here you must be in proper attire.

				JEN
		I'm just borrowing some clean
		clothes.  I'm not staying.

				YU
		I'll give them to you.

				JEN
		I was just passing by and wondered
		how you were.

Jen tries to hide her anxiety but finally breaks down on
Yu's shoulder in tears.

				JEN
		You, sister...

				YU
		Look at the trouble you've caused.
		Now you know what Giang Hu life is
		really like.  If you think of me as
		your sister, let me give you some
		sisterly advice.  You can run from
		marriage, but not your parents.

				JEN
		They forced me to marry!

				YU
		Go back to them first.  Then you
		can decide about Lo.

				JEN
		You know about Lo?

				YU
		He really loves you.  Come back to
		Peking with me.  We'll find a
		solution.

				JEN
		Where is he now?

				YU
		Li Mu Bai has made arrangements.
		He sent him to Wudan Mountain.

				JEN
		You're working together to set me
		up!  I'm leaving!

				YU
		How dare you accuse us?  I always
		knew you had stolen the sword!
		I've done nothing but protect you
		and your family.  And you're repaid
		me with nothing but contempt.  Li
		Mu Bai himself spared you, and all
		you do is insult him.  We wanted
		some peace and you've ruined it all!
		You're no sister of mine!

				JEN
		What do I care?  You were never a
		real friend anyway.  But I wonder,
		how long could you last as my enemy?

Jen gets up to leave.  Yu intercepts her.

				YU
		Put the sword down!

Jen jumps out.

INT. YUAN COURTYARD - DAY

Jen soars out to the front courtyard where the guards are
still practicing.

They raise their weapons at the sight of an intruder.

				YU
			(calling out)
		Jen!

Jen greets Yu with the Green Destiny.

				YU
		Everyone out.  Shut the doors.

The men leave.

				YU
		Fine... the friendship is over.

Yu scoops up a weapon from one of many lying around and
begins her battle with Jen.

Yu uses every weapon that's available against Jen but none
are any match for the Green Destiny.

After slicing through another set of Yu's weapons, Jen looks
admiringly at the Green Destiny in her hands.

				YU
		Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's
		sword.

				JEN
		Come and get it if you can.

				YU
		Without the Green Destiny, you are
		nothing.

				JEN
		Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead.
		Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go
		ahead.

Yu picks up a huge broad sword and attacks.  Just as the
Green Destiny slices it in half, Yu holds the broken blade
at Jen's neck.  She pauses before hurting Jen, then pulls
back.

				YU
		Give me the sword.

Jen, taking advantage of Yu's trust, slices her arm.

				JEN
		Take it!

Yu, her shoulder bleeding, falls back as Li Mu Bai jumps in.

				LI
			(enraged)
		Stop it!  You don't deserve the
		Green Destiny.

				JEN
		Not another lecture!  On guard!

				LI
		Let's end this here.

				JEN
		Only the sword will settle this.

Jen soars up to the rooftop, with Li right on her tail.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

Jen floats over the lake, Li close behind.

EXT. BAMBOO FOREST - DAY

Jen runs into a sea of bamboo.  She appears to have lost Li
but is not slowing down.  Her white clothes are now stained
with blood and mud.  The wind had picked up and every breeze
sounds like an air attack by Li.

The two leap onto the tips of the bamboo trees and begin
their dances and dodges.  They glance off bamboos and each
other while staying afloat.  Finally Jen lands on the same
stick of bamboo as Li.  The two hold their positions for a
while, as the bamboo bends.

				LI
		I only let you go because I wanted
		to see the real you.

Jen tries to shake Li off the bamboo but Li recovers nicely.

				JEN
		What do you know about a true heart?

Li suddenly leaps off the bamboo tree.  The bamboo
straightens up and throws Jen toward the ground.  Jen
quickly pulls herself up and charges at Li.

Jen chases after Li, into a clearing, out of the bamboo
forest.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

Jen finally catches up to Li, who is standing on a rock
about a few feet wide amid the rapids.  Jen vaults onto the
rock and scuffles with Li.  Jen loses her balance.

				JEN
		What do you want?

				LI
		What I've always wanted, to teach
		you.

				JEN
		All right.  If you can take back
		the sword in three moves, I'll go
		with you.

Li takes the sword back.

				JEN
		Give it back!

				LI
		Kneel!

				JEN
		Never!

				LI
		Then you have no use for the sword.

Li throws the sword into the rapids.

Jen dives in to retrieve it.  He follows Jen downstream by
hopping from one rock to another.  Jen recovers the sword
but is herself drowning.  Suddenly Jade Fox swings into the
rapids and fishes Jen out.  Jade Fox carries the unconscious
Jen away.  Li gives chase, but loses them.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

It's raining.  Inside an old factory, Fox heats some medicine
paste and then dips a needle in the paste.  She burns the
needle point, causing a blue smoke.  She lights some incense
and puts it in a burner near Jen, who is barely conscious.

				FOX
		Sooner or later, they'd drag you
		back to Peking.  Your parents will
		never accept you again.  But why go
		home?  We've gone this far, we
		won't stop now.  You'll always be
		my lady.  At last, we'll be our own
		masters.  We'll be happy.  That's
		the most important thing.  All we
		have left is each other, right?
		Lie down and rest.

Jen is too weak to respond.

Fox leaves Jen clutching the Green Destiny.

EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Fox scurries ahead in the rain.  Her eyes catch something,
but she keeps moving.

INT. YUAN COMPOUND - DAY

Aunt Wu finishes bandaging Yu.

				AUNT WU
		She's crazy.  You should have
		killed her.

				YU
		I didn't have the heart.

				AUNT WU
		Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.

Yu senses movement at the window.  Looking out, she sees
Jade Fox in the distance.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Jen wakes up, flushed from fever.  She takes a sip from a
cup of water -- it's empty.  She tosses the cup, gets up,
and walks into the rain.

EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Jen walks out, raises her face into the rain, and drinks the
raindrops.  Thirst quenched, she turns around and finds Li
standing there.  Jen limps towards him while mumbling.

				JEN
		Is it me or the sword you want?

Jen falls into Li, who checks her pulse and looks at her eyes.

				LI
		You've been drugged!

Li carries her inside, kicking away the incense burner.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Li lays his hands on Jen's back; she slowly comes to.

				LI
		Where is Jade Fox?

Jen gestures that she doesn't know.  Yu and Bo enter.  Yu
looks at Jen.

				YU
		What happened?

				LI
		Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you
		get here?

				YU
		We followed Jade Fox.

Instantaneously, a flurry of darts flies directly in Jen's
direction.  Li and Yu swipe miraculously at them all,
sending them flinging hither and thither.

Fox shows herself.  Li attacks her.  She falls back, bleeding
to death.

				LI
		And so you die.

Li touches his neck.

				FOX
		And so shall you!

Li pulls a single needle from his neck.

				YU
		A poisoned needle!

				FOX
		You deserve to die, but the life I
		was hoping to take... was Jen's.
		Ten years I devoted to you.  But
		you deceived me!  You hid the
		manual's true meaning.  I never
		improved... but your progress was
		limitless!  You know what poison is?
		An eight-year-old girl, full of
		deceit.  That's poison!  Jen!  My
		only family... my only enemy...

Jade Fox dies.

				YU
		You can't die!  Tell us what poison
		you used!  You can't die!  Tell us
		the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu
		Bai die!

				JEN
		She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin
		poison.  It goes straight to the
		heart.

				LI
		My blood will soon reverse its flow.
		It's the same poison she used to
		kill my master.  There is no
		antidote.

				YU
		That can't be!  Everything has an
		antithesis!  Why not this?

				JEN
		The antidote exists.  She taught it
		to me.  The formula is simple, but
		it takes time to prepare.  Trust me.
		As you have helped me, let me help
		you.

				LI
		All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on
		as long as I can.

				YU
			(takes the comb from
			her hair)
		Take my horse and go to the compound.
		Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help
		you.  Hurry!

				JEN
		Spare your energy.  I'll be back!

EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

Bo is burying Fox in the rain.

EXT. YUAN COMPOUND - NIGHT

The guards surround Jen.  She pushes past them.

				JEN
		Where is Mrs. Wu?

Aunt Wu comes running out.

				AUNT WU
		Stop it!

Jen pulls out Yu's comb.

				JEN
		Shu Lien told me to show you this.

				AUNT WU
		Let her in.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

Yu sits across from Li, whose pose is almost meditational,
eerily calm.

				YU
		Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some
		hope...

				LI
		Shu Lien...

				YU
		Save your strength.

				LI
		My life is departing.  I've only
		one breath left.

				YU
		Use it to meditate.  Free yourself
		from this world as you have been
		taught.  Let your soul rise to
		eternity with your last breath.  Do
		not waste it... for me.

				LI
		I've already wasted my whole life.
		I want to tell you with my last
		breath... I have always loved you.
		I would rather be a ghost, drifting
		by your side... as a condemned
		soul... than enter heaven without
		you.  Because of your love... I
		will never be a lonely spirit.

Yu cries.

She kisses him lightly.  He closes his eyes.

EXT. PATH - DAY

As the sun rises, Jen rides speedily, clutching the medicine
in her hands.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Li is in Yu's arms.  They're holding hands.  The sun shines
in.  Yu slowly releases Li's stiff fingers -- he is dead.

Jen is at the door.

				JEN
		He's gone?

Bo peeks over Jen's shoulder.

Yu rises and picks up Green Destiny.  Jen kneels.  Yu raises
the sword, but doesn't kill her.

				YU
		Bo... please take this sword back
		to Sir Te.

He takes the sword from her.

				YU
			(to Jen)
		Now you must go to Wudan Mountain.
		Lo awaits you there.  Promise me
		one thing, whatever path you take
		in this life... be true to yourself.

EXT. WU TAN TEMPLE - DAY

Jen climbs up toward the temple, finally reaching the temple
gate, and sees Lo standing there.

He runs to her.  She greets him.

INT. WU TAN TEMPLE - MAGIC

Jen and Lo make love.

INT. WU TAN TEMPLE - DAY

Lo wakes up to find the jade comb on the pillow beside him,
Jen gone.

EXT. WU TAN MOUNTAIN - DAY

Lo catches up to Jen, who stands on a bridge.  The gorges
below are shrouded in clouds.  She looks back at him.

				JEN
		Do you remember the legend of the
		young man?

				LO
		"A faithful heart makes wishes come
		true."

				JEN
		Make a wish, Lo.

Lo pauses.

				LO
			(closing his eyes)
		To be back in the desert, together
		again.

Jen smiles, turns, and leaps into the clouds.  They seem to
catch her gently, before she disappears into them.

Lo remains standing, a smile on his face, tears rolling down
his cheeks.

THE END.

               The Crow : SALVATION

               By

               Chip Johannessen



               OVER BLACKNESS.

               Silence. Broken by the faint clink of precision tools.
               Accurately, patiently wielded.

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DIMNESS

               X-CLOSE. A SCALPEL returned to its place in a neat array
               of TAXIDERMY TOOLS. Long surgical TWEEZERS taken. A steady
               HAND grasps a CLAY BIRD FORM. Then sets the second eye.
               Unhurried. Meticulous.

               A MYSTERY MAN, features obscured, sets the tweezers aside,
               reaches for a black lump on the table, revealed to be shiny
               feathers as he wraps it around the form. Adjusts it so the
               glass eyes peer out through holes in the skin of this large
               CROW. A taxidermy specimen.

               WIDE, the man works across the room under the pooled light
               of a draftsman's lamp, the Crow on the table in front of
               him. His identity yet to discover.

                                                          SLOW FADE OUT.

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               X-WIDE. "THE WALLS" like a medieval castle above a throng
               of PROTESTERS and GAWKERS. A POSTCARD at first, then signs
               of movement--handheld placards and flickering candles
               telegraph an imminent execution.

               The group shifts amoeba like as... A LARGE MERCEDES
               approaches, slowly works its way into the edge of the crowd.

               INSIDE THE BENZ NATHAN RANDALL, father of the victim
               comforts ERIN RANDALL, seventeen year old sister, as she
               looks up in terror at the bodies pressed against the car,
               the throng between the car and the prison entrance. The
               car stops.

                                     ERIN
                         Why are there so many?

                                     RANDALL
                         Just hold on to me.

               THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD--a Protestor's poster visible.
               "Remember the Victim." With a picture of LAUREN RANDALL,
               the deceased, who bears a striking resemblance to surviving
               sister Erin. And another sign--"Happy Birthday Alex."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       2.


                                     ERIN
                         It's because they're doing this on
                         his birthday.

               She takes a deep breath, they get out of the car and...

               WITH THE RANDALLS as they make their way through the throng
               toward a special entrance marked "WITNESSES," nearly within
               reach when WHOMP.

               Erin shields her face as a BRIGHT LIGHT comes on. OVER TV
               REPORTER BARBARA GONZALEZ Action Newsteam addressing the
               Nathans. Speaking into a mic.

                                     GONZALEZ
                         Mr. Randall. Sir. Do you think
                         this execution will bring you a
                         sense of closure?

               Nathan pushes past Gonzalez, taking Erin's hand.

                                     GONZALEZ (CONT'D)
                         Erin. Your sister...

                         Leave us alone!

               The Reporter TURNS to the camera, not missing a beat.

                                     GONZALEZ
                         A difficult time for everyone
                         involved.
                              (then)
                         Interesting fact. It will take
                         about twenty-one cents of
                         electricity to execute Alex Corvis
                         tonight on this, his twenty-first
                         birthday.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW - NIGHT

               CLOSE on a BIRTHDAY CAKE, twenty one candles flickering as
               it makes its way past deathrow cells, held waiter style on
               one hand by MERCER, a MUSTACHED prison GUARD.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

               CLANG. The barred door opens and the cake swoops in, landing
               on a small table next to a CHESS GAME in progress and an
               untouched last meal. ADJUST to find...

               ALEX CORVIS. Twenty-One today. Disarmingly appealing.
               Peaceful. Simple clothes. He looks up from the game, at...

               PETER WALSH, Alex's pro-bono attorney and only friend,
               trying not to explode at this shit-eating stunt.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       3.


                                     WALSH
                         He didn't order that.

                                     MERCER
                         We found the man with the scar.

               Despite himself, Alex looks up. Mercer gestures at... THE
               CAKE in the middle of the candles, an arm made of frosting
               with a large ZIGZAG marking on the forearm, also frosting.

               FAVORING ALEX looking from the cake up to Mercer, who nods
               at the candles.

                                     MERCER (CONT'D)
                         Go ahead. Make a wish.

                                     WALSH
                              (intense whisper)
                         Get it out of here.

               Alex focusses on the chess board. Tries to anyway.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - NIGHT

               FLASH. The harsh Newsteam video light WHUMPS on,
               illuminating a WRINKLED OLD WOMAN.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Yes, I've come to a lot of these
                         over the years, but this one has
                         many unique aspects. Youth of the
                         condemned. That's unusual. Fifty
                         three stab wounds. Kind of a record.

                                     GONZALEZ'S VOICE
                         And Corvis still maintaining his
                         innocence.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, they all say that.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               FLASH. A nervous, not to say shifty looking THOMAS "TOMMY"
               LEONARD, thirty five year old key witness in the trial,
               talks to Gonzalez under the hot video light.

                                     TOMMY
                         I don't fault him saying I lied on
                         the stand. Facing the chair, you
                         do what you gotta do. But I saw
                         those two fighting that night.

               Tommy shifts uncomfortably, silent as we HOLD a long beat.

                                                                       4.


                                     TOMMY (CONT'D)
                         I didn't lie.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

               CLOSE. A Chess piece, a CASTLE, shoved at CAMERA. ADJUST
               to INCLUDE ALEX.

               He breathes deliberately, trying to hold it together. His
               hand shakes as he removes it from the piece.

                                     WALSH
                         You ok?

               Alex gets up, crosses to a small ledge on the other side
               of the cell that holds a few books and pictures. He finds...

               A PICTURE OF LAUREN AND ALEX In a grove of tall trees. A
               self-portrait by autotimer. Arms around each other. Her
               head on his shoulder. Happy.

               RESUME Alex staring at the photo, taped to the wall.

                                     ALEX
                         What's been holding me together is
                         the hope that maybe you do go
                         someplace. And I'll be seeing her
                         again soon. Only what will I say?
                         That I was too stupid to find the
                         guy who killed her? That he's down
                         here laughing?

                                     WALSH
                         Tell her... we'll get him.

                                     ALEX
                         We won't.

                                     WALSH
                         Someday he'll surface and I'll get
                         him for both of you. I promise.
                         I'll find the guy with the scar.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               FLASH. Four UNIFORMED COPS--DUTTON, ERLICH, LARKIN and
               TOOMEY--in the harsh news light.

               Erlich holds a CANE in one hand. Larkin and Toomey are
               twosie monkeys, smoking cigarettes with eerie simultaneity.

                                     ERLICH
                         This mystery man with the scar...
                              (indicates forearm)
                         ...the zigzag, whatever.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       5.


               Erlich gives a long-suffering look. Like it's preposterous.
               But he's too gentlemanly to say it.

                                     ERLICH (CONT'D)
                         We couldn't find him. And,
                         obviously, the jury didn't buy it.

                                     GONZALEZ
                         Some people here seem to.

                                     DUTTON
                         People here are protesting the
                         execution of a kid just turning
                         twenty-one. A kid who had a tough
                         life. No parents, no dough. Always
                         had to fight for everything. It's
                         a tragedy, it really is. But I
                         don't see a single sign telling me
                         Alex Corvis is innocent.

               Look around. He's right.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

               Alex still gazing at the picture of Lauren. At the board,
               Walsh moves a piece.

                                     MERCER
                         I was facing the hot seat, I'd
                         want my attorney banging down the
                         door of the Supreme Court, not
                         playing board games. But maybe
                         that's just me.

               They look up as Mercer appears outside the barred door to
               the cell, starts to unlock it.

                                     WALSH
                         Your move.

                                     MERCER
                         No. It's time.

               It really is. Other prison personnel arrive outside the
               cell in various uniforms:

               A MINISTER with clerical collar, the WARDEN, two GUARDS.
               Waiting. Walsh crosses, very emotional how. Gives Alex a
               huge hug.

                                     ALEX
                         I don't want you to watch. I don't
                         want to give them the pleasure.

               The two friends exchange a long last look.

                                     MERCER
                         Ok. C'mon now...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       6.


               As Alex exits past Mercer, Walsh sits down on the cot.
               He's hard to read a second until he lashes out, flips...

               THE CAKE against the wall where it hits, slides down, still
               semi-intact as it hits the floor.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW

               Dead Man Walking. A mini parade past the cells of the
               condemned. One guard flanks Alex, another follows. The
               Warden and Minister out in front.

               HANDS extend from the other cells as Alex passes. Unable
               to touch, but he reaches for them, a gesture of solidarity.
               Mercer catches up with the group, flanking Alex cell-side.
               Alex drops his hand, cut off even from that.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW #2 - NIGHT

               The parade continues down another hallway.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATH CHAMBER - NIGHT

               The CHAIR, an atavism, sits alone a moment before the
               entourage enters and begins a surprisingly well
               choreographed last dance.

               The Warden gestures, and Alex is escorted to his place in
               the chair. The Guards move in, death attendants now.

                                     MINISTER
                         The Lord is my shepherd, I shall
                         not want...

               THE MINISTER CONTINUES as...

               CLOSE. Handstraps tightened. WHOP. WHOP. Alex squirms
               despite his resolve. Through an act of will, calms himself.
               Looks up at...

               THE PHONE. On the wall. A last possibility of reprise.

               CLOSE. Trouser legs slit. Footstraps tightened around bare
               ankles. Electrodes checked.

               CLOSE. Chest strap tightened. Yanked again for good measure.
               ALEX gasps. It's hard to breathe now with the strap tight
               across his chest.

               CLOSE. Copper mesh. Pieces of sponge jerry-sewn onto it,
               the irregular stitching giving it an unsettling natural
               appearance.

               ADJUST to REVEAL this is the electrode in the odd leather
               HELMET tightened now on Alex's head.

               THE EXECUTIONER. Pulls a hood over his own obscured face.
               Moves behind a half curtain at the side of the room.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       7.


                                     MINISTER (CONT'D)
                              (concluding)
                         ... and I will dwell in the house
                         of the Lord. Forever.

               SLAP. The Minister shuts his bible. WIDER. Some weird sin.
               Alex strapped into the chair, unable to move.

               The guards exit, jobs done. The Warden nots and...

               ALEX'S POV - THROUGH PLEXI - THE OBSERVATION ROOM REVEALED
               as the CURTAINS OPEN.

               Two dozen observers crammed into a space the width of a
               singlewide trailer. Erin. Her father. The Cops. Tommy
               Leonard. Gonzalez and other media types. Prison personnel.
               Every seat occupied. Sweaty and surreal. All looking at
               him. IN THE DEATH CHAMBER The Warden steps forward.

                                     WARDEN
                         Alexander Frederick Corvis. Do you
                         have any last words?

               A thick silence. Alex looks unprepared, uneasy as he scans
               a sea of hostile faces, settling on Erin and her dad.

                                     ALEX
                         I loved Lauren. I still do. I'm
                         innocent.

               Erin shakes her head, disgusted. Looks away.

               ALEX'S POV - THE LAST SECONDS OF HIS LIFE SLOWING in his
               inner perception, movement ramping down as Alex scans the
               disbelieving faces.

               The Phone. Silent. No reprise. The Observation Room witness
               door opens. A Guard in the back row deferentially offers
               his seat to the NEW ARRIVAL, a man in dark clothes, his
               face obscured by REFLECTIONS in the plexiglass. As he
               UNBUTTONS his shirt cuff...

               The warden steps to the side of the room, nods to the
               executioner who lifts a COVER off a large switch.

               The New Arrival pulls his shirtsleeve back over his forearm,
               exposing a scar for Alex, THE SCAR, an odd zigzag pattern
               of raised welts, a pattern deliberately formed of skin.

               The Executioner throws the switch. ON ALEX SHAKING violently
               as he fights to stay alive, time extremely subjective now
               as he chokes out...

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                              (indistinct, filtered)
                         Murderer!

               The word bubbles up as if from underwater, audible only to
               Alex. Alex wrenches his head, a superhuman act of will
               trying to ID the Scar Man through the reflections.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       8.


               THE HELMET starts to smoke. Then a burst of FLAME at Alex's
               head.

               A BOTCHED EXECUTION made worse by Alex's struggle to see,
               to stay alive.

               IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM The observers panic, horrified.
               Only the Scar Man calm as he covers his arm, rebuttons his
               shirt. Face always obscured.

               IN THE DEATH CHAMBER Alex in electro-spasm, smoke filling
               the room, the warden in real time now as he runs to pull
               the curtain closed.

               It JAMS partway across. ALEX expires in the char,
               grotesquely burned, EYES OPEN as the Warden finally yanks
               the curtain closed.

               IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM The Scar Man slips out, but the
               rest remain, transfixed, horrified. Erin and others in
               tears. HOLD a long beat, their GASPS faintly audible.
               Then...

                                     MERCER
                         Cruel, who's to say, but it sure
                         was unusual.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Two guards push a gurney down a reverberant hallway far
               from the in-your-face security of deathrow.

                                     GUARD ONE
                         Look at this. Goddamn helmet melted
                         down.

                                     MERCER
                         That, my friend, is a deterrent.

               They WIPE past, Alex's charred remains visible a moment,
               parts of the helmet fused on his face and head, his body
               convulsed in a pugilistic attitude.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE - NIGHT

               The guards swing the gurney to a stop by a steel locker,
               one of several. Mercer opens the locker door. The
               unceremoniously slide the body into the locker and...

               BANG. The body hits the open door. Convulsed as it is, the
               body won't really fit through the door.

                                     MERCER
                         Whoops.

               CRUNCH. The sound of something breaking as the SHOVE Alex
               into the cubby hole.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       9.


                                     GUARD ONE
                         Why do they even autopsy these
                         guys? Cause of death is pretty
                         fucking obvious.

               FROM INSIDE THE LOCKER. The door slams shut.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

               CLOSE on the PICTURE of Alex and Lauren.

               ADJUST to include Walsh, looking at it. Pained. Still trying
               to understand. He secures it to the lid of the case already
               containing the neatly packed chess set. Closes it. Bows
               his head.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - NIGHT

               The protestors are gone, as is the Newsteam, but the four
               Cops are still there, Larkin and Toomey synchro-smoking.

               They look up as the Randalls emerge shaken from the Witness
               entrance.

               FAVORING NATHAN RANDALL He speaks softly to Erin, who's
               leaning against him.

                                     RANDALL
                              (to Erin)
                         I'll meet you atthe car, honey.

               She continues on and Randall crosses to the cops, who wait
               patiently to see what he'll say. Finally...

                                     DUTTON
                         We all wish this had ended better.
                         Sir.

               Randall nods. Like that's all anyone could say. As he walks
               off the Cops fall into easy chatter. CUT TO:

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DIMNESS

               CLOSE. A face slides into frame in PROFILE, too tight to
               be recognizable.

               Just an eye, peering...

               EYE'S POV - THROUGH A MAGNIFYING GLASS A coarse ZIGZAG
               stitch shaped like the Scar runs the length of the Crow's
               underbelly. The end stitch now tied with a tiny knot.

               Tightened just so. THE MYSTERY MAN features obscured still,
               grabs a bent surgical SCISSORS, snips the excess thread.
               Smoothes black feathers into place, hiding the stitching
               on...

               THE CROW Finished. The Man gets up, leaves.

               CAMERA PUSHING on the Bird's head as we HEAR a door shut,
               still PUSHING on the glass eye that BLINKS now.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE - NIGHT

               INSIDE THE LOCKER. A human EYE BLINKS. Barely visible in
               the darkness. Alex KICKS with a YELL and...

               IN THE MORGUE.  The locker door flies open and Alex spills
               onto the floor. Gropes a few seconds on hands and knees
               before a SHADOW passes over him evoking a primitive
               response. He cowers, looks up at...

               A LARGE CROW flutters through the bars of a high window,
               lands near him on the floor. It looks at him, then flaps
               its way up to the autopsy countertop, cocks its head. Follow
               me.

               ALEX strains to pull himself up on the gurney that brought
               him here.

               HIS POV as he slowly rises above the gurney--the Crow in
               front of a mirror over the splash sink. It flies off,
               revealing Alex's reflection. Charred. Hideous.

               ALEX drops back to the floor with a SCREAM. Turns, sees
               himself in a stainless door and SMASHES it with his fist...

               THE BASHED STAINLESS DOOR the word "MORGUE," painted on
               the wall behind Alex, brought into focus at the center of
               the concavity. ALEX thrashes, trying to avoid his
               reflection, but the dim mirrors have him surrounded.

               THE CROW flaps down, crazed too, as if in empathy. CAWING
               loudly, finally getting Alex's attention. ALEX settles,
               hazards another look at his reflection in stainless steel.

               His body looks less misshapen now. He looks at his arms,
               hands, no longer burned. Pulls himself up on the gurney
               again, cautiously.

               OVER ALEX as he slowly rises above the gurney a second
               time, looks in the mirror. His body miraculously HEALED,
               covered by shredded clothing.

               His face obscured by the meltdown helmet. He slowly
               approaches the mirror on unsteady feet.

                                     ALEX
                              (to his own
                              reflection)
                         What happened?

               Alex starts to tear away the helmet and gets a first
               frightening FLASH as his fingers touch it...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      11.


               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV - FLASHBACK A blitz return to his own
               execution. The copper screen, the helmet lowered into place.
               Electro-spasm. The faintest glimpse of a jagged scar seen
               darkly.

               RESUME -ALEX clutching the helmet on his head, ripping it
               off in one painful OVERCRANKED movement and...

               OVER ALEX, IN THE MIRROR It's Alex, and yet not. His face
               marked with the Crow MASK, jagged WARPAINT where the melted
               helmet ran down his face. An indelible reminder of the
               botched execution. he stares at himself for a couple of
               deep breaths. Then WHAM! Shatters the mirror with a martial
               punch.

               THE FRACTURED MIRROR Alex's mask reflected in shards as
               his busy hands remove certain pieces of broken glass. His
               purpose unclear.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE HALLWAY - NIGHT

               The Crow hops out into the hallway, flies toward us, lands
               with a CAW as Alex enters the hallway, framed against hight
               walls. His tentative movements growing more assured.

                                     ALEX
                         Follow the leader.

               The Crow flies off and Alex follows, to... A DOOR marked
               "No Unauthorized Entry." As they pass through...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - SECURITY BOOTH - NIGHT

               CLOSE on a MONITOR, a SCHEMATIC MAP of the prison. A small
               red light FLASHES. The GUARD keys a communications radio.

                                     RADIO GUARD
                         We've got unauthorized movement in

               WITH the LEGS of a Guard walking quickly. REVEAL Mercer.
               His RADIO crackling.

                                     MERCER
                              (into radio)
                         Mercer. I'm on it.

               He passes through the "No Unauthorized Entry" door into...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - "B-5" HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Empty. Bars at the far end spell seriously secure territory.
               Mercer moves cautiously up the empty hallway, stops as...
               The Crow hops out from a side hallway. Drawing him on.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      12.


                                     MERCER
                              (into radio)
                         Found our intruder. It's got a
                         beak and a death wish.

               Mercer pulls out his NIGHTSTICK, loses the bird as it hops
               back THROUGH BARS into...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

               Alex looks around his now empty cell. On the wall is a
               rectangle, clearer than the wall around it, where the
               photograph of Alex and Lauren had been before Walsh removed
               it. Alex goes up to thewall and touches the spot.

               FLASH! ALEX'S INTERNAL POV FLASH of LAUREN, laughing as
               she beckons to someone, Alex, who joins her in frame as we
               hear the whir of the camera auto-timer. A click, as the
               picture is taken. Alex and Lauren are frozen in the pose
               of Alex's photograph.

               RESUME The picture is gone. Alex, perplexed, stands looking
               at the blank spot on the wall for a moment. He turns and
               exits the cell...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW - NIGHT

               Mercer is peering through the double-barred gate at the
               end of the row as Alex emerges from his former cell.

                                     MERCER
                              (still into radio)
                         Get me some backup. We got one
                         loose on the row.
                              (through the bars
                              to Alex)
                         Now who the fuck are you?

               Alex looks up, sees Mercer and FLASH...

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV A pop of Mercer bringing the birthday
               cake. A wash of flame, twenty one candles. A blip of Walsh.
               Of a White King.

               RESUME Alex perplexed, looking at the cake still littering
               the floor of his ex-cell, candles melted down. Mercer works
               his way through the double-barred doors onto the row.

                                     MERCER (CONT'D)
                         And what have you done to your
                         face there beauty queen?

               The INMATE occupying the cell next to Alex's peers out
               through the bars, vanishes again as Mercer WHOPS the bars
               once with his nightstick.

                                     ALEX
                         It's my birthday.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      13.


                                     MERCER
                         Yeah, well... here's a present for
                         you.

               WHOOSH. Mercer swings his NIGHTSTICK at Alex's head. Alex
               catches it, instinctively in one hand. Mercer reaches for...

               A RED PANIC BUTTON hanging off his guard belt. Mercer slams
               it. FAVORING ALEX lets go of the stick, looks at his own
               hand, surprised.

               WHAM!  Mercer broadsides Alex's head with the stick. Alex
               goes down shocked, not from pain, from the fact that someone
               would attack him.

               WHAM WHAM WHAM. Mercer brutalizes Alex, collapsed at his
               feet as... TWO GUARDS enter the far end of the Row, race
               toward Alex's cell, one holding a TASER. Its LASER SIGHT
               finds Alex, crumpled in front of Mercer.

                                     MERCER (CONT'D)
                         It's ok. Man. Had me going there.

               Looks like it's over. The guards relax. ALEX suddenly looks
               up at Mercer. Zero damage from the blows.

                                     ALEX
                         Go ahead. Make a wish.

                                     MERCER
                         Taser!

               Alex wheels around as Guard One squeezes the trigger.
               CROWVISION The Taser Darts speed toward Camera.

               RESUME Alex shunts himself to the side and the TASER DARTS
               impale themselves in Mercer's thighs. He drops fibrillating.

               A CHEER goes up from the men in their cells, who become
               progressively rowdier as the guards BOLT and Alex follows,
               strength in his stride, nightstick in hand.

               Pieces of FLAMING TOILETPAPER flung now from the cells of
               Deathrow.

               AT THE FAR ENTRANCE the two Guards scramble to get the
               door closed behind them before Alex catches up. They'd
               make it except Alex hurls...

               THE NIGHTSTICK flying end over end like a throwing knife,
               catching the trailing guard in the back of the head,
               dropping him in the door, propping it open.

               ALEX enters the cage entrance to Deathrow, sharing the
               space with the Guard still standing.

                                     ALEX
                              (pats pockets, then)
                         Keys?

               The frightened Guard opens the door into the next hallway
               and bolts. Leaving the keys. The Crow hopping, screaming...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - SECURITY BOOTH - NIGHT

               CLOSE on a SCHEMATIC MAP of the prison. Lit up like a
               Christmas tree now with flashing red lights. The Guard
               keys a communications radio.

                                     RADIO GUARD

               Another LIGHT goes on. They're starting to make a line.
               Buzzers going off now. A general ALARM sounded.

                                     RADIO GUARD (CONT'D)
                         Escape in progress. Heading for
                         the roof.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

               The Crow flaps up the stairwell. Alex on its heels, taking
               steps three at a time.

               AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRWELL The Crow waits on a LANDING
               with a door marked "Emergency Use Only." Plus a dozen lines
               of assorted instructions. Guards' feet THUNDER below,
               approaching.

                                     ALEX
                         I hear the pitter patter of little
                         feet.

               He opens the door. The ALARM is LOUD.

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Dark a moment. Then a HUGE SPOTLIGHT hits Alex, casting
               long shadows. He looks up at a GUARD TOWER, the source of
               the light. And of a BULLHORN VOICE.

                                     BULLHORN VOICE
                         Do not proceed. Back slowly away
                         from the fence.

               As if in defiance, the Crow hops toward the fence, old
               chain link topped with razorwire along the perimeter of
               the roof.

               BULLHORN VOICE CONTINUES as Alex follows... ALEX'S POV
               through the fence, down fifty feet to the pavement.

                                     ALEX
                         Damn.

               Alex turns, sees... A HALF DOZEN GUARDS emerge from the
               stairwell to the top of the roof, level weapons at Alex.

               ON THE FENCE - ALEX climbs quickly to the top, where he
               grabs two painful handfuls of razorwire that cut deeply
               into this hand. He extricates himself, balancing atop the
               fence. And looks...

               ALEX'S HANDS The jagged bloodlines disappear, miraculously
               heal.

               FAVORING ALEX as he holds up his hands to show the guards,
               a kid-like smile on his face.

               They respond by raising their weapons and BAM BAM BAM.

               Alex hurls himself off the edge in a hail of Gunfire that
               Dopplers down to silence as he falls, falls...

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - BASE OF THE WALLS - NIGHT

               AT THE BASE OF "THE WALLS" Alex hits, flushing PIGEONS,
               that fill frame with manic wings.

               As the SPOTLIGHT sweeps toward Alex he rolls off, over the
               sidewalk, between two parked cars.

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               ON THE ROOFTOP Mercer and the others stand there dumbstruck,
               looking down as the SPOTLIGHT finds nothing.

               A RADIO CRACKLES. Mercer keys it a beat later.

                                     RADIO GUARD VOICE
                         Physical head count shows all
                         inmates present.

               Mercer moves the radio away from his head.

                                     MERCER
                         Then who was the fucking Houdini?

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - BASE OF THE WALLS - NIGHT

               AT THE BASE OF "THE WALLS" Illuminated by spill from the
               Spotlight, Alex crouches between two cars. He leans forward,
               checking his reflection in a CHROME HUBCAP. A huge smile
               spreads over his face.

                                     ALEX
                         Happy birthday.

               He laughs. Life--or whatever this is--is good. So far.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. CITY - AIRBORNE - NIGHT

               The CROW flies past tall buildings downtown.

                                                                      16.


               EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

               The crow flies past letters P-O-L-I-C-E on the side of an
               older building taking us to...

               INT. POLICE STATION - EVIDENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               SMASH. A hand punches through a sash window, right through
               the imbedded security wires, roughly rips off the latch
               inside. Retracts, bleeding. The window opens.

               It's Alex, on the fire escape, checking out his arm as the
               BLEEDING STOPS.

               Alex follows the Crow into the dark room packed with file
               cabinets and evidence bins, wire lockers. And a desk, strewn
               with POLICE FORMS. Plus a vertical SPIKE with processed
               evidence request FORMS impaled on it.

                                     ALEX
                              (checking out desk)
                         Police? Evidence?
                              (then, to Crow)
                         Look. I like what we've got going
                         here. But I can think of lots better
                         to do with it than fighting crime.
                         Know what I mean?

               The Crow makes its way to a file cabinet, the top drawer
               marked "Cl-Cr."  Alex lingers a moment at the desk, eye on
               the spike.

               WHOP. Alex drives his hand onto the SPIKE. Looks up,
               delighted. CAW.

               The Crow gives Alex an admonishing look. Alex pulls the
               spike from his hand. Instant healing.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Ok, ok... what?

               Alex opens the top drawer. Looking for... he's not sure
               what. Glibly goes through folders.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Nothing under "Crow."

               He stops. Pulls out the first FILE out in a thick section
               marked "CORVIS, ALEXANDER F." Having caught a glimpse of...

               IN THE FILE - ALEX'S MUG SHOT And rap sheet. X-CLOSE. We
               see "Murder 1st degree," "Penalty Phase: Find for
               Execution."

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Execution?

               But even this has little interest for him as the finds the
               words "Lauren Randall" on the page.

                              (remembering)
                         Lauren...

               ALEX rips the drawer out of the file cabinet, dumps it
               CRASHING on the ground. He drops to the floor with a growing
               sense of dread, feeling with both hands, finding...

               A SPLAY OF PHTOGRAPHS encased in plastic -- the
               prosecutions' background presentation on Alex and Lauren.
               The first photo shows LAUREN Posing jauntily, her arm around
               a Snowman. She and the Snowman wear matching Boston Red
               Sox caps.

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV On Alex, anticipating...WHAP!  A
               snowball nails him square in the face.

               WIDE to reveal LAUREN running for cover as Young Alex scoops
               up snow for ammo. He lobs a snowball at Lauren, just as
               she slips to the ground. she doesn't get up right away.

               Alex is just a shade concernec as he runs over to her. He
               reaches the spot to find LAUREN in the snow, waving her
               arms and legs to make a snow angel. She looks up at him
               and beckons him to lie on top of her.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         What are you, an Angel?

                                     LAUREN
                         I'm your Angel. Come here.

               RESUME Alex's pained smile at the memory, until he finds:
               THE MURDER WEAPON A rough looking hunting knife bagged and
               tagged as "AC-005: Murder Weapon."

               ALEX frantic now, spreading out the file contents,
               finding...

                         No! I didn't...!

               Alex SMASHES his own head against the metal file cabinets,
               wounding himself on the handles, droplets of blood flying
               now, spattering the evidence on the floor.

               THE DOOR TO THE EVIDENCE ROOM opens.

               A YOUNG COP enters, walks slowly past rows of file cabinets,
               looking down empty aisles until finding the file drawerful
               Alex dumped. But Alex is gone.

               The Young Cop looks up as the Crow departs through the
               window and two other cops arrive. One of them Dutton.

                                     DUTTON

                         Shit.

               Dutton walks to the mess on the floor, curious. He squats.
               Picks up a tag marked "Murder Weapon AC-005" staples ripped
               out, nothing attached to it. Takes in the crime scene photos

               year old, circles making an oddly sexy version of the "Oooo"
               Bruce Lee sound. A goof, a game she's playing with Alex,
               who circles opposite.

                         And I'm remembering. And it hurts.

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Lauren's starting to crack up, trying

               A SINGLE BLOOD RED TEAR rolls down the cheek of the angel
               atop the headstone. Alex stops it with his finter.

               WIDER, the supplicant at the grave. And the Crow nearby.

                         I was a friend of your sister's.

                                     ERIN
                         I know her friends.

                                     ALEX
                         That locket you're holding. You
                         have one just like it.

               She lifts the Locket around her neck. Visible to anyone.

                                     ERIN
                         Yeah, no kidding.

                                     ALEX
                         Your father gave them to both of
                         you.

                                     ERIN
                         And he's right over there by the
                         way.
                              (then)
                         What did you do to your face?

                                     ALEX
                         Someone else did it.

                                     ERIN
                         You're a friend of the guy who
                         killed her, aren't you? You almost
                         sound like him.

                                     ALEX
                         He didn't kill her.

                                     ERIN
                         How do you know?

                                     ALEX
                         I know everything about your sister.
                         I'll prove it to you.

                                     ERIN
                              (loud now)
                         Stay away from me! Dad! Dad!

               OS, the car door opens. Then SLAMS shut. Nathan approaches.

                                     RANDALL
                         Erin!

                                     ERIN
                         Watch out!

               She whips around, points at... Alex is gone.

                                     RANDALL
                         What were you yelling about?

                                     ERIN
                         This guy said he was a friend of
                         Lauren's. He had like paint all
                         over his face.

                                     RANDALL
                         Are you ok?

                                     ERIN
                         What's that supposed to mean? He
                         was right here. He was!

               She shakes her head, confused, then, looking around spots...

               THE HEADSTONE. The track from the RED TEAR indelible even
               in the downpour.

               Off Erin, as she touches the angel's stained cheek. And
               her dad, soggy in the rain...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - RAIN - NIGHT

               A street LIGHT flickers on. Maybe because night has fallen
               or maybe its just a rainy day.

               Thomas Leonard hikes up his collar, trying to stay dry, as
               he pauses a clutch of hookers huddled in a doorway...

                                     HOOKER
                         Yo, Tommy. Red light special.
                              (hikes her skirt)
                         Even you can afford it.

               He shakes his head--don't need that grief--continues on to
               the next building and CAMERA FINDS...

               ALEX watching, holding "The List." He crosses off the name
               for Eyewitness "Thomas Leonard."

               INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Tommy clears the stairs, heads for his door. Unlocking the
               second lock, he looks around, alert, like he heard
               something. Then opens the door.

               INT. TENEMENT - TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Alex waits for Tommy, crouched by an OPEN WINDOW that looks
               out onto an alley, a four story drop.

                                     TOMMY
                              (sees Alex, then)
                         March?!

                                                                      23.


                                     ALEX
                         Sssshhh. She's resting.

                                     TOMMY
                         Where the fuck did you come from?

                                     ALEX
                         Big bang, primordial ooze, divine
                         hand of a benevolent creator?  All
                         possibilities. Although recent
                         events have given me doubts about
                         the benevolent creator.

               Tommy starts toward Alex, who pulls the KNIFE from the
               Evidence Room.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You lied at my trial.

                                     TOMMY
                         I don't know you, man.

                                     ALEX
                         Capital case nine nine dash C one
                         one five. Alex Corvis.
                              (flashes knife)
                         Exhibit A.

               WHAM. Alex pins what looks like Tommy's arm. It's just his
               jacket, but it immobilizes Tommy.

                                     TOMMY
                         Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids
                         arguing. A guy and a girl.

                                     ALEX
                         You said you saw me with this. I
                         never held it until today.

                                     TOMMY
                         What's your damage, man? Corvis
                         hacked up that girl like a
                         motherfucker.

               Alex HEAVES Tommy crashing into the window, smashing the
               glass and cheap aluminum frame.

               Tommy hanging halfway in, halfway out. Four floors above
               the alley. Alex rips Tommy's shirt where the knife already
               cut it. JACKS the sleeve down. No scar there.

                                     ALEX
                         One chance to tell the truth, Tommy.
                         Who is the man with the scar? He
                         planted this in my car.

                                     TOMMY
                         There's no scar. Corvis made it
                         up.

                                     ALEX
                         Wrong. Answer.

                                     TOMMY
                         Who are you?

                                     TOMMY'S WIFE
                         Tommy!

               TOMMY'S WIFE enters from the bedroom, SCREAMING.

               Heavy eye makeup, looking like she just woke up. OS, a
               TODDLER CRIES as she throws herself on Alex and they spill
               back inside.

                                     TOMMY'S WIFE (CONT'D)
                         Let him go! Let him go!

                                     TOMMY
                         Honey. Take the baby. Get out of
                         here now!

               But she doesn't leave. She pleads in wrenching SOBS that
               seem to affect Alex. The Crow lands in the window.

                                     TOMMY'S WIFE
                         He's all I got. Tommy and the baby.
                         Don't take him. The baby needs a
                         father.

               Her MASCARA runs down her cheeks, a facsimile of Alex's
               mask. They share a long look, connected by pain.

               The Crow cawing a warning, hopping in the window as...

                                     ALEX
                         Your baby is crying. Go.

               Tommy nods at his wife, who heads off to the bedroom. The
               Crow gives Alex an admonishing CAW, then takes flight.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         What did they give you?

                                     TOMMY
                         They showed me pictures, what he
                         did to her. Evidence. Said all I
                         had to do was stand up there and
                         not my head "yes."

                                     ALEX
                              (repeats, insistent)
                         What did they give you?

                                     TOMMY
                         A job. Construction. Twelve an
                         hour.

               Tommy's wife returns, holding a fifteen month old BOY.
               Alex unfolds "The List," passes it to Tommy, blank side
               up.

                                     ALEX
                         Write down their names. All of
                         them.

               But Tommy takes a look at "The List" and flips it over...

               "THE LIST" Tommy points to the Police Witness list. Dutton,
               Erlich, Larkin, Toomey.

                                     TOMMY
                         You already got 'em. Right here.
                         These cops said the needed an
                         eyewitness, or Corvis would walk.

               ALEX drops his head. All clear now. He laughes gently at
               the sound of SIRENS approaching, still blocks away.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DIMNESS

               CAMERA CREEPS toward the by now familiar Mystery Man, bent
               over his work at the table across the room.

               CLOSE. A lineup of short (2") rods. One selected with a
               pair of surgical forceps,

               INSERTED through a hole in human flesh, raising a
               considerable welt. Some bleeding.

               As the man reaches for a cotton ball, he notices an empty
               STAND among the taxidermy specimens. Marked "Corvus
               brachyrhynchos."

               He scans the table, searching, then throws up his hands,
               shielding his face as a Crow flies out of the darkness,
               right at him.

               The man turns toward Camera but we never see his face as
               the Crow wheels mid-air, flying past him a second time. As
               the Crow flies up and out a SMALL WINDOW, the man stands,
               hands on the desk. SLOW PUSH on the man, on...

               A ZIGZAG PATTERN of raised welts on the underside of his
               forearm, in high relief under the Draftsman's lamp.

               The "Scar." A drop of blood zigzags, running downward.
               SLOW FADE OUT. OVER BLACK, the CRACKLE of a Police Radio.
               We're...

               EXT. CITY STREET #1 - NIGHT

               HIGH ANGLE. A police CRUISER has stopped a late model
               CADILLAC SEVILLE on a deserted street.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      26.


               IN THE POLICE CAR CLOSE. COP I.D. "Dutton, Philip" with a
               picture of the same face CAMERA FINDS working a bad comb-
               over in the rearview mirror.

               IN THE SEVILLE TRACY, almost sixteen, dressed for nightlife,
               sees Dutton primping in her rearview mirror. He's getting
               out now.

                                     TRACY
                         Oh no...

               She jostles her friend JANNIE, passed out in the front
               passenger seat, trying to rouse her. No luck. DUTTON motions
               and Tracy buzzes down the window.

                                     TRACY (CONT'D)
                         Anything wrong?

                                     DUTTON
                         Let's hope not. License and
                         registration please.

               Tracy tries hard to keep her smile going as she looks
               through her purse. Not finding anything.

                                     DUTTON (CONT'D)
                         What's with your friend there?

                                     TRACY
                         She's... sick.
                              (off Dutton)
                         Actually she never had Mai Tais
                         before.

                                     DUTTON
                         But you, you've had them.

                                     TRACY
                         Not tonight. Honest.

               Tracy paws through her purse some more. Vamping.

                                     DUTTON
                         If you had a license, I bet I'd
                         have seen it by now. How old are
                         you? Fifteen?

                                     TRACY
                         Look, I'll tell you the truth.
                         Jannie drove us and was supposed
                         to drive us back, she has a license,
                         but I mean... look at her.

               Dutton leaves that dangling. Circles around to the passenger
               side...

                                     TRACY (CONT'D)
                              (whisper to Jannie)
                         Get up, get up...!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      27.


               Dutton opens Jannie's door, leans in, slides a hand between
               her slightly parted legs. Dutton smiles at Tracy.

                                     DUTTON
                         Why don't you get out.

               CROWVISION High overhead. Tracy steps out of the car. Dutton
               shuts the passenger door, points. Tracy moves behind the
               Seville.

               RESUME Dutton closes in. She's getting very nervous.

                                     TRACY
                         You want me to walk a straight
                         line?

                                     DUTTON
                         I want you... to bend over.

                                     TRACY
                         Look, can I just call a cab?

                                     DUTTON
                         What did I say?

               Tracy bends over the car trunk. Dutton eases her feet apart
               with the tip of his boot then pulls out his NIGHTSTICK,
               uses it to lift her tiny skirt slowly up over her butt. As
               he does, she stands back up, shakes her head "no."

                                     DUTTON (CONT'D)
                         Maybe I'll ask your friend.

               Tracy's frantic, about to call out as Dutton moves to the
               passenger door, opens it and...

               OVER DUTTON - ALEX sits in the passenger seat now. Jannie
               shunted inward.

                                     ALEX
                              (mimicking Dutton)
                         I want you... to bend over. Officer
                         Dutton.

               Dutton pulls his 9MM BARETTA on Alex.

                                     DUTTON
                         Where'd you come from? Out of the
                         car. Now!

               With insolent slowness, Alex finishes writing...

               "THE LIST" a red line drawn through Dutton's name.

               ALEX gets out of the car. Dutton SLAMS the door and Janie
               stirs, coming to. At least a bit.

                                     DUTTON (CONT'D)
                         Hands on the car.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      28.


                                     ALEX
                         Question. These hands?

               Alex advances on Dutton.

                                     DUTTON
                         You're dead, ditch weed.

               CLOSE. Dutton's finger squeezes the trigger.

               BAM! The shot blows Alex back at the Seville passenger
               window. Slumped face against the car.

                                     TRACY
                         Omigod, omigod...

               Jannie's head pops up inside the car. She SCREAMS at...

               JANNIE'S POV Alex right in her face, nice and dead. Dutton
               lowers his gun BG. Tracy in a panic. Suddenly, Alex opens
               his eyes, smiles.

               Face distorted against the glass. She screams again.

                                     ALEX
                         You're up.

               ALEX wheels around, wrenches Dutton's wrist, vise gripped.
               Dutton's gun falls to the ground.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Ladies. Drive carefully.

               Tracy rushes to the driver side.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You might want to call 911. Report
                         an officer down.

               Tracy SCREECHES off leaving Dutton in shock.

                                     DUTTON
                         That was a fucking hollow point!

                                     ALEX
                         I guess it's true. Guns don't kill
                         people...

               Alex draws the KNIFE--the murder weapon--from his costume.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Think maybe knives do?

                                     DUTTON
                         Keep that thing away from me.

                                     ALEX
                         This is not just some "thing."
                         It's A C zero zero five.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      29.


                                     DUTTON
                         You're the skel broke into the
                         evidence room.

               FLASH. The knife moves and RIP! Alex yanks the sleeve off
               Dutton's uniform, revealing a SCARLESS FOREARM.

                                     DUTTON (CONT'D)
                         Fuck! What do you want?

                                     ALEX
                         A scar. On the arm. Of the man who
                         planted this in Alex Corvis's car.

                                     DUTTON
                         There's no scar, you freak. The
                         Corvis kid made it up.

               Alex glitches, hearing this a second time, then RAMS Dutton
               into a wall with a great CLATTER of trash cans.

               Alex all over him, holding Dutton's head firmly in his two
               hands, like he could crush it in an instant.

                                     ALEX
                         He was innocent. You framed him.
                         You. And Erlich. And Larkin. And
                         Toomey. What do you think, Officer
                         Dutton? An eye for an eye?

               Alex's thumbs inch toward Dutton's eyes, grazing Dutton's
               eyelids now and a wild thing happens.

               FLASH!  ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Dutton's Nightstick lifts
               Lauren's skirt.

               Then flashs of a bloodsoaked struggle, Lauren's death. And
               the surprise BAM! of a shot fired.

               RESUME Alex thrown by this. Relaxes his grip on Dutton.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You were there. All four of you.

               Dutton kicks him off, smashes a garbage can over Alex's
               back then pulls a SMALL SEMI-AUTO from an ankle holster.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You killed her. I saw it.

                                     DUTTON
                         Bitch killed herself when she shot
                         a cop in the leg. If she' just
                         acted like a girl nothing would
                         have happened.
                              (then)
                         So you're right, spooky. Happy?

               BAM! Alex barely slowed by the shot, advancing, Dutton
               starting to panic. BAM!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      30.


               Alex keeps coming, right up to the gun. Pointed right at
               his face, then...

               WHOOSH. Alex flips it around, RAMS the gun in Dutton's
               mouth. He couldn't talk if he wanted to.

                                     ALEX
                         I'm working on it.

               BAM! We HEAR the blast as we... CUT TO:

               INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT

               BAM BAM continues, but these are TOY GUNS, fired in synch
               with POUNDING MUSIC.

               In the hands of TWO STRIPPERS. Topless, leather G's and
               chokers, black stockings, POLICE HATS on their heads, law
               enforcement stars for earrings.

               The CAPACITY CROWD responds as they pout, wield their
               weapons.

               AT THE ENTRANCE - MADDEN a straightfaced plainclothes
               detective, more upscale than the clientele, flashes a BADGE
               at a BOUNCER who scowls, lets him pass.

               WITH MADDEN circumnavigating the mainstage, where the cop-
               strippers are waving handcuffs now. At the edge of the
               room, LAP-DANCERS pull one-on-one's for twenties. Madden
               exits...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

               BACKSTAGE Madden moves past girls in various stages of
               undress. Smoking, yapping, waiting to go onstage. One looks
               up, interested, but he doesn't look back, exits into...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY

               AN INTERNET PORN FACILITY Where "live" sex workers man
               tiny fantasy sets--a Dungeon, a Shower, a desk and
               blackboard meant to suggest a Schoolroom. Crudely built,
               but good enough for 500x800 pixel resolution. Madden stops
               a second, looking...

               OVER A MONITOR - THE DUNGEON SET UPDATES every six seconds,
               the slowly changing low-rez version of the action on the
               set--a woman tied to a chair with bright surgical tubing.

               The picture refreshes and BG, the woman sneaks an expertly
               timed sip of Diet Coke, puts the can away before the picture
               updates again.

               A COUNTER shows 132,768 hits and climbing. Madden gives a
               look, like people are really fucked up, continues past a
               curtain with a "No Admittance" sign into...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      31.


               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK HALL - NIGHT

               A BACK HALL dark, the furthest recesses of the building.
               Madden continues cautiously toward... A DOOR

               INT. THE HOLE - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

               The door is cracked open. Madden moving very quietly now,
               scowling as he peers through the slight opening.

               Three guys and whirring machines counting stacks of money.
               Guns on the tabletops, in holsters, out of reach.

               The door flies open.

                                     MADDEN
                         Police!

               A moment of panic as the guys bent over the machines freeze.
               Raise their hands, slowly turn. Then lower their hands.

                                     ERLICH
                         You fuck. Don't do that.

               It's Erlich, Larkin and Toomey. Three cops we met at the
               execution. Erlich's cane nearby.

                                     MADDEN
                         How's the month end?

                                     ERLICH
                         Oh yes. Never been better.

                                     MADDEN
                         Where's Dutton?

                                     ERLICH
                         Probably parked near some high
                         school with a hardon. Fuck never
                         showed.

                                     MADDEN
                         Anyone at all curious why?

               Erlich, Larkin and Toomey exchange a look. Madden goes to
               one of the money counters and grabs...

               A STACK OF TWENTIES tossed violently at the ceiling.

               Larkin and Toomey scramble as the bills flutter down like
               leaves, picking them up.

                                     MADDEN (CONT'D)
                         You leave the door open with two
                         hundred strangers out there!  What's
                         it take for you guys to learn a
                         goddamn lesson?

                                     TOOMEY
                         No one saw anything, Mad.

                                     MADDEN
                         You know why Dutton's not here?
                         Rigor mortis! He's dead.

               The Three exchange looks.

                                     MADDEN (CONT'D)
                         One shot to the head, then fifty
                         three stab wounds with a six inch
                         blade. Any deja vu here? Think
                         Corvus knife, missing from the
                         evidence room.

                                     TOOMEY
                         Since when?

                                     MADDEN
                         Since last night. As usual, you're
                         right on top of things.

                                     LARKIN
                         It was supposed to end when Corvis
                         died. Remember? The kid no one
                         would miss?

                                     ERLICH
                         Don't look at me, asshole.

                                     LARKIN
                         Hey, I didn't kill anybody.

                                     ERLICH
                         Back off. I mean it.

                                     MADDEN
                         Shut up! Erlich and Larkin settle
                         down.

                                     MADDEN (CONT'D)
                         Crime scene's a goddamn clusterfuck.
                         Every reporter in town's trying to
                         get a look at Dutton's body. I
                         suggest we get a line on this before
                         someone else does.

                                     LARKIN
                         Who'd give a shit about Corvis at
                         this point? Kid didn't have a friend
                         in the world even when he was alive.

                                     ERLICH
                         I can think of one.

               Erlich and Madden share a look. On the same wavelength.
               Erlich picks up his weapon off the table.

               EXT. CITY STREET #1 - NIGHT

               A large CRIME SCENE marked off by tape, Dutton's cruiser
               where he left it. Several other cruisers nearby, lights
               flashing. An ambulance, stretcher being unloaded now.

               AN ACTION NEWSTEAM the one we've seen before, Barbara
               Gonzalez frontman, speaking into a mic, too far away for
               us to hear.

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               CLOSE on a TV. Gonzalez audible now.

                                     GONZALEZ
                         ... rumors multiply as officials
                         refuse to confirm or deny reports
                         of multiple, multiple stab wounds...

               Gonzalez CONTINUES UNDER as...

                                     ERIN
                         Dad! Come in here!

               The SOUND of footsteps racing down the hall.

                                     RANDALL
                         What is it?

                                     ERIN
                         The cop who found the knife in
                         Corvis's car.

               Randall riveted by the TV now.

                                     GONZALEZ
                         They're moving him now, body
                         covered. It would appear that thirty
                         seven year old Phillip Dutton is
                         dead in the line of duty...

               ON THE TV the Newsteam and Gonzalez SHOVED back by COPS
               running defense for the stretcher. Gonzalez grabs for the
               sheet covering the body and...

               NEWSCAM TIGHT on Dutton, as the sheet pulls down, partially
               uncovering...

               DUTTON'S HEAD: Comb-over hanging to the side. Blood dripping
               from crude letters carved in his bald pate--the word
               "DAISY."  Quickly covered by a COP who yells at Gonzalez...

                                     COP
                         Out of here! Now!

               ... but through a digital miracle the "Daisy" frame has
               been grabbed, and appears as a still now behind Gonzalez.

               RESUME - FAVORING ERIN struck dumb by this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      34.


                                     GONZALEZ
                         Shocking even for these mean
                         streets, the word "Daisy" apparently
                         cut into his head by the
                         perpetrator, still at large. A
                         name. Perhaps a message...

               Gonzalez FADES UNDER as Erin backs away from the TV.

                                     RANDALL
                         What? What is it?

                                     ERIN
                         Lauren called me that when we were
                         little. Daisy. No one knew but us.

                                     RANDALL
                         Honey. It's doesn't mean anything.
                         It's not a message.

                                     ERIN
                         That guy in the cemetery today
                         said he knew everything about
                         Lauren.

                                     RANDALL
                         It still doesn't mean...

                                     ERIN
                         He said he'd prove it.

               Off Randall, as he sits on the bed, thoughtful...

               EXT. CITY STREET #1 - NIGHT

               WIDE. The ambulance drives off, lights flashing, and we
               BOOM UP over the crime scene, over the Newsteam, revealing
               the top of Dutton's cruiser, marked with a BLOODRED CROW.

               Continuing upward, FINDING... The Crow, perched high on a
               building. It takes flight.

               EXT. CITY - AIRBORNE - NIGHT

               The Crow soaring through this lousy part of town.

               EXT. LOW-RENT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

               The Crow swoops in, lands on the roof of a low end brick
               building, peers down over the edge.

               Camera DRIFTS DOWN the side of he building finding a light,
               someone burning the midnight oil.

               FINDING a CHESS SET mid-game near the open window as...

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               WAM! Erlich's CANE knocks a pile of papers to the floor
               off a desk piled high with briefs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      35.


                                     WALSH
                         I don't know about any knife. I'm
                         trying to forget that case.

                                     ERLICH
                         Well someone isn't. They killed
                         Dutton.

                                     WALSH
                         It wasn't me.

                                     ERLICH
                         No shit. You couldn't get close to
                         him. But I'm betting you know who
                         did. Who's into Corvis? Huh?

               Erlich flips through a Rolodex, knocks it to the floor,
               then picks up a PHONE LOG off the desk.

                                     ERLICH (CONT'D)
                         Not a lot of calls. Business slow?

               He tosses the phone log out the window.

               EXT. LOW-RENT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

               HIGH ANGLE. Watching the phone log fluttering down.

               INCLUDE ALEX, sitting where the Crow was perched, wearing
               Dutton's badge on his evolving costume.

               Alex winces at the voices faint but audible from below.

                                     ERLICH'S VOICE
                         You're the only one gave a flying
                         fuck about him when he was alive.

                                     WALSH'S VOICE
                         Lauren Randall did.

                                     ERLICH'S VOICE
                         Hey. Bitches are crazy. Richer
                         they are, crazier they get.

               "THE LIST" The name "Erlich, Vincent" crossed off now by
               Alex.

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Erlich limps through frame toward Walsh, grabs him roughly
               by the collar.

                                     WALSH
                         Maybe if you hadn't fried an
                         innocent kid...

                                     ERLICH
                         Who is it?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      36.


                                     WALSH
                         How about the real killer. You
                         think of that?

               Erlich violently tosses Walsh crashing back toward the
               window, falling by the chess board.

                                     ERLICH
                         If you're covering for someone,
                         that's jail time. I got my eye on
                         you.

               Erlich exits, slamming the door behind him. Walsh starts
               to get up, stops. Looking at his own eye level...

               ALEX'S CHESS BOARD set up identically to the game in Alex's
               cell, a piece of FOLDED PAPER protruding from under the
               board. Walsh pulls it out.

               It says "Q-->B5" WALSH makes the move, Queen to Bishop
               Five. Smiles. Looks at...

               THE PAPER UNFOLDED says "Check." Walsh sets it down in the
               Chess Box next to...

               THE PICTURE OF ALEX AND LAUREN arms around each other in
               the woods, smiling.

               WALSH sensing something, a presence.

                                     WALSH
                         Alex?

               Walsh moves cautiously to the curtains, draws them back.
               Nothing. He leans out the window.

               EXT. LOW-RENT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

               CROWVISION: Starting on Walsh, popping his head out the
               window two stories down, INCLUDING Erlich as he exits the
               building, gets in a SILVER PORSCHE.

               Picture bending wildly as the Porsche takes off and the
               Crow takes flight.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. CITY STREET #2 - INTERSECTION - NIGHT

               A RED TRAFFIC LIGHT. The Porsche pulling to a stop.

               IN THE PORSCHE Erlich looks down, presses a button on the
               stereo. Elvis from his baroque period "If I can Dream."
               Erlich looks up, waves his arms.

                                     ERLICH
                         No, no...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      37.


               ERLICH'S POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD A BUM starts to
               "clean" the windshield with an OILY rag, leaving opaque
               smears on the once clean glass.

               THUD. A handful of gravelly MUD lands on the windshield,
               starts to get smeared around. ERLICH pounding the window
               from inside.

                                     ERLICH (CONT'D)
                         No! Shit!

               The bum is giving the driver side window the same treatment.
               Hard to see anything now. Erlich throws up his hands in
               disgust, reaches for the door handle just as...

               SMASH!  The driver side window SHATTERS as something enters
               at high speed KICKING Erlich across the car...

               Erlich's head bounces off the passenger window, leaving a
               BLOODY SMEAR. Alex in the driver seat now.

                                     ALEX
                         The Germans really know how to
                         make a car, don't they?

               LOW ANGLE ON THE PORSCHE wheels spinning as it peels out.

               INT. CORVETTE - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

               WINDSHIELD WASHERS and WIPERS clear away the grime Alex
               smeared on the windshield, revealing that we're rocketing
               through a bad part of town.

               MUSIC CONTINUES as Alex pulls the KNIFE out of his costume
               with his LEFT HAND. It looks huge in the cramped sports
               car.

                                     ALEX
                              (re: Lauren knife)
                         I heard you were looking for this.

                                     ERLICH
                         You're the guy killed Dutton.

                                     ALEX
                         I want you to think of me as the
                         guy who killed you.

               Erlich pulls a .380 SEMI-AUTO stashed between the two seats.
               Points it at Alex.

                                     ERLICH
                         Stop the car.

               Alex FLOORS it and... BAM.

               Erlich blows a hole through Alex's LEFT ARM, a yawning
               aperture through which Erlich watches the passing scenery
               a few improbably seconds.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      38.


                                     ALEX
                         Ow.

               The WOUND closes. Knife still in Alex's hand.

                                     ERLICH
                         Fuck. Me.

                                     ALEX
                         What happened to your leg there
                         Officer? Hunting accident?

               WHOP. In one swift move Alex impales the knife THROUGH
               ERLICH'S WRIST, into his thigh. Erlich SCREAMS, tries to
               remove the knife, but Alex keeps a firm grip on the handle.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)

                         wounds she died of came from you.
                         Am I right? Ballpark?

               Erlich tries to stay steely, yells louder as...

               EXT. CITY STREET #2 - NIGHT

               The Corvette bumps over a sidewalk, runs a red light.

               A POLICE CRUISER going the other way pulls a stunt U, flips
               on its lights. In hot pursuit.

               INT. CORVETTE - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

               Bumpier now as Alex's driving gets more and more erratic.

                                     ALEX
                         In Saudi Arabia they cut off the
                         hands of petty thieves. What price
                         for a life? Two lives?

               FLASH. Alex yanks the Knife out and FLASH, slices through
               the left arm of Erlich's jacket, sawing into the FLESH.
               Erlich's arm bleeding.

                                     ERLICH
                         Not my arm! What you fucking want?

                                     ALEX
                         I want Lauren. I want my life back.
                         I want... to know why.

                                     ERLICH
                         Why? Why's anything happen? It's
                         all money, man. Money. The girl
                         just got in the way.

               Alex grimaces, then RIP, he yanks the sleeves off Erlich's
               arm. Erlich looks down, surprised to see his arm intact.

                                                                      39.


                                     ALEX
                         The scar. Which of you has it?

                                     ERLICH
                         Nobody.

               Alex poises the knife for another descent.

                                     ERLICH (CONT'D)
                         I swear. It's a bullshit fucking
                         story the loser boyfriend made up.

               This gives Alex pause. He shakes his head, clearing the
               reality glitch, looks up...

               IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR Cop cars, lights flashing.

               EXT. CITY STREET #4 - NIGHT

               The Corvette slides around a corner, screams into a final
               straightaway that dead ends into the sloping concrete side
               of an overpass.

               The cops not far behind. The Porsche bottoming out on a
               bump now ant...

               INT. CORVETTE - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

               Alex's sun visor falls partway down from the jolt. He
               reaches to push it back into position and notices...

               ON THE BACK OF THE VISOR The CAR REGISTRATION. Alex takes
               it out of the holder. RESUME Alex suddenly calm. He reaches
               down for...

               THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER pushed in. The volume on the Elvis
               song pumped up. ALEX relaxes back in his seat as they scream
               toward the abutment.

                                     ERLICH
                         Are you out of your fucking mind?
                         We're going to die.

                                     ALEX
                         How can you die if you're already
                         dead?

                                     ERLICH
                         You're him. Corvis.

                                     ALEX
                         I was talking about you.

               Alex smiles as the CIGARETTE LIGHTER pops out. He grabs it
               and the GLOW vanishes as he closes his fist around it.

               Erlich turns front in horror. The microsecond of terror
               realized as Elvis climaxes, the retaining wall zoomes in...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      40.


                                     ELVIS
                         My dream... comes true... right
                         now!

               EXT. OVERPASS / ABUTMENT - NIGHT

               WHAM! The Corvette hits at a million mph. Crumpling,
               disintegrating, and hurling two bodies bouncing off the
               abutment.

               THE CAVALRY - CRUISERS AND PLAINWRAPS Too late. A half
               dozen cars bearing down all lights and sirens. Screeching
               to a halt by what used to be a silver Porsche.  The ruptured
               gas tank spurting GASOLINE.

               A CRUISER screeches to a halt. Both doors fly open. Toomey
               and Larkin step out. Toomey on his radio as Larkin looks
               up the embankment, catches a glimpse of...

               ALEX battered but alive, jerkily unclenches his fist, still
               holding the Lighter, glow fading.  He tosses...

               THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER arcs down onto the ex-Corvette. WIDER -
               BOOM!  Cops shield themselves as the Crash scene explodes
               in a huge FIREBALL that engulfs a cruiser stopped too close
               by.

               IN THE TOO-CLOSE COP CAR the DRIVER rams the car into
               REVERSE. Tires squeal as the fireball hits and...

               THE TOO-CLOSE CRUISER Engine compartment ignites, a second
               fireball racing backward into another Cruiser. BOOM!

               Total chaos now. LARKIN focussed on Alex, seen vaguely
               through the flames. Moving toward him.

               WITH LARKIN as he arrives at the top of the enbankment,
               draws his weapon. Hyperalert. Alex is gone, but he finds...

               ERLICH'S BODY two hundred broken boned bagged by bruises.
               Larkin pulls something out of Erlich's shattered fist.
               It's...

               "THE LIST" Dutton and Erlich crossed off. Larkin and Toomey
               yet to go, but the first letters of their names are all
               contained in a VERTICAL OVAL, "DELT" circled in red.

               LARKIN, AS TOOMEY JOINS HIM They give each other an oh-
               shit look. Then Larkin checkes his fingertips, smeared red
               from...

               "THE LIST" - FLIP SIDE the CROW CIPHER, rendered thick in
               coagulating blood. Illuminated by the flickering light of
               the fire below.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               CLOSE. A heart shaped Locket swung gently back and forth,
               then closed in Erin's hand as CAW!

               Erin turns, sees the Crow perched on the window ledge. As
               she moves to the open window, the Crow flies off.

               ERIN'S POV - OUT THE WINDOW - THE CRASH SCENE far away,
               the flashing lights and sirens of fire trucks arriving to
               bring the fire under control.

               ERIN looks, wondering, then spots something closer to hom.
               She moves off, WIPING through frame REVEALING...

               ON THE FRONT LAWY Alex. He looks down now, at the front
               door where...

               EXT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

               Erin exits the front door and we see her framed against
               the huge house, a rich-man's castle built in the twenties
               of quarried stone, quarter sawn oak and leaded glass.

               Erin, like her sister, a child of privilege. She approaches
               Alex.

                                     ERIN
                         Daisy. How did you know?

                                     ALEX
                         I told you, I knew your sister.

                                     ERIN
                         You killed that cop Dutton.

                                     ALEX
                         And another one. There. Erlich.
                         Took a wrong turn.

               Alex points at the distant crash site, the vague flashing
               lights.

                                     ERIN
                         I know who you are.
                              (no response)
                         That's why you paint your face. To
                         hide.

                                     ALEX
                         I'm not hiding. I'm right here.

                                     ERIN
                         You killed Lauren! You killed her!

               Erin shakes her head, trying to absorb what's going on,
               then RUSHES ALEX, screaming, beating on him, fists of fury.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      42.


                                     ALEX
                         Not me. Dirty cops killed her.
                         Dutton, Erlich...

               Alex tries to handle her flailing arms but she's too manic.
               He's getting hit in the face, the chest, and it's hurting.
               He grabs her roughly, gets her to stop.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         I've been shot, and stabbed and
                         thrown from a car and none of it
                         hurt. But what you're doing now,
                         does. I don't know why.

                                     ERIN
                         My dad was right! He said you'd
                         ruin her life.

                                     ALEX
                         No. Listen to me. Lauren found out
                         something they didn't want her to
                         know.
                              (then)
                         This.

               He holds up a Card, the Registration from the Corvette.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         From the bonfire over there. Look
                         at it.

                                     ERIN
                         No! Why are you haunting me?

                                     ALEX
                         Because you need to understand.
                         And you need... to be careful.

               He tries to give it to her one more time, then flips the
               card through the air. She turns, watching its flight all
               the way to the landing by the front door...

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         I'm sorry. Your father wasn't right.

               She turns back and...

               He's gone. Erin walks to the door. Despite herself reaches
               for the Card on the landing. It's...

               THE CORVETTE REGISTRATION which we see clearly for the
               first time. Owned by a company called DELT. The address is
               4201 Forestview Drive.

               ERIN spins around horrified, holds up the Registration.

               THE ADDRESS ON THE REGISTRATION - 4201 FORESTVIEW matches
               the numbers two feet away from her--the address plaque on
               her own house.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - ROLL CALL BULLPEN - DAY

               The buzz of nervous COP WALLA settles out as a stocky
               SERGEANT #2, clueless but honest, raises his voice, trying
               to command attention.

                                     SERGEANT#2
                         Listen up! Yo! We got a cop killer
                         out there.

               Walla responds "no shit"--and CAMERA BOOMS UP, moving to
               the back of the room over a nervous sea of blue uniforms.

                                     SERGEANT#2 (CONT'D)
                         Til we get an I.D. treat everyone
                         like a suspect. Patrol assignments
                         are posted by the door. Read them.
                         No singles, it's the buddy system
                         til we catch this asshole.

               Sergeant #2 CONTINUES UNDER as CAMERA FINDS...

               FAVORING LARKIN, TOOMEY AND MADDEN huddling together at
               the back. Urgent whispers. Larkin and Toomey try to contain
               their panic.

                                     LARKIN
                         He knows. I saw him. Fucking zombie
                         mask.

                         Calm down.

                                     LARKIN
                         You calm down.

               Larkin takes out "The List" from the crash site.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         Whose name's fucking next? Not

                         You didn't testify. You're not on

                         crash, but takes time out for art.

               He pockets "The List." Then looks up as...

               The entire room looking back at the three renegades.

                                     SERGEANT#2 (CONT'D)
                         The old man's requested the pleasure

               Madden shakes his head like this is bad news, rises and
               leaves.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - DAY

               A SECRETARY mans a LOW COUNTER guarding a large door at
               the end of the huge empty hall. She's got a heavy mascara
               trailer park vibe, looks up from her eyelash curler at the
               sound of approaching FOOTSTEPS.

               HER POV - THROUGH THE EYELASH CURLER Madden approaches.
               Stops. THE SECRETARY smiles, hits a BUTTON under the
               counter. The door to the Captain's office swings open.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Glad I'm not you.

                                     MADDEN
                         Right back at ya.

               She checks out Madden as he moves past her, then puts the
               eyelash curler away in a NAILIT containing a couple of
               razor sharp SCALPELS.

               INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY

               No sunlight in this cavernous, wood-panelled office. The
               Captain obscure in skifts of shadow at the edge of the
               room.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Sit down.

               Madden sits.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         I thought we had an understanding.
                         I thought we understood that
                         discretion is paramount.

                                     MADDEN
                         Yeah, we do.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Shut up.

               Madden does. The Captain begins and intense slow burn.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      45.


                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Erlich gimping around in his goddamn
                         hot rod is not discreet. I've got
                         reporters asking me how much he
                         made. I've got the entire force
                         looking at this case now.

                                     MADDEN
                         I know.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         You know.

                                     MADDEN
                         I know the guy leaves a sign.

               Madden produces "The List," flips it over to show the Crow
               doodle in blood.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         No shit he leaves a sign. He's a
                         goddamn Picasso.

               The Captain slaps down a crime scene photo--the Crow
               emblazoned huge on the top of Dutton's cruiser.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         What else do you know? Do you know
                         this?

               The Captain SLAMS a file down in front of Madden, who lets
               things cool out a moment before looking at it.

                                     MADDEN
                              (reads cover)
                         Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in
                         the Corvis case.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Some hooker phoned it in. There
                         was a riot at his apartment
                         yesterday.

                                     MADDEN
                         Guy dressed for Halloween?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Good for you. You do know something.

               They look up as the Secretary enters, holding the door
               open, like it's time to leave. Madden starts to speak and...

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Don't say. Just do. Before it all
                         comes tumbling down.

               The Secretary gives Madden a look as he exits, then joins
               the captain who's standing...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      46.


               BY AN AWARDS CASE holding glass bowls and trophies presented
               to the Captain over the years for Civic Service.

               The Secretary wraps her arms around him from behind as he
               looks at his loot.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Idiots.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Sssshhhh.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         You're the only one who makes it
                         go away.

               As he turns toward her embrace, CAMERA ADJUSTS to point up
               something we may have noticed...

               IN THE CASE - A STUFFED BIRD, on one of the glass shelves.
               CUT TO:

               EXT. RANDALL HOUSE - NIGHT

               CAMERA CREEPS toward the large stone house. A light comes
               on at one end of the lower floor, shining through the
               window.

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - NATHAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Erin works at her father's desk under the light of an
               antique floor lamp. Using a LETTER OPENER to PRY open...

               A DESK DRAWER full of files. She flips through, finds a
               manila file marked--DELT. Takes it out. ERIN lays the file
               open on the desktop.

               EMPTY. She checks...

               A SMALL PAPER SHREDDER under the desk. Judging from the
               paper spaghetti in the basket underneath, recently used.
               ERIN scoops up the shreds of paper. No way to reassemble
               this.

                                     RANDALL
                              (trying to be casual)
                         What are you doing there?

               Erin's a terrible liar, spooked as he approaches.

                                     ERIN
                         I think I dropped an earring.

                                     RANDALL
                         Looks like you have them both on.

               She jumps up as her father reaches the desk, keeps her
               distance. He spots the empty DELT folder, closes it.

                                     ERIN
                         Alex Corvis didn't kill Lauren.
                         Cops did. Didn't they?

               No response.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         You're in with them.

                                     RANDALL
                         It's not what you think.

                                     ERIN
                         You killed her!

                                     RANDALL
                         No.

                                     ERIN
                         Stay away from me! Stay away!

                                     RANDALL
                         Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.

               Erin SCREAMS, runs out the door with her hands over her
               ears. He misses a beat, then RUNS after her.

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT FOYER - NIGHT

               Nathan catches up with her as she frantically grabs CAR
               KEYS out of a dish by the front door.

               He grabs hold of her arm, she struggles, CLAWS at his face
               to get loose. Squeaks out the door onto...

               EXT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

               Erin runs to the far side of the big Benz, parked in the
               driveway. Tries the door. The ALARM goes off.

                                     RANDALL
                         They killed her because she found
                         out.

                                     ERIN
                         About you.

                                     RANDALL
                         About them. You've got to leave it
                         alone.

               ACROSS THE STREET, A PORCH LIGHT comes on. Erin hits a
               button on the key ring, CHIRP CHIRP. It stops.

                                     RANDALL (CONT'D)
                         Sweetheart...

                                     ERIN
                         Don't call me that! Don't call me
                         anything!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      48.


               A NEIGHBOR opens the door, peers at them from across the
               street. Inquisitive.

                                     RANDALL
                         I would never hurt you or Lauren.
                         Never. Believe me.

                                     ERIN
                         I don't believe you.

                                     RANDALL
                         Please. Come inside.

                                     ERIN
                         I'm never going back in that house
                         again. Get away.

               He edges away from the car, reluctantly. She starts to get
               in, anger giving way to extreme sadness.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                              (crying now)
                         They killed Alex for something you
                         did, daddy. You killed both of
                         them.

               She gets in the car. Starts it. ERRRKKKK! She peels out
               backward down the driveway.

               SLAMS the car into Drive and tears off down the street.
               The Neighbor shakes her head at Nathan, goes back inside.

               INT. TENEMENT - THOMAS LEONARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               WHAM! Thomas Leonard bounces off the wall, drops to the
               floor.

               A FEMALE FIGURE wipes through frame, throws herself on
               Larkin, who's roughing up Tommy.

                                     TOMMY'S WIFE
                         Please! Leave him alone!

               Larkin backhands her sprawling to the floor, where she
               crawls to the WAILING BABY, takes him in sheltering arms.

                                     TOMMY
                         I'm not making this up. He had a
                         crow with him.

                                     LARKIN
                         Caw, caw, that's what you're telling
                         me.

                                     TOMMY
                         He said I lied at his trial. It's
                         Alex Corvis.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      49.


                                     LARKIN
                         So we're talking... a ghost. With
                         a pet bird.

               Tommy nods.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         Turn down that fucking baby!

               The baby's gets quieter as the mom rocks it.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         Get up, Tommy. I want to show you
                         something.

               Larkin helps Tommy to his feet. Places "The List" on the
               table. Then RAMS Tommy's face down on top of it.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         You see that? My name's next on
                         his list. It's fucking next.

               Larkin hauls Tommy back upright. Dazed.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         So who is the guy, Tommy?

                                     TOMMY
                         Corvis. It's...

                                     LARKIN
                              (cutting him off)
                         Take your time. Think before you
                         speak. Cause at this point I got
                         to hear something besides the crap
                         you're been spewing.

               KA-CHUNK. Toomey cycles his 9mm. Everything dead silent.

                                     TOMMY
                         He said the whole trial was a setup.
                         That I caused an innocent kid to
                         die. Is that true?

               Larkin grimaces. The only question is how to end this.

               EXT. TENEMENT - ALLEY - NIGHT

               Madden stands by a plainwrap ,calmly SMOKING.

               A SCREAM above. He looks up to see CRASH!

               Tommy's BODY breaks through a window four floors up and
               falls with broken glass, landing by Madden who rubs his
               temple a second, then calmly grinds out the butt.

               INT. TENEMENT - THOMAS LEONARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Tommy's wife horrified, pleading, as Toomey raises his

                                     TOMMY'S WIFE
                         No, please...

               Her voice stops mid-sentence as BAM.

               The baby still crying as Toomey takes aim again, then lowers
               his weapon, starts to leave the room with Larkin. At the
               door, Toomey turns and BAM!

               The crying stops.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               CLOSE. A diminished field of Chess Pieces. ADJUST to include
               Walsh, scrutinizing the board.

                                     WALSH
                         Alex?

               He looks out the window a second. Then scans the room again.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                         C'mon. I'm talking to my myself
                         here. It's humiliating.

               Walsh goes back to the board, makes a move.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                         Check and mate.

                                     ALEX
                         Dream on.

               Walsh looks up. Nothing. Then Alex steps from the shadows.
               Walsh looks at him a long moment, sees through the makeup.

                                     WALSH
                         My God. It's really you under there.

               The two guys look at each other a long moment, cross the
               few steps to hug. Walsh blown away.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                         I'd like to say you're looking
                         good, but...

               Walsh leans in, examines Dutton's BADGE on Alex's costume.

                                     ALEX
                         Two down. Two to go.

                                     WALSH
                         "Down?" Wait, don't tell me.

                                     ALEX
                         The cops from my trial. They killed
                         Lauren. The whole thing was fixed.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                              (off Walsh)
                         You think I'm crazy.

                                     WALSH
                         I'm thinking... that explains a
                         lot.

               Walsh sits down. Disturbed.

                                     ALEX
                         Lauren's father's involved. He
                         bought the cops fancy cars, I don't
                         know what else. It's a company
                         called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren
                         found out.

                                     WALSH
                         What do they do that they had to
                         kill her?

                                     ALEX
                         I was hoping you'd find out.

                                     WALSH
                         Yeah. I sure will.

               They both turn as the Crow lands in the window, CAWS.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                              (at the bird)
                         Boo!

               The Crow flies off. Walsh goes to the window and looks
               out.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                         What's the deal with this bird.
                         It's been hanging around. Alex?

               He turns toward Alex, who's gone. A double take as Walsh
               gets it, whips around, looks out the window again. CUT TO:

               EXT. REMOTE ROAD - FOREST - NIGHT

               Far above a solitary car winding through an old-growth
               forest, its headlights stabbing the darkness.

               The Crow soars into frame, watching.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. OLD GROWTH GROVE - NIGHT

               A simple WOODEN CROSS illuminated by the headlights of the
               Big Benz as it pulls off the road into the grove of huge
               trees dripping with moss.

               IN THE BENZ Erin blank as she turns off the car, leaving
               the headlights on. Silence.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      52.


               WITH ERIN as she steps from the car, walks toward the cross.
               Partway there...

               CAW! Erin looks up, finds the Crow fluttering in to perch
               high overhead. Alex emerges from behind a tree, near the
               cross.

                                     ALEX
                         This is where it happened. Right
                         over here.

                                     ERIN
                         Yeah, I know.

               She stays where she is. Alex quiet, affected by the place.
               Erin's about to lose it.

                                     ALEX
                         Are you ok?

                                     ERIN
                         When Lauren was missing the police
                         came to our house. They said they
                         were looking for her, right?
                              (breaking down)
                         But I know now they had her, and
                         the reason they brought her here
                         and knew the could blame it on
                         you...

                                     ALEX
                         No...

                                     ERIN
                         ... is that I sent them here. I
                         told them she came here sometimes.
                         With her dirtball boyfriend. That's
                         exactly what I said.

               She's crying softly. He draws nearer.

                                     ALEX
                         Erin. It's not your fault.

                                     ERIN
                              (losing it now)
                         It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish
                         I were dead.

                                     ALEX
                         No. You don't.

                                     ERIN
                         Yes I do, I really do.

               Seeming to lose patience, Alex lunges at her, like an
               attack.

                                     ALEX
                         There were four of them.

                                     ERIN
                         No...

               He's holding his hands over her eyes, transferring IMAGES
               that shake them both.

               ALEX/ERIN'S INTERNAL POV Jolting FLASHES.

               A Plainwrap stops where the Mercedes is now.

               A hand slams the car into Park. Doors open. Four men get
               out, seen dimly, but they're Dutton, Erlich, Larkin, Toomey.

               Erlich reaches back in to drag Lauren out of the back seat,
               her hands cuffed in front of her.

               Dutton flips up her skirt with his nightstick.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE
                         Four large men. And still...

               Lauren stumbles into Erlich, grabs and BAM! FLASH!

               He takes a shot in the leg from his own, still holstered
               weapon.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         She grabbed one of their guns. Got
                         off a shot, then ran, ran for her
                         life.

               RESUME - PRESENT Erin's covering her face, like trying to
               avoid seeing some horrible thing.

                                     ERIN
                         I don't want to know.

               Alex grabs Erin, forces her to run with him, awkwardly,
               like a three legged race. Tracing the path Lauren covered.

                                     ALEX
                         She ran. Them breathing down her
                         neck...

               Erin stumbling as Alex pushes, cajoles her, the two of
               them running toward a large tree, MATCHING to...

               ALEX/ERIN'S INTERNAL POV Lauren stumbling, her cuffed hands
               hindering, tree limbs hitting her face.

               Her own panting subsumed in the panting of the cops on her
               heels.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE
                         ... all the way from the road to
                         this tree...

               RESUME - PRESENT Erin still trying not to see. Alex forcing
               her.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      54.


                                     ALEX
                         This tree. Here's where it happened.

                                     ERIN
                         I don't want to see!

               Alex spins her up against the tree and we MATCH to...

               ALEX/ERIN'S INTERNAL POV Lauren an adrenaline crazed fighter
               destined to lose. Her movements UNDERCRANKED, strobed.
               Discontinuous and jarring.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE
                         She turned and faced them and went
                         down kicking and punching and
                         fighting them, fighting death as
                         they stabbed her and stabbed her.
                         Fifty three times.

               The brutal cops overwhelm Lauren. She drops to the ground
               as...

               RESUME Erin drops to the forest floor, convulsed in sobs.

                                     ALEX
                         She fought for her life because
                         life is worth living.

               Alex panting. Fierce.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Think about that. And then tell me
                         how much you wish you were dead.

               Off Erin, sobbing, heartbroken. Alex's fury waning as he
               looks at her, wonders if he did the right thing.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               Armed men and barbed wire. The Spotlight FLARES and we're...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE HALLWAY - NIGHT

               An odd foursome approaches from the far end of the hall.
               Mercer escorts Madden, the Captain, and the Secretary who
               hangs on her bosses arm, gawking like a tourist.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Why wasn't the incident reported?

                                     MERCER
                         Nothing to report. All inmates
                         were present and accounted for.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         So you pretended nothing happened.

                                     MERCER
                         Hey, Corvis fried. I don't really
                         see how it could be him.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         No. I wouldn't expect you to.

               They all enter...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE - NIGHT

               Mercer goes to the locker where he left Alex.

                                     MERCER
                         Be forewarned. Nature takes its
                         toll.
                              (opens locker)
                         Bon appetit.

               The all look inside. The locker is empty. Mercer's the
               only one shocked. He noisily opens and shuts the other
               lockers looking for Alex.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         You lost him! Now lay off the
                         fucking doors!

               Mercer stops, backs off, gives the power trio some space.

                                     MADDEN
                         They botched the execution.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Could say that.

                                     MADDEN
                         Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard
                         was right.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Maybe you were a little harsh on
                         him.

               They watch now as the Secretary moves, drawn to the mirror.

                                     SECRETARY (CONT'D)
                         Babe?

               She's looking at... T

               HE FRACTURED MIRROR. Shards of glass selectively removed
               forming, we see now, a CROW.

                                     MADDEN
                         Fucking crow.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Sign of the dead come back to life.

               Madden turns, not comfortable with the concept.

                                     MADDEN
                         How about sign of a big black bird?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         The dead can return, given
                         sufficient motivation. And Corvis
                         has that.

                                     SECRETARY
                         This guy David Jenkins came back
                         as a ghost because my uncle owed
                         him four dollars. Followed him
                         everywhere. Ruined his life.

                                     MADDEN
                         Time out. You really saying he's
                         back from beyond?

               The Secretary nestles into the Captain, who whispers in
               her ear. He nods.

                                     MADDEN (CONT'D)
                         Cause if you're losing your mind,
                         I got a right to know.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         He's looking for something. Won't
                         stop until he finds it.
                              (then)
                         Sometimes the best way to get rid
                         of someone is to let them have
                         what they want.

                                     SECRETARY
                         The man...

                                     ALEX
                         ... with the scar...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. OLD GROWTH GROVE - NIGHT

               WIDE. Erin sits cross-legged in the HEADLIGHTS of the Benz.
               Alex perches Crow-like on the hood.

                                     ALEX
                         ... took everything I ever cared
                         about. Left me with nothing.

                                     ERIN
                         So you're going to kill him?

                                     ALEX
                         Have to find him first.

               He closes his eyes. Pained at a memory.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You know what Lauren and I were
                         fighting about that night? She had
                         a secret, wouldn't tell me...

                                     ERIN
                         My father.

                                     ALEX
                         All I knew, she was pulling away.
                         It made me crazy.

                                     ERIN
                         I used to be so proud of him. My
                         big deal daddy. And now, he's just
                         a crook. Worse even. And the weird
                         thing is...

               She fights back tears. Gains strength.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         I wish I could hate him but I can't.
                         He said he'd never hurt either of
                         us, and I know it's true and...
                         I'm going back.

                                     ALEX
                         It's what Lauren would do.

               Erin nods, takes the Locket off her neck.

                                     ERIN
                         I want to forget. Forget what I
                         know. Forget myself. Forget
                         everything.

               She winds up to toss the Locket away and Alex hops down
               off the hood. Stops her. Takes the Locket. ALEX

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                              (re: Locket)
                         Keep it. Because it connects you
                         to Lauren. And it connects you to
                         me.

               He fastens the Locket back around her neck. A covenant.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         No matter what happens I'll make
                         sure everyone knows. That you're
                         innocent. That you loved her. I
                         promise.

               CLOSE. Erin pulls some makeup out of her jacket pocket.
               Dumps it on the ground. Finds a pot of dark eyeshadow among
               the containers.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         I don't want to be me anymore.
                         Make me like you.

               Erin's face blasted WHITE by HEADLIGHTS.

               She closes her eyes as Alex begins the first bold lines
               around her eyes and for a moment in the gauzy white light,
               she could be...

               LAUREN opens her eyes a second, smiles, shuts them again.

               WIDER. Alex paints Erin's face in the Benz headlights, the
               two of them kneeling in the forest-cathedral.

               Camera creeps BACKWARD, leaving the two of them connected
               by ritual. And touch. And a promise to each other.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. RANDALL'S HOUSE - NATHAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               CLOSE. A mess of documents. Nathan nervously writing,
               assembling a tell-all at his desk.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         You know it doesn't work this way.

               Nathan gets up. Tries to subtly herd the Captain off.

                                     NATHAN
                         I'm out of this.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Partnerships don't end like that.
                         Friendships don't.

                                     NATHAN
                         Our friendship ended when Lauren
                         died.

               The Captain circles to the desk now, past Nathan.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan?
                         Because there's a ghost threatening
                         us.

                                     RANDALL
                         You mean Alex.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I mean Lauren.

               The Captain flips through some of the papers on the desk.
               Frowns. He closes a file folder.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Because you never accepted that
                         what happened to her was an
                         accident.

                                     RANDALL
                         You killed my daughter.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         An accident, Nathan.

                                     RANDALL
                              (exploding now)
                         She was eighteen years old! There
                         were four of them. They stabbed
                         her fifty three times! Where's the
                         fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is
                         it?!

               Nathan furious. The Captain keeps a preternatural calm.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I watched her grow up. Just like
                         you. I know how her mind worked.
                         She kept snooping around because
                         she was worried about you. What
                         you'd gotten yourself into. So
                         stop blaming me. And blame yourself.

                                     RANDALL
                              (beat, quietly)
                         I do. Every day.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Erin knows, doesn't she?

               This catches Nathan off guard. He starts to say something.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Don't even bother. You never were
                         a good liar.

               The Captain flips through the papers on the desk again.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Look at this. Everything we worked
                         for. You tell me... what are we
                         going to do?

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

               HEADLIGHTS approach from down the street. The Big Benz
               pulls into the empty driveway.

               Erin alone in the car, her mood tough to judge in the Crow
               mask.

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT FOYER - NIGHT

               Erin enters, steels herself. Then she calls out...

                                     ERIN
                         Dad?! You home?

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

               UNDERWATER. Erin plunges her masked face into the wash
               basin in this white-tiled bathroom.

               ANGLE - ERIN A few SLO-MO DROPLETS cascade off her face
               into basin as she scrutinizes herself in the mirror, wipes
               off the mask.

               CAMERA INCHING forward...

               She listens up. Grabs a Towel to blot the water on her
               face. We begin to hear with her...

               DRIP. DRIP. DRIP...

               She tightens the sink faucets. The sound continues DRIP
               DRIP as she moves to...

               THE CLAWFOOT BATHTUB Faucet not dripping, but the sound is
               louder. DRIP DRIP. Erin grabs the shower curtain, whips it
               back REVEALING...

               NATHAN RANDALL behind the tub, face a mask of gore, blown
               off point blank by the BLOODY HANDGUN on the tile next to
               him. ERIN screams.

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               CLOSE. The Chess set. A few pieces moved off the board
               now. Alex not looking at it. He's looking at the picture
               of himself and Lauren taped in the lid of the Chess box.

                                     WALSH

                         through, so I checked out Tommy
                         Leonard.

               Alex picks up the BLACK KING.

                         Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't
                         matter. I want the King.

               Alex places the picture of himself with Lauren back in the
               box of chess pieces, against the open lid.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                         Places like that, they're about
                         unreported cash, processing money
                         from drugs, prostitution.
                              (then)
                         I took a chance, called asking for
                         Larkin and Toomey, the two other
                         cops. Whoever answered said "they're
                         not here...
                              (meaningfully)
                         ... this is the front office."

               BAM BAM BAM.

               They look up. A shadow banging on the door. Leaving BLOODY
               SMEARS on the outside of the frosted glass.

                                     ERIN
                         Alex!

               Walsh opens the door and Erin enters, wild and blood
               smeared, remnants of the Crow mask around her eyes.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         They killed my dad.

               It all catches up with her now, the flight, the exhaustion.
               She throws herself into his arms.

                                     ALEX
                         It's ok, it's ok...

                                     ERIN
                         It's not. I can't take it.

                                     ALEX
                         Erin. Who?

                                     ERIN
                         I don't know. I found him lying
                         there.

               Alex immobilized by this. He turns to Walsh.

                                     ALEX
                         Where is it? This place?

                                     WALSH
                         I think we should get some support?

                                     ALEX
                         What? Call the police?

                                     ERIN
                         What is this? Where are you going?

               Alex waiting for an address. Finally...

                                                                      62.


                                     WALSH
                         1315 Berkeley Street.

                                     ERIN
                         Don't leave me. Please.

               Alex turns to her, comforting. Holds her face in his hands.

                                     ALEX
                         It will be over soon.
                              (then)
                         Watch out for each other.

               He heads off and we PRE-LAP sexbomb death metal POUNDING...
               CUT TO:

               INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT

               More debauched than our previous visit. Darker, more
               crowded.

               Patrons propositioned in front of our eyes by girls barely
               eighteen. The room writhing.

               ON THE MAINSTAGE the "Cop" strippers we saw before, but
               dangerous seeming, as they pantomime an interrogation, a
               handcuffed "perp" manhandled between them.

               AT THE ENTRANCE Alex blows past people waiting to get in,
               creating enough disturbance that TWO BOUNCERS greet him.

                                     ALEX
                         Toomey and Larkin. They're expecting
                         me.

               The Two Bouncers give each other a look. One points to a
               SIGN on the wall: "You must be 21..."

                                     BOUNCER
                         I need to see some I.D., pal. Circus
                         in town?

               The Other Bouncer grabs Alex as he pushes past. Alex heaves
               him into the line of WAITING PATRONS.

               As they go down like dominoes... the First Bouncer pulls a
               GUN.

                                     ALEX
                         I don't think you want to do that.
                         Lot of innocent people here...
                              (looks around)
                         A lot of people, anyway.

               As Alex starts off... BAM! He's blown back by a shot half
               lost in the noisy club. No panic yet.

               ONSTAGE the strippers break character, looking. The audience
               turns as...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      63.


               NEAR THE ENTRANCE The First Bouncer goes flying above the
               heads of the crowd, getting off a dramatic SHOT while
               airborne, inducing...

               PANDEMONIUM Patrons stampeding as BAM BAM!  Alex taking
               bullets, the miracle lost in the chaotic exit. The Bouncers
               out of sight underfoot.

               ON ALEX visible again, back on his feet. Buffeted,
               stationary as everyone flees. With the exodus still at
               flood stage...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               ON WALSH, in motion as he puts on a jacket, throws some
               papers into a briefcase. He's nervous, ill-suited for this
               cloak and dagger stuff, chattering...

                                     WALSH
                         We'll be safe in my car. Nobody
                         will recognize it. Let's move yours
                         in back, no, down the block. Hope
                         it's nothing fancy. There's a chop
                         shop around the corner.

               She's looking elsewhere, at the door that has quietly
               opened. The Captain stands there. Somber reptile. Holding
               a sheaf of papers in one hand.

                                     ERIN
                         You followed me here.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         No... Erin, I put out a bulletin
                         on your car because... there's bad
                         news. And I thought you should
                         hear it from me.

               She stares at him expressionless.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Your father got involved with some
                         bad cops. On my force, so I take
                         responsibility.
                              (beat, then)
                         He killed himself.

               She talks with great difficulty.

                                     ERIN
                         How?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         How did he kill himself?

               She nods.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      64.


                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         With a gun. Is that what you mean?

                                     ERIN
                         No. I mean... how did he kill
                         himself How do you figure he killed
                         himself--with a gun, right--when
                         it wasn't anywhere near where you
                         found him?

               He takes a step toward her. She pulls out the Blood Pistol.
               Seems crazy enough to use it.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         You killed him.

                                     WALSH
                         Erin. Don't.

                                     ERIN
                         Back the fuck off! Now!

               The Captain stops, gently tosses the sheaf of papers toward
               her, onto Walsh's desk.

               The papers Nathan was preparing. Walsh looks at them
               while...

                                     CAPTAIN
                         He left this. Names, addresses, a
                         note to you. These people he was
                         involved with killed Lauren. He
                         couldn't bear it anymore.

                                     WALSH
                         My God. He's right, it's all here.

                                     ERIN
                         The note. Show it to me.

               Erin has one eye on the papers now, recognizes her dad's
               hand. The Captain inches forward.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                              (to Captain)
                         Not you!
                              (to Walsh)
                         Show it to me.

               The Captain steps forward, right to the desk. Erin backed
               into a corner now.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         It's right there, under that paper.
                              (grabs a note)
                         Here. Look.

               She holds a hand out for the note, taking her eye off the
               situation for one second as she reads...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      65.


               THE NOTE A bunch of numbers added together in her father's
               hand. Not a suicide note.

               THE CAPTAIN grabs Erin's wrist and BAM!

               A chunk of the ceiling falls as the weapon discharges. The
               Captain throws her in a chokehold, her finger still on the
               trigger.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         You were always the stupid one.

               She fights as the Captain wraps his own hand over hers,
               wrestles her arm toward Walsh, in the sights now. BAM!

               WALSH blown backward, collapsing by the Chess Board. Trying
               to pull himself up. Erin struggling. As...

               MADDEN enters from the hall, in a hurry, gun drawn.

                                     MADDEN
                         You need help?

               He nods toward Walsh, who is moving, barely.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Hurry. We don't have much time.

               BAM. A shot from Madden drops Walsh for god. As Madden
               drags Walsh toward the door, the Captain grabs...

               THE PICTURE OF ALEX AND LAUREN pulled off the lid of the
               Chess box, one of the pieces of tape left behind. The
               Captain exits.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT

               MUSIC STILL POUNDS, lights swirl. But the club has cleared
               out, leaving human detritus, a handful of casualties from
               the stampede.

               WITH ALEX as he steps over the Two Bouncers, expired on
               the floor.

               A soft WHIMPERING marks the silence.  The girl cuffed
               onstage. Alex goes up to the terrified girl.

               Close up, she looks way underage. He gathers her clothes,
               spots a key on the floor.

                                     ALEX
                         How old are you?

               She listens as he unlocks the cuffs.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You have one chance to value your
                         life. Take it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      66.


               He watches as she hightails it out the front door, still
               half naked. As she leaves...

               THE CROW appears in the doorway near the broken bodies.
               Alex takes a deep breath, as if it hurts.

               The casualties. CAW. The Crow flies on, disappearing into
               the back rooms. Alex turns, follows...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

               Alex moves past the empty makeup table. A lipstick cigarette
               smolders in an ashtray. People left in a hurry. MUSIC LOUD,
               as if inside our heads now. Alex continues...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY

               Nobody home. Empty images refreshed every six seconds.
               Number of hits static now. Alex drawn now by the "No
               Admittance" Curtain which he approaches slowly, touching
               it and FLASH!

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV - LAUREN looking over her shoulder,
               pulling back the "No Admittance" Curtain, going where she
               shouldn't go.

                                     ALEX
                         Lauren? You were here?

               Lauren makes her stealthy way into....

               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK HALL - NIGHT

               revealed as Alex slips past the Curtain, retracing Lauren's
               footsteps. CAMERA FOLLOWS Alex CREEPING down the hall to...

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV - LAUREN down the hall, peering inside
               the partially open Back Room door, then turning back
               startled TOWARD CAMERA as if suddenly overtaken.

               AT THE DOOR Alex turns back, like Lauren, looks behind
               him. The hallway is empty. He enters...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

               Darkness. As Alex gropes for a lightswitch, a LIGHTER
               FLARES. Toomey and Larkin lean in, light up in synch.

               Alex takes in the dark fringes, dim reflections off lots
               of eyes. Not taxidermy specimens.

               BAM BAM BAM BAM.

               A dozen police officers lining the walls empty cartridges
               into Alex in an angry, STROBING fusillade. In the silence
               that follows...

                                     LARKIN
                              (after the fact)
                         Don't move.

               The gang LAUGHS. Larkin makes his way to a light switch by
               the door.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         Drinks are on me.

               Larkin flips on the low-watt BARE BULBS hanging down past
               industrial pipes and conduit, casting a dim light on the
               cinderblock space.

               NO ALEX.

                                     ALEX
                         Cheers.

               They look up and... BAM! Alex DROPS LARKIN with a shot to
               the forehead. BAM!

               He MISSES TOOMEY as bullets from below EXPLODE all around
               him. Alex scampers across framing as...

               The BARE BULBS burst, all but one, plunging us back in to
               near darkness as Alex drops to the ground near Larkin's
               fallen body. Jacks up the sleeve. No scar. Alex spots
               Toomey, rolls out as...

               THREE COPS pump rounds into Alex. BAM!

               Alex takes the middle Cop out, a TOONEY-LIKE GUY who falls
               onto Toomey, behind him. ALEX turns, forced to defend
               himself as FULL AUTO FIRE breaks open, the other flank,
               more advancing cops. While...

               TOOMEY crawls out from under the fallen copy, then backs
               out the door on hands and knees while...

               A FINAL EXPLOSIVE FUSILLADE leaves only Alex standing. As
               the echoes dissolve...

               Alex Alex moves to where Toomey was, bends down to check
               the body...

               THE NAMEPLATE - "TOOMEY" But the pin isn't fastened
               properly.

               The badge askew. RESUME - ALEX rolls the body over, finds
               another nameplate underneath. "Hauser."  Heads off in search
               of...

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Toomey!

               INT - "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY - NIGHT

               Toomey is clearing the "No Admittance" curtain when...

                                     ALEX
                         You dripped something!

               Toomey panics as he approaches...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      68.


               INTERNET FANTASY SETS Monitors still updating every six
               seconds. Toomey hears Alex coming, slips through the
               "Dungeon."

               BEHIND THE SHOWER FANTASY SET Toomey takes refuge out of
               sight, next to a GAS HOT WATER HEATER, quiet as a mouse.
               ALEX tears the "No Admittance" curtain completely off its
               rod, arriving at the fantasy sets just in time to see...

               THE DUNGEON MONITOR Toomey (frozen) scurrying through.
               Gone now as the monitor updates. Then Alex appears,
               following him through the set...

               WITH ALEX moving to the rear of the "dungeon," on Toomey's
               heels. WAM. Toomey hits him full force with A PIPE, sending
               Alex sprawling backward, COLLAPSING the flimsy Shower set.

               WAM. Toomey swings again, misses Alex, but connects with...

               THE GAS LINE to the water heater ripped out by the blow.
               HISS. The sound of gas, loud, as the line breaks.

               RESUME Alex straddles Toomey, just as Toomey manages to
               get his gun pointed in Alex's face. Hissing gas nearby.

               CLICK. Toomey cocks the gun.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Spark, gas... bad combination. And
                         it's not this leak here, that's
                         the least of your worries.

               WAM! Alex swings Toomey's pipe HARD at a much bigger GAS
               LINE right behind the gas heater, leaving it badly cracked.
               The hiss magnified 100% nos.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         We're going to play a little game
                         called "Who's got the Scar."

                                     TOOMEY
                         What Scar? What fucking scar?

                                     ALEX
                              (buzzer sound)
                         AAAANK. That's not how we play the
                         game.

               Alex jacks Toomey's sleeve down. No Scar. Alex pissed as
               Toomey locks eyes with him. Really seeing him now.

                                     TOOMEY
                         You're him! You're Corvis! We fried
                         your ass. You're dead, man!

                                     ALEX
                         Good thing in a situation like
                         this.

               We pick up...

                                                                      69.


               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

               Some light filters in as a door opens to the outside. A
               FIGURE enters, squats among the bodies. He leans in, closes
               larkin's eyes, and we see...

               It's Madden. Blood on his hands. He hears Alex's VOICE
               faintly, then Toomey cries out in pain. Madden moves
               toward...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY - NIGHT

               Madden creeps down the hallway to the back room. VOICES
               growing louder.

                                     TOOMEY
                         Fucking Zombie.

                                     ALEX
                         The scar.

                                     TOOMEY
                         There is no scar. I'm telling you.

               As Madden moves toward the conversation, his face registers
               the slightest of smiles.

               MADDEN'S CREEPING POV MONITORS obliquely visible as he
               reaches the end of the hall by the Fantasy sets. The
               "Shower" monitor shows Alex and Toomey, visible through
               the trashed set, updated every six seconds.

               MADDEN SNIFFS gas. The HISS now audible along with Alex's
               voice. Madden smiles. Pulls out his 9mm.

               And BACKS UP, away from the Fantasy Sets toward the back
               room. Madden takes aim at...

               THE FIRST MONITOR The images is Alex threatening Toomey.
               Updating now--LOSING ALEX on the Monitor as he steps into
               frame in person, looks up and BAM!

               CROWVISION a speeding bullet passes narrowly by and...

               ANGLE - GROUND ZERO as the bullet hits the monitor in a
               shower of sparks, followed by...

               BOOM! A ROILING FIREBALL Seems to vaporize Alex before
               flying down the hallway right at CAMERA.

               Madden manages a couple steps in retreat before it blows
               him into the back room with a deafening roar.

               EXT. "THE HOLE" - INFERNO - NIGHT

               BOOM! Windows blow out in a gas fired inferno. A body flung
               out the rear door. BOOM!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      70.


               EXT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT

               Interior/exterior being less meaningful than seconds ago.
               Walls crumbled, roof blown off.

               BRIGHT FIRE consumes the frame, consumes the bodies of
               downed cops, consumes every last bit of oxygen and life.
               Distant SIRENS draw closer.

               A SLOW SCAN, someone's OBSTRUCTED POV of Hell.

               INCLUDE ALEX watching from under a collapsed cinderblock
               wall that offers some protection from the flames, if not
               the heat. He looks, intent now, spotting...

               THE ARM WITH THE ZIGZAG SCARIFICATION sticking out of the
               rubble, murky through the flames, growing clearer as camera
               PUSHES, flames licking at it...

               ALEX tries to move toward the arm. Forced back by too-
               intense flame as another beam falls, the rubble shifts
               and...

               THE ARM WITH THE ZIGZAG SCARIFICATION skeletal now, baked
               down to bones. A dozen short metal rods on the ground under
               it. He picks a few up. THE CAPTAIN drawn now to...

               UNDER THE RUBBLE - WHERE ALEX WAS water dripping off the
               concrete, collecting in the place where Alex hid. But he's
               long gone. The Captain drops the rods. Satisfied it's over.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. CITY STREET #5 - NIGHT

               Alex staggers along in bad shape. Up ahead...

               A GIRL in her twenties exits a building down a flight of
               stairs, waits at the bottom for her BOYFRIEND, who's locking
               the door. She sees Alex, gives him an empathetic look.
               Alex walks slowly closer.

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Lauren appearing to him, playing their
               game. But the words are wrong, distorted.

                                     LAUREN
                         Your witness list is no match for
                         my kung fu.

               Her Bruce Lee "Oooo" a siren call. RESUME Alex moving slowly
               forward on the street, drawn toward the girl who watches
               with horrified fascination.

                                     ALEX
                         I'm losing you.

                         Your zigzag love scar is no match
                         for...

               Lauren and Alex drawing very close now when... RESUME WAM.
               A FIST clocks Alex in the face, dropping him hard onto the
               pavement.

                                     GIRL
                         Did you have to do that?

                                     BOYFRIEND
                         How about "thank you."

                                     GIRL
                         He's bleeding.

                                     ALEX
                         I don't bleed.

                                     BOYFRIEND
                         And delirious. Better steer clear.

               ALEX'S POV

               The Guy wraps his arm protectively around the girl, walks
               her off. Running into a COP at the next intersection. They
               POINT at...

               ALEX takes off, ducking into an alley. Confused.

               CAMERA CREEPS BACKWARD as he gathers his thoughts.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               RATTLE RATTLE. Alex's shadow visible through the frosted
               glass, jostling the locked door.

                                     ALEX
                         Erin!

               SMASH. His arm PUNCHES through the glass, turn the knob.
               Alex enters, arm bleeding badly. He yanks a large piece of
               glass from his flesh. Painful.

               Alex registers that the rules have changed. He finds a
               necktie of Walsh's, uses it to bind the wound, staunch the
               flow. He scans the room again looking for...

               Something. But everything seems ok. He passes...

               The Chess Box, the picture of Lauren and Alex gone. Just a
               piece of TAPE left, sticking to the top of the open lid.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      72.


               OVER THE CHESS BOARD - ALEX the missing pic lost on him,
               drawn to the chess board where Walsh collapsed. Something
               wrong with the game. He finds...

               THE BLACK KING Off the board. On top of a stack of news
               clippings lying on the floor.

               Alex picks it up, LEAVING a RING OF BLOOD under.

               CAMERA PUSHES on the clipping underneath, the headline
               "City Leaders Vow Crackdown in Wake of Randall Murder."
               PUSHING, finding among the City Leaders...

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         The King.

               THE CAPTAIN'S FACE circled in blood. Camera continues to
               PUSH on the grainy newsprint, through it, until all we see
               are halftone pixels and the picture loses meaning.

               EXT. CITY - AIRBORNE - NIGHT

               The Police Station in sinister CROWVISION as we approach,
               swoop in and...

               INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY

               Alex walks the long approach to the Captain's office, past
               the empty Secretary's desk. KICKING the door open CRASH!
               into...

               INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

               The Captain works alone at his desk under a standing lamp.
               Looks up unconcerned as Alex enters, walks to the desk,
               and SLAPS down the ring-of-blood clipping.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I hate that picture.

                                     ALEX
                         Where are they?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Can I get you something? A glass
                         of water? A transfusion?

                                     ALEX
                         Where are they? Last chance.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Or what? You'll bleed all over my
                         carpet?

               The Captain rises.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         You know crime was actually down
                         until you showed up, or stuck

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         around, or whatever the hell you're
                         doing here.
                              (then)
                         What are you doing here?

                                     ALEX
                         I'm looking for my friends.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         See, I heard you were looking for
                         some guy with a scar. How's that
                         going? You find him? Yes? No?

               Alex tenses as the Captain starts toward him.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         You are like the guest who would
                         not leave, you know that?  And
                         judging from your condition, maybe
                         you've overstayed your welcome.
                         That's not a criticism. Just an
                         observation.

               Alex draws the knife from his clothes.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         I don't think you're going to use
                         it. That's Lauren's knife.

               Enraged, Alex SWIPES the knife. The Captain grabs his arm
               right at the blood soaked necktie, squeezes hard. Alex
               writhes in pain. In each other's faces now.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         You come in here al lfull of
                         righteous indignation, but what
                         have you got to be righteous about?

               THE KNIFE starting to fall from Alex's hand as the Captain
               continues to clamp down on his wound.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         How many innocent people did you
                         leave dead back there?

                                     ALEX
                         You sent them. I had no choice.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Bullshit. You're a killer, that's
                         all you are. A clown with a bird
                         and a rising death toll. You think
                         the world did you wrong?! You did
                         the world wrong.

               The Captain snatches the knife, RAMS it into Alex's midriff.

               Alex in the chair. But his last words are different.

                                     ALEX
                         I loved Lauren. I never meant to
                         hurt her.

               ZAP. Electro-spasm as the switch is thrown. No scar, no

               Lauren's NECK is SLASHED, her body riddled with stab wounds.
               Alex has a big smile on his face, his arm around her, her

               The Captain drops Alex lifeless and bloody to the floor.
               Only the sound of the Captain panting now, then...

               The sound of slow clapping. Madden walks into the room
               from behind perimeter curtains.

                         You were right. Picture's worth a
                         thousand words.

               Madden kicks Alex lightly, nudging him. No life signes.
               The Captain rips the picture in two. Tosses it in the trash.

                                     CAPTAIN

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - NIGHT

               NEW ANGLE - THROUGH A WINDOW DARKLY Madden and the Captain
               grab Alex, one at each end.

                                     SECRETARY
                         He's cute. Was cute.

               REVEAL, this is the Secretary's POV through the window.
               She's bent over someone's toes, painting them BLUE.

               WIDE. The Mystery Room revealed. Taxidermy specimens line
               the wall and the table.

               Erin stands in PROFILE in the middle of the room, strangely
               silent, hands tied overhead by a rope that runs to the
               ceiling.

               The Secretary brushing polish on Erin's toes.

                                     SECRETARY (CONT'D)
                         But the face, well, makeup can
                         work for you or against you. Right?

               The Secretary applies a last flourish of polish, then
               stands, kisses Erin gently.

                                     SECRETARY (CONT'D)
                         All done. Very nice.
                              (then)
                         You're a good listener.

               The Secretary moves off REVEALING...

               ERIN'S FACE MOUTH SEWN shut in a rough zigzag stitch, like
               the scar. Her eyes dart as...

               THE DOOR opens. The Captain and Madden carry Alex in. Madden
               sweeps the TAXIDERMY SPECIMENS back with his hand, clearing
               a space for Alex on the table. Among them...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      77.


               THE CROW on its Corvus Brachyrhynchos stand takes a small
               hop backward, this sign of life unnoticed as...

               RESUME WHUMP. Alex heaved onto the table.

                                     MADDEN
                         So was he dead? Or alive?

               The Secretary puts her ear to Alex's lifeless lips.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I've seen birds stuffed and mounted
                         so lifelike you'd swear you saw
                         them breathing.

               This reminds him... he looks at the Crow on the stand.
               Lifeless, stuffed. As it should be.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Maybe we had a case of that here.
                              (to Secretary)
                         Get me my kit.

                                     MADDEN
                         You two are majorly demented. Anyone
                         ever tell you that?

               The Secretary steps off to grab thekit, leaving Alex's
               lifeless open eyes pointing toward Erin, reflected in his
               eyeballs first before...

               ANGLE - ERIN looking up at her own hands, bound above her
               as she eases them apart and...

               The HEART SHAPED LOCKET slips from between her palms and
               she closes them again in time to catch the chain, the locket
               swinging.

               ON THE TABLE X-CLOSE. The locket reflected in Alex's
               lifeless open eyes a second before...

               The Secretary returns, blocking the sightline. Lays out
               the Kit, nasty looking tools left over from the Inquisition.
               Then unbuttons Alex's tattered shirt, undressing him for
               the procedure.

               Stab wounds everywhere.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Fifty three?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         In all the excitement I kind of
                         lost count.
                              (then)
                         I think I'll mount him with his
                         head up his ass.

               A large KNIFE, the Lauren murder weapon, angles in at the
               base of Alex'sneck where the Secretary's head was.

               THE CROW - OVERCRANKED moves on the table. Takes flight.

               THE TRIO turn toward the commotion.

                         Grab it!

               THE LOCKET - OVERCRANKED Snatched in midair by the Crow
               from Erin's praying hands.

               Dim memories from the woods. Anamorphic and dark.

               released from the Crow's beak, passing through the TRIO'S
               HANDS uncaught, bouncing off Alex onto the table, in front
               of his open eyes.

               ALEX/CROW'S INTERNAL POV FLASH. AT GROUND LEVEL. Alex
               fastens the LOCKET around her neck. The distortion
               lessening, becoming Alex's POV.

                                     ALEX
                         ... it connects you to me...

                         innocent... I promise...

               FLASH. Alex painting her face.

               RESUME Alex BLINKS. The Captain reacts--oh shit--starts to
               bring the knife down, a hurried strike at Alex's chest.

               WAM! Alex grabs the Captain's arm in his hand, stopping
               the movement on a dime.

                                     ALEX
                         All lies. Everything you ever showed
                         me.

               MADDEN pulls a gun, points it at Erin. ALEX jumps up, flying
               INTO the gun as it goes off.

               CRASH! They tumble THROUGH THE WINDOW into the Captain's
               office while...

               THE CAPTAIN cuts down the rope holding Erin. She
               collapses...

               ON THE TABLE strewn with blades, secreting one between her
               hands, in the second before...

               THE CAPTAIN drags Erin off. The Secretary flails at the
               Crow with a metal ROD, while...

               IN THE CAPTAIN'S OFFICE Madden has the gun on Alex now.
               BAM! No effect. BAM!

                                                                      79.


               Madden sweating it now, continuing to shoot with no effect
               as...

               THE MYSTERY ROOM The Secretary finally connects with the
               Crow, batting it against the wall, noticing this coincides
               with...

               Alex goes flying against the desk, winged himself. Madden
               c Onfused, not understanding.

                                     SECRETARY (O.S.)
                         It's the bird! Kill it!

               Madden wheels, points the gun through the busted-out picture
               window into...

               The SECRETARY dives for cover as bullets explode around
               her. The Crow dancing, sprayed with debris.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               CLOSE. Floor lights sequence above the door, heading for
               underground parking.

               "5 - 4 - 3..." The Captain watches the lights. Erin is
               slumped face first against the side of the elevator opposite
               him.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         You brought him back. Good. He
                         owes you. We'll stick together,
                         you and I.

               ON ERIN face pressed against the elevator wall, intent.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Seen but not heard. They ought to
                         make it a law.

               Erin winces, looks down...

               THE BLADE emerging from her sleeve as she tries to hold it
               with her two bound hands. DING. The elevator jerks to a
               stop.

               THE CAPTAIN grabs her off the floor and she RAMS the blade
               into his abdomen with the force of the entire body. Twists
               it. The elevator doors open.

               ERIN pulls out the blade, claws her way out the door, the
               Captain hanging on to her, finally getting free as she
               swipes at him again, drawing fresh blood. Running now,
               into...

               INT. POLICE STATION - PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

               Erin stumbles between cars in the dark underground garage,
               cutting the cord off her hands, leaving it behind as...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      80.


               Behind her, the Captain unsteady on his feet, a wounded
               animal. He pulls out a GLOCK 9MM and KA-CHUNK. Cycles it.
               Erin dives between cars, scrambling on hands and knees.
               Looks around.

               HER POV - SCANNING a small garage with a few police cruisers
               by a SERVICE AREA and no people. A barred GATE over the
               exit. No way out.

               ERIN winces. Then stifles a cry as she cuts the stitches
               off her mouth with the knife. Drops the threads on the
               floor and moves off...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Alex runs past the glass AWARDS CASE, takes a flying leap
               behind the desk, seeking cover as Madden empties a clip at
               him.

               The slide ratchets back. Madden SLAMS another clip in,
               advances on Alex, hidden behind the shredded desk as...

               THE SECRETARY clears stuffed birds off the table trying to
               expose the wounded crow cowering back against the wall.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Here pretty bird. Here birdy.

               WHOP! She grabs it, the Crow flapping desperately as...

               IN THE CAPTAIN'S OFFICE Madden creeps up on the desk, peers
               over it. Nothing. Out of nowhere...

               WAM!  Alex rushes Madden, bulldozing him across the room
               with a pained cry of brute force toward...

               THE AWARDS CASE CRASH! Glass shatters as Alex hurls Madden,
               who swivels around in time to get off a last shot BAM!

               That collapses Alex to the floor.

               IN THE MYSTERY ROOM The Crow squeezes out of the Secretary's
               grasp, leaving her holding a couple feathers.

               AT THE AWARD'S CASE Alex hauls himself off the floor as
               the Crow joins him. Seeing...

               MADDEN'S HEAD has taken its place among glass bowls and
               trophies, half decapitated by the glass shelf it now rests
               on. Down the shelf from the stuffed bird. ALEX rushes
               through the blown out window into...

               Seeing for the first time that Erin is gone, the rope
               hanging from the ceiling, finding...

               THE SECRETARY

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      81.


                                     SECRETARY (CONT'D)
                         sitting on the floor, painting her
                         own toenails BLUE, leaning up
                         against the wall.

                                     ALEX
                         Where'd they go?

               Alex eases the Secretary to her feet with a hand around
               her neck, her back to the wall. She looks UP, smiling at...

               WALSH - RIGHT ARM MISSING hangs high overhead from some
               kind of hook. His arm has been crudely removed.

               Underneath him, on the table, a BOX of 2" surgical stainless
               steel rods sits by a pool of blood. ALEX yells, reeling,
               as...

               The door flies open. A half dozen cops in, all targeting
               Alex as...

               THE SECRETARY plunges the Lauren KNIFE in Alex's back. He
               spins violently THROWING her HARD against the wall. WAM!

               Surprise!-she sticks. REVEAL, she's impaled on ANTELOPE
               ANTLERS, hanging off the wall. Her head drops, looking
               down as a stream of blood flows down her legs, drips off
               her toes...

                                     SECRETARY
                              (dying words)
                         My nails.

               BAM BAM BAM. The new arrivals open fire. Alex reaches over
               his shoulder, yanks out the knife with an odd slurping
               sound as...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - PARKING GARAGE

               The sound of GUNFIRE filters down from above as the Captain
               hunts his hidden prey. He stops, studies...

               ERIN'S POV - LOW ANGLE LOOKING UNDER A CAR The Captain's
               feet, joined by his hand as he picks up the thread she
               left on the ground.

               INCLUDE ERIN

                                     SECRETARY
                         reproving herself as she turns
                         toward camera. She looks back under
                         the car, but...

               The Captain's feet have moved off. Where? She listens,
               hears nothing. Slips off...

               NEW ANGLE - ERIN takes refuge in the service area, crouching
               behind stacks of TIRES. Knife at the ready.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      82.


               The Captain's FOOTSTEPS audible.

               HER OBSTRUCTED POV between stacks of tires, the Captain,
               Glock at ready, PASSES BY, moving out of sight. Footsteps
               RECEDING. Then silent.

               ERIN Listening, neurons firing.  Cranes her neck to see.
               Nothing. WIDER the Captain appears BEHIND ERIN, over the
               stacks of tires. She's oblivious, then...

               Erin wheels, slashes across his wrist. The Glock falls,
               Erin grabs it, levels it at the Captain. Her finger tense
               on the trigger.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (re: gun)
                         I know you too well. You won't do
                         it.

                                     ERIN
                         You don't know me at all.

               BAM! She pulls the trigger, simultaneously wrenching the
               gun, aiming just enough off that...

               THE CAPTAIN yells in pain, rushes his hand to his ear, a
               bloody mess. He starts advancing again toward her and Erin
               pulls...

               THE TRIGGER again, again, again. No click, no blast.
               NOTHING.

               RESUME the Captain takes the gun from her. Shows her the
               CLIP he's carrying in his hand. Slams it into the gun.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         One in the chamber. That's all you
                         get.

               Erin SCREAMS as he drags her off now and...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - NIGHT

               THE CROW flies UP toward the small entry window. Alex
               follows, bullets exploding around him as he hauls himself
               up toward the windowledge.

               EXT. POLICE STATION - ROOFTOP

               ERRRKKK. The SOUND of a car in a hurry audible as Alex
               hauls himself out the small window. Runs to the edge,
               spotting...

               FAR BELOW a dark sedan leaving in a rush, wrapping around
               the corner of the police station now.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      83.


               INT. DARK SEDAN - TRAVELLING FAST - NIGHT

               The Captain nervous at the wheel. He looks over his
               shoulder...

               Erin's in the back seat, cuffed to the door handle.

               INT. POLICE STATION - MYSTERY ROOM

               The Sergeant and crew utterly speechless taking in the
               carnage.

                                     SERGEANT
                              (crossing himself)
                         Holy mother of God. The devil
                         himself.

               He looks up, where Alex vanished. Starts to climb.

               EXT. POLICE STATION - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Alex dashes over the articulated roof, trying to keep in
               sight...

               HIS MOVING POV partially obstructed, of the sedan below.
               Speeding around another corner now...

               ALEX alters course to cut the sedan off, jumping up onto a
               PARAPET where he totters over the vertical face as the
               sedan turning onto the street below.

               THE SERGEANT AND CREW emerge on the roof. Acquire target
               Alex Corvis.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Stop or...! Don't jump!

               WITH ALEX as he takes a flying dive off the building,
               intercepting...

               EXT. POLICE STATION - STREET #

               The Dark Sedan careening up the street leaving the city.
               WAM!

               INT. DARK SEDAN - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

               WAM! ERRRK! The Captain nearly jumps out of his skin, barely
               keeping control.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         What the fuck?

               Erin perks up in the back seat. Battered. Ever hopeful.

               EXT. CITY STREETS #6 - DARK SEDAN

               WIDE. As the speeding car passes under a streetlight, we
               see a HUMAN FIGURE standing on top of it, legs spread,
               arms upstretched.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      84.


               PUNCH IN... CLOSE. The Figure, Alex, strikes downward,
               right THROUGH the glass moonroof.

               CRASH!  IN THE SEDAN the Captain horrified as Alex's hand
               yanks his own right off the wheel and up, through the
               moonroof...

               ON THE ROOF OF THE SEDAN Alex kneels now, holding the
               Captain's arm up as he jacks the sleeve down exposing...

               THE ZIGZAG PATTERN, THE MORTIFIED FLESH held in Alex's
               hand like the trophy it is.

                                                          FADE TO BLACK.

               INT. GARRISON'S PRISON - EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Alex's voice appears. Calm. Unhurried.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE
                         The Jolt, eight amps at two to
                         three thousand volts. It lasts a
                         few seconds. The current surges
                         and is turned off.

               FIND ALEX'S FACE in the darkness. Moving as he performs
               some unseen task. Intent, focussed.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         They wait for the body to cool,
                         then check to see if the heart is
                         still beating.

               FIND ERIN, in the darkness, listening to Alex's voice.

               She touches her mouth, little drops of dried blood where
               the wounds are already healing.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         If it is... ba-boom, ba-boom...
                         another jolt is applied.

               SLOW FADE IN as our eyes adjust to the dim light.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         Experts say unconsciousness occcurs
                         before pain has time to register.
                         They agree electrocution does not
                         "hurt," could not hurt. But it
                         does. Unimaginably. Believe me.

               We're in the death chamber. Dark. Claustrophobic.

               The only light a few panel indicators and spill from the
               door open from the adjacent observation room to the outside.
               Alex looks at the phone on the wall. Silent.

                                     ALEX
                         I don't expect a call from the
                         Governor. Any last words? Captain,
                         my Captain?

               REVEAL the Captain in the chair. A private execution. Erin
               slumped along a side wall. Totally inscrutable. Intense.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Yeah. Fuck you.

               A long beat of silence.

                                     ALEX
                         Was that it? Well, ok.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I'm not dying for your goddamn
                         illusions. You got that? You think
                         you and your girlfriend had some
                         rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit.
                         She was already bored, why do you
                         think she was looking around? You're
                         nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.

               A Figure wipes through frame moving toward the switch. The
               Captain's voice rising as he senses time running out.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         You can't do this to me you little
                         fucks!  I'll come back, just like
                         you, a big fucking shit spewing
                         bird and three guesses what little
                         bitch I'm taking out first...

               CLOSE. The switch thrown. ZZZZZTTT. PAN UP off the switch
               to...

                                     ERIN
                         You are so dead.

               She glances at the Captain, fibrillating in the chair,
               starts to move off. Then stops, near Alex, looking with
               him at...

               THEIR POV - THE ZIGZAG SCAR fibrillating, as we PUSH into
               seething detail.

               Writhing bodies, human suffering, a hellish miasma that
               draws us in until we turn our heads away, released.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - DAWN

               Alex and Erin exit the visitor's entrance, met by the Crow
               and the first rays of morning light.

               He puts his arm around her and she places her hand over
               his.

                                     ERIN
                         You want to get some breakfast?
                              (then)
                         What I mean is... I don't know how
                         this works, but...

               He stops, face to face now.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         In the woods you said you had
                         nothing. But you wouldn't, and I
                         wouldn't if there's some way you
                         don't have to go. Please. At least
                         not right away.

                                     ALEX
                         Erin. I'll always be with you.

               For a split second, she's...

               LAUREN Smiling. Sublime. She kisses him. As the break off,
               it's...

               ERIN AGAIN She hangs on a long moment before letting go.
               Then she spots something...

               ON THE GROUND - A SIGN carried by one of the protestors.
               "Remember the Victim." With a picture of Lauren. Someone
               has written a bold "s" after it. "Remember the Victims."
               ERIN picks up the sign.

                                     ERIN
                         Alex. Look at this.

               She turns to Alex. But he's gone. She tries to keep it
               together as...

               CAMERA BOOMS up leaving her alone outside the prison walls,
               with her memories, and her conscience, and her hopes, which
               is alot.

               As a DUSTDEVIL whips up in the parking lot, she drops the
               sign, and starts to CRY.

                                     ERIN'S VOICE
                         In that moment when Alex went...
                         wherever he went... when he made
                         that choice, I knew I was making a
                         choice too. To be alive. In the
                         world. And it made me cry.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DAWN

               CAMERA FINDS Walsh, laid out on the table now, missing arm
               mercifully away from us. The CROW alights nearby, something
               in its beak.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      87.


                                     ERIN'S VOICE
                         Maybe the world is a bad place but
                         the Captain gone has to be some
                         improvement. And that hope, that
                         tomorrow will be better, is enough
                         to keep me going.

               The Crow flaps off, REVEALING the WHITE KING, laid by
               Walsh's head. CAMERA keeps MOVING, FINDING..

               The Crow, on the stand marked Corvis Brachyrhynchos, stuffed
               and mute.

               Its eyes blink a last time, then are motionless.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. CEMETARY - LAUREN AND ALEX'S GRAVES

               X-CLOSE. JOURNAL. A not-too-loopy feminine hand, writing
               the words we are hearing.

                                     ERIN'S VOICE
                         When I think of Lauren fighting
                         and dying, it tears me apart, but
                         it also reassures me. That Lauren
                         and Alex were meant for each other.

               REVEAL... Erin is writing the journal, but she's a radically
               transformed wild child.

               A shock of vividly colored dreadlocks, some of the holes
               that stitched her mouth shut kept permanently open by studs.

                                     ERIN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         That they're together now. Fighters.
                         United by love. And anger. That
                         they've given also to me.

               She's leaning up against a new headstone.

               "Alex Corvis 1981-1999 Always With Us."

                                     ERIN
                         I love Alex. As my sister always
                         hoped I would. And I love Lauren.
                         And I know, because of this, that
                         love does not die. I'm alive.
                         Thinking of them. Hoping that,
                         sometimes, they're thinking of me.

               Erin stops writing, closes the journal, stands. She takes
               the Locket off her neck, drapes it over Alex's headstone,
               like the one already over Lauren's.

               She stares at the two a moment, then puts her index finger
               to her lips, transfers kisses to the two stones. And leaves.

               THE END
The Crow : SALVATION

               By

               Chip Johannessen



               OVER BLACKNESS.

               Silence. Broken by the faint clink of precision tools.
               Accurately, patiently wielded.

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DIMNESS

               X-CLOSE. A SCALPEL returned to its place in a neat array
               of TAXIDERMY TOOLS. Long surgical TWEEZERS taken. A steady
               HAND grasps a CLAY BIRD FORM. Then sets the second eye.
               Unhurried. Meticulous.

               A MYSTERY MAN, features obscured, sets the tweezers aside,
               reaches for a black lump on the table, revealed to be shiny
               feathers as he wraps it around the form. Adjusts it so the
               glass eyes peer out through holes in the skin of this large
               CROW. A taxidermy specimen.

               WIDE, the man works across the room under the pooled light
               of a draftsman's lamp, the Crow on the table in front of
               him. His identity yet to discover.

                                                          SLOW FADE OUT.

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               X-WIDE. "THE WALLS" like a medieval castle above a throng
               of PROTESTERS and GAWKERS. A POSTCARD at first, then signs
               of movement--handheld placards and flickering candles
               telegraph an imminent execution.

               The group shifts amoeba like as... A LARGE MERCEDES
               approaches, slowly works its way into the edge of the crowd.

               INSIDE THE BENZ NATHAN RANDALL, father of the victim
               comforts ERIN RANDALL, seventeen year old sister, as she
               looks up in terror at the bodies pressed against the car,
               the throng between the car and the prison entrance. The
               car stops.

                                     ERIN
                         Why are there so many?

                                     RANDALL
                         Just hold on to me.

               THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD--a Protestor's poster visible.
               "Remember the Victim." With a picture of LAUREN RANDALL,
               the deceased, who bears a striking resemblance to surviving
               sister Erin. And another sign--"Happy Birthday Alex."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       2.


                                     ERIN
                         It's because they're doing this on
                         his birthday.

               She takes a deep breath, they get out of the car and...

               WITH THE RANDALLS as they make their way through the throng
               toward a special entrance marked "WITNESSES," nearly within
               reach when WHOMP.

               Erin shields her face as a BRIGHT LIGHT comes on. OVER TV
               REPORTER BARBARA GONZALEZ Action Newsteam addressing the
               Nathans. Speaking into a mic.

                                     GONZALEZ
                         Mr. Randall. Sir. Do you think
                         this execution will bring you a
                         sense of closure?

               Nathan pushes past Gonzalez, taking Erin's hand.

                                     GONZALEZ (CONT'D)
                         Erin. Your sister...

                                     RANDALL
                         Leave us alone!

               The Reporter TURNS to the camera, not missing a beat.

                                     GONZALEZ
                         A difficult time for everyone
                         involved.
                              (then)
                         Interesting fact. It will take
                         about twenty-one cents of
                         electricity to execute Alex Corvis
                         tonight on this, his twenty-first
                         birthday.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW - NIGHT

               CLOSE on a BIRTHDAY CAKE, twenty one candles flickering as
               it makes its way past deathrow cells, held waiter style on
               one hand by MERCER, a MUSTACHED prison GUARD.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

               CLANG. The barred door opens and the cake swoops in, landing
               on a small table next to a CHESS GAME in progress and an
               untouched last meal. ADJUST to find...

               ALEX CORVIS. Twenty-One today. Disarmingly appealing.
               Peaceful. Simple clothes. He looks up from the game, at...

               PETER WALSH, Alex's pro-bono attorney and only friend,
               trying not to explode at this shit-eating stunt.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       3.


                                     WALSH
                         He didn't order that.

                                     MERCER
                         We found the man with the scar.

               Despite himself, Alex looks up. Mercer gestures at... THE
               CAKE in the middle of the candles, an arm made of frosting
               with a large ZIGZAG marking on the forearm, also frosting.

               FAVORING ALEX looking from the cake up to Mercer, who nods
               at the candles.

                                     MERCER (CONT'D)
                         Go ahead. Make a wish.

                                     WALSH
                              (intense whisper)
                         Get it out of here.

               Alex focusses on the chess board. Tries to anyway.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - NIGHT

               FLASH. The harsh Newsteam video light WHUMPS on,
               illuminating a WRINKLED OLD WOMAN.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Yes, I've come to a lot of these
                         over the years, but this one has
                         many unique aspects. Youth of the
                         condemned. That's unusual. Fifty
                         three stab wounds. Kind of a record.

                                     GONZALEZ'S VOICE
                         And Corvis still maintaining his
                         innocence.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, they all say that.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               FLASH. A nervous, not to say shifty looking THOMAS "TOMMY"
               LEONARD, thirty five year old key witness in the trial,
               talks to Gonzalez under the hot video light.

                                     TOMMY
                         I don't fault him saying I lied on
                         the stand. Facing the chair, you
                         do what you gotta do. But I saw
                         those two fighting that night.

               Tommy shifts uncomfortably, silent as we HOLD a long beat.

                                     TOMMY (CONT'D)
                         I didn't lie.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

               CLOSE. A Chess piece, a CASTLE, shoved at CAMERA. ADJUST
               to INCLUDE ALEX.

               He breathes deliberately, trying to hold it together. His
               hand shakes as he removes it from the piece.

                                     WALSH
                         You ok?

               Alex gets up, crosses to a small ledge on the other side
               of the cell that holds a few books and pictures. He finds...

               A PICTURE OF LAUREN AND ALEX In a grove of tall trees. A
               self-portrait by autotimer. Arms around each other. Her
               head on his shoulder. Happy.

               RESUME Alex staring at the photo, taped to the wall.

                                     ALEX
                         What's been holding me together is
                         the hope that maybe you do go
                         someplace. And I'll be seeing her
                         again soon. Only what will I say?
                         That I was too stupid to find the
                         guy who killed her? That he's down
                         here laughing?

                                     WALSH
                         Tell her... we'll get him.

                                     ALEX
                         We won't.

                                     WALSH
                         Someday he'll surface and I'll get
                         him for both of you. I promise.
                         I'll find the guy with the scar.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               FLASH. Four UNIFORMED COPS--DUTTON, ERLICH, LARKIN and
               TOOMEY--in the harsh news light.

               Erlich holds a CANE in one hand. Larkin and Toomey are
               twosie monkeys, smoking cigarettes with eerie simultaneity.

                                     ERLICH
                         This mystery man with the scar...
                              (indicates forearm)
                         ...the zigzag, whatever.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       5.


               Erlich gives a long-suffering look. Like it's preposterous.
               But he's too gentlemanly to say it.

                                     ERLICH (CONT'D)
                         We couldn't find him. And,
                         obviously, the jury didn't buy it.

                                     GONZALEZ
                         Some people here seem to.

                                     DUTTON
                         People here are protesting the
                         execution of a kid just turning
                         twenty-one. A kid who had a tough
                         life. No parents, no dough. Always
                         had to fight for everything. It's
                         a tragedy, it really is. But I
                         don't see a single sign telling me
                         Alex Corvis is innocent.

               Look around. He's right.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

               Alex still gazing at the picture of Lauren. At the board,
               Walsh moves a piece.

                                     MERCER
                         I was facing the hot seat, I'd
                         want my attorney banging down the
                         door of the Supreme Court, not
                         playing board games. But maybe
                         that's just me.

               They look up as Mercer appears outside the barred door to
               the cell, starts to unlock it.

                                     WALSH
                         Your move.

                                     MERCER
                         No. It's time.

               It really is. Other prison personnel arrive outside the
               cell in various uniforms:

               A MINISTER with clerical collar, the WARDEN, two GUARDS.
               Waiting. Walsh crosses, very emotional how. Gives Alex a
               huge hug.

                                     ALEX
                         I don't want you to watch. I don't
                         want to give them the pleasure.

               The two friends exchange a long last look.

                                     MERCER
                         Ok. C'mon now...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       6.


               As Alex exits past Mercer, Walsh sits down on the cot.
               He's hard to read a second until he lashes out, flips...

               THE CAKE against the wall where it hits, slides down, still
               semi-intact as it hits the floor.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW

               Dead Man Walking. A mini parade past the cells of the
               condemned. One guard flanks Alex, another follows. The
               Warden and Minister out in front.

               HANDS extend from the other cells as Alex passes. Unable
               to touch, but he reaches for them, a gesture of solidarity.
               Mercer catches up with the group, flanking Alex cell-side.
               Alex drops his hand, cut off even from that.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW #2 - NIGHT

               The parade continues down another hallway.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATH CHAMBER - NIGHT

               The CHAIR, an atavism, sits alone a moment before the
               entourage enters and begins a surprisingly well
               choreographed last dance.

               The Warden gestures, and Alex is escorted to his place in
               the chair. The Guards move in, death attendants now.

                                     MINISTER
                         The Lord is my shepherd, I shall
                         not want...

               THE MINISTER CONTINUES as...

               CLOSE. Handstraps tightened. WHOP. WHOP. Alex squirms
               despite his resolve. Through an act of will, calms himself.
               Looks up at...

               THE PHONE. On the wall. A last possibility of reprise.

               CLOSE. Trouser legs slit. Footstraps tightened around bare
               ankles. Electrodes checked.

               CLOSE. Chest strap tightened. Yanked again for good measure.
               ALEX gasps. It's hard to breathe now with the strap tight
               across his chest.

               CLOSE. Copper mesh. Pieces of sponge jerry-sewn onto it,
               the irregular stitching giving it an unsettling natural
               appearance.

               ADJUST to REVEAL this is the electrode in the odd leather
               HELMET tightened now on Alex's head.

               THE EXECUTIONER. Pulls a hood over his own obscured face.
               Moves behind a half curtain at the side of the room.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       7.


                                     MINISTER (CONT'D)
                              (concluding)
                         ... and I will dwell in the house
                         of the Lord. Forever.

               SLAP. The Minister shuts his bible. WIDER. Some weird sin.
               Alex strapped into the chair, unable to move.

               The guards exit, jobs done. The Warden nots and...

               ALEX'S POV - THROUGH PLEXI - THE OBSERVATION ROOM REVEALED
               as the CURTAINS OPEN.

               Two dozen observers crammed into a space the width of a
               singlewide trailer. Erin. Her father. The Cops. Tommy
               Leonard. Gonzalez and other media types. Prison personnel.
               Every seat occupied. Sweaty and surreal. All looking at
               him. IN THE DEATH CHAMBER The Warden steps forward.

                                     WARDEN
                         Alexander Frederick Corvis. Do you
                         have any last words?

               A thick silence. Alex looks unprepared, uneasy as he scans
               a sea of hostile faces, settling on Erin and her dad.

                                     ALEX
                         I loved Lauren. I still do. I'm
                         innocent.

               Erin shakes her head, disgusted. Looks away.

               ALEX'S POV - THE LAST SECONDS OF HIS LIFE SLOWING in his
               inner perception, movement ramping down as Alex scans the
               disbelieving faces.

               The Phone. Silent. No reprise. The Observation Room witness
               door opens. A Guard in the back row deferentially offers
               his seat to the NEW ARRIVAL, a man in dark clothes, his
               face obscured by REFLECTIONS in the plexiglass. As he
               UNBUTTONS his shirt cuff...

               The warden steps to the side of the room, nods to the
               executioner who lifts a COVER off a large switch.

               The New Arrival pulls his shirtsleeve back over his forearm,
               exposing a scar for Alex, THE SCAR, an odd zigzag pattern
               of raised welts, a pattern deliberately formed of skin.

               The Executioner throws the switch. ON ALEX SHAKING violently
               as he fights to stay alive, time extremely subjective now
               as he chokes out...

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                              (indistinct, filtered)
                         Murderer!

               The word bubbles up as if from underwater, audible only to
               Alex. Alex wrenches his head, a superhuman act of will
               trying to ID the Scar Man through the reflections.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       8.


               THE HELMET starts to smoke. Then a burst of FLAME at Alex's
               head.

               A BOTCHED EXECUTION made worse by Alex's struggle to see,
               to stay alive.

               IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM The observers panic, horrified.
               Only the Scar Man calm as he covers his arm, rebuttons his
               shirt. Face always obscured.

               IN THE DEATH CHAMBER Alex in electro-spasm, smoke filling
               the room, the warden in real time now as he runs to pull
               the curtain closed.

               It JAMS partway across. ALEX expires in the char,
               grotesquely burned, EYES OPEN as the Warden finally yanks
               the curtain closed.

               IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM The Scar Man slips out, but the
               rest remain, transfixed, horrified. Erin and others in
               tears. HOLD a long beat, their GASPS faintly audible.
               Then...

                                     MERCER
                         Cruel, who's to say, but it sure
                         was unusual.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Two guards push a gurney down a reverberant hallway far
               from the in-your-face security of deathrow.

                                     GUARD ONE
                         Look at this. Goddamn helmet melted
                         down.

                                     MERCER
                         That, my friend, is a deterrent.

               They WIPE past, Alex's charred remains visible a moment,
               parts of the helmet fused on his face and head, his body
               convulsed in a pugilistic attitude.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE - NIGHT

               The guards swing the gurney to a stop by a steel locker,
               one of several. Mercer opens the locker door. The
               unceremoniously slide the body into the locker and...

               BANG. The body hits the open door. Convulsed as it is, the
               body won't really fit through the door.

                                     MERCER
                         Whoops.

               CRUNCH. The sound of something breaking as the SHOVE Alex
               into the cubby hole.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       9.


                                     GUARD ONE
                         Why do they even autopsy these
                         guys? Cause of death is pretty
                         fucking obvious.

               FROM INSIDE THE LOCKER. The door slams shut.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

               CLOSE on the PICTURE of Alex and Lauren.

               ADJUST to include Walsh, looking at it. Pained. Still trying
               to understand. He secures it to the lid of the case already
               containing the neatly packed chess set. Closes it. Bows
               his head.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - NIGHT

               The protestors are gone, as is the Newsteam, but the four
               Cops are still there, Larkin and Toomey synchro-smoking.

               They look up as the Randalls emerge shaken from the Witness
               entrance.

               FAVORING NATHAN RANDALL He speaks softly to Erin, who's
               leaning against him.

                                     RANDALL
                              (to Erin)
                         I'll meet you atthe car, honey.

               She continues on and Randall crosses to the cops, who wait
               patiently to see what he'll say. Finally...

                                     DUTTON
                         We all wish this had ended better.
                         Sir.

               Randall nods. Like that's all anyone could say. As he walks
               off the Cops fall into easy chatter. CUT TO:

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DIMNESS

               CLOSE. A face slides into frame in PROFILE, too tight to
               be recognizable.

               Just an eye, peering...

               EYE'S POV - THROUGH A MAGNIFYING GLASS A coarse ZIGZAG
               stitch shaped like the Scar runs the length of the Crow's
               underbelly. The end stitch now tied with a tiny knot.

               Tightened just so. THE MYSTERY MAN features obscured still,
               grabs a bent surgical SCISSORS, snips the excess thread.
               Smoothes black feathers into place, hiding the stitching
               on...

               THE CROW Finished. The Man gets up, leaves.

               CAMERA PUSHING on the Bird's head as we HEAR a door shut,
               still PUSHING on the glass eye that BLINKS now.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE - NIGHT

               INSIDE THE LOCKER. A human EYE BLINKS. Barely visible in
               the darkness. Alex KICKS with a YELL and...

               IN THE MORGUE.  The locker door flies open and Alex spills
               onto the floor. Gropes a few seconds on hands and knees
               before a SHADOW passes over him evoking a primitive
               response. He cowers, looks up at...

               A LARGE CROW flutters through the bars of a high window,
               lands near him on the floor. It looks at him, then flaps
               its way up to the autopsy countertop, cocks its head. Follow
               me.

               ALEX strains to pull himself up on the gurney that brought
               him here.

               HIS POV as he slowly rises above the gurney--the Crow in
               front of a mirror over the splash sink. It flies off,
               revealing Alex's reflection. Charred. Hideous.

               ALEX drops back to the floor with a SCREAM. Turns, sees
               himself in a stainless door and SMASHES it with his fist...

               THE BASHED STAINLESS DOOR the word "MORGUE," painted on
               the wall behind Alex, brought into focus at the center of
               the concavity. ALEX thrashes, trying to avoid his
               reflection, but the dim mirrors have him surrounded.

               THE CROW flaps down, crazed too, as if in empathy. CAWING
               loudly, finally getting Alex's attention. ALEX settles,
               hazards another look at his reflection in stainless steel.

               His body looks less misshapen now. He looks at his arms,
               hands, no longer burned. Pulls himself up on the gurney
               again, cautiously.

               OVER ALEX as he slowly rises above the gurney a second
               time, looks in the mirror. His body miraculously HEALED,
               covered by shredded clothing.

               His face obscured by the meltdown helmet. He slowly
               approaches the mirror on unsteady feet.

                                     ALEX
                              (to his own
                              reflection)
                         What happened?

               Alex starts to tear away the helmet and gets a first
               frightening FLASH as his fingers touch it...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      11.


               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV - FLASHBACK A blitz return to his own
               execution. The copper screen, the helmet lowered into place.
               Electro-spasm. The faintest glimpse of a jagged scar seen
               darkly.

               RESUME -ALEX clutching the helmet on his head, ripping it
               off in one painful OVERCRANKED movement and...

               OVER ALEX, IN THE MIRROR It's Alex, and yet not. His face
               marked with the Crow MASK, jagged WARPAINT where the melted
               helmet ran down his face. An indelible reminder of the
               botched execution. he stares at himself for a couple of
               deep breaths. Then WHAM! Shatters the mirror with a martial
               punch.

               THE FRACTURED MIRROR Alex's mask reflected in shards as
               his busy hands remove certain pieces of broken glass. His
               purpose unclear.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE HALLWAY - NIGHT

               The Crow hops out into the hallway, flies toward us, lands
               with a CAW as Alex enters the hallway, framed against hight
               walls. His tentative movements growing more assured.

                                     ALEX
                         Follow the leader.

               The Crow flies off and Alex follows, to... A DOOR marked
               "No Unauthorized Entry." As they pass through...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - SECURITY BOOTH - NIGHT

               CLOSE on a MONITOR, a SCHEMATIC MAP of the prison. A small
               red light FLASHES. The GUARD keys a communications radio.

                                     RADIO GUARD
                         We've got unauthorized movement in
                         "B five."

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE HALLWAY - NIGHT

               WITH the LEGS of a Guard walking quickly. REVEAL Mercer.
               His RADIO crackling.

                                     MERCER
                              (into radio)
                         Mercer. I'm on it.

               He passes through the "No Unauthorized Entry" door into...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - "B-5" HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Empty. Bars at the far end spell seriously secure territory.
               Mercer moves cautiously up the empty hallway, stops as...
               The Crow hops out from a side hallway. Drawing him on.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      12.


                                     MERCER
                              (into radio)
                         Found our intruder. It's got a
                         beak and a death wish.

               Mercer pulls out his NIGHTSTICK, loses the bird as it hops
               back THROUGH BARS into...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

               Alex looks around his now empty cell. On the wall is a
               rectangle, clearer than the wall around it, where the
               photograph of Alex and Lauren had been before Walsh removed
               it. Alex goes up to thewall and touches the spot.

               FLASH! ALEX'S INTERNAL POV FLASH of LAUREN, laughing as
               she beckons to someone, Alex, who joins her in frame as we
               hear the whir of the camera auto-timer. A click, as the
               picture is taken. Alex and Lauren are frozen in the pose
               of Alex's photograph.

               RESUME The picture is gone. Alex, perplexed, stands looking
               at the blank spot on the wall for a moment. He turns and
               exits the cell...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW - NIGHT

               Mercer is peering through the double-barred gate at the
               end of the row as Alex emerges from his former cell.

                                     MERCER
                              (still into radio)
                         Get me some backup. We got one
                         loose on the row.
                              (through the bars
                              to Alex)
                         Now who the fuck are you?

               Alex looks up, sees Mercer and FLASH...

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV A pop of Mercer bringing the birthday
               cake. A wash of flame, twenty one candles. A blip of Walsh.
               Of a White King.

               RESUME Alex perplexed, looking at the cake still littering
               the floor of his ex-cell, candles melted down. Mercer works
               his way through the double-barred doors onto the row.

                                     MERCER (CONT'D)
                         And what have you done to your
                         face there beauty queen?

               The INMATE occupying the cell next to Alex's peers out
               through the bars, vanishes again as Mercer WHOPS the bars
               once with his nightstick.

                                     ALEX
                         It's my birthday.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      13.


                                     MERCER
                         Yeah, well... here's a present for
                         you.

               WHOOSH. Mercer swings his NIGHTSTICK at Alex's head. Alex
               catches it, instinctively in one hand. Mercer reaches for...

               A RED PANIC BUTTON hanging off his guard belt. Mercer slams
               it. FAVORING ALEX lets go of the stick, looks at his own
               hand, surprised.

               WHAM!  Mercer broadsides Alex's head with the stick. Alex
               goes down shocked, not from pain, from the fact that someone
               would attack him.

               WHAM WHAM WHAM. Mercer brutalizes Alex, collapsed at his
               feet as... TWO GUARDS enter the far end of the Row, race
               toward Alex's cell, one holding a TASER. Its LASER SIGHT
               finds Alex, crumpled in front of Mercer.

                                     MERCER (CONT'D)
                         It's ok. Man. Had me going there.

               Looks like it's over. The guards relax. ALEX suddenly looks
               up at Mercer. Zero damage from the blows.

                                     ALEX
                         Go ahead. Make a wish.

                                     MERCER
                         Taser!

               Alex wheels around as Guard One squeezes the trigger.
               CROWVISION The Taser Darts speed toward Camera.

               RESUME Alex shunts himself to the side and the TASER DARTS
               impale themselves in Mercer's thighs. He drops fibrillating.

               A CHEER goes up from the men in their cells, who become
               progressively rowdier as the guards BOLT and Alex follows,
               strength in his stride, nightstick in hand.

               Pieces of FLAMING TOILETPAPER flung now from the cells of
               Deathrow.

               AT THE FAR ENTRANCE the two Guards scramble to get the
               door closed behind them before Alex catches up. They'd
               make it except Alex hurls...

               THE NIGHTSTICK flying end over end like a throwing knife,
               catching the trailing guard in the back of the head,
               dropping him in the door, propping it open.

               ALEX enters the cage entrance to Deathrow, sharing the
               space with the Guard still standing.

                                     ALEX
                              (pats pockets, then)
                         Keys?

                                                                      14.


               The frightened Guard opens the door into the next hallway
               and bolts. Leaving the keys. The Crow hopping, screaming...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - SECURITY BOOTH - NIGHT

               CLOSE on a SCHEMATIC MAP of the prison. Lit up like a
               Christmas tree now with flashing red lights. The Guard
               keys a communications radio.

                                     RADIO GUARD
                         Unauthorized movement in B five, B
                         six, C three, four, five...

               Another LIGHT goes on. They're starting to make a line.
               Buzzers going off now. A general ALARM sounded.

                                     RADIO GUARD (CONT'D)
                         Escape in progress. Heading for
                         the roof.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

               The Crow flaps up the stairwell. Alex on its heels, taking
               steps three at a time.

               AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRWELL The Crow waits on a LANDING
               with a door marked "Emergency Use Only." Plus a dozen lines
               of assorted instructions. Guards' feet THUNDER below,
               approaching.

                                     ALEX
                         I hear the pitter patter of little
                         feet.

               He opens the door. The ALARM is LOUD.

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Dark a moment. Then a HUGE SPOTLIGHT hits Alex, casting
               long shadows. He looks up at a GUARD TOWER, the source of
               the light. And of a BULLHORN VOICE.

                                     BULLHORN VOICE
                         Do not proceed. Back slowly away
                         from the fence.

               As if in defiance, the Crow hops toward the fence, old
               chain link topped with razorwire along the perimeter of
               the roof.

               BULLHORN VOICE CONTINUES as Alex follows... ALEX'S POV
               through the fence, down fifty feet to the pavement.

                                     ALEX
                         Damn.

               Alex turns, sees... A HALF DOZEN GUARDS emerge from the
               stairwell to the top of the roof, level weapons at Alex.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      15.


               ON THE FENCE - ALEX climbs quickly to the top, where he
               grabs two painful handfuls of razorwire that cut deeply
               into this hand. He extricates himself, balancing atop the
               fence. And looks...

               ALEX'S HANDS The jagged bloodlines disappear, miraculously
               heal.

               FAVORING ALEX as he holds up his hands to show the guards,
               a kid-like smile on his face.

               They respond by raising their weapons and BAM BAM BAM.

               Alex hurls himself off the edge in a hail of Gunfire that
               Dopplers down to silence as he falls, falls...

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - BASE OF THE WALLS - NIGHT

               AT THE BASE OF "THE WALLS" Alex hits, flushing PIGEONS,
               that fill frame with manic wings.

               As the SPOTLIGHT sweeps toward Alex he rolls off, over the
               sidewalk, between two parked cars.

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               ON THE ROOFTOP Mercer and the others stand there dumbstruck,
               looking down as the SPOTLIGHT finds nothing.

               A RADIO CRACKLES. Mercer keys it a beat later.

                                     RADIO GUARD VOICE
                         Physical head count shows all
                         inmates present.

               Mercer moves the radio away from his head.

                                     MERCER
                         Then who was the fucking Houdini?

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - BASE OF THE WALLS - NIGHT

               AT THE BASE OF "THE WALLS" Illuminated by spill from the
               Spotlight, Alex crouches between two cars. He leans forward,
               checking his reflection in a CHROME HUBCAP. A huge smile
               spreads over his face.

                                     ALEX
                         Happy birthday.

               He laughs. Life--or whatever this is--is good. So far.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. CITY - AIRBORNE - NIGHT

               The CROW flies past tall buildings downtown.

                                                                      16.


               EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

               The crow flies past letters P-O-L-I-C-E on the side of an
               older building taking us to...

               INT. POLICE STATION - EVIDENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               SMASH. A hand punches through a sash window, right through
               the imbedded security wires, roughly rips off the latch
               inside. Retracts, bleeding. The window opens.

               It's Alex, on the fire escape, checking out his arm as the
               BLEEDING STOPS.

               Alex follows the Crow into the dark room packed with file
               cabinets and evidence bins, wire lockers. And a desk, strewn
               with POLICE FORMS. Plus a vertical SPIKE with processed
               evidence request FORMS impaled on it.

                                     ALEX
                              (checking out desk)
                         Police? Evidence?
                              (then, to Crow)
                         Look. I like what we've got going
                         here. But I can think of lots better
                         to do with it than fighting crime.
                         Know what I mean?

               The Crow makes its way to a file cabinet, the top drawer
               marked "Cl-Cr."  Alex lingers a moment at the desk, eye on
               the spike.

               WHOP. Alex drives his hand onto the SPIKE. Looks up,
               delighted. CAW.

               The Crow gives Alex an admonishing look. Alex pulls the
               spike from his hand. Instant healing.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Ok, ok... what?

               Alex opens the top drawer. Looking for... he's not sure
               what. Glibly goes through folders.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Nothing under "Crow."

               He stops. Pulls out the first FILE out in a thick section
               marked "CORVIS, ALEXANDER F." Having caught a glimpse of...

               IN THE FILE - ALEX'S MUG SHOT And rap sheet. X-CLOSE. We
               see "Murder 1st degree," "Penalty Phase: Find for
               Execution."

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Execution?

               But even this has little interest for him as the finds the
               words "Lauren Randall" on the page.

                                                                      17.


                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                              (remembering)
                         Lauren...

               ALEX rips the drawer out of the file cabinet, dumps it
               CRASHING on the ground. He drops to the floor with a growing
               sense of dread, feeling with both hands, finding...

               A SPLAY OF PHTOGRAPHS encased in plastic -- the
               prosecutions' background presentation on Alex and Lauren.
               The first photo shows LAUREN Posing jauntily, her arm around
               a Snowman. She and the Snowman wear matching Boston Red
               Sox caps.

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV On Alex, anticipating...WHAP!  A
               snowball nails him square in the face.

               WIDE to reveal LAUREN running for cover as Young Alex scoops
               up snow for ammo. He lobs a snowball at Lauren, just as
               she slips to the ground. she doesn't get up right away.

               Alex is just a shade concernec as he runs over to her. He
               reaches the spot to find LAUREN in the snow, waving her
               arms and legs to make a snow angel. She looks up at him
               and beckons him to lie on top of her.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         What are you, an Angel?

                                     LAUREN
                         I'm your Angel. Come here.

               RESUME Alex's pained smile at the memory, until he finds:
               THE MURDER WEAPON A rough looking hunting knife bagged and
               tagged as "AC-005: Murder Weapon."

               ALEX frantic now, spreading out the file contents,
               finding...

               CRIME SCENE PHOTOS In a Grove of tall trees, Lauren
               Randall's stabbed and mutilated body, her neck slashed,
               head lolling sideways, melds with...

               EXT. THE OLD GROWTH GROVE

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Brief glimpses of Lauren with Alex in
               the Grove, happy, like the still photo Alex kept in his
               cell.

               INT. POLICE STATION - EVIDENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               RESUME Alex full-blown tortured now, throwing things.

                                     ALEX
                         No! I didn't...!

               Alex SMASHES his own head against the metal file cabinets,
               wounding himself on the handles, droplets of blood flying
               now, spattering the evidence on the floor.

               He reaches for the KNIFE, the murder weapon, to end the
               pain and FLASH...

               INT. COURTROOM - DAY

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV A tunnelvision pop of Tommy Leonard on
               the witness stand. The knife held up for him by an unseen
               lawyer.

                                     TOMMY
                         His knife. Corvis.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE
                         You lie!

               INT. POLICE STATION - EVIDENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               RESUME Alex shakes his head "no." Incredulous, horrified.
               The fury abating with a growing sense of mission.

                                     ALEX
                         You lie, you lie, you lie...

               Alex fishing through the detritus around him, finding...
               "THE LIST" A list of witnesses by category with contact
               numbers, addresses. Alex's finger finds Eyewitness Thomas
               Leonard.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Thomas Leonard.

               THE DOOR TO THE EVIDENCE ROOM opens.

               A YOUNG COP enters, walks slowly past rows of file cabinets,
               looking down empty aisles until finding the file drawerful
               Alex dumped. But Alex is gone.

               The Young Cop looks up as the Crow departs through the
               window and two other cops arrive. One of them Dutton.

                                     DUTTON
                         What the hell was that?
                              (then seeing mess)
                         Shit.

               Dutton walks to the mess on the floor, curious. He squats.
               Picks up a tag marked "Murder Weapon AC-005" staples ripped
               out, nothing attached to it. Takes in the crime scene photos
               of Lauren. Off the PIX...

               EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

               CAMERA DRIFTS down through dark trees FINDING Alex at a
               grave beneath a sheltering tree.

                                     ALEX
                         I thought I'd be with you now.

               He's kneeling in front of a HEADSTONE. "Lauren Randall
               1982-2000. Always With Us."

               The Crow perched nearby. Camera circles Alex who looks up
               as the headstone WIPES through frame and...

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV LAUREN NATHAN, a compelling sixteen
               year old, circles making an oddly sexy version of the "Oooo"
               Bruce Lee sound. A goof, a game she's playing with Alex,
               who circles opposite.

                                     LAUREN

               RESUME Camera continues to circle Alex at the grave.

                                     ALEX
                         I'm not dead. And I'm not alive.
                         And I'm remembering. And it hurts.

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV More goof kung fu, the circle closing.
               Lauren laughing more, searching for words.

                                     LAUREN
                         Your... flying crane style is no

                         I can't be alive. Not without you.

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Lauren's starting to crack up, trying
               to think of what comes next.

                                     LAUREN
                         Your... mad monkey... love ... is

                         I want to be with you forever.

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Lauren in his arms as the kiss ends,
               and she answers a question we never heard.

                                     LAUREN
                         Only forever?

               RESUME OVER THE CROW. Camera stops circling. Alex looks up
               at the headstone, silent tears in his eyes as...

                                     ALEX
                         What happened to us?

               A SINGLE BLOOD RED TEAR rolls down the cheek of the angel
               atop the headstone. Alex stops it with his finter.

               WIDER, the supplicant at the grave. And the Crow nearby.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               A GIRL'S HAND clutches a HEART SHAPED LOCKET.

               TILT UP, it's Erin, wearing an identical LOCKET around her
               neck. School uniform, pleated skirt and school books. The
               splish splash of the wipers the only sound until...

                         Dad...

               Nathan looks over. Sees she's holding the Locket.

                         I want to take this to Lauren.
                         She'd want it.

                         Honey. I just can't.

                                     ERIN
                         Stay in the car. I'll only take a
                         second.

                         talking to you.

                         It's not that. Really. It's just...
                         now that he's gone, I think it's
                         time.

               Off her dad...

               He holds his hands up, compliant. She doesn't bolt. But
               she's ultra-cautious. Like with a snarling dog.

                                     ALEX
                         I was a friend of your sister's.

                         He didn't kill her.

                                     ERIN
                              (loud now)
                         Stay away from me! Dad! Dad!

               OS, the car door opens. Then SLAMS shut. Nathan approaches.

                                     RANDALL
                         Erin!

                                     ERIN
                         Watch out!

                                                                      22.


               She whips around, points at... Alex is gone.

                                     RANDALL
                         What were you yelling about?

                                     ERIN
                         This guy said he was a friend of
                         Lauren's. He had like paint all
                         over his face.

                                     RANDALL
                         Are you ok?

                                     ERIN
                         What's that supposed to mean? He
                         was right here. He was!

               She shakes her head, confused, then, looking around spots...

               THE HEADSTONE. The track from the RED TEAR indelible even
               in the downpour.

               Off Erin, as she touches the angel's stained cheek. And
               her dad, soggy in the rain...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - RAIN - NIGHT

               A street LIGHT flickers on. Maybe because night has fallen
               or maybe its just a rainy day.

               Thomas Leonard hikes up his collar, trying to stay dry, as
               he pauses a clutch of hookers huddled in a doorway...

                                     HOOKER
                         Yo, Tommy. Red light special.
                              (hikes her skirt)
                         Even you can afford it.

               He shakes his head--don't need that grief--continues on to
               the next building and CAMERA FINDS...

               ALEX watching, holding "The List." He crosses off the name
               for Eyewitness "Thomas Leonard."

               INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Tommy clears the stairs, heads for his door. Unlocking the
               second lock, he looks around, alert, like he heard
               something. Then opens the door.

               INT. TENEMENT - TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Alex waits for Tommy, crouched by an OPEN WINDOW that looks
               out onto an alley, a four story drop.

                                     TOMMY
                              (sees Alex, then)
                         March?!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      23.


                                     ALEX
                         Sssshhh. She's resting.

                                     TOMMY
                         Where the fuck did you come from?

                                     ALEX
                         Big bang, primordial ooze, divine
                         hand of a benevolent creator?  All
                         possibilities. Although recent
                         events have given me doubts about
                         the benevolent creator.

               Tommy starts toward Alex, who pulls the KNIFE from the
               Evidence Room.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You lied at my trial.

                                     TOMMY
                         I don't know you, man.

                                     ALEX
                         Capital case nine nine dash C one
                         one five. Alex Corvis.
                              (flashes knife)
                         Exhibit A.

               WHAM. Alex pins what looks like Tommy's arm. It's just his
               jacket, but it immobilizes Tommy.

                                     TOMMY
                         Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids
                         arguing. A guy and a girl.

                                     ALEX
                         You said you saw me with this. I
                         never held it until today.

                                     TOMMY
                         What's your damage, man? Corvis
                         hacked up that girl like a
                         motherfucker.

               Alex HEAVES Tommy crashing into the window, smashing the
               glass and cheap aluminum frame.

               Tommy hanging halfway in, halfway out. Four floors above
               the alley. Alex rips Tommy's shirt where the knife already
               cut it. JACKS the sleeve down. No scar there.

                                     ALEX
                         One chance to tell the truth, Tommy.
                         Who is the man with the scar? He
                         planted this in my car.

                                     TOMMY
                         There's no scar. Corvis made it
                         up.

                                     ALEX
                         Wrong. Answer.

                                     TOMMY
                         Who are you?

                                     TOMMY'S WIFE
                         Tommy!

               TOMMY'S WIFE enters from the bedroom, SCREAMING.

               Heavy eye makeup, looking like she just woke up. OS, a
               TODDLER CRIES as she throws herself on Alex and they spill
               back inside.

                                     TOMMY'S WIFE (CONT'D)
                         Let him go! Let him go!

                                     TOMMY
                         Honey. Take the baby. Get out of
                         here now!

               But she doesn't leave. She pleads in wrenching SOBS that
               seem to affect Alex. The Crow lands in the window.

                                     TOMMY'S WIFE
                         He's all I got. Tommy and the baby.
                         Don't take him. The baby needs a
                         father.

               Her MASCARA runs down her cheeks, a facsimile of Alex's
               mask. They share a long look, connected by pain.

               The Crow cawing a warning, hopping in the window as...

                                     ALEX
                         Your baby is crying. Go.

               Tommy nods at his wife, who heads off to the bedroom. The
               Crow gives Alex an admonishing CAW, then takes flight.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         What did they give you?

                                     TOMMY
                         They showed me pictures, what he
                         did to her. Evidence. Said all I
                         had to do was stand up there and
                         not my head "yes."

                                     ALEX
                              (repeats, insistent)
                         What did they give you?

                                     TOMMY
                         A job. Construction. Twelve an
                         hour.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      25.


               Tommy's wife returns, holding a fifteen month old BOY.
               Alex unfolds "The List," passes it to Tommy, blank side
               up.

                                     ALEX
                         Write down their names. All of
                         them.

               But Tommy takes a look at "The List" and flips it over...

               "THE LIST" Tommy points to the Police Witness list. Dutton,
               Erlich, Larkin, Toomey.

                                     TOMMY
                         You already got 'em. Right here.
                         These cops said the needed an
                         eyewitness, or Corvis would walk.

               ALEX drops his head. All clear now. He laughes gently at
               the sound of SIRENS approaching, still blocks away.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DIMNESS

               CAMERA CREEPS toward the by now familiar Mystery Man, bent
               over his work at the table across the room.

               CLOSE. A lineup of short (2") rods. One selected with a
               pair of surgical forceps,

               INSERTED through a hole in human flesh, raising a
               considerable welt. Some bleeding.

               As the man reaches for a cotton ball, he notices an empty
               STAND among the taxidermy specimens. Marked "Corvus
               brachyrhynchos."

               He scans the table, searching, then throws up his hands,
               shielding his face as a Crow flies out of the darkness,
               right at him.

               The man turns toward Camera but we never see his face as
               the Crow wheels mid-air, flying past him a second time. As
               the Crow flies up and out a SMALL WINDOW, the man stands,
               hands on the desk. SLOW PUSH on the man, on...

               A ZIGZAG PATTERN of raised welts on the underside of his
               forearm, in high relief under the Draftsman's lamp.

               The "Scar." A drop of blood zigzags, running downward.
               SLOW FADE OUT. OVER BLACK, the CRACKLE of a Police Radio.
               We're...

               EXT. CITY STREET #1 - NIGHT

               HIGH ANGLE. A police CRUISER has stopped a late model
               CADILLAC SEVILLE on a deserted street.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      26.


               IN THE POLICE CAR CLOSE. COP I.D. "Dutton, Philip" with a
               picture of the same face CAMERA FINDS working a bad comb-
               over in the rearview mirror.

               IN THE SEVILLE TRACY, almost sixteen, dressed for nightlife,
               sees Dutton primping in her rearview mirror. He's getting
               out now.

                                     TRACY
                         Oh no...

               She jostles her friend JANNIE, passed out in the front
               passenger seat, trying to rouse her. No luck. DUTTON motions
               and Tracy buzzes down the window.

                                     TRACY (CONT'D)
                         Anything wrong?

                                     DUTTON
                         Let's hope not. License and
                         registration please.

               Tracy tries hard to keep her smile going as she looks
               through her purse. Not finding anything.

                                     DUTTON (CONT'D)
                         What's with your friend there?

                                     TRACY
                         She's... sick.
                              (off Dutton)
                         Actually she never had Mai Tais
                         before.

                                     DUTTON
                         But you, you've had them.

                                     TRACY
                         Not tonight. Honest.

               Tracy paws through her purse some more. Vamping.

                                     DUTTON
                         If you had a license, I bet I'd
                         have seen it by now. How old are
                         you? Fifteen?

                                     TRACY
                         Look, I'll tell you the truth.
                         Jannie drove us and was supposed
                         to drive us back, she has a license,
                         but I mean... look at her.

               Dutton leaves that dangling. Circles around to the passenger
               side...

                                     TRACY (CONT'D)
                              (whisper to Jannie)
                         Get up, get up...!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      27.


               Dutton opens Jannie's door, leans in, slides a hand between
               her slightly parted legs. Dutton smiles at Tracy.

                                     DUTTON
                         Why don't you get out.

               CROWVISION High overhead. Tracy steps out of the car. Dutton
               shuts the passenger door, points. Tracy moves behind the
               Seville.

               RESUME Dutton closes in. She's getting very nervous.

                                     TRACY
                         You want me to walk a straight
                         line?

                                     DUTTON
                         I want you... to bend over.

                                     TRACY
                         Look, can I just call a cab?

                                     DUTTON
                         What did I say?

               Tracy bends over the car trunk. Dutton eases her feet apart
               with the tip of his boot then pulls out his NIGHTSTICK,
               uses it to lift her tiny skirt slowly up over her butt. As
               he does, she stands back up, shakes her head "no."

                                     DUTTON (CONT'D)
                         Maybe I'll ask your friend.

               Tracy's frantic, about to call out as Dutton moves to the
               passenger door, opens it and...

               OVER DUTTON - ALEX sits in the passenger seat now. Jannie
               shunted inward.

                                     ALEX
                              (mimicking Dutton)
                         I want you... to bend over. Officer
                         Dutton.

               Dutton pulls his 9MM BARETTA on Alex.

                                     DUTTON
                         Where'd you come from? Out of the
                         car. Now!

               With insolent slowness, Alex finishes writing...

               "THE LIST" a red line drawn through Dutton's name.

               ALEX gets out of the car. Dutton SLAMS the door and Janie
               stirs, coming to. At least a bit.

                                     DUTTON (CONT'D)
                         Hands on the car.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      28.


                                     ALEX
                         Question. These hands?

               Alex advances on Dutton.

                                     DUTTON
                         You're dead, ditch weed.

               CLOSE. Dutton's finger squeezes the trigger.

               BAM! The shot blows Alex back at the Seville passenger
               window. Slumped face against the car.

                                     TRACY
                         Omigod, omigod...

               Jannie's head pops up inside the car. She SCREAMS at...

               JANNIE'S POV Alex right in her face, nice and dead. Dutton
               lowers his gun BG. Tracy in a panic. Suddenly, Alex opens
               his eyes, smiles.

               Face distorted against the glass. She screams again.

                                     ALEX
                         You're up.

               ALEX wheels around, wrenches Dutton's wrist, vise gripped.
               Dutton's gun falls to the ground.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Ladies. Drive carefully.

               Tracy rushes to the driver side.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You might want to call 911. Report
                         an officer down.

               Tracy SCREECHES off leaving Dutton in shock.

                                     DUTTON
                         That was a fucking hollow point!

                                     ALEX
                         I guess it's true. Guns don't kill
                         people...

               Alex draws the KNIFE--the murder weapon--from his costume.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Think maybe knives do?

                                     DUTTON
                         Keep that thing away from me.

                                     ALEX
                         This is not just some "thing."
                         It's A C zero zero five.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      29.


                                     DUTTON
                         You're the skel broke into the
                         evidence room.

               FLASH. The knife moves and RIP! Alex yanks the sleeve off
               Dutton's uniform, revealing a SCARLESS FOREARM.

                                     DUTTON (CONT'D)
                         Fuck! What do you want?

                                     ALEX
                         A scar. On the arm. Of the man who
                         planted this in Alex Corvis's car.

                                     DUTTON
                         There's no scar, you freak. The
                         Corvis kid made it up.

               Alex glitches, hearing this a second time, then RAMS Dutton
               into a wall with a great CLATTER of trash cans.

               Alex all over him, holding Dutton's head firmly in his two
               hands, like he could crush it in an instant.

                                     ALEX
                         He was innocent. You framed him.
                         You. And Erlich. And Larkin. And
                         Toomey. What do you think, Officer
                         Dutton? An eye for an eye?

               Alex's thumbs inch toward Dutton's eyes, grazing Dutton's
               eyelids now and a wild thing happens.

               FLASH!  ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Dutton's Nightstick lifts
               Lauren's skirt.

               Then flashs of a bloodsoaked struggle, Lauren's death. And
               the surprise BAM! of a shot fired.

               RESUME Alex thrown by this. Relaxes his grip on Dutton.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You were there. All four of you.

               Dutton kicks him off, smashes a garbage can over Alex's
               back then pulls a SMALL SEMI-AUTO from an ankle holster.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You killed her. I saw it.

                                     DUTTON
                         Bitch killed herself when she shot
                         a cop in the leg. If she' just
                         acted like a girl nothing would
                         have happened.
                              (then)
                         So you're right, spooky. Happy?

               BAM! Alex barely slowed by the shot, advancing, Dutton
               starting to panic. BAM!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      30.


               Alex keeps coming, right up to the gun. Pointed right at
               his face, then...

               WHOOSH. Alex flips it around, RAMS the gun in Dutton's
               mouth. He couldn't talk if he wanted to.

                                     ALEX
                         I'm working on it.

               BAM! We HEAR the blast as we... CUT TO:

               INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT

               BAM BAM continues, but these are TOY GUNS, fired in synch
               with POUNDING MUSIC.

               In the hands of TWO STRIPPERS. Topless, leather G's and
               chokers, black stockings, POLICE HATS on their heads, law
               enforcement stars for earrings.

               The CAPACITY CROWD responds as they pout, wield their
               weapons.

               AT THE ENTRANCE - MADDEN a straightfaced plainclothes
               detective, more upscale than the clientele, flashes a BADGE
               at a BOUNCER who scowls, lets him pass.

               WITH MADDEN circumnavigating the mainstage, where the cop-
               strippers are waving handcuffs now. At the edge of the
               room, LAP-DANCERS pull one-on-one's for twenties. Madden
               exits...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

               BACKSTAGE Madden moves past girls in various stages of
               undress. Smoking, yapping, waiting to go onstage. One looks
               up, interested, but he doesn't look back, exits into...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY

               AN INTERNET PORN FACILITY Where "live" sex workers man
               tiny fantasy sets--a Dungeon, a Shower, a desk and
               blackboard meant to suggest a Schoolroom. Crudely built,
               but good enough for 500x800 pixel resolution. Madden stops
               a second, looking...

               OVER A MONITOR - THE DUNGEON SET UPDATES every six seconds,
               the slowly changing low-rez version of the action on the
               set--a woman tied to a chair with bright surgical tubing.

               The picture refreshes and BG, the woman sneaks an expertly
               timed sip of Diet Coke, puts the can away before the picture
               updates again.

               A COUNTER shows 132,768 hits and climbing. Madden gives a
               look, like people are really fucked up, continues past a
               curtain with a "No Admittance" sign into...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      31.


               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK HALL - NIGHT

               A BACK HALL dark, the furthest recesses of the building.
               Madden continues cautiously toward... A DOOR

               INT. THE HOLE - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

               The door is cracked open. Madden moving very quietly now,
               scowling as he peers through the slight opening.

               Three guys and whirring machines counting stacks of money.
               Guns on the tabletops, in holsters, out of reach.

               The door flies open.

                                     MADDEN
                         Police!

               A moment of panic as the guys bent over the machines freeze.
               Raise their hands, slowly turn. Then lower their hands.

                                     ERLICH
                         You fuck. Don't do that.

               It's Erlich, Larkin and Toomey. Three cops we met at the
               execution. Erlich's cane nearby.

                                     MADDEN
                         How's the month end?

                                     ERLICH
                         Oh yes. Never been better.

                                     MADDEN
                         Where's Dutton?

                                     ERLICH
                         Probably parked near some high
                         school with a hardon. Fuck never
                         showed.

                                     MADDEN
                         Anyone at all curious why?

               Erlich, Larkin and Toomey exchange a look. Madden goes to
               one of the money counters and grabs...

               A STACK OF TWENTIES tossed violently at the ceiling.

               Larkin and Toomey scramble as the bills flutter down like
               leaves, picking them up.

                                     MADDEN (CONT'D)
                         You leave the door open with two
                         hundred strangers out there!  What's
                         it take for you guys to learn a
                         goddamn lesson?

                                     TOOMEY
                         No one saw anything, Mad.

                                                                      32.


                                     MADDEN
                         You know why Dutton's not here?
                         Rigor mortis! He's dead.

               The Three exchange looks.

                                     MADDEN (CONT'D)
                         One shot to the head, then fifty
                         three stab wounds with a six inch
                         blade. Any deja vu here? Think
                         Corvus knife, missing from the
                         evidence room.

                                     TOOMEY
                         Since when?

                                     MADDEN
                         Since last night. As usual, you're
                         right on top of things.

                                     LARKIN
                         It was supposed to end when Corvis
                         died. Remember? The kid no one
                         would miss?

                                     ERLICH
                         Don't look at me, asshole.

                                     LARKIN
                         Hey, I didn't kill anybody.

                                     ERLICH
                         Back off. I mean it.

                                     MADDEN
                         Shut up! Erlich and Larkin settle
                         down.

                                     MADDEN (CONT'D)
                         Crime scene's a goddamn clusterfuck.
                         Every reporter in town's trying to
                         get a look at Dutton's body. I
                         suggest we get a line on this before
                         someone else does.

                                     LARKIN
                         Who'd give a shit about Corvis at
                         this point? Kid didn't have a friend
                         in the world even when he was alive.

                                     ERLICH
                         I can think of one.

               Erlich and Madden share a look. On the same wavelength.
               Erlich picks up his weapon off the table.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      33.


               EXT. CITY STREET #1 - NIGHT

               A large CRIME SCENE marked off by tape, Dutton's cruiser
               where he left it. Several other cruisers nearby, lights
               flashing. An ambulance, stretcher being unloaded now.

               AN ACTION NEWSTEAM the one we've seen before, Barbara
               Gonzalez frontman, speaking into a mic, too far away for
               us to hear.

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               CLOSE on a TV. Gonzalez audible now.

                                     GONZALEZ
                         ... rumors multiply as officials
                         refuse to confirm or deny reports
                         of multiple, multiple stab wounds...

               Gonzalez CONTINUES UNDER as...

                                     ERIN
                         Dad! Come in here!

               The SOUND of footsteps racing down the hall.

                                     RANDALL
                         What is it?

                                     ERIN
                         The cop who found the knife in
                         Corvis's car.

               Randall riveted by the TV now.

                                     GONZALEZ
                         They're moving him now, body
                         covered. It would appear that thirty
                         seven year old Phillip Dutton is
                         dead in the line of duty...

               ON THE TV the Newsteam and Gonzalez SHOVED back by COPS
               running defense for the stretcher. Gonzalez grabs for the
               sheet covering the body and...

               NEWSCAM TIGHT on Dutton, as the sheet pulls down, partially
               uncovering...

               DUTTON'S HEAD: Comb-over hanging to the side. Blood dripping
               from crude letters carved in his bald pate--the word
               "DAISY."  Quickly covered by a COP who yells at Gonzalez...

                                     COP
                         Out of here! Now!

               ... but through a digital miracle the "Daisy" frame has
               been grabbed, and appears as a still now behind Gonzalez.

               RESUME - FAVORING ERIN struck dumb by this.

                                     GONZALEZ
                         Shocking even for these mean
                         streets, the word "Daisy" apparently
                         cut into his head by the
                         perpetrator, still at large. A
                         name. Perhaps a message...

               Gonzalez FADES UNDER as Erin backs away from the TV.

                                     RANDALL
                         What? What is it?

                                     ERIN
                         Lauren called me that when we were
                         little. Daisy. No one knew but us.

                                     RANDALL
                         Honey. It's doesn't mean anything.
                         It's not a message.

                                     ERIN
                         That guy in the cemetery today
                         said he knew everything about
                         Lauren.

                                     RANDALL
                         It still doesn't mean...

                                     ERIN
                         He said he'd prove it.

               Off Randall, as he sits on the bed, thoughtful...

               EXT. CITY STREET #1 - NIGHT

               WIDE. The ambulance drives off, lights flashing, and we
               BOOM UP over the crime scene, over the Newsteam, revealing
               the top of Dutton's cruiser, marked with a BLOODRED CROW.

               Continuing upward, FINDING... The Crow, perched high on a
               building. It takes flight.

               EXT. CITY - AIRBORNE - NIGHT

               The Crow soaring through this lousy part of town.

               EXT. LOW-RENT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

               The Crow swoops in, lands on the roof of a low end brick
               building, peers down over the edge.

               Camera DRIFTS DOWN the side of he building finding a light,
               someone burning the midnight oil.

               FINDING a CHESS SET mid-game near the open window as...

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               WAM! Erlich's CANE knocks a pile of papers to the floor
               off a desk piled high with briefs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      35.


                                     WALSH
                         I don't know about any knife. I'm
                         trying to forget that case.

                                     ERLICH
                         Well someone isn't. They killed
                         Dutton.

                                     WALSH
                         It wasn't me.

                                     ERLICH
                         No shit. You couldn't get close to
                         him. But I'm betting you know who
                         did. Who's into Corvis? Huh?

               Erlich flips through a Rolodex, knocks it to the floor,
               then picks up a PHONE LOG off the desk.

                                     ERLICH (CONT'D)
                         Not a lot of calls. Business slow?

               He tosses the phone log out the window.

               EXT. LOW-RENT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

               HIGH ANGLE. Watching the phone log fluttering down.

               INCLUDE ALEX, sitting where the Crow was perched, wearing
               Dutton's badge on his evolving costume.

               Alex winces at the voices faint but audible from below.

                                     ERLICH'S VOICE
                         You're the only one gave a flying
                         fuck about him when he was alive.

                                     WALSH'S VOICE
                         Lauren Randall did.

                                     ERLICH'S VOICE
                         Hey. Bitches are crazy. Richer
                         they are, crazier they get.

               "THE LIST" The name "Erlich, Vincent" crossed off now by
               Alex.

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Erlich limps through frame toward Walsh, grabs him roughly
               by the collar.

                                     WALSH
                         Maybe if you hadn't fried an
                         innocent kid...

                                     ERLICH
                         Who is it?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      36.


                                     WALSH
                         How about the real killer. You
                         think of that?

               Erlich violently tosses Walsh crashing back toward the
               window, falling by the chess board.

                                     ERLICH
                         If you're covering for someone,
                         that's jail time. I got my eye on
                         you.

               Erlich exits, slamming the door behind him. Walsh starts
               to get up, stops. Looking at his own eye level...

               ALEX'S CHESS BOARD set up identically to the game in Alex's
               cell, a piece of FOLDED PAPER protruding from under the
               board. Walsh pulls it out.

               It says "Q-->B5" WALSH makes the move, Queen to Bishop
               Five. Smiles. Looks at...

               THE PAPER UNFOLDED says "Check." Walsh sets it down in the
               Chess Box next to...

               THE PICTURE OF ALEX AND LAUREN arms around each other in
               the woods, smiling.

               WALSH sensing something, a presence.

                                     WALSH
                         Alex?

               Walsh moves cautiously to the curtains, draws them back.
               Nothing. He leans out the window.

               EXT. LOW-RENT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

               CROWVISION: Starting on Walsh, popping his head out the
               window two stories down, INCLUDING Erlich as he exits the
               building, gets in a SILVER PORSCHE.

               Picture bending wildly as the Porsche takes off and the
               Crow takes flight.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. CITY STREET #2 - INTERSECTION - NIGHT

               A RED TRAFFIC LIGHT. The Porsche pulling to a stop.

               IN THE PORSCHE Erlich looks down, presses a button on the
               stereo. Elvis from his baroque period "If I can Dream."
               Erlich looks up, waves his arms.

                                     ERLICH
                         No, no...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      37.


               ERLICH'S POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD A BUM starts to
               "clean" the windshield with an OILY rag, leaving opaque
               smears on the once clean glass.

               THUD. A handful of gravelly MUD lands on the windshield,
               starts to get smeared around. ERLICH pounding the window
               from inside.

                                     ERLICH (CONT'D)
                         No! Shit!

               The bum is giving the driver side window the same treatment.
               Hard to see anything now. Erlich throws up his hands in
               disgust, reaches for the door handle just as...

               SMASH!  The driver side window SHATTERS as something enters
               at high speed KICKING Erlich across the car...

               Erlich's head bounces off the passenger window, leaving a
               BLOODY SMEAR. Alex in the driver seat now.

                                     ALEX
                         The Germans really know how to
                         make a car, don't they?

               LOW ANGLE ON THE PORSCHE wheels spinning as it peels out.

               INT. CORVETTE - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

               WINDSHIELD WASHERS and WIPERS clear away the grime Alex
               smeared on the windshield, revealing that we're rocketing
               through a bad part of town.

               MUSIC CONTINUES as Alex pulls the KNIFE out of his costume
               with his LEFT HAND. It looks huge in the cramped sports
               car.

                                     ALEX
                              (re: Lauren knife)
                         I heard you were looking for this.

                                     ERLICH
                         You're the guy killed Dutton.

                                     ALEX
                         I want you to think of me as the
                         guy who killed you.

               Erlich pulls a .380 SEMI-AUTO stashed between the two seats.
               Points it at Alex.

                                     ERLICH
                         Stop the car.

               Alex FLOORS it and... BAM.

               Erlich blows a hole through Alex's LEFT ARM, a yawning
               aperture through which Erlich watches the passing scenery
               a few improbably seconds.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                     ALEX
                         Ow.

               The WOUND closes. Knife still in Alex's hand.

                                     ERLICH
                         Fuck. Me.

                                     ALEX
                         What happened to your leg there
                         Officer? Hunting accident?

               WHOP. In one swift move Alex impales the knife THROUGH
               ERLICH'S WRIST, into his thigh. Erlich SCREAMS, tries to
               remove the knife, but Alex keeps a firm grip on the handle.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Lauren Randall shot you trying to
                         get free. The fifty three stab
                         wounds she died of came from you.
                         Am I right? Ballpark?

               Erlich tries to stay steely, yells louder as...

               EXT. CITY STREET #2 - NIGHT

               The Corvette bumps over a sidewalk, runs a red light.

               A POLICE CRUISER going the other way pulls a stunt U, flips
               on its lights. In hot pursuit.

               INT. CORVETTE - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

               Bumpier now as Alex's driving gets more and more erratic.

                                     ALEX
                         In Saudi Arabia they cut off the
                         hands of petty thieves. What price
                         for a life? Two lives?

               FLASH. Alex yanks the Knife out and FLASH, slices through
               the left arm of Erlich's jacket, sawing into the FLESH.
               Erlich's arm bleeding.

                                     ERLICH
                         Not my arm! What you fucking want?

                                     ALEX
                         I want Lauren. I want my life back.
                         I want... to know why.

                                     ERLICH
                         Why? Why's anything happen? It's
                         all money, man. Money. The girl
                         just got in the way.

               Alex grimaces, then RIP, he yanks the sleeves off Erlich's
               arm. Erlich looks down, surprised to see his arm intact.

                         The scar. Which of you has it?

                                     ERLICH
                         Nobody.

               Alex poises the knife for another descent.

                                     ERLICH (CONT'D)
                         I swear. It's a bullshit fucking
                         story the loser boyfriend made up.

               This gives Alex pause. He shakes his head, clearing the
               reality glitch, looks up...

               IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR Cop cars, lights flashing.

               EXT. CITY STREET #4 - NIGHT

               The Corvette slides around a corner, screams into a final
               straightaway that dead ends into the sloping concrete side
               of an overpass.

               The cops not far behind. The Porsche bottoming out on a
               bump now ant...

               INT. CORVETTE - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

               Alex's sun visor falls partway down from the jolt. He
               reaches to push it back into position and notices...

               ON THE BACK OF THE VISOR The CAR REGISTRATION. Alex takes
               it out of the holder. RESUME Alex suddenly calm. He reaches
               down for...

               THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER pushed in. The volume on the Elvis
               song pumped up. ALEX relaxes back in his seat as they scream
               toward the abutment.

                                     ERLICH
                         Are you out of your fucking mind?
                         We're going to die.

                                     ALEX
                         How can you die if you're already
                         dead?

                                     ERLICH
                         You're him. Corvis.

                                     ALEX
                         I was talking about you.

               Alex smiles as the CIGARETTE LIGHTER pops out. He grabs it
               and the GLOW vanishes as he closes his fist around it.

               Erlich turns front in horror. The microsecond of terror
               realized as Elvis climaxes, the retaining wall zoomes in...

                                     ELVIS
                         My dream... comes true... right
                         now!

               EXT. OVERPASS / ABUTMENT - NIGHT

               WHAM! The Corvette hits at a million mph. Crumpling,
               disintegrating, and hurling two bodies bouncing off the
               abutment.

               THE CAVALRY - CRUISERS AND PLAINWRAPS Too late. A half
               dozen cars bearing down all lights and sirens. Screeching
               to a halt by what used to be a silver Porsche.  The ruptured
               gas tank spurting GASOLINE.

               A CRUISER screeches to a halt. Both doors fly open. Toomey
               and Larkin step out. Toomey on his radio as Larkin looks
               up the embankment, catches a glimpse of...

               ALEX battered but alive, jerkily unclenches his fist, still
               holding the Lighter, glow fading.  He tosses...

               THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER arcs down onto the ex-Corvette. WIDER -
               BOOM!  Cops shield themselves as the Crash scene explodes
               in a huge FIREBALL that engulfs a cruiser stopped too close
               by.

               IN THE TOO-CLOSE COP CAR the DRIVER rams the car into
               REVERSE. Tires squeal as the fireball hits and...

               THE TOO-CLOSE CRUISER Engine compartment ignites, a second
               fireball racing backward into another Cruiser. BOOM!

               Total chaos now. LARKIN focussed on Alex, seen vaguely
               through the flames. Moving toward him.

               WITH LARKIN as he arrives at the top of the enbankment,
               draws his weapon. Hyperalert. Alex is gone, but he finds...

               ERLICH'S BODY two hundred broken boned bagged by bruises.
               Larkin pulls something out of Erlich's shattered fist.
               It's...

               "THE LIST" Dutton and Erlich crossed off. Larkin and Toomey
               yet to go, but the first letters of their names are all
               contained in a VERTICAL OVAL, "DELT" circled in red.

               LARKIN, AS TOOMEY JOINS HIM They give each other an oh-
               shit look. Then Larkin checkes his fingertips, smeared red
               from...

               "THE LIST" - FLIP SIDE the CROW CIPHER, rendered thick in
               coagulating blood. Illuminated by the flickering light of
               the fire below.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               CLOSE. A heart shaped Locket swung gently back and forth,
               then closed in Erin's hand as CAW!

               Erin turns, sees the Crow perched on the window ledge. As
               she moves to the open window, the Crow flies off.

               ERIN'S POV - OUT THE WINDOW - THE CRASH SCENE far away,
               the flashing lights and sirens of fire trucks arriving to
               bring the fire under control.

               ERIN looks, wondering, then spots something closer to hom.
               She moves off, WIPING through frame REVEALING...

               ON THE FRONT LAWY Alex. He looks down now, at the front
               door where...

               EXT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

               Erin exits the front door and we see her framed against
               the huge house, a rich-man's castle built in the twenties
               of quarried stone, quarter sawn oak and leaded glass.

               Erin, like her sister, a child of privilege. She approaches
               Alex.

                                     ERIN
                         Daisy. How did you know?

                                     ALEX
                         I told you, I knew your sister.

                                     ERIN
                         You killed that cop Dutton.

                                     ALEX
                         And another one. There. Erlich.
                         Took a wrong turn.

               Alex points at the distant crash site, the vague flashing
               lights.

                                     ERIN
                         I know who you are.
                              (no response)
                         That's why you paint your face. To
                         hide.

                                     ALEX
                         I'm not hiding. I'm right here.

                                     ERIN
                         You killed Lauren! You killed her!

               Erin shakes her head, trying to absorb what's going on,
               then RUSHES ALEX, screaming, beating on him, fists of fury.

                                                                      42.


                                     ALEX
                         Not me. Dirty cops killed her.
                         Dutton, Erlich...

               Alex tries to handle her flailing arms but she's too manic.
               He's getting hit in the face, the chest, and it's hurting.
               He grabs her roughly, gets her to stop.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         I've been shot, and stabbed and
                         thrown from a car and none of it
                         hurt. But what you're doing now,
                         does. I don't know why.

                                     ERIN
                         My dad was right! He said you'd
                         ruin her life.

                                     ALEX
                         No. Listen to me. Lauren found out
                         something they didn't want her to
                         know.
                              (then)
                         This.

               He holds up a Card, the Registration from the Corvette.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         From the bonfire over there. Look
                         at it.

                                     ERIN
                         No! Why are you haunting me?

                                     ALEX
                         Because you need to understand.
                         And you need... to be careful.

               He tries to give it to her one more time, then flips the
               card through the air. She turns, watching its flight all
               the way to the landing by the front door...

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         I'm sorry. Your father wasn't right.

               She turns back and...

               He's gone. Erin walks to the door. Despite herself reaches
               for the Card on the landing. It's...

               THE CORVETTE REGISTRATION which we see clearly for the
               first time. Owned by a company called DELT. The address is
               4201 Forestview Drive.

               ERIN spins around horrified, holds up the Registration.

               THE ADDRESS ON THE REGISTRATION - 4201 FORESTVIEW matches
               the numbers two feet away from her--the address plaque on
               her own house.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - ROLL CALL BULLPEN - DAY

               The buzz of nervous COP WALLA settles out as a stocky
               SERGEANT #2, clueless but honest, raises his voice, trying
               to command attention.

                                     SERGEANT#2
                         Listen up! Yo! We got a cop killer
                         out there.

               Walla responds "no shit"--and CAMERA BOOMS UP, moving to
               the back of the room over a nervous sea of blue uniforms.

                                     SERGEANT#2 (CONT'D)
                         Til we get an I.D. treat everyone
                         like a suspect. Patrol assignments
                         are posted by the door. Read them.

                         til we catch this asshole.

               Sergeant #2 CONTINUES UNDER as CAMERA FINDS...

               FAVORING LARKIN, TOOMEY AND MADDEN huddling together at
               the back. Urgent whispers. Larkin and Toomey try to contain
               their panic.

                                     LARKIN
                         He knows. I saw him. Fucking zombie
                         mask.

                         Calm down.

                         You calm down.

               Larkin takes out "The List" from the crash site.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)

                         You didn't testify. You're not on

                         crash, but takes time out for art.

               He pockets "The List." Then looks up as...

                         The old man's requested the pleasure

               Madden shakes his head like this is bad news, rises and
               leaves.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - DAY

               A SECRETARY mans a LOW COUNTER guarding a large door at
               the end of the huge empty hall. She's got a heavy mascara
               trailer park vibe, looks up from her eyelash curler at the
               sound of approaching FOOTSTEPS.

               HER POV - THROUGH THE EYELASH CURLER Madden approaches.
               Stops. THE SECRETARY smiles, hits a BUTTON under the
               counter. The door to the Captain's office swings open.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Glad I'm not you.

                                     MADDEN
                         Right back at ya.

               She checks out Madden as he moves past her, then puts the
               eyelash curler away in a NAILIT containing a couple of
               razor sharp SCALPELS.

               INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY

               No sunlight in this cavernous, wood-panelled office. The
               Captain obscure in skifts of shadow at the edge of the
               room.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Sit down.

               Madden sits.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         I thought we had an understanding.
                         I thought we understood that
                         discretion is paramount.

                                     MADDEN
                         Yeah, we do.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Shut up.

               Madden does. The Captain begins and intense slow burn.

                                                                      45.


                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Erlich gimping around in his goddamn
                         hot rod is not discreet. I've got
                         reporters asking me how much he
                         made. I've got the entire force
                         looking at this case now.

                                     MADDEN
                         I know.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         You know.

                                     MADDEN
                         I know the guy leaves a sign.

               Madden produces "The List," flips it over to show the Crow
               doodle in blood.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         No shit he leaves a sign. He's a
                         goddamn Picasso.

               The Captain slaps down a crime scene photo--the Crow
               emblazoned huge on the top of Dutton's cruiser.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         What else do you know? Do you know
                         this?

               The Captain SLAMS a file down in front of Madden, who lets
               things cool out a moment before looking at it.

                                     MADDEN
                              (reads cover)
                         Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in
                         the Corvis case.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Some hooker phoned it in. There
                         was a riot at his apartment
                         yesterday.

                                     MADDEN
                         Guy dressed for Halloween?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Good for you. You do know something.

               They look up as the Secretary enters, holding the door
               open, like it's time to leave. Madden starts to speak and...

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Don't say. Just do. Before it all
                         comes tumbling down.

               The Secretary gives Madden a look as he exits, then joins
               the captain who's standing...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      46.


               BY AN AWARDS CASE holding glass bowls and trophies presented
               to the Captain over the years for Civic Service.

               The Secretary wraps her arms around him from behind as he
               looks at his loot.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Idiots.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Sssshhhh.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         You're the only one who makes it
                         go away.

               As he turns toward her embrace, CAMERA ADJUSTS to point up
               something we may have noticed...

               IN THE CASE - A STUFFED BIRD, on one of the glass shelves.
               CUT TO:

               EXT. RANDALL HOUSE - NIGHT

               CAMERA CREEPS toward the large stone house. A light comes
               on at one end of the lower floor, shining through the
               window.

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - NATHAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Erin works at her father's desk under the light of an
               antique floor lamp. Using a LETTER OPENER to PRY open...

               A DESK DRAWER full of files. She flips through, finds a
               manila file marked--DELT. Takes it out. ERIN lays the file
               open on the desktop.

               EMPTY. She checks...

               A SMALL PAPER SHREDDER under the desk. Judging from the
               paper spaghetti in the basket underneath, recently used.
               ERIN scoops up the shreds of paper. No way to reassemble
               this.

                                     RANDALL
                              (trying to be casual)
                         What are you doing there?

               Erin's a terrible liar, spooked as he approaches.

                                     ERIN
                         I think I dropped an earring.

                                     RANDALL
                         Looks like you have them both on.

               She jumps up as her father reaches the desk, keeps her
               distance. He spots the empty DELT folder, closes it.

                                                                      47.


                                     ERIN
                         Alex Corvis didn't kill Lauren.
                         Cops did. Didn't they?

               No response.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         You're in with them.

                                     RANDALL
                         It's not what you think.

                                     ERIN
                         You killed her!

                                     RANDALL
                         No.

                                     ERIN
                         Stay away from me! Stay away!

                                     RANDALL
                         Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.

               Erin SCREAMS, runs out the door with her hands over her
               ears. He misses a beat, then RUNS after her.

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT FOYER - NIGHT

               Nathan catches up with her as she frantically grabs CAR
               KEYS out of a dish by the front door.

               He grabs hold of her arm, she struggles, CLAWS at his face
               to get loose. Squeaks out the door onto...

               EXT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

               Erin runs to the far side of the big Benz, parked in the
               driveway. Tries the door. The ALARM goes off.

                                     RANDALL
                         They killed her because she found
                         out.

                                     ERIN
                         About you.

                                     RANDALL
                         About them. You've got to leave it
                         alone.

               ACROSS THE STREET, A PORCH LIGHT comes on. Erin hits a
               button on the key ring, CHIRP CHIRP. It stops.

                                     RANDALL (CONT'D)
                         Sweetheart...

                                     ERIN
                         Don't call me that! Don't call me
                         anything!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      48.


               A NEIGHBOR opens the door, peers at them from across the
               street. Inquisitive.

                                     RANDALL
                         I would never hurt you or Lauren.
                         Never. Believe me.

                                     ERIN
                         I don't believe you.

                                     RANDALL
                         Please. Come inside.

                                     ERIN
                         I'm never going back in that house
                         again. Get away.

               He edges away from the car, reluctantly. She starts to get
               in, anger giving way to extreme sadness.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                              (crying now)
                         They killed Alex for something you
                         did, daddy. You killed both of
                         them.

               She gets in the car. Starts it. ERRRKKKK! She peels out
               backward down the driveway.

               SLAMS the car into Drive and tears off down the street.
               The Neighbor shakes her head at Nathan, goes back inside.

               INT. TENEMENT - THOMAS LEONARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               WHAM! Thomas Leonard bounces off the wall, drops to the
               floor.

               A FEMALE FIGURE wipes through frame, throws herself on
               Larkin, who's roughing up Tommy.

                                     TOMMY'S WIFE
                         Please! Leave him alone!

               Larkin backhands her sprawling to the floor, where she
               crawls to the WAILING BABY, takes him in sheltering arms.

                                     TOMMY
                         I'm not making this up. He had a
                         crow with him.

                                     LARKIN
                         Caw, caw, that's what you're telling
                         me.

                                     TOMMY
                         He said I lied at his trial. It's
                         Alex Corvis.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      49.


                                     LARKIN
                         So we're talking... a ghost. With
                         a pet bird.

               Tommy nods.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         Turn down that fucking baby!

               The baby's gets quieter as the mom rocks it.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         Get up, Tommy. I want to show you
                         something.

               Larkin helps Tommy to his feet. Places "The List" on the
               table. Then RAMS Tommy's face down on top of it.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         You see that? My name's next on
                         his list. It's fucking next.

               Larkin hauls Tommy back upright. Dazed.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         So who is the guy, Tommy?

                                     TOMMY
                         Corvis. It's...

                                     LARKIN
                              (cutting him off)
                         Take your time. Think before you
                         speak. Cause at this point I got
                         to hear something besides the crap
                         you're been spewing.

               KA-CHUNK. Toomey cycles his 9mm. Everything dead silent.

                                     TOMMY
                         He said the whole trial was a setup.
                         That I caused an innocent kid to
                         die. Is that true?

               Larkin grimaces. The only question is how to end this.

               EXT. TENEMENT - ALLEY - NIGHT

               Madden stands by a plainwrap ,calmly SMOKING.

               A SCREAM above. He looks up to see CRASH!

               Tommy's BODY breaks through a window four floors up and
               falls with broken glass, landing by Madden who rubs his
               temple a second, then calmly grinds out the butt.

               INT. TENEMENT - THOMAS LEONARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Tommy's wife horrified, pleading, as Toomey raises his
               weapon.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      50.


                                     TOMMY'S WIFE
                         No, please...

               Her voice stops mid-sentence as BAM.

               The baby still crying as Toomey takes aim again, then lowers
               his weapon, starts to leave the room with Larkin. At the
               door, Toomey turns and BAM!

               The crying stops.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               CLOSE. A diminished field of Chess Pieces. ADJUST to include
               Walsh, scrutinizing the board.

                                     WALSH
                         Alex?

               He looks out the window a second. Then scans the room again.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                         C'mon. I'm talking to my myself
                         here. It's humiliating.

               Walsh goes back to the board, makes a move.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                         Check and mate.

                                     ALEX
                         Dream on.

               Walsh looks up. Nothing. Then Alex steps from the shadows.
               Walsh looks at him a long moment, sees through the makeup.

                                     WALSH
                         My God. It's really you under there.

               The two guys look at each other a long moment, cross the
               few steps to hug. Walsh blown away.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                         I'd like to say you're looking
                         good, but...

               Walsh leans in, examines Dutton's BADGE on Alex's costume.

                                     ALEX
                         Two down. Two to go.

                                     WALSH
                         "Down?" Wait, don't tell me.

                                     ALEX
                         The cops from my trial. They killed
                         Lauren. The whole thing was fixed.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                              (off Walsh)
                         You think I'm crazy.

                                     WALSH
                         I'm thinking... that explains a
                         lot.

               Walsh sits down. Disturbed.

                                     ALEX
                         Lauren's father's involved. He
                         bought the cops fancy cars, I don't
                         know what else. It's a company
                         called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren
                         found out.

                                     WALSH
                         What do they do that they had to
                         kill her?

                                     ALEX
                         I was hoping you'd find out.

                                     WALSH
                         Yeah. I sure will.

               They both turn as the Crow lands in the window, CAWS.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                              (at the bird)
                         Boo!

               The Crow flies off. Walsh goes to the window and looks
               out.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                         What's the deal with this bird.
                         It's been hanging around. Alex?

               He turns toward Alex, who's gone. A double take as Walsh
               gets it, whips around, looks out the window again. CUT TO:

               EXT. REMOTE ROAD - FOREST - NIGHT

               Far above a solitary car winding through an old-growth
               forest, its headlights stabbing the darkness.

               The Crow soars into frame, watching.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. OLD GROWTH GROVE - NIGHT

               A simple WOODEN CROSS illuminated by the headlights of the
               Big Benz as it pulls off the road into the grove of huge
               trees dripping with moss.

               IN THE BENZ Erin blank as she turns off the car, leaving
               the headlights on. Silence.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      52.


               WITH ERIN as she steps from the car, walks toward the cross.
               Partway there...

               CAW! Erin looks up, finds the Crow fluttering in to perch
               high overhead. Alex emerges from behind a tree, near the
               cross.

                                     ALEX
                         This is where it happened. Right
                         over here.

                                     ERIN
                         Yeah, I know.

               She stays where she is. Alex quiet, affected by the place.
               Erin's about to lose it.

                                     ALEX
                         Are you ok?

                                     ERIN
                         When Lauren was missing the police
                         came to our house. They said they
                         were looking for her, right?
                              (breaking down)
                         But I know now they had her, and
                         the reason they brought her here
                         and knew the could blame it on
                         you...

                                     ALEX
                         No...

                                     ERIN
                         ... is that I sent them here. I
                         told them she came here sometimes.
                         With her dirtball boyfriend. That's
                         exactly what I said.

               She's crying softly. He draws nearer.

                                     ALEX
                         Erin. It's not your fault.

                                     ERIN
                              (losing it now)
                         It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish
                         I were dead.

                                     ALEX
                         No. You don't.

                                     ERIN
                         Yes I do, I really do.

               Seeming to lose patience, Alex lunges at her, like an
               attack.

                                     ALEX
                         There were four of them.

                                     ERIN
                         No...

               He's holding his hands over her eyes, transferring IMAGES
               that shake them both.

               ALEX/ERIN'S INTERNAL POV Jolting FLASHES.

               A Plainwrap stops where the Mercedes is now.

               A hand slams the car into Park. Doors open. Four men get
               out, seen dimly, but they're Dutton, Erlich, Larkin, Toomey.

               Erlich reaches back in to drag Lauren out of the back seat,
               her hands cuffed in front of her.

               Dutton flips up her skirt with his nightstick.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE
                         Four large men. And still...

               Lauren stumbles into Erlich, grabs and BAM! FLASH!

               He takes a shot in the leg from his own, still holstered
               weapon.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         She grabbed one of their guns. Got
                         off a shot, then ran, ran for her
                         life.

               RESUME - PRESENT Erin's covering her face, like trying to
               avoid seeing some horrible thing.

                                     ERIN
                         I don't want to know.

               Alex grabs Erin, forces her to run with him, awkwardly,
               like a three legged race. Tracing the path Lauren covered.

                                     ALEX
                         She ran. Them breathing down her
                         neck...

               Erin stumbling as Alex pushes, cajoles her, the two of
               them running toward a large tree, MATCHING to...

               ALEX/ERIN'S INTERNAL POV Lauren stumbling, her cuffed hands
               hindering, tree limbs hitting her face.

               Her own panting subsumed in the panting of the cops on her
               heels.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE
                         ... all the way from the road to
                         this tree...

               RESUME - PRESENT Erin still trying not to see. Alex forcing
               her.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      54.


                                     ALEX
                         This tree. Here's where it happened.

                                     ERIN
                         I don't want to see!

               Alex spins her up against the tree and we MATCH to...

               ALEX/ERIN'S INTERNAL POV Lauren an adrenaline crazed fighter
               destined to lose. Her movements UNDERCRANKED, strobed.
               Discontinuous and jarring.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE
                         She turned and faced them and went
                         down kicking and punching and
                         fighting them, fighting death as
                         they stabbed her and stabbed her.
                         Fifty three times.

               The brutal cops overwhelm Lauren. She drops to the ground
               as...

               RESUME Erin drops to the forest floor, convulsed in sobs.

                                     ALEX
                         She fought for her life because
                         life is worth living.

               Alex panting. Fierce.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Think about that. And then tell me
                         how much you wish you were dead.

               Off Erin, sobbing, heartbroken. Alex's fury waning as he
               looks at her, wonders if he did the right thing.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Armed men and barbed wire. The Spotlight FLARES and we're...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE HALLWAY - NIGHT

               An odd foursome approaches from the far end of the hall.
               Mercer escorts Madden, the Captain, and the Secretary who
               hangs on her bosses arm, gawking like a tourist.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Why wasn't the incident reported?

                                     MERCER
                         Nothing to report. All inmates
                         were present and accounted for.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         So you pretended nothing happened.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                     MERCER
                         Hey, Corvis fried. I don't really
                         see how it could be him.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         No. I wouldn't expect you to.

               They all enter...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE - NIGHT

               Mercer goes to the locker where he left Alex.

                                     MERCER
                         Be forewarned. Nature takes its
                         toll.
                              (opens locker)
                         Bon appetit.

               The all look inside. The locker is empty. Mercer's the
               only one shocked. He noisily opens and shuts the other
               lockers looking for Alex.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         You lost him! Now lay off the
                         fucking doors!

               Mercer stops, backs off, gives the power trio some space.

                                     MADDEN
                         They botched the execution.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Could say that.

                                     MADDEN
                         Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard
                         was right.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Maybe you were a little harsh on
                         him.

               They watch now as the Secretary moves, drawn to the mirror.

                                     SECRETARY (CONT'D)
                         Babe?

               She's looking at... T

               HE FRACTURED MIRROR. Shards of glass selectively removed
               forming, we see now, a CROW.

                                     MADDEN
                         Fucking crow.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Sign of the dead come back to life.

               Madden turns, not comfortable with the concept.

                         How about sign of a big black bird?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         The dead can return, given
                         sufficient motivation. And Corvis
                         has that.

                                     SECRETARY
                         This guy David Jenkins came back
                         as a ghost because my uncle owed
                         him four dollars. Followed him
                         everywhere. Ruined his life.

                                     MADDEN
                         Time out. You really saying he's
                         back from beyond?

               The Secretary nestles into the Captain, who whispers in
               her ear. He nods.

                                     MADDEN (CONT'D)
                         Cause if you're losing your mind,
                         I got a right to know.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         He's looking for something. Won't
                         stop until he finds it.
                              (then)
                         Sometimes the best way to get rid
                         of someone is to let them have
                         what they want.

                                     SECRETARY
                         The man...

                                     ALEX
                         ... with the scar...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. OLD GROWTH GROVE - NIGHT

               WIDE. Erin sits cross-legged in the HEADLIGHTS of the Benz.
               Alex perches Crow-like on the hood.

                                     ALEX
                         ... took everything I ever cared
                         about. Left me with nothing.

                                     ERIN
                         So you're going to kill him?

                                     ALEX
                         Have to find him first.

               He closes his eyes. Pained at a memory.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You know what Lauren and I were
                         fighting about that night? She had
                         a secret, wouldn't tell me...

                                     ERIN
                         My father.

                                     ALEX
                         All I knew, she was pulling away.
                         It made me crazy.

                                     ERIN
                         I used to be so proud of him. My
                         big deal daddy. And now, he's just
                         a crook. Worse even. And the weird
                         thing is...

               She fights back tears. Gains strength.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         I wish I could hate him but I can't.
                         He said he'd never hurt either of
                         us, and I know it's true and...
                         I'm going back.

                                     ALEX
                         It's what Lauren would do.

               Erin nods, takes the Locket off her neck.

                                     ERIN
                         I want to forget. Forget what I
                         know. Forget myself. Forget
                         everything.

               She winds up to toss the Locket away and Alex hops down
               off the hood. Stops her. Takes the Locket. ALEX

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                              (re: Locket)
                         Keep it. Because it connects you
                         to Lauren. And it connects you to
                         me.

               He fastens the Locket back around her neck. A covenant.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         No matter what happens I'll make
                         sure everyone knows. That you're
                         innocent. That you loved her. I
                         promise.

               CLOSE. Erin pulls some makeup out of her jacket pocket.
               Dumps it on the ground. Finds a pot of dark eyeshadow among
               the containers.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         I don't want to be me anymore.
                         Make me like you.

               Erin's face blasted WHITE by HEADLIGHTS.

               She closes her eyes as Alex begins the first bold lines
               around her eyes and for a moment in the gauzy white light,
               she could be...

               LAUREN opens her eyes a second, smiles, shuts them again.

               WIDER. Alex paints Erin's face in the Benz headlights, the
               two of them kneeling in the forest-cathedral.

               Camera creeps BACKWARD, leaving the two of them connected
               by ritual. And touch. And a promise to each other.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. RANDALL'S HOUSE - NATHAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               CLOSE. A mess of documents. Nathan nervously writing,
               assembling a tell-all at his desk.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         You know it doesn't work this way.

               Nathan gets up. Tries to subtly herd the Captain off.

                                     NATHAN
                         I'm out of this.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Partnerships don't end like that.
                         Friendships don't.

                                     NATHAN
                         Our friendship ended when Lauren
                         died.

               The Captain circles to the desk now, past Nathan.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan?
                         Because there's a ghost threatening
                         us.

                                     RANDALL
                         You mean Alex.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I mean Lauren.

               The Captain flips through some of the papers on the desk.
               Frowns. He closes a file folder.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Because you never accepted that
                         what happened to her was an
                         accident.

                                     RANDALL
                         You killed my daughter.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         An accident, Nathan.

                                     RANDALL
                              (exploding now)
                         She was eighteen years old! There
                         were four of them. They stabbed
                         her fifty three times! Where's the
                         fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is
                         it?!

               Nathan furious. The Captain keeps a preternatural calm.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I watched her grow up. Just like
                         you. I know how her mind worked.
                         She kept snooping around because
                         she was worried about you. What
                         you'd gotten yourself into. So
                         stop blaming me. And blame yourself.

                                     RANDALL
                              (beat, quietly)
                         I do. Every day.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Erin knows, doesn't she?

               This catches Nathan off guard. He starts to say something.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Don't even bother. You never were
                         a good liar.

               The Captain flips through the papers on the desk again.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Look at this. Everything we worked
                         for. You tell me... what are we
                         going to do?

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

               HEADLIGHTS approach from down the street. The Big Benz
               pulls into the empty driveway.

               Erin alone in the car, her mood tough to judge in the Crow
               mask.

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT FOYER - NIGHT

               Erin enters, steels herself. Then she calls out...

                                     ERIN
                         Dad?! You home?

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

               UNDERWATER. Erin plunges her masked face into the wash
               basin in this white-tiled bathroom.

               ANGLE - ERIN A few SLO-MO DROPLETS cascade off her face
               into basin as she scrutinizes herself in the mirror, wipes
               off the mask.

               CAMERA INCHING forward...

               She listens up. Grabs a Towel to blot the water on her
               face. We begin to hear with her...

               DRIP. DRIP. DRIP...

               She tightens the sink faucets. The sound continues DRIP
               DRIP as she moves to...

               THE CLAWFOOT BATHTUB Faucet not dripping, but the sound is
               louder. DRIP DRIP. Erin grabs the shower curtain, whips it
               back REVEALING...

               NATHAN RANDALL behind the tub, face a mask of gore, blown
               off point blank by the BLOODY HANDGUN on the tile next to
               him. ERIN screams.

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               CLOSE. The Chess set. A few pieces moved off the board
               now. Alex not looking at it. He's looking at the picture
               of himself and Lauren taped in the lid of the Chess box.

                                     WALSH
                         It's like a bowl of spaghetti. D-E-
                         L-T is owned by Westwind Builders,
                         Nathan Randall's company. But DELT
                         in turn owns a dozen other
                         corporations. A big mess to wade
                         through, so I checked out Tommy
                         Leonard.

               Alex picks up the BLACK KING.

                                     ALEX
                         Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't
                         matter. I want the King.

                                     WALSH
                         We're getting there. Because in
                         his so-called construction job,
                         Tommy makes a daily delivery to a
                         place called "The Hole."

                         The strip joint?

                         I believe they call it a

               Alex places the picture of himself with Lauren back in the
               box of chess pieces, against the open lid.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                         Places like that, they're about
                         unreported cash, processing money
                         from drugs, prostitution.
                              (then)
                         I took a chance, called asking for
                         Larkin and Toomey, the two other
                         cops. Whoever answered said "they're
                         not here...
                              (meaningfully)
                         ... this is the front office."

               BAM BAM BAM.

               They look up. A shadow banging on the door. Leaving BLOODY
               SMEARS on the outside of the frosted glass.

                                     ERIN
                         Alex!

               Walsh opens the door and Erin enters, wild and blood
               smeared, remnants of the Crow mask around her eyes.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         They killed my dad.

               It all catches up with her now, the flight, the exhaustion.
               She throws herself into his arms.

                                     ALEX
                         It's ok, it's ok...

                                     ERIN
                         It's not. I can't take it.

                                     ALEX
                         Erin. Who?

                                     ERIN
                         I don't know. I found him lying
                         there.

               Alex immobilized by this. He turns to Walsh.

                                     ALEX
                         Where is it? This place?

                                     WALSH
                         I think we should get some support?

                                     ALEX
                         What? Call the police?

                                     ERIN
                         What is this? Where are you going?

               Alex waiting for an address. Finally...

                                     WALSH
                         1315 Berkeley Street.

                                     ERIN
                         Don't leave me. Please.

               Alex turns to her, comforting. Holds her face in his hands.

                                     ALEX
                         It will be over soon.
                              (then)
                         Watch out for each other.

               CUT TO:

               INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT

               More debauched than our previous visit. Darker, more
               crowded.

               Patrons propositioned in front of our eyes by girls barely
               eighteen. The room writhing.

               ON THE MAINSTAGE the "Cop" strippers we saw before, but
               dangerous seeming, as they pantomime an interrogation, a
               handcuffed "perp" manhandled between them.

               AT THE ENTRANCE Alex blows past people waiting to get in,
               creating enough disturbance that TWO BOUNCERS greet him.

                                     ALEX
                         Toomey and Larkin. They're expecting
                         me.

               The Two Bouncers give each other a look. One points to a
               SIGN on the wall: "You must be 21..."

                                     BOUNCER
                         I need to see some I.D., pal. Circus
                         in town?

               The Other Bouncer grabs Alex as he pushes past. Alex heaves
               him into the line of WAITING PATRONS.

               As they go down like dominoes... the First Bouncer pulls a
               GUN.

                                     ALEX
                         I don't think you want to do that.
                         Lot of innocent people here...
                              (looks around)
                         A lot of people, anyway.

               As Alex starts off... BAM! He's blown back by a shot half
               lost in the noisy club. No panic yet.

               ONSTAGE the strippers break character, looking. The audience
               turns as...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      63.


               NEAR THE ENTRANCE The First Bouncer goes flying above the
               heads of the crowd, getting off a dramatic SHOT while
               airborne, inducing...

               PANDEMONIUM Patrons stampeding as BAM BAM!  Alex taking
               bullets, the miracle lost in the chaotic exit. The Bouncers
               out of sight underfoot.

               ON ALEX visible again, back on his feet. Buffeted,
               stationary as everyone flees. With the exodus still at
               flood stage...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               ON WALSH, in motion as he puts on a jacket, throws some
               papers into a briefcase. He's nervous, ill-suited for this
               cloak and dagger stuff, chattering...

                                     WALSH
                         We'll be safe in my car. Nobody
                         will recognize it. Let's move yours
                         in back, no, down the block. Hope
                         it's nothing fancy. There's a chop
                         shop around the corner.

               She's looking elsewhere, at the door that has quietly
               opened. The Captain stands there. Somber reptile. Holding
               a sheaf of papers in one hand.

                                     ERIN
                         You followed me here.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         No... Erin, I put out a bulletin
                         on your car because... there's bad
                         news. And I thought you should
                         hear it from me.

               She stares at him expressionless.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Your father got involved with some
                         bad cops. On my force, so I take
                         responsibility.
                              (beat, then)
                         He killed himself.

               She talks with great difficulty.

                                     ERIN
                         How?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         How did he kill himself?

               She nods.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      64.


                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         With a gun. Is that what you mean?

                                     ERIN
                         No. I mean... how did he kill
                         himself How do you figure he killed
                         himself--with a gun, right--when
                         it wasn't anywhere near where you
                         found him?

               He takes a step toward her. She pulls out the Blood Pistol.
               Seems crazy enough to use it.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         You killed him.

                                     WALSH
                         Erin. Don't.

                                     ERIN
                         Back the fuck off! Now!

               The Captain stops, gently tosses the sheaf of papers toward
               her, onto Walsh's desk.

               The papers Nathan was preparing. Walsh looks at them
               while...

                                     CAPTAIN
                         He left this. Names, addresses, a
                         note to you. These people he was
                         involved with killed Lauren. He
                         couldn't bear it anymore.

                                     WALSH
                         My God. He's right, it's all here.

                                     ERIN
                         The note. Show it to me.

               Erin has one eye on the papers now, recognizes her dad's
               hand. The Captain inches forward.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                              (to Captain)
                         Not you!
                              (to Walsh)
                         Show it to me.

               The Captain steps forward, right to the desk. Erin backed
               into a corner now.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         It's right there, under that paper.
                              (grabs a note)
                         Here. Look.

               She holds a hand out for the note, taking her eye off the
               situation for one second as she reads...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      65.


               THE NOTE A bunch of numbers added together in her father's
               hand. Not a suicide note.

               THE CAPTAIN grabs Erin's wrist and BAM!

               A chunk of the ceiling falls as the weapon discharges. The
               Captain throws her in a chokehold, her finger still on the
               trigger.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         You were always the stupid one.

               She fights as the Captain wraps his own hand over hers,
               wrestles her arm toward Walsh, in the sights now. BAM!

               WALSH blown backward, collapsing by the Chess Board. Trying
               to pull himself up. Erin struggling. As...

               MADDEN enters from the hall, in a hurry, gun drawn.

                                     MADDEN
                         You need help?

               He nods toward Walsh, who is moving, barely.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Hurry. We don't have much time.

               BAM. A shot from Madden drops Walsh for god. As Madden
               drags Walsh toward the door, the Captain grabs...

               THE PICTURE OF ALEX AND LAUREN pulled off the lid of the
               Chess box, one of the pieces of tape left behind. The
               Captain exits.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT

               MUSIC STILL POUNDS, lights swirl. But the club has cleared
               out, leaving human detritus, a handful of casualties from
               the stampede.

               WITH ALEX as he steps over the Two Bouncers, expired on
               the floor.

               A soft WHIMPERING marks the silence.  The girl cuffed
               onstage. Alex goes up to the terrified girl.

               Close up, she looks way underage. He gathers her clothes,
               spots a key on the floor.

                                     ALEX
                         How old are you?

               She listens as he unlocks the cuffs.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You have one chance to value your
                         life. Take it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      66.


               He watches as she hightails it out the front door, still
               half naked. As she leaves...

               THE CROW appears in the doorway near the broken bodies.
               Alex takes a deep breath, as if it hurts.

               The casualties. CAW. The Crow flies on, disappearing into
               the back rooms. Alex turns, follows...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

               Alex moves past the empty makeup table. A lipstick cigarette
               smolders in an ashtray. People left in a hurry. MUSIC LOUD,
               as if inside our heads now. Alex continues...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY

               Nobody home. Empty images refreshed every six seconds.
               Number of hits static now. Alex drawn now by the "No
               Admittance" Curtain which he approaches slowly, touching
               it and FLASH!

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV - LAUREN looking over her shoulder,
               pulling back the "No Admittance" Curtain, going where she
               shouldn't go.

                                     ALEX
                         Lauren? You were here?

               Lauren makes her stealthy way into....

               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK HALL - NIGHT

               revealed as Alex slips past the Curtain, retracing Lauren's
               footsteps. CAMERA FOLLOWS Alex CREEPING down the hall to...

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV - LAUREN down the hall, peering inside
               the partially open Back Room door, then turning back
               startled TOWARD CAMERA as if suddenly overtaken.

               AT THE DOOR Alex turns back, like Lauren, looks behind
               him. The hallway is empty. He enters...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

               Darkness. As Alex gropes for a lightswitch, a LIGHTER
               FLARES. Toomey and Larkin lean in, light up in synch.

               Alex takes in the dark fringes, dim reflections off lots
               of eyes. Not taxidermy specimens.

               BAM BAM BAM BAM.

               A dozen police officers lining the walls empty cartridges
               into Alex in an angry, STROBING fusillade. In the silence
               that follows...

                                     LARKIN
                              (after the fact)
                         Don't move.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      67.


               The gang LAUGHS. Larkin makes his way to a light switch by
               the door.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         Drinks are on me.

               Larkin flips on the low-watt BARE BULBS hanging down past
               industrial pipes and conduit, casting a dim light on the
               cinderblock space.

               NO ALEX.

                                     ALEX
                         Cheers.

               They look up and... BAM! Alex DROPS LARKIN with a shot to
               the forehead. BAM!

               He MISSES TOOMEY as bullets from below EXPLODE all around
               him. Alex scampers across framing as...

               The BARE BULBS burst, all but one, plunging us back in to
               near darkness as Alex drops to the ground near Larkin's
               fallen body. Jacks up the sleeve. No scar. Alex spots
               Toomey, rolls out as...

               THREE COPS pump rounds into Alex. BAM!

               Alex takes the middle Cop out, a TOONEY-LIKE GUY who falls
               onto Toomey, behind him. ALEX turns, forced to defend
               himself as FULL AUTO FIRE breaks open, the other flank,
               more advancing cops. While...

               TOOMEY crawls out from under the fallen copy, then backs
               out the door on hands and knees while...

               A FINAL EXPLOSIVE FUSILLADE leaves only Alex standing. As
               the echoes dissolve...

               Alex Alex moves to where Toomey was, bends down to check
               the body...

               THE NAMEPLATE - "TOOMEY" But the pin isn't fastened
               properly.

               The badge askew. RESUME - ALEX rolls the body over, finds
               another nameplate underneath. "Hauser."  Heads off in search
               of...

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Toomey!

               INT - "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY - NIGHT

               Toomey is clearing the "No Admittance" curtain when...

                                     ALEX
                         You dripped something!

               Toomey panics as he approaches...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      68.


               INTERNET FANTASY SETS Monitors still updating every six
               seconds. Toomey hears Alex coming, slips through the
               "Dungeon."

               BEHIND THE SHOWER FANTASY SET Toomey takes refuge out of
               sight, next to a GAS HOT WATER HEATER, quiet as a mouse.
               ALEX tears the "No Admittance" curtain completely off its
               rod, arriving at the fantasy sets just in time to see...

               THE DUNGEON MONITOR Toomey (frozen) scurrying through.
               Gone now as the monitor updates. Then Alex appears,
               following him through the set...

               WITH ALEX moving to the rear of the "dungeon," on Toomey's
               heels. WAM. Toomey hits him full force with A PIPE, sending
               Alex sprawling backward, COLLAPSING the flimsy Shower set.

               WAM. Toomey swings again, misses Alex, but connects with...

               THE GAS LINE to the water heater ripped out by the blow.
               HISS. The sound of gas, loud, as the line breaks.

               RESUME Alex straddles Toomey, just as Toomey manages to
               get his gun pointed in Alex's face. Hissing gas nearby.

               CLICK. Toomey cocks the gun.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Spark, gas... bad combination. And
                         it's not this leak here, that's
                         the least of your worries.

               WAM! Alex swings Toomey's pipe HARD at a much bigger GAS
               LINE right behind the gas heater, leaving it badly cracked.
               The hiss magnified 100% nos.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         We're going to play a little game
                         called "Who's got the Scar."

                                     TOOMEY
                         What Scar? What fucking scar?

                                     ALEX
                              (buzzer sound)
                         AAAANK. That's not how we play the
                         game.

               Alex jacks Toomey's sleeve down. No Scar. Alex pissed as
               Toomey locks eyes with him. Really seeing him now.

                                     TOOMEY
                         You're him! You're Corvis! We fried
                         your ass. You're dead, man!

                                     ALEX
                         Good thing in a situation like
                         this.

               We pick up...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

               Some light filters in as a door opens to the outside. A
               FIGURE enters, squats among the bodies. He leans in, closes
               larkin's eyes, and we see...

               It's Madden. Blood on his hands. He hears Alex's VOICE
               faintly, then Toomey cries out in pain. Madden moves
               toward...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY - NIGHT

               Madden creeps down the hallway to the back room. VOICES
               growing louder.

                                     TOOMEY
                         Fucking Zombie.

                                     ALEX
                         The scar.

                                     TOOMEY
                         There is no scar. I'm telling you.

               As Madden moves toward the conversation, his face registers
               the slightest of smiles.

               MADDEN'S CREEPING POV MONITORS obliquely visible as he
               reaches the end of the hall by the Fantasy sets. The
               "Shower" monitor shows Alex and Toomey, visible through
               the trashed set, updated every six seconds.

               MADDEN SNIFFS gas. The HISS now audible along with Alex's
               voice. Madden smiles. Pulls out his 9mm.

               And BACKS UP, away from the Fantasy Sets toward the back
               room. Madden takes aim at...

               THE FIRST MONITOR The images is Alex threatening Toomey.
               Updating now--LOSING ALEX on the Monitor as he steps into
               frame in person, looks up and BAM!

               CROWVISION a speeding bullet passes narrowly by and...

               ANGLE - GROUND ZERO as the bullet hits the monitor in a
               shower of sparks, followed by...

               BOOM! A ROILING FIREBALL Seems to vaporize Alex before
               flying down the hallway right at CAMERA.

               Madden manages a couple steps in retreat before it blows
               him into the back room with a deafening roar.

               EXT. "THE HOLE" - INFERNO - NIGHT

               BOOM! Windows blow out in a gas fired inferno. A body flung
               out the rear door. BOOM!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      70.


               EXT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT

               Interior/exterior being less meaningful than seconds ago.
               Walls crumbled, roof blown off.

               BRIGHT FIRE consumes the frame, consumes the bodies of
               downed cops, consumes every last bit of oxygen and life.
               Distant SIRENS draw closer.

               A SLOW SCAN, someone's OBSTRUCTED POV of Hell.

               INCLUDE ALEX watching from under a collapsed cinderblock
               wall that offers some protection from the flames, if not
               the heat. He looks, intent now, spotting...

               THE ARM WITH THE ZIGZAG SCARIFICATION sticking out of the
               rubble, murky through the flames, growing clearer as camera
               PUSHES, flames licking at it...

               ALEX tries to move toward the arm. Forced back by too-
               intense flame as another beam falls, the rubble shifts
               and...

               THE ARM WITH THE ZIGZAG SCARIFICATION skeletal now, baked
               down to bones. A dozen short metal rods on the ground under
               it. He picks a few up. THE CAPTAIN drawn now to...

               UNDER THE RUBBLE - WHERE ALEX WAS water dripping off the
               concrete, collecting in the place where Alex hid. But he's
               long gone. The Captain drops the rods. Satisfied it's over.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. CITY STREET #5 - NIGHT

               Alex staggers along in bad shape. Up ahead...

               A GIRL in her twenties exits a building down a flight of
               stairs, waits at the bottom for her BOYFRIEND, who's locking
               the door. She sees Alex, gives him an empathetic look.
               Alex walks slowly closer.

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Lauren appearing to him, playing their
               game. But the words are wrong, distorted.

                                     LAUREN
                         Your witness list is no match for
                         my kung fu.

               Her Bruce Lee "Oooo" a siren call. RESUME Alex moving slowly
               forward on the street, drawn toward the girl who watches
               with horrified fascination.

                                     ALEX
                         I'm losing you.

                         Your zigzag love scar is no match
                         for...

               Lauren and Alex drawing very close now when... RESUME WAM.
               A FIST clocks Alex in the face, dropping him hard onto the
               pavement.

                                     GIRL
                         Did you have to do that?

                                     BOYFRIEND
                         How about "thank you."

                                     GIRL
                         He's bleeding.

                                     ALEX
                         I don't bleed.

                                     BOYFRIEND
                         And delirious. Better steer clear.

               ALEX'S POV

               The Guy wraps his arm protectively around the girl, walks
               her off. Running into a COP at the next intersection. They
               POINT at...

               ALEX takes off, ducking into an alley. Confused.

               CAMERA CREEPS BACKWARD as he gathers his thoughts.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               RATTLE RATTLE. Alex's shadow visible through the frosted
               glass, jostling the locked door.

                                     ALEX
                         Erin!

               SMASH. His arm PUNCHES through the glass, turn the knob.
               Alex enters, arm bleeding badly. He yanks a large piece of
               glass from his flesh. Painful.

               Alex registers that the rules have changed. He finds a
               necktie of Walsh's, uses it to bind the wound, staunch the
               flow. He scans the room again looking for...

               Something. But everything seems ok. He passes...

               The Chess Box, the picture of Lauren and Alex gone. Just a
               piece of TAPE left, sticking to the top of the open lid.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      72.


               OVER THE CHESS BOARD - ALEX the missing pic lost on him,
               drawn to the chess board where Walsh collapsed. Something
               wrong with the game. He finds...

               THE BLACK KING Off the board. On top of a stack of news
               clippings lying on the floor.

               Alex picks it up, LEAVING a RING OF BLOOD under.

               CAMERA PUSHES on the clipping underneath, the headline
               "City Leaders Vow Crackdown in Wake of Randall Murder."
               PUSHING, finding among the City Leaders...

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         The King.

               THE CAPTAIN'S FACE circled in blood. Camera continues to
               PUSH on the grainy newsprint, through it, until all we see
               are halftone pixels and the picture loses meaning.

               EXT. CITY - AIRBORNE - NIGHT

               The Police Station in sinister CROWVISION as we approach,
               swoop in and...

               INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY

               Alex walks the long approach to the Captain's office, past
               the empty Secretary's desk. KICKING the door open CRASH!
               into...

               INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

               The Captain works alone at his desk under a standing lamp.
               Looks up unconcerned as Alex enters, walks to the desk,
               and SLAPS down the ring-of-blood clipping.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I hate that picture.

                                     ALEX
                         Where are they?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Can I get you something? A glass
                         of water? A transfusion?

                                     ALEX
                         Where are they? Last chance.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Or what? You'll bleed all over my
                         carpet?

               The Captain rises.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         You know crime was actually down
                         until you showed up, or stuck
                                     (MORE)

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         around, or whatever the hell you're
                         doing here.
                              (then)
                         What are you doing here?

                                     ALEX
                         I'm looking for my friends.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         See, I heard you were looking for
                         some guy with a scar. How's that
                         going? You find him? Yes? No?

               Alex tenses as the Captain starts toward him.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         You are like the guest who would
                         not leave, you know that?  And
                         judging from your condition, maybe
                         you've overstayed your welcome.
                         That's not a criticism. Just an
                         observation.

               Alex draws the knife from his clothes.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         I don't think you're going to use
                         it. That's Lauren's knife.

               Enraged, Alex SWIPES the knife. The Captain grabs his arm
               right at the blood soaked necktie, squeezes hard. Alex
               writhes in pain. In each other's faces now.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         You come in here al lfull of
                         righteous indignation, but what
                         have you got to be righteous about?

               THE KNIFE starting to fall from Alex's hand as the Captain
               continues to clamp down on his wound.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         How many innocent people did you
                         leave dead back there?

                                     ALEX
                         You sent them. I had no choice.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Bullshit. You're a killer, that's
                         all you are. A clown with a bird
                         and a rising death toll. You think
                         the world did you wrong?! You did
                         the world wrong.

               The Captain snatches the knife, RAMS it into Alex's midriff.

               a single, quiet image. One we've seen before...

               Alex in the chair. But his last words are different.

                                     ALEX
                         I loved Lauren. I never meant to
                         hurt her.

               ZAP. Electro-spasm as the switch is thrown. No scar, no

               The Captain drops Alex lifeless and bloody to the floor.
               Only the sound of the Captain panting now, then...

               The sound of slow clapping. Madden walks into the room
               from behind perimeter curtains.

                                     MADDEN
                         You were right. Picture's worth a
                         thousand words.

               Madden kicks Alex lightly, nudging him. No life signes.
               The Captain rips the picture in two. Tosses it in the trash.

                                     CAPTAIN

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - NIGHT

               NEW ANGLE - THROUGH A WINDOW DARKLY Madden and the Captain
               grab Alex, one at each end.

                                     SECRETARY
                         He's cute. Was cute.

               REVEAL, this is the Secretary's POV through the window.
               She's bent over someone's toes, painting them BLUE.

               WIDE. The Mystery Room revealed. Taxidermy specimens line
               the wall and the table.

               Erin stands in PROFILE in the middle of the room, strangely
               silent, hands tied overhead by a rope that runs to the
               ceiling.

               The Secretary brushing polish on Erin's toes.

                                     SECRETARY (CONT'D)
                         But the face, well, makeup can
                         work for you or against you. Right?

               The Secretary applies a last flourish of polish, then
               stands, kisses Erin gently.

                                     SECRETARY (CONT'D)
                         All done. Very nice.
                              (then)
                         You're a good listener.

               The Secretary moves off REVEALING...

               ERIN'S FACE MOUTH SEWN shut in a rough zigzag stitch, like
               the scar. Her eyes dart as...

               THE DOOR opens. The Captain and Madden carry Alex in. Madden
               sweeps the TAXIDERMY SPECIMENS back with his hand, clearing
               a space for Alex on the table. Among them...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      77.


               THE CROW on its Corvus Brachyrhynchos stand takes a small
               hop backward, this sign of life unnoticed as...

               RESUME WHUMP. Alex heaved onto the table.

                                     MADDEN
                         So was he dead? Or alive?

               The Secretary puts her ear to Alex's lifeless lips.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I've seen birds stuffed and mounted
                         so lifelike you'd swear you saw
                         them breathing.

               This reminds him... he looks at the Crow on the stand.
               Lifeless, stuffed. As it should be.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Maybe we had a case of that here.
                              (to Secretary)
                         Get me my kit.

                                     MADDEN
                         You two are majorly demented. Anyone
                         ever tell you that?

               The Secretary steps off to grab thekit, leaving Alex's
               lifeless open eyes pointing toward Erin, reflected in his
               eyeballs first before...

               ANGLE - ERIN looking up at her own hands, bound above her
               as she eases them apart and...

               The HEART SHAPED LOCKET slips from between her palms and
               she closes them again in time to catch the chain, the locket
               swinging.

               ON THE TABLE X-CLOSE. The locket reflected in Alex's
               lifeless open eyes a second before...

               The Secretary returns, blocking the sightline. Lays out
               the Kit, nasty looking tools left over from the Inquisition.
               Then unbuttons Alex's tattered shirt, undressing him for
               the procedure.

               Stab wounds everywhere.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Fifty three?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         In all the excitement I kind of
                         lost count.
                              (then)
                         I think I'll mount him with his
                         head up his ass.

               A large KNIFE, the Lauren murder weapon, angles in at the
               base of Alex'sneck where the Secretary's head was.

               THE CROW - OVERCRANKED moves on the table. Takes flight.

               THE TRIO turn toward the commotion.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Grab it!

               THE LOCKET - OVERCRANKED Snatched in midair by the Crow
               from Erin's praying hands.

               FLASH!  ALEX/CROW'S INTERNAL POV HIGH ANGLE CROWVISION.
               Dim memories from the woods. Anamorphic and dark.

               Two figures--Alex and Erin--kneeling. RESUME - THE LOCKET
               released from the Crow's beak, passing through the TRIO'S
               HANDS uncaught, bouncing off Alex onto the table, in front
               of his open eyes.

               ALEX/CROW'S INTERNAL POV FLASH. AT GROUND LEVEL. Alex
               fastens the LOCKET around her neck. The distortion
               lessening, becoming Alex's POV.

                                     ALEX
                         ... it connects you to me...

               FLASH.

                                     ERIN
                         No matter what happens... you're
                         innocent... I promise...

               FLASH. Alex painting her face.

               RESUME Alex BLINKS. The Captain reacts--oh shit--starts to
               bring the knife down, a hurried strike at Alex's chest.

               WAM! Alex grabs the Captain's arm in his hand, stopping
               the movement on a dime.

                                     ALEX
                         All lies. Everything you ever showed
                         me.

               MADDEN pulls a gun, points it at Erin. ALEX jumps up, flying
               INTO the gun as it goes off.

               CRASH! They tumble THROUGH THE WINDOW into the Captain's
               office while...

               THE CAPTAIN cuts down the rope holding Erin. She
               collapses...

               ON THE TABLE strewn with blades, secreting one between her
               hands, in the second before...

               THE CAPTAIN drags Erin off. The Secretary flails at the
               Crow with a metal ROD, while...

               IN THE CAPTAIN'S OFFICE Madden has the gun on Alex now.
               BAM! No effect. BAM!

               Madden sweating it now, continuing to shoot with no effect
               as...

               THE MYSTERY ROOM The Secretary finally connects with the
               Crow, batting it against the wall, noticing this coincides
               with...

               Alex goes flying against the desk, winged himself. Madden
               c Onfused, not understanding.

                                     SECRETARY (O.S.)
                         It's the bird! Kill it!

               Madden wheels, points the gun through the busted-out picture
               window into...

               The SECRETARY dives for cover as bullets explode around
               her. The Crow dancing, sprayed with debris.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               CLOSE. Floor lights sequence above the door, heading for
               underground parking.

               "5 - 4 - 3..." The Captain watches the lights. Erin is
               slumped face first against the side of the elevator opposite
               him.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         You brought him back. Good. He
                         owes you. We'll stick together,
                         you and I.

               ON ERIN face pressed against the elevator wall, intent.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Seen but not heard. They ought to
                         make it a law.

               Erin winces, looks down...

               THE BLADE emerging from her sleeve as she tries to hold it
               with her two bound hands. DING. The elevator jerks to a
               stop.

               THE CAPTAIN grabs her off the floor and she RAMS the blade
               into his abdomen with the force of the entire body. Twists
               it. The elevator doors open.

               ERIN pulls out the blade, claws her way out the door, the
               Captain hanging on to her, finally getting free as she
               swipes at him again, drawing fresh blood. Running now,
               into...

               INT. POLICE STATION - PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

               Erin stumbles between cars in the dark underground garage,
               cutting the cord off her hands, leaving it behind as...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      80.


               Behind her, the Captain unsteady on his feet, a wounded
               animal. He pulls out a GLOCK 9MM and KA-CHUNK. Cycles it.
               Erin dives between cars, scrambling on hands and knees.
               Looks around.

               HER POV - SCANNING a small garage with a few police cruisers
               by a SERVICE AREA and no people. A barred GATE over the
               exit. No way out.

               ERIN winces. Then stifles a cry as she cuts the stitches
               off her mouth with the knife. Drops the threads on the
               floor and moves off...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Alex runs past the glass AWARDS CASE, takes a flying leap
               behind the desk, seeking cover as Madden empties a clip at
               him.

               The slide ratchets back. Madden SLAMS another clip in,
               advances on Alex, hidden behind the shredded desk as...

               THE SECRETARY clears stuffed birds off the table trying to
               expose the wounded crow cowering back against the wall.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Here pretty bird. Here birdy.

               WHOP! She grabs it, the Crow flapping desperately as...

               IN THE CAPTAIN'S OFFICE Madden creeps up on the desk, peers
               over it. Nothing. Out of nowhere...

               WAM!  Alex rushes Madden, bulldozing him across the room
               with a pained cry of brute force toward...

               THE AWARDS CASE CRASH! Glass shatters as Alex hurls Madden,
               who swivels around in time to get off a last shot BAM!

               That collapses Alex to the floor.

               IN THE MYSTERY ROOM The Crow squeezes out of the Secretary's
               grasp, leaving her holding a couple feathers.

               AT THE AWARD'S CASE Alex hauls himself off the floor as
               the Crow joins him. Seeing...

               MADDEN'S HEAD has taken its place among glass bowls and
               trophies, half decapitated by the glass shelf it now rests
               on. Down the shelf from the stuffed bird. ALEX rushes
               through the blown out window into...

               Seeing for the first time that Erin is gone, the rope
               hanging from the ceiling, finding...

               THE SECRETARY

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      81.


                                     SECRETARY (CONT'D)
                         sitting on the floor, painting her
                         own toenails BLUE, leaning up
                         against the wall.

                                     ALEX
                         Where'd they go?

               Alex eases the Secretary to her feet with a hand around
               her neck, her back to the wall. She looks UP, smiling at...

               WALSH - RIGHT ARM MISSING hangs high overhead from some
               kind of hook. His arm has been crudely removed.

               Underneath him, on the table, a BOX of 2" surgical stainless
               steel rods sits by a pool of blood. ALEX yells, reeling,
               as...

               The door flies open. A half dozen cops in, all targeting
               Alex as...

               THE SECRETARY plunges the Lauren KNIFE in Alex's back. He
               spins violently THROWING her HARD against the wall. WAM!

               Surprise!-she sticks. REVEAL, she's impaled on ANTELOPE
               ANTLERS, hanging off the wall. Her head drops, looking
               down as a stream of blood flows down her legs, drips off
               her toes...

                                     SECRETARY
                              (dying words)
                         My nails.

               BAM BAM BAM. The new arrivals open fire. Alex reaches over
               his shoulder, yanks out the knife with an odd slurping
               sound as...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - PARKING GARAGE

               The sound of GUNFIRE filters down from above as the Captain
               hunts his hidden prey. He stops, studies...

               ERIN'S POV - LOW ANGLE LOOKING UNDER A CAR The Captain's
               feet, joined by his hand as he picks up the thread she
               left on the ground.

               INCLUDE ERIN

                                     SECRETARY
                         reproving herself as she turns
                         toward camera. She looks back under
                         the car, but...

               The Captain's feet have moved off. Where? She listens,
               hears nothing. Slips off...

               NEW ANGLE - ERIN takes refuge in the service area, crouching
               behind stacks of TIRES. Knife at the ready.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      82.


               The Captain's FOOTSTEPS audible.

               HER OBSTRUCTED POV between stacks of tires, the Captain,
               Glock at ready, PASSES BY, moving out of sight. Footsteps
               RECEDING. Then silent.

               ERIN Listening, neurons firing.  Cranes her neck to see.
               Nothing. WIDER the Captain appears BEHIND ERIN, over the
               stacks of tires. She's oblivious, then...

               Erin wheels, slashes across his wrist. The Glock falls,
               Erin grabs it, levels it at the Captain. Her finger tense
               on the trigger.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (re: gun)
                         I know you too well. You won't do
                         it.

                                     ERIN
                         You don't know me at all.

               BAM! She pulls the trigger, simultaneously wrenching the
               gun, aiming just enough off that...

               THE CAPTAIN yells in pain, rushes his hand to his ear, a
               bloody mess. He starts advancing again toward her and Erin
               pulls...

               THE TRIGGER again, again, again. No click, no blast.
               NOTHING.

               RESUME the Captain takes the gun from her. Shows her the
               CLIP he's carrying in his hand. Slams it into the gun.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         One in the chamber. That's all you
                         get.

               Erin SCREAMS as he drags her off now and...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - NIGHT

               THE CROW flies UP toward the small entry window. Alex
               follows, bullets exploding around him as he hauls himself
               up toward the windowledge.

               EXT. POLICE STATION - ROOFTOP

               ERRRKKK. The SOUND of a car in a hurry audible as Alex
               hauls himself out the small window. Runs to the edge,
               spotting...

               FAR BELOW a dark sedan leaving in a rush, wrapping around
               the corner of the police station now.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      83.


               INT. DARK SEDAN - TRAVELLING FAST - NIGHT

               The Captain nervous at the wheel. He looks over his
               shoulder...

               Erin's in the back seat, cuffed to the door handle.

               INT. POLICE STATION - MYSTERY ROOM

               The Sergeant and crew utterly speechless taking in the
               carnage.

                                     SERGEANT
                              (crossing himself)
                         Holy mother of God. The devil
                         himself.

               He looks up, where Alex vanished. Starts to climb.

               EXT. POLICE STATION - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Alex dashes over the articulated roof, trying to keep in
               sight...

               HIS MOVING POV partially obstructed, of the sedan below.
               Speeding around another corner now...

               ALEX alters course to cut the sedan off, jumping up onto a
               PARAPET where he totters over the vertical face as the
               sedan turning onto the street below.

               THE SERGEANT AND CREW emerge on the roof. Acquire target
               Alex Corvis.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Stop or...! Don't jump!

               WITH ALEX as he takes a flying dive off the building,
               intercepting...

               EXT. POLICE STATION - STREET #

               The Dark Sedan careening up the street leaving the city.
               WAM!

               INT. DARK SEDAN - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

               WAM! ERRRK! The Captain nearly jumps out of his skin, barely
               keeping control.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         What the fuck?

               Erin perks up in the back seat. Battered. Ever hopeful.

               EXT. CITY STREETS #6 - DARK SEDAN

               WIDE. As the speeding car passes under a streetlight, we
               see a HUMAN FIGURE standing on top of it, legs spread,
               arms upstretched.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      84.


               PUNCH IN... CLOSE. The Figure, Alex, strikes downward,
               right THROUGH the glass moonroof.

               CRASH!  IN THE SEDAN the Captain horrified as Alex's hand
               yanks his own right off the wheel and up, through the
               moonroof...

               ON THE ROOF OF THE SEDAN Alex kneels now, holding the
               Captain's arm up as he jacks the sleeve down exposing...

               THE ZIGZAG PATTERN, THE MORTIFIED FLESH held in Alex's
               hand like the trophy it is.

                                                          FADE TO BLACK.

               INT. GARRISON'S PRISON - EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Alex's voice appears. Calm. Unhurried.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE
                         The Jolt, eight amps at two to
                         three thousand volts. It lasts a
                         few seconds. The current surges
                         and is turned off.

               FIND ALEX'S FACE in the darkness. Moving as he performs
               some unseen task. Intent, focussed.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         They wait for the body to cool,
                         then check to see if the heart is
                         still beating.

               FIND ERIN, in the darkness, listening to Alex's voice.

               She touches her mouth, little drops of dried blood where
               the wounds are already healing.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         If it is... ba-boom, ba-boom...
                         another jolt is applied.

               SLOW FADE IN as our eyes adjust to the dim light.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         Experts say unconsciousness occcurs
                         before pain has time to register.
                         They agree electrocution does not
                         "hurt," could not hurt. But it
                         does. Unimaginably. Believe me.

               We're in the death chamber. Dark. Claustrophobic.

               The only light a few panel indicators and spill from the
               door open from the adjacent observation room to the outside.
               Alex looks at the phone on the wall. Silent.

                                                                      85.


                                     ALEX
                         I don't expect a call from the
                         Governor. Any last words? Captain,
                         my Captain?

               REVEAL the Captain in the chair. A private execution. Erin
               slumped along a side wall. Totally inscrutable. Intense.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Yeah. Fuck you.

               A long beat of silence.

                                     ALEX
                         Was that it? Well, ok.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I'm not dying for your goddamn
                         illusions. You got that? You think
                         you and your girlfriend had some
                         rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit.
                         She was already bored, why do you
                         think she was looking around? You're
                         nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.

               A Figure wipes through frame moving toward the switch. The
               Captain's voice rising as he senses time running out.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         You can't do this to me you little
                         fucks!  I'll come back, just like
                         you, a big fucking shit spewing
                         bird and three guesses what little
                         bitch I'm taking out first...

               CLOSE. The switch thrown. ZZZZZTTT. PAN UP off the switch
               to...

                                     ERIN
                         You are so dead.

               She glances at the Captain, fibrillating in the chair,
               starts to move off. Then stops, near Alex, looking with
               him at...

               THEIR POV - THE ZIGZAG SCAR fibrillating, as we PUSH into
               seething detail.

               Writhing bodies, human suffering, a hellish miasma that
               draws us in until we turn our heads away, released.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - DAWN

               Alex and Erin exit the visitor's entrance, met by the Crow
               and the first rays of morning light.

               He puts his arm around her and she places her hand over
               his.

                                     ERIN
                         You want to get some breakfast?
                              (then)
                         What I mean is... I don't know how
                         this works, but...

               He stops, face to face now.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         In the woods you said you had
                         nothing. But you wouldn't, and I
                         wouldn't if there's some way you
                         don't have to go. Please. At least
                         not right away.

                                     ALEX
                         Erin. I'll always be with you.

               For a split second, she's...

               LAUREN Smiling. Sublime. She kisses him. As the break off,
               it's...

               ERIN AGAIN She hangs on a long moment before letting go.
               Then she spots something...

               ON THE GROUND - A SIGN carried by one of the protestors.
               "Remember the Victim." With a picture of Lauren. Someone
               has written a bold "s" after it. "Remember the Victims."
               ERIN picks up the sign.

                                     ERIN
                         Alex. Look at this.

               She turns to Alex. But he's gone. She tries to keep it
               together as...

               CAMERA BOOMS up leaving her alone outside the prison walls,
               with her memories, and her conscience, and her hopes, which
               is alot.

               As a DUSTDEVIL whips up in the parking lot, she drops the
               sign, and starts to CRY.

                                     ERIN'S VOICE
                         In that moment when Alex went...
                         wherever he went... when he made
                         that choice, I knew I was making a
                         choice too. To be alive. In the
                         world. And it made me cry.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DAWN

               CAMERA FINDS Walsh, laid out on the table now, missing arm
               mercifully away from us. The CROW alights nearby, something
               in its beak.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      87.


                                     ERIN'S VOICE
                         Maybe the world is a bad place but
                         the Captain gone has to be some
                         improvement. And that hope, that
                         tomorrow will be better, is enough
                         to keep me going.

               The Crow flaps off, REVEALING the WHITE KING, laid by
               Walsh's head. CAMERA keeps MOVING, FINDING..

               The Crow, on the stand marked Corvis Brachyrhynchos, stuffed
               and mute.

               Its eyes blink a last time, then are motionless.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. CEMETARY - LAUREN AND ALEX'S GRAVES

               X-CLOSE. JOURNAL. A not-too-loopy feminine hand, writing
               the words we are hearing.

                                     ERIN'S VOICE
                         When I think of Lauren fighting
                         and dying, it tears me apart, but
                         it also reassures me. That Lauren
                         and Alex were meant for each other.

               REVEAL... Erin is writing the journal, but she's a radically
               transformed wild child.

               A shock of vividly colored dreadlocks, some of the holes
               that stitched her mouth shut kept permanently open by studs.

                                     ERIN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         That they're together now. Fighters.
                         United by love. And anger. That
                         they've given also to me.

               She's leaning up against a new headstone.

               "Alex Corvis 1981-1999 Always With Us."

                                     ERIN
                         I love Alex. As my sister always
                         hoped I would. And I love Lauren.
                         And I know, because of this, that
                         love does not die. I'm alive.
                         Thinking of them. Hoping that,
                         sometimes, they're thinking of me.

               Erin stops writing, closes the journal, stands. She takes
               the Locket off her neck, drapes it over Alex's headstone,
               like the one already over Lauren's.

               She stares at the two a moment, then puts her index finger
               to her lips, transfers kisses to the two stones. And leaves.

 	The CROW

	Davis Schow

	based on a screenplay by
	John Shirley

	Based on the comic book
	created, drawn, and written by
	James O'Barr

	September 14, 1992

	FADE IN:

	EXT. CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON

	BOOM!  A crack of lightning illuminates the silhouette of a
	perched crow large in the f.g.

	TIGHT ANGLE - FRESH GRAVE

	As a spade smooths the walls of a new double-decker plot.

				DIMITRI (O.S.)
		We're losing the light; let's pack
		it in.

	ANGLE - DIMITRI AND ALEXI

	TWO GRAVEDIGGERS.  Scoop digger parked f.g. towering gothic-
	style church b.g.  Rolls of astro turf.  They look up toward 
	the sky.

				ALEXI
		Snow, maybe?

				DIMITRI
		What, you gonna ski on this?

	He indicates the mound of fresh dirt.  Spits into the grave.

				DIMITRI (CONT'D)
		Come on, let's bag this.  It's
		beer time.

	Alexi nods and unfurls the tarp over the dirt.

	LOW ANGLE TRACKING SHOT - FLOWERS ON GRAVES

	As we MOVE alongside a pair of canvas-sided combat boots, as the 
	wearer collects the most lively flowers from each grave in 
	sequence.

	TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

	Cemetery DEFOCUSED b.g.  Large, glossy-black, the bird follows
	the arc of movement in the previous shot.  Ruffles its feathers
	as it begins to sprinkle rain.

	ANGLE - ELLY - RESUMING HER MOTION

	A dirty-blondish tenement KID of eleven, clad in a blend of cast-
	offs and hand-me-downs; her version of street punk chic.  She
	totes a skateboard under one arm (itself a berserk Jackson
	Pollock chaos of band stickers, silver marker and graffiti, with
	day-glo wheels), and transfers her impromptu bouquet so she may
	unzip a flap and hike up a ragged hood against the rain.  She 
	stops to watch the grave diggers pack up and EXIT b.g.

				ELLY
		Guess the picnic got rained out.

	She looks down o.s. at --

	ANGLE - SHELLY WEBSTER'S GRAVE

	as Elly places the gathered flowers down.  Almost reverent.

	RESUME CROW ANGLE - ELLY B.G.

	as Elly takes a single white rose and places it atop the grave
	near Shelly Webster's.

	ANGLE ON GRAVE - AS ELLY LEAVES

	TILT UP from rose to the name: ERIC DRAVEN. Rain spatters the 
	granite, darkening it.

	EXTREME CLOSE-UP - CROW's EYE

	It blinks in its alien way.

	WITH THE CROW

	as it takes wing from it's unseen perch.  Lands stop Eric's
	headstone.  It pecks tentatively at the top of the monument.

	ANGLE - ELLY NEAR ERIC'S GRAVE

	She hasn't gotten too far before she notices the bird.

				ELLY
		Oh, scary.

	The bird blinks at her from the headstone.
				ELLY
		What are you, like, the night
		watchman?

	Another blink from El Birdo.

	CAMERA WITH ELLY -  BOOMING BACK HIGH

	as she exits the iron gates of the cemetery without looking
	back.  Brutal building facades, like dead eyes, and bad
	alleyways, like hungry mouths, are gradually revealed as we
	continue PULLING BACK to unveil that the cemetery is smack in
	the middle of the city.

	EXT. MAXI-DOGS - TWILIGHT - RAIN CONTINUES

	CLOSE-UP of a foot-long hot dog being drowned in mustard.

				MICKEY (O.S.)
		What this place needs is a good
		natural catastrophe.  Earthquake,
		tornado...

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND MICKEY

	ALBRECHT is a black beat cop, 35, in a rain slicker.

	MICKEY is the grease-aproned entrepreneur of MAXI DOGS, a steamy
	open-front fast foodery.

				ALBRECHT
		You gotta put the mustard
		underneath first.

				MICKEY
		Maybe a flood, like in the Bible.

				ALBRECHT
		Here, let me do it.

	He grabs the dog from Mickey.  Mickey puffs his cigar while he
	cooks.  Albrecht methodically spreads a napkin and performs
	surgery on the hot dog, coating the bun with mustard, rolling
	the dog in the bun.  Flashes Mickey a "gimme" look. 

				ALBRECHT
		Come on... onion.  Don't cheap
		out on me.  Lotta onions.

	MOVING ANGLE - AS ELLY SKATEBOARDS TOWARDS MAXI DOGS

				MICKEY
		Heyyy -- it's the Elly monster.

				ALBRECHT
		How do you ride that thing on a 
		wet street?

				ELLY
		Talent. Hi.

				ALBRECHT
		Care for a hot dog?

				ELLY
		You buying?

				ALBRECHT
		I'm buying.

	Elly grabs the stool next to Albrecht.  They`ve done this routine before.

				ELLY
		No onions though, okay?

				ALBRECHT
			(horror)
		No onions?

				ELLY
		They make you fart.

	Mickey laughs.  Spots Elly a Coke.

				MICKEY
		What's goin' on, Elly?

				ELLY
		I went to see a friend of mine.

				MICKEY
		Well, how's your friend?

				ELLY
		She's still dead.

	Albrecht and Mickey exchange a look re:  Elly's matter-of-
	factness.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (RAIN)

	Thunder KABOOMS o.s.  The crow pecks the top of the stone again
	and a chip of granite flies off, bang!

	EXTREME CLOSE - THE HEADSTONE

	as the crow pecks again and draws blood from the rock.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	A dot of blood on its ebony beak.

	LOW ANGLE - HEADSTONE

	A thin, watery trickle of blood wanders from the top of the
	stone towards the earth.  Rain does not interfere.  Lightning
	plays in the rolling cloud cover, b.g.

	RESUME THE CROW

	as it takes off from the gravestone, into the rain.

	CLOSE-UP - THE BLOOD

	It slowly fills the name Eric Draven into the rock.

	CLOSE-UP - FOOT TAPPER

	A LOW ANGLE like the SHOT introducing Elly's boot.  This time
	we see cowboy boots, leather chaps.  The foot taps.  Waiting.

	MEDIUM ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER

	as lightning strikes.  Just enough for us to see a figure in a 
	long duster and a cowboy hat.

	RESUME ERIC'S HEADSTONE

	DRAVEN fills with blood.  Blood continues groundward.

	NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER

	Turning to meet FRAME as the crow alights on his outstretched 
	arm.  This is the SKULL COWBOY.  We glimpse the deathshead,
	beneath the brim of the cowboy hat.

	RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE

	as blood trickles into the turf at the base of the grave.

	TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

	shaking off rain.  Watching intently.

	CLOSE-UP - THE SKULL COWBOY'S FREE HAND

	Black gloved.  It walks a flat silver throwing knife across it's
	knuckles, like a quarter somersaulting.

	RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE

	The turf stirs beneath the white rose.  Magically, a slim white
	parts the earth to grasp the rose.

	SKULL COWBOY POV - ERIC's GRAVE

	as the figure of Eric Draven stands up from behind his own
	headstone.

	LOW ANGLE (FROM GRAVE) - ERIC

	Pale.  Clad in cerements: cheap black burial suit, slit open in 
	back.  WHite shirt.  A nothing tie.  No shoes.  Rain sluices mud
	from his upturned face.  He looks to the sky.  Lightning.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - FOLLOW ERIC

	as he weaves to lean against a nearby tree.  Looks o.s.

	ERIC's POV - THE SKULL COWBOY

	water-blurred, through the rain, standing with the crow perched
	on his arm like a hunting falcon.  He releases it and it flies
	to the tree.

	ANGLE -  ERIC

	Watching this.  Wipes mud from his eyes, tries to clear vision.
	The crow lights in the tree and they meet eye-to-eye.  Eric
	looks back o.s. and we RACK to include the Skull Cowboy.

				ERIC
		What the hell are you?

				SKULL COWBOY
		Interested?  Follow the crow.

	NB.  The Skull Cowboy speaks in nicely distorted, buzzlike
	charnal house whisper.  Unsettling and hackle-raising.

	Eric turns back to the bird, which takes wing in the rain, His
	eyes follow it.  He looks back, disoriented, doubtful, but the 
	Skull Cowboy is gone.

	LOW DEEP ANGLE - THE CROW

	Taking wing in the rain, showing the way.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC

	alone in the cemetery.  After a moments hesitation, he lurches
	off, following the crow.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH:

	A candy-flaked muscle T-bird is parked at the curb.

	INT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT

	A MOVING SHOT during o.s. lines.  Past dead video and pinball
	devices.  Pasta desk with an open briefcase, coffee cup,
	ashtray -- someone was just there.  Then past a WOMAN, trussed
	with duct tape to her office chair, gagged, hot fear in her 
	darting eyes.

	COMPLETE CAMERA MOVE to include SKANK, a blade-thin speed freak 
	with pattern baldness, always loud, jittery, a manic dust puppy.
	And T-BIRD, an arrogant Arayan, brush-cut iron pumper, who is
	prepping an incendiary.  He exhibits a small squeeze bottle of
	arson cocktail to Skank.

				T-BIRD
		Uncle T-Bird's 100-proof
		accelerator.  I squirt you with
		this, you could jump in the 
		Detroit river and burn all the way
		to the bottom.

	INSERT A CLOSE-UP of the bomb in his hands as he works.  Silver
	canisters, an LED timer, wires.

				T-BIRD (CONT'D)
		You know, Lake Erie actually
		caught on fire once, from all the
		crap in it.  Wish I coulda seen
		that.

	He CLICKS a switch.  PEEP.  LED countdown blurs.

				T-BIRD (CONT'D)
		We're ready to rock.

	Skank notices the captive woman's handbag on the floor.  Picks
	it up.  Looks through it for valuables.

				SKANK
		What about working girl?

	INTERCUT the woman's increasingly horrified reactions.

				T-BIRD
		What about her?

				SKANK
		I say we leave her here to fry,
		man.

	T-Bird looks casually at the woman.  Smiles hideously.

				T-BIRD
		No.  Let's take her with us.

	ANGLE - THE WOMAN

	Her eyes bug in a terrified NO!

	EXT. STREET - MOVING - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird fishtails wildly around the corner and eats street.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

	TB drives.  One eye on his digital watch (doing an equally
	fast countdown).  Skank wrestles their captive, the woman, in
	the back seat.

				TB
			(pissed off)
		Skank, shut her the fuck up!

	SKank punches her and she sags.  Then he looks forward.

				SKANK
		Whoaaa -- T-Bird, red light, red
		light!

	EXT. STREET CORNER NEAR MAXI-DOGS - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird slews wide, cutting sidewalk, scattering
	nightwalkers, immediately attracting everybody's attention.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT - AT MAXI-DOGS

	Reacting, with a mouthful.

				ALBRECHT
		Goddammit.

	Mickey grabs the counter phone instantly.

				MICKEY
		Call it in?

	Albrecht is off and running for the corner already.

				ALBRECHT
		Yeah, do it!
			(to Elly)
		Stay right there!

	HOLD ON MICKEY.  He points at Albrecht's hot dog.  Yecch.

				MICKEY
			(yelling after)
		You want I should save this for
		you?

	EXT. MOUTH OF ALLEY ACROSS FROM CEMETERY - NIGHT

	The car slides to a nose-down panic stop.

				SKANK (O.S.)
		Dump her, man, dump her!

	The woman comes tumbling from the car, which blasts off with a
	war hoop from the guys inside.

	ANGLE - CORNER - ON ALBRECHT

	Gun out, hauling ass on wet pavement.  Aims at the departing
	car.  Gives it up.  Still too far away.  Pedestrians in the way.

	ANGLE - THE WOMAN

	hurting, cut, bleeding, tottering toward the dumpster.  Duct tape 
	stuck to her face but cut away around her mouth.  With her as
	she falls into the alley darkness... straight into the arms of

	CLOSE TWO-SHOT - ERIC AND THE WOMAN

	Their eyes lock.  Eric stiffens with his first FLASH.

	NB:  Eric's flashes of past memory are conditioned by the nature
	of things with which he makes physical contact.  Hints and
	fragments in fierce, super-saturated COLOR.  Puzzle pieces he
	must assemble.  Each flash keynoted by a BLOWBACK NOISE and 
	accompanied by a degree of pain.  It hurts to remember.

	FLASH:  INT. T-BIRD - WOMAN'S STRUGGLE

	The faces of Skank and T-Bird are murky, ephemeral, their voices
	hideous, distorted echoes.  A knife snaps open.  We see the 
	blade.  Blood.  Skank hits her, pow! and --

				FLASH ENDS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND WOMAN

	An airborne crow POV spiralling up and away from them.

							MATCH WITH:

	ANGLE - THE CROW

	perched on a fire escape, high above, watching and waiting.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AND WOMAN

	She fades.  He lets her drop away, horrified.  And staggers back
	into the cover of the alley.  Her blood is on his hands.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT RUNNING

	Skidding in, spotting the woman.  Kneeling to her.

				ALBRECHT
		Here now!  You're gonna be okay!
		Can you understand me?  I'm a
		police officer...

	The woman is no longer in pain.  Deathly calm now.

				WOMAN
		He touched me and it stopped.  The
		pain.

				ALBRECHT
		What did you say?

				WOMAN
		I saw a ghost...

	Her eyes roll back and she dies in Albrecht's arms.

				ALBRECHT
		Oh no... don't go, darlin', you
		stay with me, now... shit!

	HIGH ANGLE CROW POV - THE ALLEY

	BOOMING BACK from Albrecht, the woman, onlookers, as police
	units screech up to assist.

	EXT. ALLEY BEHIND ARCADES GAMES SUPPLY HOUSE - ON ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric in lurching flight, panting.  Stops and steadies against
	the wall across from the backside of Arcade Games.

	ANGLE - THE CROW (FLYING)

	Circling, then lighting on the fire escape above Eric.

	BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES - ("CROWVISION")

	"CROWVISION" is what the crow "gives" Eric to see.  Visually 
	distinct and immediately identifiable.

	ERIC'S POV - BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES

	Which he's already seen through the crow's eyes.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	looking up at the crow.  Disoriented.  Doesn't understand.
	Suddenly he cottons, and covers his eyes just in time to shield
	from:

	ANGLE - BACK OF ARCADE GAMES

	The rear windows EXPLODING outward in a spray of fire and
	debris.

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC

	he reels back, crashes into a dumpster.  Falls.

	ANGLE - THE CROW

	landing on the dumpsters edge near a pair of discarded combat
	boots in the trash.  Flames.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC

	The blood from his hands mars his burial shirt.  He tears the
	shirt away, leaving his tie absurdly intact.  Wipes his face
	with his shirt.  Discards it.  Stops, held by his discovery --

	PUSH IN ON ERIC

	as his fingers explore the five puckered bullet punctures in his
	chest.  Almost a circle.  Comically, he feels his back foe exit
	wounds.  Then hauls himself upright, coming level with the crow.
	His glance at the bird is almost accusatory.

	ANGLE - THe CROW

	Inscrutable.  We should get the idea that some silent
	communication is taking place.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S FEET 

	bare, muddied, frozen.  TILT to Eric.  His gaze moves from the
	crow to the boots in the trash.  He grabs them, pushes them onto
	his bare feet.  His eyes catch the firelight.  Distant o.s.
	SIRENS

				ERIC
		Fire.  In the rain.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT

	We are now within the neon techno-depths of Club Trash.  The BG
	music is hard, savage, primal:  a doom-laden Radio Werewolf band
	rules.  Cabaret Blitzkrieg, packed with Death-to-Yup
	trendazoids.  We'll see more of this circus later.  Right now
	the BG SOUND is our biggest clue to the flavor of this
	establishment since we are --

	TIGHT CLOSE-UP A FRAMED 8X10

	Thinly filmed in dust, mounted among dozens of other band shots.
	Visible among the posed members of a group called Diabolique is
	Eric, wielding guitar on the club stage.  ND BLUR as people 
	CROSS FRAME.

	GRANGE, 45-50, powerful, a seasoned assassin, cruel but loyal.
	His facade remains stony as he leads three other men briskly
	down the corridor.:  NGO NWA, 50ish, clad Chinese gangster style
	- white topcoat, white scarf, tinted shades - and two body guards
	supplying a power perimeter around him,lean, dark-haired Asian
	killers who would gladly die for Ngo Nwa, which they will in 
	just a minute.

	They have just passed the Diabolique 8X10.  Ngo Nwa's gloved
	fingers, in passing, leave little skid tracks in the dust that
	clear the eyes of Eric in the photo.

	As the foursome reaches the DOOR, Grange turns doubtfully -- 
	suspiciously -- to Nwa.

				NGO NWA
		He will see me... unannounced.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE DOOR

	As Grange keys in the enter code the door hisses open.  Without
	a word, Nwa passes inside and the door is pulled shut in
	Grange's face by the Bodyguards, who post themselves to either
	side.

	INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	The door CLOSES and the BG NOISE is GONE.  Through a large window
	(mirrored on the club side) all sorts of activity is visible
	through automatic mini-blinds.  A fly-vision bank of 12 TV
	monitors is hot with surveillance.

	LAO, a painfully clean-cut, Armani-clad Asian, impeccable,
	almost dashing, but the dynamic here is crystal clear: Nwa is
	the King: Lao, the dark prince in this hierarchy.

	At the desk, Lao is startled from his contemplation of a tiny,
	perfect rat skeleton by Ngo Nwa's unheralded entry.  The desktop
	is bare except for and Arcane Vietnamese fighting knife, half a
	meter long with an ideogrammed blade, dramatically positioned
	beneath an Artemide lamp.  Lao rises and feigns servility.

	NB:  The following exchange will play FAST, and entirely in
	VIETNAMESE.

				LAO
		(formal greeting)

				NWA
		(dismissiveness, contempt, then
		chastizing anger as:)

	Nwa INDICATES the blade with some ridicule.

				LAO
		(phony assuagement)

				NWA
		(knows it's bullshit)

	Lao turns, staring out the blinds, fighting for control.  Deep
	breath.  He turns back to his "master."  Nwa gestures broadly at
	the oppulent office, indicating that Lao should be grateful, but 
	is somehow errant
	 
				NWA
		(respect is required)

				LAO
		(begrudging agreement)

	Lao sees the blade.  An idea.  He lifts it reverently, bears it
	the Nwa hilt-first in both hands, as if bestowing a thing of
	immeasurable worth.

				NGO NWA
		(why give me this?)

	Nonetheless, Nwa accepts the blade.  It gleams.  Hypnotic. Even
	Nwa has to admire it.  Turns it so the blade is pointed at his
	sternum.  His attitude indicates Lao is too far away to do
	anything untoward.

				LAO
		(sinister punchline)

	Lao spins through the air and HEEL-KICKS the blade THROUGH Nwa's
	chest, pinning him to the door.  It's over so fast the gasp of
	astonishment never escapes Nwa.  Lao is much more than merely 
	treacherous, he is extremely capable.

				LAO
			(in perfect English)
		When I spoke of an offering, I
		didn't mean an offering to you.

	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

	Grange, standing out of arm's reach in the corridor, kills both
	Bodyguards with a double headshot as they turn in greeting as the
	door OPENS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR - LAO, GRANGE, AND CORPSES

	Lao exchanges a look with his right arm; Grange nods
	affirmatively.

				GRANGE
		You gonna smoke his bones now, or
		however it is you do it?

	Lao smiles indulgently.  He wipes the blood from the blade on
	the jacket of his ex-lord.  Lao now bows to no one. 

	EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - ANOTHER ALLEY - NIGHT

	Eric, wearing the combat boots, climbs as the crow leads him.
	Up.  He jams his hand on a rusty wedge of metal.  Ouch.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM

	Blood flows from the gash.  He vises his fist shut.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE

	Eye-to-eye with the crow.  Opens his hand.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM

	The blood flows back into the wound, which closes itself, 
	leaving another scar.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Vising the rail.  Speaks to the night.  Almost a mantra.

				ERIC
		"My kitten walks on velvet feet,
		and makes no sound at all.  And in
		the doorway nightly sits to watch
		the darkness fall.  I think
		he loves the lady night..."
			(to crow)
		Am I alive?  Am I dead?  Something
		else?  Something in between?

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	Inscrutable.  No answer here.

	RESUME ERIC

	Almost bemused.  Steadier.  A hint of friendliness.

				ERIC
		Thanks for sharing that.

	ETC. GIDEON`S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird grumbles tp park curbside.  Menacing.

	INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	A junkyard of loot and dusty discards.  Junkie thievings and
	other people's stereos.  Behind a wire-meshed security counter
	GIDEON reads a racing form, chain-smoking throughout the scene.  He
	is pear-shaped, stubbled, unkempt.  Food on his shirt.  JINGLE
	of doorbells.  Gideon lowers his paper to reveal Skank and
	T-Bird on approach.

				GIDEON
		Ahhh, jesus, the creatures of the 
		night, here they come.  Tweedledum
		and Tweedledummer.

	Skank riles

				SKANK
		Hey, blow me, fat boy!

	Just as quick, Gideon cocks and levels a Magnum at Skank.

				GIDEON
		Blow yourself, bigmouth.

				T-BIRD
			(interposing)
		Whoa, hey, whoa.
			(hands up)
		Business.

	He lifts a small carton onto the counter.

				GIDEON
		Whatcha got?

	NEW ANGLE - COUNTER

	Transaction time.  T-Bird passes items through the screen slot 
	and Gideon gives each one cursory, doubtful inspection.

				T-BIRD
		Coupla more rings... 24k.

				GIDEON
		18k.  Crap.

				T-BIRD
		...necklace... pearls...

				GIDEON
		Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,

				T-BIRD
		Leather purse...

	He hands though the bag rested from the woman.

				GIDEON
		What's this -- a little, ah,
		bloodstain, right?
			(doesn't matter)
		Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm
		doin' you a --

				T-BIRD
		Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a 
		favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.

				SKANK
		You wouldn't want Top Dollar not 
		to smile.

	Mention of Top Dollar clams Gideon efficiently up.  He hands
	over the cash to T-Bird with a grimace.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - ON ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric stares upward at the crow as it drops like a bomber from
	the night sky, flying past him, skimming the roof, leading him
	on.  Eric exhales, shrugs, feeling mocked by the bird.

				ERIC
		All right.

	And he takes off on a run.  Only to stumble and fall.  But the
	falls turns into a TUMBLING ROLL that lands Eric back on his feet
	still moving.  He looks back as if to ask: "Did I do that?" and
	runs out of the frame.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON THE RUN.

	as he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up.
	TRACK WITH HIM to the edge of the roof, heavily misted in rain.

	He jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof.  The next 
	roof-top is a one-story jump down.  Eric clears the jump with a
	WOOF of air.  Keeping his eyes on the flying crow; gaining
	strength.  His next leap is more like a broad-jump.  Athletic.

	FAST MOVING ANGLE - THE CROW

	keeping airborne, keeping ahead.

	MOVING ANGLE - ERIC

	Eyes confidently on the sky as he arches out into space...

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - BUILDINGS

	As Eric is seen to jump across the gap at least three stories up
	where there is no connecting building.

	CLOSE ANGLE - TARGET BUILDING LEDGE

	as Eric smashes into it, just missing, hinging at the waist,
	grabbing for purchase, suddenly panicked, gravity pulling him 
	downward.

	ANGLE - AT ERIC FROM PHONE CABLE BRACKET

	Eric falls but manages to grab the bracket one-handed.  He hangs
	for another deadly moment, then slowly, to his own astonishment,
	executes a one-handed pull-up that will save his ass.
				ERIC
		Gotcha.

	He completes the pull-up, bringing his chin level with the 
	ledge.  As he reaches for it with his other hand the bracket
	rips from the wall and Eric plummets, with a howl of defeat.

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S DOWNFALL

	It's a looooooong way down.

	ANGLE - ALLEYWAY

	as Eric lands and splits a trash can in two.  A beat as we wonder
	if any bones are left unpulped.  PUSH IN as Eric rolls from
	facedown to his back.

	TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE

	as he completes the roll, gasping, amazed he's still in one 
	piece.

	ANGLE - TRASHCAN - ON THE CROW

	It flies easily down to inspect Eric as he slowly sits up,
	examining his hands.  Frustrated and pissed off.

				ERIC
		Thanks.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	Not "your welcome", but other-worldly patience.  It waits.

	RESUME ERIC

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Where're we going next -- the
		sewer?

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Still, dark silence until Eric lands from ABOVE FRAME, feline.
	The crow lands simultaneously b.g., perched near a roof access
	door with a shaded, dim-yellow bulb.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	It just blinks at him. 

	INT. ABANDONED STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	as Eric yanks open the rusty rooftop door from the outside and
	sweeps down the steps in a swirl of night mist

	ANGLE - FOOT OF STAIRS

	Trash and detritus all around, clogging the arteries of the
	building, which is old, unoccupied, forsaken.  The crow lights
	on a scarred banister knob.  Eric's footsteps come down into frame.

	ANGLE ON LOFT DOOR - INCLUDE ERIC

	A year ago this door was sealed with police barricade tape...
	which now sags, faded.

	A sticker across the jam notifies potential trespassers that
	this is -- was -- a crime scene.  Eric slows, stops, his hand
	on the banister.

	ANGLE - THE CROW

	as is wafts ahead of Eric, arriving at the door first.

	ANGLE ON ERIC, THE DOOR, THE CROW

	Eric has had enough.

				ERIC
		Are we finished yet?

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND ON BANISTER
	sliding along, as he speaks, until it hits a cigarette burn.

	PUSH IN ON ERIC - TIGHT

	stiffening as he suffers his second --

	FLASH:  IMAGES and DIALOG are not linked.  A rapidfire MONTAGE set
	in the loft, a year earlier (it is decorated for Halloween).
	The broken door.  The stairwell is filled with cops and cop 
	noise; lab guys bustle.  Albrecht is there, making notes as a
	DETECTIVE steps over to him.

				ALBRECHT
		Victim's name is Shelly Webster.
		The guy who got tossed is, uh ...--
			(checks his notebook)

	Albrecht grinds out his smoke on the banister.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC ON THE STAIRS.

	He sits down hard, hurting from the flash.  His eyes seek the 
	crow.  He completes Albrecht's line:

				ERIC
		"Draven, Eric."

	EXT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	LOW DOLLY of Elly's little combat boots moving toward the
	entryway of the pit.  MUSIC gradually UP LOUDER O.s. as she
	nears.

	ANGLE - ELLY IN DOORWAY

	Luridly-lit.  A grown-up's place.  A burly BOUNCER appraises
	her, his tone jokey.  He knows Elly.

				BOUNCER
		Hey!  You got any ID?

				ELLY
		Very funny.  Ha.  Ha.  Oh my,
		sides.

	The Bouncer jerks a thumb.  Go on in. 

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	A grungy sawdust-floored shot-and-beer joint packed tight
	with urban BURNOUTS rushing to drink their lives away.  Hammering
	MUSIC and rude whorehouse lighting.  Each predator straining to
	be badder than the next.

	TRACK THROUGH this maze at Elly's eye level until we reach 
	DARLA, waitressing her heart out, the drug mileage on her 
	obvious.

				ELLY
		Mom --?

				DARLA
		I told you you're not supposed
		to come in here.

				ELLY
			(a quick lie)
		I lost my key.

	Disgustedly -- goddamn kids -- Darla fishes up a key and slaps
	it into Elly's hand.

				FUNBOY (O.S.)
		Hey, Darla -- before we die of old
		age, how about it --?

				DARLA
			(to Elly)
		Out.  Now.  I gotta work.

	RACK PAST Darla and MOVE IN CLOSE on a corner table -- where sit
	Funboy, Skank, T-Bird and a black, vested muscle gypsy, TIN-TIN. 

	INT. LOFT - NIGHT

	As Eric shoves the door open from the outside.  The lock, popped
	from the frame, spins on the wooden floor.  The barrier tape
	whisps and dust roils.  Dark, chilly, damp.  A rat's nest of
	disuse.

	PULL BACK THROUGH THE BROKEN PICTURE WINDOW

	as Eric enters.  Glass blown out.  Shards poking.  Jagged.

	NEW ANGLE - AS ERIC WALKS IN

	He scans the loft.  Sees reflecting golden eyes near the floor.

	ERIC'S POV - FLOOR NEAR WINDOW

	A white, long-haired cat walks into a pool of night light.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND THE CAT

	He kneels.  Extends his hand.  The cat nears; likes Eric.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND.

	as the cat makes contact.  Sudden white jolt - a FLASH.

	FLASH:  we HEAR Eric strumming his Strat o.s.  We see what he
	saw:  Shelly, holding the cat.

							FLASH ENDS.

	UP ANGLE - ERIC

	Wincing.  Recovering from the flash.  He purposefully gathers
	the cat into his arms and braces for more, harder, stronger...

	FLASH:  A MAN and a WOMAN make love on a big bed amidst a hundred
	points of candlelight.  Shelly and Eric, once upon a time.

							FLASH ENDS.

	REVERSE ANGLE FROM BEDROOM DOOR - ON ERIC

	as the cat, dropped, hits the floor and scrambles out of the way.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	vising his head, teary-eyed, his nose bleeding.

				ERIC
		No!  Don't look!  No! No!

	He whirls unexpectedly and punches his fist completely through
	the masonry wall.
	FLASH:  Eric and Shelly in a mock waltz.  He spins her and they
	collapse on the bed.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	slowly pulling his arm out of the wall.

				ERIC
			(whispering)
		Stop it.

	His eyes roll up and he slumps the length of the door frame like
	a drowning man.

	ANGLE - GABRIEL

	watching Eric.  He hits with an o.s. THUD.

	INT. THE PIT - ON FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT

	As a gloved hand sets up four bullets next to four shots.

				FUNBOY (O.S.)
		Let's have some fun.

	Funboy pops the bullet, like a contact capsule and washes it down.
	T-Bird turns to Tin-Tin, the new guy.

				T-BIRD	You first.

				TIN-TIN
		You're outta your fuckin' mind.

	Into it, almost jazzed, Tin-Tin downs his bullet and shot, and
	T-Bird does likewise.  Points to Skank.

				T-BIRD
		No.  I'm not the lunatic.  He is.

	Skank riles, pulls a huge Auto Mag and sticks it in T-Bird's
	face, cocking.

				SKANK
		Fuck you, T-Bird.

	Just as lightning fast, T-Bird has his own gun out and jammed
	right under Skank's jawbone.  He makes a kissy face.

				T-BIRD
		I love you too, you madman.

	They all crack up laughing like ax murderers.  Skank drinks,
	Tin-Tin spot checks the satchell from Top Dollar's.  Darla
	delivers more shots and funboy feels her ass.

				FUNBOY
		Hey, pussycat.

	INT. LOFT - DOWN ANGLE (CROW POV) - ERIC ON FLOOR

	He's awake.  Pushes himself up.

	REVERSE ANGLE - THE CROW

	Is perched in a dead light fixture, monitoring Eric.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON FLOOR

	He's awake.  Pushes himself up.  Realizes he is in the center of a 
	faint chalk outline on the hardwood floor.  He reaches to touch
	the dark stain of old blood.

	FLASH:  Shelly spills into frame, mouth bloodied.  T-Bird
	instantly on top of her, rough.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC

	as he abandons the outline and staggers to the window... where
	he cuts open his hand on jags of glass.

	FLASH:  Eric held firm in the grasp of T-Bird and Funboy, one
	arm each.  Five bloody bullet holes in Eric's chest.

	The thugs 1-2-3 and hurl Eric backwards through the window,
	which shatters.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - ERIC AT THE WINDOW

	Reeling backward, same trajectory as in the Flash, but toward
	the floor, in SLO-MO.  Overloaded.  Blacking out.

	AS ERIC FALLS - INTERCUT MONTAGE

	A jumble of good/bad images from the loft:  Tin-Tin embedding a
	page of paper in the loft wall with a throwing knife...
	Shelly's face as she lights a candle... a POPPING champagne
	cork... the echoing CANNONADE of the shots that killed Eric...
	Skank backhanding Shelly... Shelly blowing bubbles from a
	clawfoot tub full of suds... Eric catching Funboy's first slug 
	high in the chest... NEW ANGLE of the glass in the window
	blowing out as T-Bird and Funboy through Eric through...

	ANGLE - ERIC'S REAL TIME FALL

	He plummets to BLACK OUT FRAME.  THUMP.  Out cold.

	INT. PIT - RESUMING FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT

	Funboy contemplates his drink as the previous scene reverbs.

				FUNBOY
		More fun than a torture chamber.

	Tin-Tin's pocket pager goes BEEP and startles them all.  Skank
	nearly shoots it, jumpy.  Tin-Tin pulls back on a black leather 
	trenchcoat after clicking off the pager.

				TIN-TIN
		I hate this goddamn thing...

	ANGLE - DARLA watching them from a distance as Tin exits.

	INT. LOFT - FLOOR LEVEL - NIGHT

	An enormous cockroach trundles past, large in FRAME.  RACK to
	show Eric lying on floor b.g. as his eyes pop open.  A flurry of
	dark motion as the crow flies past frame.

	ANGLE -- THE CROW -- Having snatched the bug in it's beak.  Eats
	it.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	rising from the floor.  Careful.  Stealthy.  Watches his fireplace.

				ERIC
		We have company.

	ANGLE ON FIREPLACE

	Huge.  Marble.  COld.  Eric's paper mache masks of Comedy and
	Tragedy still hang there.  The Skull Cowboy steps out of the
	dark and into the vague blue light.  Shadowy as ever.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Having fun yet?  No?
			(beat)
		I'll give you a hint.  Remember
		whatshername?

				ERIC
		Shelly?

				SKULL COWBOY
		Miss her?

				ERIC
		Yes.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Kill the men who killed you both,
		and the Day of the Dead will be
		your reunion.

	The Skull Cowboy prestidigitates a flat throwing knife(like Tin-
	Tin's).  Eric's gaze follow it closely.

				SKULL COWBOY (CONT'D)
		You must use your eyes.

	He points to the crow.

	ANGLE - THE COMING KNIFE - ("CROWVISION")

	Weirdly distorted, a shared vision between Eric and the crow.

	TIGHT ON ERIC

	As he DUCKS out of the path of the knife he sees through the
	bird's eyes.  He rolls.

	ON THE CROW

	It hops out of the way as the knife embeds in the wall.  Eric's
	ROLL finishes him up nearby.

				ERIC
		Goddammit.

	He grabs for the knife as if to use it on the Skull Cowboy, but
	the knife causes an unexpected painful FLASH.

	FLASH:  Eric bouncing off the bedroom doorframe, Tin-Tin's knife
	stuck in his shoulder.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC

	vising his head with his hands, in pain.  Too much pain.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Get it?

				ERIC
		Leave me alone -- !

	He looks up, the Skull Cowboy is still there.

				SKULL COWBOY
			(contempt)
		Do something about it.
	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND THE SKULL COWBOY.

	A horrible beat between them.  The Eric runs full tilt across
	the room, bounding to the open window and then leaping.

	ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY

	as close to surprise as he gets.  Steps out to watch as --

	ANGLE ON WINDOW - ERIC

	FLIES feet first out into space.

	CLOSE-UP - BRICKWORK ABOVE WINDOWFRAME

	Eric's fingers smash into grip the tiny mortared gaps!

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING - UP ANGLE FROM STREET - NIGHT

	High above, Eric's feet shoot out the window, knocking loose
	stray shards that fall toward frame.  He swings into an upside-
	down pose, impossibly holding himself rigid against the
	building's side, face down. by his quarter-inch finger grip.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	Every muscle rigid, quivering with tension.  Hold.  Then he
	relaxes, and swings back inside.

	INT. LOFT - AT WINDOW, PICKING UP ERIC - NIGHT

	He arches, flips, to land on his feet.  The Skull Cowboy is
	gone.  No knife either.  The crow watches.  O.S. "meow".

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC AS HE TURNS TO SEE THE CAT

				ERIC
		I guess I'm not ready to leave...
		just yet.

	He picks up the cat -- wary of flashes, which don't come this
	time -- and returns to the window.  Feeling safer.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		The last time we saw each other,
		I didn't do so well.
			(holds cat up)
		Huh, Gabriel?

	He moves to the fireplace.  With his free hand, lifts the
	Tragedy mask off its hook.  Puzzles it, fact-to-mask.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I bet you need some cat food...
		right?

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT -ESTABLISHING:

	Eric walking, the Tragedy mask hanging from his hip.  An
	occasional PEDESTRIAN passes without comment, brutalized
	by the city.  Eric, more confident, smells the night's bouquet.

	EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT ("CROWVISION")

	Two men around a trashcan fire.  We should recognize Tin-Tin by 
	his black leather trench coat.  A wonderfully rude Rap tune, "Got
	a White WOman Tied Up In My Closet, Gonna Jab Her With A Stick,"
	RAZZLES b.g.

	EXT. STREET - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

	As Eric reacts to what the crow has just seen.  Slows.  Stops.
	And directs his attention toward the mouth of the alley.

	EXT. ALLEY - TIGHT ON TIN-TIN - NIGHT

	He pulls the nickel plated revolver from the satchel.  FOLLOW as
	he hands it across to RATSO, who removes the suitcase-sized boom 
	box (the source of the music) from his shoulder to accept.
	Ratso is a feral skull-head; street trash.

				TIN-TIN
		Three hundred and your a 
		gunslinger.

	HIGH ANGLE - TIN-TIN and RATSO

	As the crow is still watching, yet perched.  A brief
	shove-and-standoff.  The gun deal has gone bad.

				RATSO
		Please, TIn-Tin, you know I'm good
		for the money, man, I promise,
		Leslie put me up to it, please,
		man, don't --
			(choking scream)

	Tin-Tin has just up-rammed a throwing knife into Ratso.

				TIN-TIN
		Ratty -- shut the fuck up.

	Tin-Tin lifts Ratso on the knife, gutting him.  Ratso goes
	slack, deader'n hell.  Tin-Tin reaches around to click OFF 
	the boom box... then let's Ratso`s corpse fall.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		Another satisfied customer?

	TIGHT ANGLE - TIN-TIN

	galvanized by the surprise voice.  He automatically draw a
	fresh knife from the bandolero of knives across his chest inside
	the coat.  Can't yet track the source of the voice.

				TIN-TIN
		Who the hell is that?
			(beat, venomous)
		Come on out man, I won't hurt
		you.

	ANGLE - ERIC IN ALLEY

	He steps out from behind another flaming trashcan.  Wearing a 
	long black scarf and the Tragedy mask.

				ERIC
		Hello, Tin-Tin.

	ANGLE ON TIN-TIN - AS HE RISES (FROM RATSO)

	trying to process what he sees.  And cover.  And buy time.

				TIN-TIN
		Little early from trick-or-treat,
		homie.
			(re: Ratso)
		This dick trying to bushwack me.

				ERIC
		Murderer.

	Tin-Tin blows out a breath.  No bluff.  Time to kill again.

				TIN-TIN
		Guess you got that goddamn right.

	He shrugs.  The shrug becomes the launch of a knife.

	TIGHT SHOT - MOVING - ERIC

	His black-gloved hand slaps away the incoming knife and inch from
	his nose.  It CLATTERS.  Eric continues striding toward Tin-TIn.

				ERIC
		Try harder.  Try again.

	SHIFTING ANGLE - ERIC NEARS TIN-TIN

	as Tin-TIn throws another knife.  Eric closing in.  He claps
	hand together, immobilizing the next knife.  Opens his hands,
	almost an "oops" gesture.  Keeps on coming.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND TIN-TIN

	As they meet.  Tin-Tin attempts a roundhouse.  Eric blocks it
	and smashes Tin-Tin into the alley wall.

				ERIC
		A year ago.  Halloween.  A man
		and a woman.  In a loft.  You
		helped to murder them.

				TIN-TIN
		Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...
			(beat)
		Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her
		too, I think.

				ERIC
		You cut her.  You raped her.
			(rage)
		You watched!

				TIN-TIN
		Hey, I got my rocks off, so
		fuck you in the ass, man.
		
	They're face-to-face now, sweaty and tense.  Eric peels off
	the Tragedy mask.

				ERIC
		I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.

				TIN-TIN
		I don't know you...

	But, as Eric bears down on Tin-TIn, Tin begins to recognize him.
	Fear.  Sweat.

	For the first time, Tin-Tin starts to loose control.

				TIN-TIN (CONT'D)
		Holy shit... you're dead, man...

	EXTREME CLOSE-UP - ERIC

				ERIC
		Victims.  Aren't we all.

	INT. LOFT - NIGHT

	TIGHT ANGLE - TABLETOP

	as Eric's hands place Ratso's boom box on the table and click on 
	suitable weird b.g. MUSIC.

	ANGLE - FLOOR LEVEL

	Eric's boots pass frame.  An open can of cat food CLANKS down
	big in f.g.  as Eric walks b.g. obviously wearing Tin-Tin's 
	trenchcoat.  Gabriel noses into to frame to eat from the can.

	INT. LOFT, BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

	Shelly's vanity.  Dusty, disused.  The mirror spiderwebbed with
	cracks but still hanging precariously in its frame.  Eric is 
	seated, his image crazily split into many.  He pulls on a long-
	sleeved, tight-knit, black shirt.

	WIDEN ANGLE to reveal the loft now lit with dozens of candle
	stubs.  Placed all around.  Ceremonial and weird.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

				ERIC
		Halloween is coming.  The Day of the Dead...

	In the mirror, multi Eric's.  He touches the glass, tightening up 
	as he realizes he's in for another --

	FLASH:  Shelly, sleeping on her divan, a year ago, wakes as Eric
	(O.S.) says "Boo".  She cracks an eye open.

				SHELLY
		Your scary quotient needs work.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY

	Considering old cosmetics.  Everything he touches will hurt him.
	But he's ready to eat this pain.  He grabs a lipstick.

	FLASH:  Shelly at the vanity in happier times

				SHELLY
		I think red's my color, don't you?

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC

	wincing.  He drops the lipstick on the floor.  Grabs a
	hairbrush.

	FLASH:  Eric smashes into the street after his death-fall,
	trailing broken glass.

							FLASH ENDS.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY

	Later.  He's wearing white pancake makeup on his cheeks.  Shaky.

	FLASH:  Eric sucks up Funboy's gunshots in the chest.  1-2-3-4.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY

	his face a crazy warpaint maze of white streaks, not blended
	yet.  He looks at his own reflection.  In one cracked,
	triangular facet of the mirror is not a multiple of his face,
	but the Skull Cowboy.  Just one.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Glad to see you're finally with
		the program.

				ERIC
		Bugger off to the graveyard, skull-
		face, I'm busy.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You work for the dead.  Forget
		that, and you can forget it all.

	The Cowboy tips his hat and isn't there.  Eric sees the crow
	perched on the edge of the mirror now.

				ERIC
		Forget this.

	He smears the streaks until his face is uniformly grave-wave
	white.

	ANGLE - GABRIEL THE CAT

	coming in to sniff around the clutter at the foot of the vanity.
	Eric looks down towards him... and toward the lipstick he dropped.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND

	as it glides down to pick up the lipstick.  CONTACT, and --

	FLASH:  Eric, smashed on the street, T-Bird's car b.g., upside down
	in Eric's POV as he rolls over and blood courses from both
	corners of his mouth,  a definite foreshadow of the "Crow" face.

							FLASH ENDS.
	RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY - TIGHT

				ERIC
		She always red red was her color.

	EXTREME CLOSE - THE MIRROR

	We see only a reflected corner of Eric's mouth as he duplicates
	the blood trail in red lipstick, making one one half of a crow
	harlequin smile.

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING - LATER - NIGHT

	A MEDIUM SHOT as lightning strikes; a storm brews.

	EXT. LOFT - LATER - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S BOOTS

	crossing the floor.  Tin-Tin's knife slotted to the bucklework.

	CLOSE-UP - VANITY

	Eric's hands discard a hairbrush there.  He moves off.

	CLOSE-UP - GABRIEL

	looking up o.s., watching his master stalk around with purpose.
	Thunder rumbles long o.s.

	ANGLE - AT ERIC IN WINDOW FROM OUTSIDE

	The storm boils.  Eric framed in broken window.

	CLOSER ANGLE - ERIC IN WINDOW

	Eric all in black,  Firm-wrapped.  Tight-wired.  The trenchcoat
	flutters, cloak-like.  His shadowy face framed by the upturned
	collar, his hair punkish and spiky.

	SIDE ANGLE - ERIC

	as he moves forward in the light.  The crow lights on his shoulder.

				ERIC
		All right, bad guys...

	FRONT VIEW - ERIC

	Full crow regalia.  Face makeup streamlined.  Eric's eyes flash.

				ERIC
			(in drawn out yell)
		Here I commme -- !

	PULL BACK swiftly, vertiginously, as Eric swan dives from the
	window, his voice a howl.

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S FALL

	Coat, wing-like.  MATCH his dive yell with o.s. crow SCREECH.
	SLOW MOTION as Eric fills the frame and we --

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. ALLEY - WHERE TIN-TIN GOT IT - NIGHT

	Cop lights bounce, competing with the trash fires.  Albrecht and
	several other UNIFORMS assess the double-death scene.  A
	detective, TORRES tries to appear in charge.

				TORRES
		Couldn't have happened to a nicer 
		couple.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND TORRES OVER DEAD TIN-TIN

	Tin-Tin frozen in deathshock, all of his knives sticking out of 
	him.  Dead Ratso, b.g., where he fell.

				ALBRECHT
		Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not
		here, neither is T-Bird -- none
		of Top Dollar's number ones.

				TORRES
		You know, you sure got a hard-on for
		a guy that's guilty of zip on
		paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime;
		what's the matter, don't you like
		adult entertainment?

				ALBRECHT
		This sack of shit is called Tin-
		Tin.

				TORRES
		Don't any of your little pals have
		real, grown up names?

				ALBRECHT
		He was a runner for Top Dollar.
		Just muscle.

				TORRES
		Was.
				ALBRECHT
			(sigh)
		This isn't Top Dollar's style
		anyway.  This was somebody else.
		Somebody new.

	Albrecht lights a fresh smoke.  Torres waves the smoke away.

				TORRES
		And you're gonna tell me who.

				ALBRECHT
		Who ever made that.

	Albrecht points.  CAMERA FOLLOWS to wall behind Tin-Tin.  A crow
	silhouette has been daubed in blood there, now dry.

				TORRES
		What in the hell... do you
		call that?

				ALBRECHT
		I call it blood, Detective.  If
		you want, you can call it graffiti.

	INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of Gideon's thick fingers shuffling grimy currency.
	Some scratchy 1920's TUNE plays throughout b.g., like a broadcast
	from another time and place.

	TIGHTER ANGLE - GIDEON

	looking up at a metallic SOUND, o.s.  Irritated.

				GIDEON
		Piss off, we're closed.

	As the outside security gate rattles, Gideon draws his magnum
	and approaches the front door.

				GIDEON
		Fucking creatures of the night;
		they never goddamn learn.

	Sudden surprise as he sees the silhouette of the gate SCREE back
	against the frosted glass of the front door.

				GIDEON (CONT'D)
		HEY!!

	And he hustles to close up the distance between himself and the
	door, gun up.  Before he can touch the door, the crowbar comes
	rocketing through the glass, pegging Gideon in the forehead and 
	knocking him flat on his ass.  He loses the pistol.
	Eric walks through the door, causing the fractured glass to
	disintegrate around him.  He disclaims, thespian.

				ERIC
		"Suddenly I heard a tapping, as of
		someone gently rapping, rapping at
		my chamber door."
			(pause)
		You heard me rapping, right?

	LOW ANGLE - GIDEON ON THE FLOOR

	reacting to Eric's weird appearance and looking for his gun.

				GIDEON
		Oh, bullshit!  You're trespassing
		asshole, you're breakin'
		and enterin' and you just bought me a
		fucking door!

	During Gideon's rant, Eric brushes glass cubes from his
	shoulders, nonplussed.  Now he flings Gideon across the room.

	Gideon crashes into the counter cage.  As Eric advances on him:

				ERIC
		I'm looking for something in an
		engagement ring.  Gold.

	As Eric comes up behind him, Gideon reaches through the open
	cage door and pulls a big combat knife from beneath the counter.

				GIDEON
		You're looking for a coroner,shit-
		for-brains!

	And he tries to nail Eric with the knife.

	NEW ANGLE - BEHIND GIDEON - AS GIDEON SWINGS

	No Eric behind him.  TILT to reveal Eric hanging off the cage
	above Gideon.  Eric slams the cage door against Gideon's head.
	Drops down like a spider and collects the knife.

				ERIC
		I repeat: a gold engagement ring.
		It was pawned here, a year ago, by
		another gentleman whose name, I
		believe was... "T-Bird"?

	IN TIGHT ON ERIC AND GIDEON

	Eric twists Gideon's sail-like shirt and Gideon turns bright red.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Cute nickname, don't you think?

				GIDEON
			(gasping)
		I ain't got no fuckin' ring.

				ERIC
		Wrong answer.

	Eric nails Gideon's hand to the counter top.  Gideon howls!

				GIDEON
		All's I got is in a box!  Behind
		the counter!

	Eric jumps through the cage door.  Gideon's eyes bug as he sees 
	his own pierced hand, immobilized.

	ANGLE - ON ERIC BEHIND THE COUNTER

	scans the shelves.  Rows of boxed ammo.  Kerosene tins.  A shotgun.  
	Knives and assorted knuckle duster curios.  And the ring box.

	CLOSE-UP - THE RING BOX IN ERIC'S HAND.

	Dozens of gold rings.  Eric's fingers sift through them.

	TIGHTER ON ERIC

	He brings each ring to his face.  INTERCUT with Gideon's feeble
	struggles and invective, o.s.

				ERIC
		No... no... no... no...

	He tosses each rejected ring over his shoulder.  Until:

	CLOSE-UP - THE RING IN ERIC'S HAND

	Obliterated by a stab of brilliant white light --

	FLASH:  Shelly's face.  A perfect vision...

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUMING ERIC

	He closes his fist tightly around the ring.  A moment of
	decision.  Then he draws the shotgun from beneath the counter.
	Uses the butt to knock the knife free of Gideon's hand.  It goes
	spinning across the countertop.  Eric shucks the shotgun and
	rams it into Gideon's nose as the big man slumps to the floor.

				ERIC
		Tin-Tin confided in me, before he
		ran out of breath.  You have one
		chance to live.
				GIDEON
		No fucking way.  He'll kill me.

				ERIC
		Who would waste time killing you...
		besides me?

	Gideon sweats, pants, contemplates the hole in his hand.

				GIDEON
			(cowed)
		Top Dollar.

				ERIC
		Another jolly nickname?

				GIDEON
		You want those assholes, you want 
		Top Dollar.

				ERIC
		T-Bird?

				GIDEON
		Like the car.  He hangs out with
		Skank. that little ass-hair, and
		they hang at the Pit -- hell,
		Funboy lives there.  Ask Top
		Dollar.

				ERIC
		A whole club of pirates, with
		pirate names...

	Eric seems to go berserk, SMASHING and PUNCTURING cans of
	flammables and powder while Gideon flinches, nursing his holed
	hand.  Blows just miss Gideon's head.  Soon he's cowering.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC

	Looking down at Gideon in revulsion.

				ERIC
		You feed off the living.

	SMASH!  as another tin ceases to exist next to Gideon.  Then
	Eric is gone, past him without further word, ignoring him
	entirely.  As he exits, shotgun shouldered, he pauses to admire
	a white Fender Strat hanging among the pawnables.  He reaches 
	for it.

	ON GIDEON

	As he summons some last minute budget bravery.

				GIDEON
		You walk outta here Top Dollar
		will erase your ass!  Top Dollar
		owns the fucking street here and
		you can't dick with me, you son of
		a bitch! 

	RESUME ERIC - FRAMED IN DOORWAY

	The guitar now bowslung across his back, the shotgun levelled at
	Gideon's position.

				ERIC
		One chance to live.  Take it.

	MOVE IN TIGHT ON GIDEON

	as he realizes what Eric means.  Hauls ass and bangs through the
	rear door with a bleat of terror.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC IN DOOR  

	as he cuts loose with the shotgun.

	EXT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	as seen from across the street.  Eric silhouetted, unmoving as
	the whole store front blows hellaciously out around him, raining
	glass and debris.  Stirring his hair.  Eric is the black eye of
	the fireball.

	LOW ANGLE - FRONT OF PAWN SHOP - EMPHASIZE ERIC

	lit by flames and residual explosions.  He hurls the shotgun
	into the inferno.  Casually brushes flaming/smoking detritus
	from his own clothes.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		Don't move! I said don't move.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC

	as he turns slowly, to see Albrecht, out of reach, gun drawn.
	Eric's attitude lightens; Albrecht is not the threat here.

				ERIC
		I thought the police always said
		"freeze:.

	Albrecht divides his attention, jumpy, between the odd sight of
	Eric (guitar on his back), and the raging instant inferno of
	Gideon's.

				ALBRECHT
		I'm the police and I say don't
		move, Snow White.  You're under
		arrest; I don't care what else is 
		wrong with you!  You move and
		you're dead.

	Eric has begun to pace towards Albrecht.  Palms up.  A gesture of
	submission.  Albrecht's battle calm begins to waiver.

				ERIC
		And I say I'm dead... and I move.

				ALBRECHT
		No further.  I'm serious.

	Eric bows, bringing his forehead in line with the gun's muzzle.

				ERIC
		Then shoot, if you will.

	TIGHT ANGLE - ALBRECHT

	He gives it up.  Can't shoot.  This is too weird for him.

				ALBRECHT
		Are you nuts, walking into a gun?

	NEW ANGLE - LESS THREATENING - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

				ERIC
		You must listen carefully:  the 
		Fire Department will be here soon.
		There is an injured man in the 
		alley who needs assistance.
			(meaningfully)
		As Shelly Webster once needed your 
		assistance, and as you are shortly 
		going to need my assistance.

	Albrecht gestures casually, almost comically, with his pointed
	gun.  B.g., the crow lands on a fire escape to monitor them.

				ALBRECHT
		You wanna run that back for me one
		time?

	SIRENS near, o.s.  Eric listens to them, to the night.

				ERIC
		Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the
		street here."  He will "erase
		my ass."

				ALBRECHT
		You don't say.

				ERIC
		I know Top Dollar has turned your 
		streets into his hell.

				ALBRECHT
		Fucking A, my friend.

				ERIC
		The others are called Skank, T-
		Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.
			(beat)
		Watch me, office Albrecht.

	Eric lifts a chunk of glass from the sidewalk.  Slow and easy.
	Albrecht doesn't completely trust him.  Up comes the gun.

				ALBRECHT
		Watch it...

	Eric slices open his palm.  Blood flows.  To his fingertips.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

	as Eric quickly daubs a crow silhouette in blood on the wall...
	then exhibits the gashed hand to Albrecht.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND

	as the blood retreats and the wound seals itself up.

	TIGHT ON ALBRECHT

	and the silhouette.  Mouth hangs.

				ALBRECHT
		You're the one who did Tin-Tin...

	PULL BACK FAST to reveal Eric is gone from the frame.  Albrecht does
	a quick 180.  No Eric.  Flashbars from incoming units begin
	to bounce red and blue off his face.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Great.  Good night.  Guy shows up
		looking like a mime from hell.
			(beat)
		Least he didn't do that "walking
		against the wind" shit;  I hate
		that.

	EXT. SHOWTIME - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH.

	A night-owl pornucopia.  T-Bird enters beneath a garish theater
	marquee.  The 2-bill:  RUMP ROMP with BUTTBUSTERS II.

	INT. SHOWTIME LOBBY - NIGHT

	T-Bird approaches the snack bar.  Wet, breathy mating NOISES
	from the auditorium throughout, o.s.  Looking supremely bored,
	the counterman, DICKEY BIRD, thumbs a porn tabloid.  So what.

				DICKEY BIRD
		T-Bird.  Thrill me.

				T-BIRD
		Business.

	T-bird heads left through s steal door that Dickie buzzes
	open for him.

	INT.  SHOWTIME AUDITORIUM (BACKSTAGE) - NIGHT

	T-Bird walks past dust-covered boxy black speakers as we glimpse
	Lance and Angelique making history in reverse, on the back of the 
	movie screen: oratoria as good as porn films can make it.

				PORN QUEEN (O.S.)
		I don't know how to describe how
		I feel, Lance -- so restless --

				PORN KING (O.S.)
		You're my Moon Queen, Angelique.

				PORN QUEEN (o.S.)
		Oooh -- I want you're rocket right
		now in my Sea of Tranquility -- 
		Lance --

	ANGLE - CATWALK STAIRS

	As T-Bird approaches, the movie sounds dwindle o.s.  He ascends
	the skinny metal stairway two steps at a time.

	ANGLE - STEEL FACED DOOR AT TOP OF STAIRS.

	As T-Bird nears it, a viewplate SNAPS open to asses him.  By
	the time he reaches the top, the door unbolts to admit him.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	As T-Bird enters.  The room is organized around a long meeting
	table and flavored with a taste of everything illegal:  drug
	paraphernalia, weapons.

	Across the table are a couple of Sentries like the one that
	admits T-Bird to the room.  TRACK PAST them to a lank-haired
	silhouette as he turns away from a windowshade, backlit by
	Showtime's exterior neon.

	This is TOP DOLLAR.  Who looks like a Johnny Winter acid 
	casualty but is deadly cold, definitely the man in charge.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Wild fucking night.  I hear our
		pal Tin-Tin got himself very dead.

				T-BIRD
		And Gideon's just burned all the
		down to the foundation.

	Top's eyebrows go up.  Oh really?

				T-BIRD (CONT'D) 
		I didn't have nothin to do with
		that.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Bet that pisses you off, right?

				T-BIRD
		Top, what the fuck is going on
		tonight?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Stay normal, T.  Cops'll be all
		hotwired and aggressive.  No
		combat moves until I check this
		out.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT - (~CROWVISION") HIGH ANGLE

	Taking in the street, the Pit, and a little girl seated on an
	abandoned car.

	ANGLE - STREET LEVEL - ON ELLY.

	Seated on the looted wheelless car, playing with a small doll.

	CLOSER ANGLE - ON ELLY

	She doesn't notice someone is watching her yet.

	TIGHT ON DOLL, THEN ELLY

	She looks up o.s. at Eric, who is still out of the frame.

				ELLY
		What are you supposed to be?  A clown?

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	He smiles for what seems to be the first time.  Warm, even past
	his crow makeup.

				ERIC
		Sometimes.

	He glances back and logs the location of the Pit for later, not
	in a big hurry just now.  Turns back to Elly.

	WIDE ANGLE - ERIC AND ELLY

				ELLY
		You look like a rock star without a
		job.

				ERIC
		I dabble.  May I?

	He indicates the car hood, a "seat" next to Elly from which he
	may observe the Pit.

				ELLY
		If you're not some kinda child 
		molester.

	Eric looks behind himself.  Who, me?  Genuinely amused.  He 
	shakes his head no and sits down next to Elly. 

	INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT

	The music POUNDS and smoke is everywhere, like incense.
	INTERCUTS of the clientele, retro, robotic, clove cigarettes and
	rubber clothing; fetish casual wear.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR

	right in the center of the noise, looking downscale and dirty
	in this milieu.

	ANGLE - ANOTHER CUSTOMER

	Passing Top, appraising him, finding him as boring as life
	itself.  Undertaker chic, she stares at Top.

				TOP DOLLAR
		I thought Halloween was tomorrow
		night.

	An Oriental bodyguard passes him in f.g., motioning to follow.

	INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	Lao watches club activity on his flybank of TVs.  When Top
	Dollar shows up at the office door two Sentries try to bar his 
	passage.  He shoves through.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Get outta my way, you mooks.

	Lao's demeanor indicates that they should not kill Top.

				LAO
		An unexpected pleasure.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Bad news.  Alot of action on the
		streets tonight, and nobody
		bothered to clear it with me.  Tin-
		Tin got himself whacked.

				LAO
		Who got himself what?

				TOP DOLLAR
		One of mine.  And it wasn't a 
		standard hit.

				LAO
		I had heard something like this.
			(beat)
		Describe it for me.  The "hit".

				TOP DOLLAR
		I was wondering if you could tell
		me anything... about a wildcat
		operative.

				LAO
		I know of no one.
			(beat)
		But even if there is, I am sure it
		is nothing outside your capacity 
		to deal with?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Anybody violates my turf -- our 
		turf -- I'll rip out there heart 
		and show it to 'em.

				LAO
		To be sure.  Now tell how your 
		friend died.

	INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT

	ANNABELLA, a comfortable large, spider-in-the-web deskworker,
	sits typing at a terminal.  Miked headphone in one ear, police
	scanner chatter o.s.  She blows and pops a pink bubble of gum.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		Annie?

	ANGLE - ANNABELLA AND ALBRECHT

	Albrecht enters frame from across her countertop.

				ANNABELLA
		Whatever it is, the answer's no,
		Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.

				ALBRECHT
		Annie, I need a file.

	There is a desperate edge to Albrecht's voice.

				ANNABELLA
		Speak up.
			(beat; her guard up)
		Clear it with the Captain if you
		need a file.

				ALBRECHT
		This is special, darlin'.  Please?

	Annabella eyes Albrecht doubtfully.  Fatalistic sigh.

				ANNABELLA
		Just don't tell me you "owe me
		one."  What file?

				ALBRECHT
		Double homicide.  A year ago.
		Las Halloween.

	EXT. STREET NEAR THE PIT - ERIC AND ELLY - NIGHT

	Still hanging by the car, a bit more familiar with each other
	now.  A low-slung mirror-windowed LIMOUSINE hisses past them and
	curbs across the street from the Pit.

				ELLY
		My mom works over there.  I'm
		waiting for her, but she's
		probably with him, right now.

				ERIC
		Who?
				
				ELLY
		Mister Funboy.

				ERIC
		Mister Funboy lives there?

	TWO SHOT - ELLY AND ERIC - (PIT B.G.)

				ELLY
		He has a room, upstairs.  I don't
		like him very much.

	Elly is not happy about this.  B.G. we see Grange get out of the 
	car, heading to the Pit, and notice in passing a guy with the
	white face talking to the little girl down on the block.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		Can you play that thing or do you
		just carry it around everywhere?

	Elly indicates the guitar strapped to Eric' back.

				ERIC
		I can pick out a tune now 
		and again.

				ELLY
		Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"
			(re: doll)
		It used to be her favorite.

				ERIC
		Does she have a name?

				ELLY
		No name.  You sure ask a lot of
		questions.

	Elly HANDS the doll to Eric and he experiences a wholly 
	unexpected flash.

	FLASH:  Elly and SHelly sitting as SHelly's vanity, goofing with
	makeup, test-driving lipstick, the doll visible on the vanity.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC - AS THE DOLL DROPS FROM HIS HAND

	Pain is trying to fight it's way out of Eric in surges. 

				ELLY (OS)
			(smart alec)
		Hel-lo?  Earth to anybody...?

	Eric snaps out of it.  Elly retrieves the doll.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		Do you feel okay.

				ERIC
		No.

				ELLY
		You gotta go now, I bet.

				ERIC
		I have to go.

	Half-zomboid, half-determined, he exits.

	INT. PIT - NIGHT - WITH GRANGE

	As he circulates to the bar, unimpressed.  To the bouncer:

				GRANGE
		Top Dollar?

				BOUNCE
		Never heard of him.

				GRANGE
		Funboy?

				BOUNCER
		Oh, prob'ly upstairs bangin'
		Darla.  Pay for your own beer and
		they'll prob'ly be down before you 
		can drink it.

	INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of an 8x10 of the loft slaughter in Albrecht's hands.
	Subject: a document pinned to the wall with a knife.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT DESK.

	flipping through the file. Smoking.

	ANGLE - THE 8X10 IN ALBRECHT'S HAND

	Subject: Eric, dead in the street in front of the loft 
	building.  The blood on his face reminiscent of his crow face.

	As Albrecht's hand moves the photo we can see in the file
	several band shots of Eric as a member of Diabolique... 
	including the shot on Lao's wall gallery of past performers at
	Club Trash.

	A DOUGHUT on a paper plate suddenly touches down in the middle
	of all this research, startling Albrecht.

	ANGLE - ANNABELLA BEHIND HIM

				ANNABELLA
		Don't thank me.  Your ass is
		already in enough trouble for this shit.

				ALBRECHT
		I knew that.

	Albrecht holds a typewritten page closer to the the light.

	CLOSE-UP DOCUMENT, torn by the knife hole made by Tin-Tin.

	It reads:  We, the Undersigned tenants of 1929 Calderone Court
	Apartments...

				ALBRECHT
		Another nice white girl with a
		cause.  Like a big KICK ME sign.

	Albrecht takes up and 8x10 of Eric's face.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Shelly Webster.  And her nice 
		white boyfriend, Eric Draven.

	With a felt-tip pen he superimposes the crow smile, like the make-
	up, like the blood.

				ANNABELLA
		Your last little wild goose chase
		got you busted back to the Beat 
		Patrol, just like in a bad
		detective story, Eddie. Are we
		doing the wildgoose thing again?

	UNDER THIS Albrecht sketches in Eric's spiky Crow hairdo.

				ALBRECHT
		Could be.

				ANNABELLA
		You gonna wind up working at a school
		crosswalk.   that doughnut's 
		chocolate you, know.

	PUSH IN on the doctored photo.  It's Eric.  It's the Crow.

	PUSH IN on ALbrecht.

				ALBRECHT
		Well, hello there...chocolate,

				ANNABELLA
		Don't thank me.

				ALBRECHT
		Thanks, babe.

	INT. THE PIT (REAR) - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

	Climbing.  The crow perched on his shoulder.  Not in a hurry.

				ERIC
		It's a Raymond Chandler evening
		And the pavements are all wet, And
		I'm lurking in the shadows, for it 
		hasn't happened ...

	TIGHT CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	Impish.  Clown killer.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		... yet.

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	Grange at a table.  SMoking and waiting.  No beer.  His back
	protected, he is stationed near the fire stair door and has a
	good overview of the room.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of a base pipe being lit and hit hard.

	EXT. THE PIT (REAR) - FIRE ESCAPE - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric's gloved hand slides sinuously up rusted railing.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	A hypodermic needle rises into frame.  A nicotined fingernail
	flicks bubbles in the syringe.  FOLLOW needle down and BROADEN
	ANGLE: Funboy taps up a vein in Darla's arm and shoots her up.
	Both are naked in a shabby bed.  Bare lightbulb above.

				DARLA
		Ooh, baby -- gimme all of it.

	CLOSE-UP - THE NEEDLE

	As the plunger depresses.

	ANGLE - ON THE WINDOW

	As the crow quite unexpectedly arrives and perches on the sill,
	scaring the shit out of our two dopey friends.  Funboy pulls a
	giant auto pistol; mock aims, calms down, doesn't fire.

				DARLA
		It's a big fucking bird...

	She falls back against her pillow, eyes dreamily defocusing.
	Funboy giggles.  Relaxes the gun, which half-disappears into the 
	sheets at his side.

				FUNBOY
		It's a squab.  Here bird, Here,
		birdie...

	NEW ANGLE - DARLA AND FUNBOY

	Except that Eric now stands near their bed, across from the 
	bird's position, the guitar bowslung.

				ERIC
		Here Funboy.

	Contained panic as Funboy and Darla both startle.  The needle 
	flies and lands at Eric's feet.  Empty.  Funboy struggles to
	maintain against his high.

				FUNBOY
		Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do
		that, man.  I nearly had a fucking
		heart attack.

				DARLA
		Fun -- look at that guy...

				FUNBOY
		It's just the dope, don't worry

				DARLA
		Fun, he's not going away; he's 
		scaring the piss outta me!

				FUNBOY
		Not me.

	Funboy draws the gun from underneath the sheers.  Suddenly he seems
	totally focused.

				FUNBOY (CONT'D)
		Time for you to take your bird and 
		leave, freako.

	Eric rips open his shirtfront to reveal a circlet of bullet
	punctures.  This gives Funboy pause.
				ERIC
		Take your shot funboy.  You got 
		me, dead bang.

	Funboy tilts the gun off target.  Grins as Eric flat handedly
	past his chest, indicating where to shoot.

				FUNBOY
		You are seriously fucked up, man.
		Just look at yourself.

	In a blur, he sighs, and shoots Eric through the heart.

				FUNBOY (CONT'D)
		BANG!  He shoots, he scores!

	Then his expression drags a little bit.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Looking down and daubing his hand in the bullet wound on his chest.

				ERIC
		Bull's eye.  Good shot.

	ANGLE - DARLA

	who starts scrambling to get out.  Grabbing clothes on the floor
	around herself. she runs right into Eric's outstretched hands.

				ERIC
		Stay.

	Eric twists her arm.

	CLOSE-UP - DARLA'S FOREARM.

	where we may clearly see the needle tracks.  

	UP ANGLE - ERIC 

				ERIC
		Morphine is bad for you.

	He holds her arm captive.  Tight, and we PUSH IN CLOSER to see
	the dope evacuating from the punctures, a reverse of Eric's,
	Blood trail.  The dope drips from Darla's arm to the floor.
	Darla's eyes roll up into the unconscious.  She slumps.

	ANGLE - ON FUNBOY - GAWPING

				FUNBOY
		How the hell did you do that?
		
				ERIC
		Magic.

	Funboy regards Eric's battlescars and guitar.

				FUNBOY
		Either die or do a solo.

	Eric looks briefly to his chest wound, wincing.  He can't seem
	to make it tie off fast enough.  He turns his attention back to
	Funboy.  But his strength is mysteriously ebbing.

				ERIC
		Neither.

				FUNBOY
		Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.

	Funboy lashes out and broadsides Eric across the temple with the
	gun.  Eric falls, rolls back to a stance, but Funboy is right on
	top of him, howling like a lunatic and pistol-whipping Eric
	relentlessly.

				FUNBOY
		I hate trespassers!
			(whack!)
		I hate prowlers!
			(whack!)
		I hate peeping toms!
			(whack!)
		And right now I hate you!

	ANGLE - WALL NEAR BATHROOM

	as Eric, caught off-guard by Funboy's hyper high and weakened by
	his wound, comes slamming into the wall, losing his footing.
	Here comes Funboy, and we TILT UP from Eric's position as he 
	looms, cocking the pistol, which now has Eric's blood on it.

				FUNBOY
		Ahh, the hell with it, I still got
		five shots left.

	In a blur, Eric grabs Funboy`s gun hand.  Twists to the 
	crunching of bones.  Funboy's skewed-around gun hand blows a
	hole in his own thigh.  Funboy fall back across the bed.

				FUNBOY
		Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what
		you did to my sheets, you lame
		piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!

				ERIC
		Does it hurt?

				FUNBOY
		Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass,
		clown-faced fuck, of course it
		fucking hurts!  What the shit are
		you gonna do about this?!

	Eric sits on the bed next to Funboy; inspects the ampule of
	morphine on the nightstand, the needle of the syringe already 
	inserted.

				ERIC
		I have some pain killer right here.

	And he fills the syringe all the way.

	ANGLE ON FUNBOY

	as he begins to see the light.  He can't get away.  Growing
	terror.

				FUNBOY
		No, wait, no WAIT, that's too
		much, man, that's like overkill,
		nobody can take that much, you're
		wasting it -- !

				ERIC
		Your pain ends now.

	And Eric rams the needle into Funboy's heart, driving home
	the full dose.  Funboy begins to convulse.

	Eric falls back on the bed, his force spent.  Darla COMES TO in
	the corner, shock-traumatized.  On O.S. COUGH, and Eric opens
	his eyes.

	The Skull Cowboy, standing in the room, tips his hat.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Howdy
			(beat)
		You look a mess.  Like an ole
		cooter dog.

	TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE

	streaked with -- mostly -- his own blood.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE SKULL COWBOY AND ERIC

				SKULL COWBOY
		Getting a little ambitious and
		extracurricular, aren't we?

				ERIC
		Go away.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You need to learn to mind your own
		business or you'll never get where
		you think you're going.

				ERIC
		Shut up.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Maybe I was wrong about you.

	The Skull Cowboy seems saddened or disappointed.  All we get is
	a little shake of his skull-head.

	Darla makes a SOUND and Eric turns toward her.  She's really
	confused.  She's looking to Eric for some kind of answer.

				ERIC
		Your daughter is out there, on the
		street, waiting for you.

	She's stunned, utterly speechless.  All she can do is look in
	Eric's eyes, try to ponder the phantoms there.

				ERIC
		Go.  Now.

	Darla shoves helter-skelter past Eric and out the door without 
	a glance back at Funboy.

	Eric, recovering, follows slowly, staring at the open door,
	stooping to lift the guitar dropped during the fight with 
	Funboy.  The Skull Cowboy has vanished.  PUSH IN.  Grimly, Eric
	takes a syringe and begins to draw blood from the late Funboy.

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	As a hastily dressed Darla BANGS out through the fire stair door
	behind Grange and FLEES the Pit.

				BOUNCER
		Hey, g'night, Darla.
			(to Grange)
		That there is Darla.

				GRANGE
		Funboy?

	Bartender indicates UP with his thumb.  Grange moves to the fire
	stairs door.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Grange has seen the door ajar and now ENTERS gun-first.  Freezes
	when he sees:

	GRANGE POV - FUNBOY

	Half-sheeted, bloody, a hypo hanging out of his heart.

	RESUME GRANGE

	Eyes darting, drawn to --

	GRANGE'S POV - THE WALL NEAR FUNBOY

	A crow silhouette spray-painted with a syringe of Funboy's
	blood.  A thin outline, drippy.

	RESUME GRANGE

	whirling with his gun to bring it to bear on --

	ANGLE - GRANGE SEES THE WINDOW

	The crow is no longer in the room.  Eric is perched on the sill,
	guitar and all, looking right at Grange as if waiting from him.
	He winks, holds a finger to his lips -- sshh --and jumps out
	into the night.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - GRANGE

	He almost fires, but doesn't.  We see instead the priceless
	expression on his face as we --

							CUT TO:

	INT. PRECINCT FOYER - NIGHT

	Albrecht lights another smoke, quitting for the night.  Waves to
	the late-working Annabella en route.

	EXT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT

	Albrecht hasn't gone three steps before Eric appears behind him,
	cat silent, matching pace.

	NB:  Eric has got a new black rock-n-roll shirt on... and a
	shell casing from Funboy's gun tied in his hair.

				ERIC
		Freeze.

	Albrecht startles; drops his file.  Nearly draws his gun.

				ALBRECHT
		Jeezus!  Don't ever do that, man!

	Albrecht pants, hysterical but calming down.  Eric waits.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		I told you cops don't say
		"freeze".

	He retrieves Eric's doctored photo from the spill of papers.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		You, my friend, are dead.  I saw
		your body.  You got buried.

				ERIC
		I saw it, too.

	Albrecht gathers up the file.  Eric stands there.  We realize he
	is hesitant about touching the file.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Walk with me.

	As Albrecht comes up with the file as they walk.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT ON THE STREET

				ALBRECHT
		You died, man.  I can't believe it
		but here you are.  Last year,
		you and your girlfriend --

				ERIC
		I need you to tell me what you
		remember.  What happened to us?

				ALBRECHT
		You went out the window.  She was
		beaten and raped.  She died in the 
		hospital.

	They stop.  Eric didn't know this.  Fixes Albrecht with a look.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Hey, you asked, man.
			(beat)
		She held on for thirty hours in 
		intensive care.  Hemorrhage,
		trauma.  He body just finally
		gave it up.
			(beat; regret)
		I saw it and couldn't do jack for 
		her.

	Eric has grown increasingly distraught over Albrecht's lines.
	Now he turns to Albrecht and, holding Albrecht's temples with
	his fingers, puts his thumbs over Albrecht's eyes.

	TIGHT ON ERIC - ALBRECHT AGAINST WALL

	We see Eric react to a brutal Flash... but we don't see the 
	Flash.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

	And Eric tears from Albrecht; staggers back, now holding his own
	head.  His crow face slacked in realized horror.

				ALBRECHT
		You okay, man?  I mean, what just
		happened.

				ERIC
		The venom of bad memories.  You
		were there; you saw her.  I saw
		you seeing her.

	Understandable nervous, Albrecht lights up a cigarette.

				ALBRECHT
		You gotta understand -- I was 
		hoping she'd talk, give me a lead,
		a clue, something to work with.
		But she only said one thing to me 
		before she died.

	Eric lowers his head, penitent.

				ERIC
		My name.

				ALBRECHT
			(fizzles)
		I'm sorry as hell, man.

				ERIC
		Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus
		change...

	TIGHT TWO-SHOT - ALBRECHT AND ERIC

	Eric plucks the cigarette from Albrecht's lips, taking a single
	contemplative puff from it.

				ERIC
		Halloween is coming, soon.  You
		will have Top Dollar if you watch
		for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.

				ALBRECHT
		I should be trying to stop you.

	Eric nods, keeping his eyes on the cigarette.

				ERIC
		Thank you.  For giving a damn.

				ALBRECHT
		My pleasure.
				ERIC
		Don't smoke these.

	As a bus grumbles past on the street, Eric pitches the butt and 
	simultaneously ducks out of frame.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT TURNS

	to see a blank building wall.  Fire escape.  Darkness.  No Eric.
	He does a full 360 degree turn.  Eric is gone again.

				ALBRECHT
		Damn, I wish he wouldn't do that.

	MOVING ANGLE - FROM BUS ROOF

	Coat flapping, Eric is standing on the bus roof as the bus moves
	away from Albrecht's position.

	INT. LAO NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	Lao has the partially disassembled rat skeleton in front of him, 
	as well as a mortar and pestle with some bits of crushed bone, and
	is smoking powdered rat bone in a pipe and Grange reports to
	him.

				GRANGE
		The son of a bitch winked at me.
		The he jumped.  Three stories.

	Lao seems strangely unaffected by the bizarre nature of Grange's
	tale.

				LAO
		Did you see an animal of any kind?
		Did you see a bird?

				GRANGE
			(puzzled)
		No.  I saw a guitar.
			(beat; irritated)
		This isn't some rock-n-roller
		you forgot to pay, is it?
			(beat)
		There was a drawing on the wall 
		that looked like a bird.  In 
		blood.

	Lao's expression is one of sublime content.

				LAO
		Good.

				Grange
		It could've been a chicken...

	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT - ("CROWVISION")

	A LONG SHOT of the T-Bird parked across the street from the
	store as two figures -- T-Bird and Skank -- approach on the
	store side.

				SKANK
		I wish to hell I had torched
		Gideon's, that fat fuck.

				T-BIRD
		I wish to hell I knew who it was
		that made Tin-Tin into a voodoo
		doll last night.

	ANGLE - CLOSER ON T-BIRD AND SKANK - STREET LEVEL

	They stop walking.  Look at each other and sanctimoniously cross 
	themselves.  Tin-Tin's big R.I.P. moment.  T-Bird indicates the
	liquor store.

				T-BIRD
		We need some smokes and some road
		beers.

				SKANK
		Got it.

	Skank hustles toward the store.  T-Bird crosses to the car.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD - THROUGH CAR WINDOWS

	WIDEN ANGLE to include the car as he nears it.  Behind him, two
	12-year-old KIDS, AXEL and CHOPPER, enter the store after Skank,
	one wearing a long duster.

	INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

	as the KIDS enter and split between the counter and magazine
	rack.  East Indian CLERK.  Two boys fight video game wars in the
	corner.  Skank browses, grabbing odds and ends.

	EXT. STREET / INT. CAR - LOWER ANGLE - NIGHT

	as T-Bird climbs in, digs the last cigarette from his pack, 
	snaps his Zippo and in the sudden orange light, sees:

	INSERT - REARVIEW MIRROR

	Eric's purloined Strat in the back sear reflecting the light.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD

	He tries to spin and draw his gun but Eric is upon him, nestling
	one of Tin-Tin's throwing knives right inside T-Bird's ear.
		
				T-BIRD
		What the fuck are you supposed to
		be, man?!

	INSERTS:  Eric liberates T-Bird's automatic from the shoulder 
	holster; Eric's hand closes T-Bird's door for him.

				ERIC
		I'm your passenger.  You drive.
		And stop talking.

	TIGHT ANGLE - T-BIRD'S HANDS

	on ignition key and gearshift, making ready.  As ordered.

	INT. LIQUOR STORE - ON SKANK AT COUNTER - NIGHT

	He looks outside and sees Eric as the car fires up, pipes and
	glasspacks grumbling.  Skank moves, BRISTLING.

				SKANK
		What's all this happy horseshit?

	And the car peels out maniacally!  Skank tries to pursue -- but
	the two KIDS draw weapons and freeze everyone in the store.

				AXEL
		Alright, alright, alright --
		everybody be cool and stay exactly
		where you are.

	Chopper hustles up to the counter and relieves Skank of a 
	gigantic Auto Mag.

				CHOPPER
		Whooooa, cowboy!  Cool gun.

	Off Skank's look of total outfoxed disgust.--

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELING FAST - NIGHT

	Vertiginous windshield POV of onrushing street, highspeed.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		Faster, T-Bird.  Faster.  You're
		a hell of a wheelman; you know you
		can drive faster.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND T-BIRD

	Eric now holds T-Bird's own gun on him.  Eyes locked on T-Bird.
	T-Bird's jump between Eric's nightmare visage and the roadway.

				T-BIRD
		You call it, blood -- you got the
		gun. You just tell me where you want
		to go.

	Clearly T-Bird would relish bisecting Eric with a meat cleaver 
	as he says this.  He's nervous and needs to hold the road.

				ERIC
		That's good.  We're going 
		someplace you've never been
		before.

	EXT. STREET - HIGH ANGLE ON T-BIRD - NIGHT

	as the car burns up the obstacle course of pavement, kicking  
	wake of litter.  PEDESTRIANS scurry to clear the way.

	INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

	Parked in an alley, facing the street.  Two cops work on large
	styro cups of steaming coffee.  MJ (driver) and SPEEG.

				MJ
		Smells like rain.

				SPEEG
		Smells like a septic tank.  You
		got that cream stuff?

				MJ
		In the bag.

	Speeg rummages inside the takeout bag.

				SPEEG   
		I hate this cream stuff.  They
		can't even call it cream, legally.

	They snap to as the T-Bird blazes past, doing ninety.

				MJ
		What in the crap?

	MJ floors the pedal, drenching Speeg in coffee on takeoff.

				SPEEG
		Ow! Owowoowowoowo, goddammit!

	EXT. STREET - ON ALLEY - NIGHT

	as the cruiser roars out to give chase.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING FAST - NIGHT

	Eric lends the chase car a backward look.

				ERIC
		You caught one.  Drive faster.

				T-BIRD
		Man, you gonna get us killed dead
		and I don't even know what you
		want!

	Eric cocks T_Bird's pistol and levels it at his face.

				ERIC
		I want you to stop talking.  And 
		drive.  Drive faster.

	Eric rifles the glove box, tossing items out the window: clips
	for the gun.  Sunglasses.  A giant dildo (brief eyebrows-up to
	T-Bird).  Then: a roll of (previously established) gaffer's
	tape.  What Eric needs.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD AND REARVIEW MIRROR

	as he sees a second cop car join the high speed pursuit, 

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		You're very popular.  Thought
		you could handle this thing.

	T-Bird macho calcifies.  He's going to win.

				T-BIRD
		To hell with you.

				ERIC
			(wry)
		Naturally.

	INSERT - SPEEDOMETER

	Climbing swiftly toward the 100 mark.


	EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS ANGLES - THE CHASE - NIGHT

	A 3-way pursuit until the T-Bird reaches the outskirts of the
	city.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT

	All quiet... until the T-Bird ZOOMS past frame.  The lead cop
	tries to duplicate the T-Bird's corner-cut and starts spinning.
	It clips a light pole.  Rebounds into the path of MJ's unit.

	INT. POLICE CRUISER - ON SPEEG AND MJ - TRAVELING - NIGHT

	as MJ stands on the brakes.  Collision imminent.  They howl.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT

	as MJ's unit broadsides the first cop car.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT

	The T-bird careens through dockside silence, alone, then
	fishtails, SCREECHING, to a lung-compressing halt.

	INT. T-BIRD - ON ERIC AND T-BIRD - NIGHT

	T-bird respirating like a jackhammer.  Eric holds stoic.

				T-BIRD
		So what -- you gonna rape me now?

				ERIC
		Time for your reward, T.  Payback
		with interest earned.

	Eric rips a long strip of tape from the roll.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT

	A HIGH ANGLE of the car as Eric opens the trunk.

	ERIC'S POV - The Trunk.

	loaded with plastique, canisters, timers, arson paraphernalia.

	INT. T-BIRD - FAVOR T-BIRD - NIGHT

	SLOW TILT starting with T-Bird's foot, firmly taped to the
	pedal.  Mummified into his seat.  Hands taped to the wheel.
	Throat taped hard against the headrest.

	The car is now in gear, idling.

	ANGLE - ON ERIC FROM WINDOW

	He drops an incendiary right into T-Bird's lap.  T-Bird squirms.
	No go.  Eric reaches in with a bungie cord.

				ERIC
		A little restrictive?  Good.
			(chilling)
		You held her down and raped her.
		You were the first.  She burned
		while you were inside of her.
			(re: bomb)
		What's the lag on this?  About
		twenty seconds, would you say?

	T-bird thrashes, but he's immobilized.  Can't even budge the
	wheel.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I've comrades in hell, T-bird.
		Give them my best.

	Eric activates the timer.  Yanks up hard on the bungie cord.

	INSERT: T-BIRD FOOTWELL

	The bungie cord pulls T-Bird's foot all the way down on the
	pedal.

	ANGLE - ON CAR, FROM DOCKSIDE

	Eric steps back, plucks the guitar out as the car starts to move.  The
	car roars for the edge of the dock, about a distance of a
	football field.  Eric examines T-bird's auto pistol and pops the
	clip.

	INTERCUTS:  as the car speeds for the water's edge, Eric thumbs
	bullets from the clip, one by one.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELING FAST - NIGHT

	T-bird's eyes bug in horror and he goes MMMMMMMMHHH!

	CLOSE-UP - THE CLIP IN ERIC'S HAND

	thumbing out the final bullet.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

				ERIC
		All gone.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD REACHES DOCKSIDE

	Lifting off and blowing all to hell, a billion smithereens of
	phosphorescent firs pattering into the dark water.  It hits.
	Sinks.  Weird flare glow as the car quickly submerges.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	heaving the gun into the distant water.  Plosh.  He produces T-
	Bird's accelerator.  Squirts it into the ground.  He
	prestidigitates and T-Bird's Zippo appears in his hand.  He 
	flicks it and drops it into the flammable puddle.

	HIGH LONG SHOT - ERIC

	walking slowly out of the scene as the firepool coalesces into
	a burning crow shape. 

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAWN

	CLOSE-UP of a frying pan busy burning some pretty firebombed
	looking eggs.  Kind gross.

	ANGLE - DARLA AT THE STOVE.

	NOT THRILLED WITH HER OWN PROGRESS.

				DARLA
		I never was too good at this 
		domestic shit.

	ANGLE - ELLY AT LIVING ROOM WINDOW

	staring outside at nothing in particular.  Yet.

				ELLY
		Don't say "shit".
			(beat)
		That's okay.  Corn Flakes are
		okay.  Anything.

	She pauses as she hears a lilting, faraway GUITAR STRAIN.
	Across the street she can make out the figure of Eric on his 
	roof playing the guitar.

	EXT. ROOF OF LOFT BUILDING DAWN

	EXTREME CLOSE of a Pignose Amp.  More soft GUITAR strokes as
	CAMERA FOLLOWS a patchwork a taped-together, jerry-rigged
	cables to:

	ANGLE - ERIC ON ROOF -- shirtless, crosslegged, his Crow make-up
	streaked by the night's work.  His fingering is unsure and he 
	tries the tune again.

	INSERT - We she Shelly's engagement ring on a leather thong
	around Eric's neck.  Like an amulet.

	ANGLE - ERIC PLAYING

	He's got it right this time.  Strong, sure CHORDS.  Passionate.
	We can almost imagine him conjuring Shelly via musical sorcery.
	He holds a stroke, letting it ring.  Sun rises behind him.

				IRATE VOICE (O.S.)
		Hey, shut the fuck up!

	Eric's eyes, closed with the moment, dart left.  Funny.

	EXT. MAXI-DOGS - DAY

	Later.  Elly is seated on a stool..  Mickey gives her a chili
	dog.

				MICKEY
		Chili dog for breakfast... it's
		original.

				ELLY
		Mom tried to cook.

				MICKEY
		Oh.

				CUSTOMER (O.S.)
		Hey, Mickey, I need a special
		with everything.  No sawdust.

				MICKEY
			(to Elly)
		Everyone's a comedian.  Enjoy.

	Mickey EXITS FRAME.

				GRANGE (O.S.)
		You're Elly, right?  I know your
		mom.

	Elly turns.  Grange sits next to her.  Lao's mirrored-windowed car
	is parked across the street, b.g.

				ELLY
		A lot of people "know" my mom.

	Grange points o.s., indicating he wants coffee from Mickey.

				GRANGE
		I know your friend, too -- the one
		that looks like a rock star.

				ELLY
		I don't know you.

				GRANGE
			(easily)
		I'd like to get in touch with him.

	Elly sizes Grange up.

				ELLY
		You're not a cop, either.  What do
		you want him for?

				GRANGE
		I'm looking for a good guitar man.

				ELLY
		Right.

	Grange withdraws a $10 bill from his wallet and slides it across
	the countertop to Mickey.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		You buying?
			(cuts him some slack)
		He kinda wanders around.  You'll
		see him if you pay attention.

				GRANGE
		I need to find him kind of soon,
		Elly.


	INT. LOFT - ON ERIC - DAY

	No shirt, the ring on the thong around his neck -- workout mode.

	He twirls and performs odd Crow moves of increasing complexity
	in the big open living room.  On purpose, he stretches hard
	against the bedroom doorframe.

	FLASH:  Shelly stands in the blue moonlight near the picture window
	wearing a rococo Victorian gown.  PUSH IN TIGHT as she is
	embraced by a nude Eric.  He undoes the last few remaining ties
	that hold the gown in place.  FOLLOW THE GOWN as it crumples
	down the length of Shelly's (also otherwise nude) body to the
	floor...

							FLASH ENDS.

	LOW ANGEL - FROM INSIDE THE BEDROOM - ON ERIC

	hanging there, inviting the pain the FLASHES bring.  Breathing
	as though he is pumping iron, pumping up.

	ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN BEDROOM

	embracing a ragged full-length dress that used to be Shelly's.

	FLASH: Eric and Shelly (wearing the same dress), exchange an
	extremely passionate and intimate KISS in the moonlight.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC

	as he drops the dress.  Absorbing the pain and memories.

	ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN LIVING ROOM

	executing a complex roll that winds him up at the windowsill.
	He grasps it with both hands.

	FLASH:  A series of CLOSE SHOTS of Eric and Shelly's HANDS, each
	moving along the other's body.  Curves and dips and contours.
	But Eric's gaze never leaves SHelly's eyes.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AT WINDOW

	His GAZE similarly FIXED.  Bringing his hands away and clapping
	them together, deep breath, fingertips pressed to his face, like
	Kung Fu prep.  When he opens his eyes, the crow is there before
	him on the sill.

				ERIC
		That's better.

	He wipes his torso down with a towel.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		It's almost time.

	He holds his hand in front of his face and he flexes it.  We can
	HEAR tendons CRACKLE like a harness.  Closes it into a powerful
	fist.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	TIGHT on Skank as he slams his fist down on the table.  He has
	a black eye and facial scuffs from his liquor store encounter.

				SKANK
		Top, I made the sumbitch!  Face
		all painted white like some kinda
		fuckin' kabuki homo!

	WIDE ANGLE to include all present:  Lao, Grange, Lao Guards #1 
	and #2, Top Dollar, and a Sentry.  Top dusts up a line and
	rinses his nostrils with brandy.

				LAO
		Sounds like our "Crow" is
		out-maneuvering you.

				TOP DOLLAR
		"Our" Crow...?

				LAO
		Come now.  You've seen the 
		graffiti -- all over the city in
		the few hors it has taken your
		men to drop like plague victims.
		What about your turf, Top?
			(mockingly)
		You don't seem to have ripped out
		anyone's heart yet.

				TOP DOLLAR
			(pissed off)
		The night is young.

				SKANK
			(hot)
		The found T-bird flash-fried to
		what was left of his fucking car!

	Top is angry too, but won't show it to Lao.  He rises and goes
	to the window.  Neon glow.  Top sees something outside, below,
	that really torques him off.

	EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SHOWTIME - NIGHT (TOP'S POV)

	A phantom GRAFFITI ARTIST is spray-painting a crow shape on the
	condemned building right across the street.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	Top whip-drawing an auto pistol and shooting below.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Hey, you little fuckweed!  That's
		against the law!

	His gun smoking.  Momentary empowerment.

				TOP DOLLAR (CONT'D)
		I don't give a shit what kinda
		bird this guy is.

	EXT. WINDOW - NIGHT

	As Top turns from the window,  PULL BACK to incorporate the
	chunky shadows where the lights don't fall.  Eric is there,
	perched on the narrow exterior ledge...but we don't know it
	until he opens his eyes, two dots of white in the blackness.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	LAO AT TABLE -- angered by this macho horseshit, annoyed at his
	time being frittered.

				LAO
		I am sitting over here.

	He SLAMS a palm on the table and the room goes silent.  Top
	looks sheepish.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Do you think this childish
		machismo impresses me?
			(regains composure)
		When I was a boy in Saigon I
		watched my country change one 
		block at a time,  one building at
		a time.  Whole lives erased.  A
		way of life, polluted.  Today, no 
		one forces me to move.  I use my
		powers to change your country, one
		block at a time,  one building at
		a time.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Nice speech.  What's it supposed
		to mean?

				LAO
		Your comprehension is not
		required.  Your cooperation and,
		indeed, your ability are the
		issues on the table.

	Top rallies to this.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Whatever you say, I can do.

	Skank looks around, nervous and jumpy, a contradiction to Top's
	guarantee.

				LAO
		That's reassuring.

	CLOSE-UP - TOP'S SHELL CASING IN ERIC'S HAND

	from the ledge.  Endstamp is for a .45 caliber.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON LEDGE

	He sniffs the cartridge.  We can see Funboy's cartridge in his
	hair.  He fists the shell casing tightly.

	ANGLE - DOWN-TABLE, AT SKANK

	Jittery, grabbing a clip for his own automatic.

				SKANK
		What was that -- !?

	It wasn't anything.  Skank loads, stands and jacks the action on
	his gun.  Lao looks questioningly to Top Dollar.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Too many poppers, Skank.  Relax.  Heel.

	ANGLE - WINDOW BEHIND TOP DOLLAR

	A black blur as Eric arches through, spilling Top.

	ANGLE - MEN SEATED AT TABLE

	Eric back flips the length of the table and kicks the gun from
	Skank's hand.  All react.  Weapons out.

	CLOSE-UP - SKANK'S GUN

	spinning mid-air to land in Eric's open hand!

	GENERAL ANGLE - BIG MOBY SHOOTOUT - (VARIOUS)

	Death cleans house.  Standing on the table, Eric fires rearward
	under his own arm to clip Lao Guard #1.  He pivots, shooting,
	and takes out Lao Guard #2 -- who slams backward into the steel
	door as it being opened by the Sentry outside.  Crash!  The
	door is shut again.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AND LAO

	Grange sprays the room with a Calico 950 Auto, shoving Lao
	beneath the table for cover.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Bullets hit him and demolish everything behind him.  Skank hits
	the deck again.  Eric fires and Lao Guard #1 sucks three hits 
	across the chest, firing convulsively against the ceiling, blowing
	the lights.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR

	springing up from behind table.  But Eric is gone from the field
	of fire and one shot strikes Skank, rising at the far end.

	ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE

	making for the door, Grange as shield.  Lao draws a pistol.  The door
	opens and Lao shoots a Sentry to clear him out of the way.

	ANGLE - TIGHTER ON LAO

	A last look back toward Eric and Grange hustle Lao out.

	Door SLAM o.s.  Top is out of ammo as Eric lands from above
	frame right in front of him and slaps the gun from his hand.

				TOP DOLLAR
			(awed but maintained)
		You want my attention, man you
		got it.

	ANGLE - SKANK UNDER TABLE

	Wounded but clawing toward Eric just the same.

				SKANK
		It's him, Top!  He dusted T-Bird!

	ANGLE - ERIC AND TOP DOLLAR, FACE-TO-FACE

				ERIC
		You have to be SKank.
			(to Top Dollar)
		One moment.

	As he speaks, WIDEN FRAME as he turns and grabs the incoming
	Skank by the hair.

				ERIC
		Thank of a snappy comeback for me
		on your way down.

	Without a beat he pitches Skank right out the window!  Skank howls
	all the way down.

	EXT. STREET - ON POLICE CAR - NIGHT

	Damaged from the wreck, limping home, piloted by our pals Speeg
	and MJ.  Skank smashes down into the roof, imploding the
	flashbar and windshield.  MJ drenches his lap in fresh coffee.

				MJ
		OwwwAAHHH son of a BITCH!

	ANGLE - SIDEWALK ACROSS THE STREET - ON ALBRECHT

	who watches with slow marvel from the shadows
				ALBRECHT
		Jesus Christ...

	He runs to assist the demolished cruiser.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - RESUMING - NIGHT

	Just Top, Eric, corpses, and lazily drifting gunsmoke.

				ERIC
		Top Dollar, you're the only one
		here still wasting good air...

				TOP DOLLAR
		Five large, in the drawer right 
		over there.  I never saw you.

				ERIC
		Do you know what you destroyed?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Take the dope, too.

	Eric backhands Top into the wall.  Gets in his face, seething.

				ERIC
		A year ago.  A very nice lady
		circulated a petition.  She died.
		Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.

				TOP DOLLAR
		That's ancient history.

				ERIC
		It's yesterday!  Do you know what
		you destroyed?

	Top Dollar yells right back at Eric's anger.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Who gives a fuck!  I'm a
		businessman.  You gonna do me,
		then do me and shut you're face!

				ERIC
		You don't even remember...

				TOP DOLLAR
		I never forget anything, dickhead.
		That building was a sweep-and-
		clear; the bitch was a nuisance
		with her goddamned petition.  It
		got a little rowdy... end of
		story.

				ERIC
		Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps 
		for you.

	And he grabs Top's head the way he grabbed ALbrecht's earlier,
	slams Top into the wall.  Nose-to-nose.

	FLASH:  Shelly backing away from oncoming Funboy in the loft,
	trying to retreat, nowhere to run, her home invaded, scared.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

	Top is quivering, almost helpless in Eric's hypnotic grasp.
	Eric winces, hard, and --

	FLASH:  Shelly cut, bleeding, struggling against T-Bird.  Wild.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

	Viciously close, more intimate and lethal than anything.

				ERIC
		You're a detail man, Top -- you
		need to see more.

	This time Top tries to twist from Eric's grasp but it's no good.

	FLASH: Shelly, comatose in ICU, eyes fixed and staring, 
	hoses darting in and out, cold blue refrigerator light.

	Bloody, bruised and broken (from Albrecht;s memory)

							FLASH ENDS.

	CLOSE-UP - TOP DOLLAR

	arching, stiffening in pain.

	CLOSE-UP - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

				ERIC
		All of her pain, Top.  Thirty
		hours.  All at once...

	Eric bears down on Top Dollar again.  Top screams.  Blood begins
	to leak from his eyes, nose, ears.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		...all for you.

	FLASH:  Rapidfire CLOSE-UPS.  A jagged compound fracture,
	jutting, Shelly's eye, blood-red sclera, purpled and sunken.

	Her scraped-raw hand clawing at air.  Icebox lighting.  A TIGHT
	SHOT of her monitor going flatline: eeeeeeeeeeeeee...

	TWO-SHOT - RESUMING ERIC AND TOP DOLLAR.

	as Top sags in Eric's grasp, terror fixing his wide-staring dead
	eyes.  Eric lets him drop like a laundry sack.

				ERIC
		I didn't think you could handle it
		either.

	O.S. BANG of impact, heavy against the steel door.  Eric turns.

	ANGLE - STEEL DOOR

	as it is battered down by a squad of police using a power-ram.
	All weapons snap up to bear on Eric.

				LEAD SWAT
		That's all she wrote, Bozo!  You
		stand down now, and that's an
		order!

	ANGLE - ERIC AS HE MOVES

	using his foot to shove the massive conference table at the 
	incoming SWATS while launching himself into the air, flipping
	toward the window and arching through cleanly as the cops open
	fire on command.  Bullets tear the room to pieces.

				LEAD SWAT
		The fire escape's covered.

	EXT. SHOWTIME - FRONT FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

	Picking up Eric on his dive through the window, bullets chasing
	him.  Immediate police fire from below sparks off the ironwork.
	Eric ducks slugs balletically and scampers to the roof.

	ANGLE - SHOWTIME ROOFTOP EDGE

	Eric somersaults over.  Bullets chip brick in his wake.

	STREET LEVEL - UP ANGLE TOWARD ROOF.

	Showtime girded police cars and MARKSMEN, Eric a distant
	shadow figure above.  Here comes a TEAM LEADER with a bullhorn.

				TEAM LEADER (FILTERED)
		On the roof!  Keep firing!  Keep
		firing!

	A fury of law enforcement ordnance cuts loose all around him.

	RESUMING ERIC ON SHOWTIME ROOF EDGE

	A forearm up against the fusillade.  Below him --

	ANGLE - PIT FRONT FIRE ESCAPE 

	Here come Lead SWAT and his Merry MEN.

	MOVING ANGLE - WITH ERIC - ADJACENT ROOFTOP

	Eric runs for it.  Half a story higher.  He hits the wall and
	skitters up, gripping tiny cracks in the brickwork.

	ANGLE - RESUMING MEN ON FRONT SHOWTIME FIRE ESCAPE.

	Lead SWAT hesitates -- because of what he sees.

				LEAD SWAT
		Holy shit, it's spiderman.

	He tries to pull a bead and fires too late.

				LEAD SWAT (CONT'D)
		What're you boy scouts staring at!
		Let's Go!  Let's go!  Let's go!

	MOVING ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON NEXT ROOF

	He sprints to the far edge and dives to the next lower rooftop.
	As he lands he is nailed by a helicopter spotlight, boring in 
	from behind and above the row of buildings.

	MOVING ANGLE - THE STREET BELOW

	COPS below, COPS in the chopper, everyone rushing parallel to 
	Eric, trying to keep up.

	ERIC'S POV - THE STREET, THE HELICOPTER

	PAN QUICK to the next ledge.  COPS right behind him on the roof
	as well.

	WITH ERIC - AS HE RUNS TO THE EDGE.

	and finds a void waiting there.  No connecting building.

	ANOTHER MOVING ANGLE - ERIC

	staying ahead of the search light.  A fantastic series of artful
	moves that wind him up at the rear edge of the roof.

	ANGLE - SWAT MEN ON NEXT ROOF

	sighting Eric as the light picks him out.  Eric glances at 
	them... then jumps.

				CHOPPER PILOT (O.S./FILTERED)
		He's off the roof.  We can't see
		him.

	CLOSE-UP - LEAD SWAT

	pulling his weapon off target, because there is not target.  

				LEAD SWAT
		Dammit to hell!
			(beat; to men)
		Come on.

	ANGLE - ALLEY - STREET LEVEL

	Eric lands like a falling safe, scattering garbage.  But he's 
	okay, up and running.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S RUNNING POV - END OF ALLEY

	as his escape is cut off by a police car that screeches to a 
	stop, blocking the exit.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC

	as he backpedals, scanning for an alternate escape.

				ALBRECHT
			(from car)
		Come on!

	CLOSER ANGLE  - POLICE CAR

	We can see Albrecht.  Eric dives inside and the car burns rubber.

	INT. ALBRECHT'S CAR - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

	Albrecht harried and frantic, but in control.

				ALBRECHT
		Keep your head down!

	He twists and turns the car, glancing rearward for pursuit.  

	Gradually he calms down.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		I figured you might need a ride 
		home.

	Eric looks up at him from his half-concealed crouch.

				ERIC
		It's done.
				ALBRECHT
		I figured as much.  Did you cap
		off Funboy.

				ERIC
		Funboy had to leave this mortal 
		coil.

				ALBRECHT
		Yeah, among others.
			(sees Eric's condition)
		Hey, man -- you're hit.

				ERIC
		It's only a flesh wound.

				ALBRECHT
		It's only fourteen or fifteen 
		flesh wounds.

	Eric sits up as the car gains distance.  Grabs the cigarette out 
	of ALbrecht's mouth.  Takes his single puff.

				ERIC
		You shouldn't smoke these.

	He pitches the smoke out the open car window.

				ALBRECHT
		Great.  Litterbug of the Living
		Dead.

	Eric turns back to Albrecht.

				ERIC
		I'm finished.

	Eric shoots him a doubtful look.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I mean, I've done what I came to
		do.  It shouldn't hurt this much.
		But it will pass...

				ALBRECHT
			(not buying it)
		Right.
			(beat)
		You sure I can't just take you to 
		the emergency ward?

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT - ON ALBRECHT'S CAR

	It hangs a turn and their escape is made.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		They couldn't do anything for me.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		How 'bout the morgue?

				ERIC (O.S.)
		No.  I have one more thing to do.

	EXT. STREET - ANOTHER PART OF THE CITY - NIGHT

	Lonelier, less traffic, more deserted.

	ANGLE - ON ALBRECHT AND ERIC THROUGH WINDSHIELD - TRAVELLING

				ALBRECHT
		You're gonna kill somebody else.
			(beat; no response)
		We're gonna stop and get a shit-load
		of Band-Aids?

	Eric is obviously fighting to stay centered, stay conscious.
	His last fight has caused him a great deal of damage, taken a
	lot out of him.  He needs to recharge.

				ERIC
		I have to prepare for an 
		anniversary.  This coming night.

	HOLD on their two kinds of determination. as we

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY

	High blue sky.  It might even be pretty if it wasn't Detroit.

	INT. LAO'S CLUB OFFICE - DAY

	The TV flybank pulses with videotaped images of Club Trash's of
	various performers -- including Diabolique.  On several screens,
	one-by-one, various images of a guitar-playing Eric Draven
	FREEZE-FRAME as we PULL BACK to the desk.  Lao has the 8x10 from
	the corridor gallery.  He places it within eyeshot and resumes
	work on the desk BELOW FRAME;  we can't see it yet, among other
	scattered research and inconcubula.

	ANGLE - GRANGE

	Entering and crossing to the desk.  As he comes up to the desk,
	he DRAWS BACK.

				GRANGE
		What... the hell is that?

				LAO
			(calmly)
		This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes,
		it is real.

	NEW ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE

	Revealing Lao with a sealed cage, holding a large, live cobra in
	his hands.  The killing blade is nearby.

				GRANGE
		That thing is poisonous.

				LAO
		Extremely so.
			(beat)
		You and I are the recipients of
		unwanted good fortune, in the form 
		of a man everyone is calling The Crow.

	Grange makes a face.  Can't keep his eyes off the cobra.

				GRANGE
		Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...

				LAO
		I intend no slight to you, but I
		cannot find the English to
		adequately express just what he
		is.  I suppose Western mythology
		would describe him as a Fury.
		
				GRANGE
		Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.

	Lao chuckles indulgently.

				LAO
		Do you know of spirit assassins?
		You do know the dead can rise?
		Properly motivated, of course.

				GRANGE
		Like some sort of zombie on a 
		revenge trip.

				LAO
		Mmm.  But tonight I can take what
		is his.

				GRANGE
		Only thing you'll get from that
		clown is a faster way to die.
				LAO
		To the contrary...

	ZZLIP!  Lao smoothly BEHEADS the snake with the Blade against
	the stone surface of the desk and discards the writhing body.
	He squeezes behind one of the eyes and a VENOM SAC protrudes
	like a dark pimento.

	LAO pulls it free of the milky, clinging tissue and EATS IT.
	Off Grange's stunned expression.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		...all the dying tonight will be 
		done by the former Eric Draven.

	Lao exhibits the blade to Grange as though it explains all.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Who is only invulnerable so long
		as he cares about the dead.  When
		he begins to care about the living,
		you'll find his heart can bleed...
		and I want it to bleed for me.

				GRANGE
		Kill a dead guy?

	Lao POPS the second venom sac; swallows it.  Pleased.

				LAO
		Truly kill him.  So I may crush
		his skull and smoke it.

	Lao SHRUGS.  Grange can handle it.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Let it suffice that I need him...
		and to get to him, we'll need his 
		little friend.

	Finally, an assignment Grange can comfortable understand. 

	INT. LOFT - DAY

	Eric, barechested, emotionally tapped, clean of makeup and blood
	but exhausted, his movements retarded and slack.  Staring
	fixedly into the fireplace,  where he burns everything he could
	find of his past:  the junk from the makeup table, the masques,
	photos of himself and Shelly.

	INT. LOFT - STAIRWELL - DAY

	Moving with Elly as she nears the open loft door.  She PEEKS
	cautiously inside.

	RESUME ERIC

	Without looking toward the door, he speaks.

				ELLY
		What's going on...?

				ERIC
		A remembrance.
			(beat)
		A closure.

	And Eric consigns to the fire the DRESS we saw earlier.

	Holds a photograph in a broken frame.  Cracked glass.  Subject:
	Eric and Shelly, goofing for the camera.

	He chucks it into the fire.  Draws a deep breath.

				ERIC
		Better now.  I feel good.  How are
		you, Elly, my friend?

	Elly is clearly uncomfortable, groping for an excuse just to see 
	Eric.  Eric is staring at her, intently.

				ERIC
		What is it?
				ELLY
		I knew.  I knew I knew you.  Even
		with the makeup and stuff you
		wore.
			(beat)
		You really loved her, didn't you?

	CLOSE-UP - FIREPLACE

	The photo burns and blackens in the grate.

				ERIC
		You brought flowers.  As long as 
		you don't forget her, Elly, she 
		lives.

				ELLY
			(upset)
		She's dead.  She's gone.  And now
		you're just gonna go away and
		never come back, too.  I hate this
		place; it isn't fair.

				ERIC
		Elly...

	He draws her close.  Wipes away an errant tear with his thumb.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Sometimes the people we care about
		are gone, for no reason.  Sometimes
		that's really tough.  I cry.  But if 
		the people we love are gone, we keep them --

	He taps Elly's temple, then his won.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		-- right here.  It's a big
		responsibility.  And that makes it 
		okay to mourn.
			(beat)
		I know that if you weren't here,
		I'd be very sad.

	Elly gives Eric a hug.

				ELLY
		You look funny without your white
		face on.  Like it's your day off
		or something.

	He quizzical expression amuses him.

				ERIC
		Somebody here wants to meet you. Gabriel?

	Gabriel the cat has wandered near the fireplace to join them.  
	Elly is immediately smitten.  Happy.
		
				ELLY
		I remember him!  Here, Gabriel...
		here kitty... Gabriel... Is he
		still yours?

				ERIC
		I think he's yours, now.

	The cat seems to like that idea.  Elly wraps him hugely up in
	her arms, talking to him: "How're you, Gabriel, whatcha doin'"

	ANOTHER ANGLE - TIGHTER ON ERIC

	While Elly is preoccupied with the cat, Eric gives up his last
	bit of Shelly to the fire - a portrait photo of her, small and 
	creased.  He puts it in the fire, watches it burn for a beat,
	then turns to Elly.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I have something else for you.

	BACK FOCUS as Eric lifts off his neck Shelly's ring for Elly's
	inspection.  The ring twirls large in f.g.

				ELLY
		Nobody ever gave me something like
		that before.  Ever.

	Eric places it around her neck.  Elly BEAMS.

				ERIC
		Shelly would've wanted you to have
		it.  This way, you'll think of her 
		every time you see it...

				ELLY
		And she'll be alive.  Up here.

	Elly TAPS her own temple with a smile, keeping one hand on the
	ring.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Blowing wind.  TRICK-OR-TREATERS wisp past.  Ghosts, witches,
	demons out for Halloween.

	ANGLE - CEMETERY FENCE

	walking home with Gabriel zipped up inside her coat is Elly.  A
	fire engine wails past in the opposite direction.

	ANGLE - ELLY ON BROWNSTONE STEPS

	Strictly downscale building.  Elly to Gabriel"

				ELLY
		You're gonna like it here.

	A car curbs across the street as she enters the building.

	ANGLE - PUSH IN ON CAR

	as the window cranks down to reveal Grange at the wheel.

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Darla nervously smoking, doing her best to stay clean, but
	jittery.  Elly enters the shabby living room with Gabriel in her
	arms.

				DARLA
		I was wonderin' where you'd
		gotten to --
			(she sees Gabriel)
		Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?

				ELLY
		He was a present.  Besides, we're
		moving anyway.  You said.

				DARLA
		We'll discuss this later.
		Obviously.  You left the door open.

	DARLA points.  As Elly goes to close the door it opens.

	NEW ANGLE - FAVOR THE DOOR

	Grange enters accompanied by two Asian martial arts STRONGARMS
	(Lao Guards #3 & #4).  Grange looks around, bemused, his manner
	avuncular.

				GRANGE
		Hi, Elly.  Remember me?

	Elly's surprise is evident.  Darla is just plain pissed off.

				DARLA
		I don't remember you.  And I don't
		remember inviting...

				GRANGE
			(to his MEN)
		If she opens her face again, shoot
		her in the head.

	ANGLE - DARLA

	Mouth stalling in the ON position as Lao Guard #3 pulls a 
	gigantic gun, draws and cocks.

	as he scoops her up, captive.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AND GABRIEL

	He strolls the circuit of the room, stopping near the window.

				GRANGE
		You should listen to your mother.
		She said no cats.

	Grange pitches Gabriel right out the window.

				ELLY
		Gabriel!

	Grange pulls out a compact Polaroid camera.

				GRANGE
		Now that's the expression I want.

	ANGLE - ELLY AND GUARD #4

	As she struggle mightily, to no avail, as Grange moves in to
	snap his shot.

				GRANGE (CONT'D)
		Say cheese.

	He snaps.  On the SX-70 WHIRR and flash white-out, we --

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING ROOFTOP - SUNSET

	Dark clouds have gathered to highlight the sunset.  Eric plays
	the guitar - LOUD, the SHelly theme in a major key.  Where
	before it was wandering, uncertain, now it's bold and
	heartbreaking.  Definitive.  Pain replaced by strength and a
	sense of homecoming.

	As Eric gets to the end of it, the notes are flying out... At
	the climax, rips the guitar up over his head and brings it 
	down -- SMASH -- on the Pignose.  He's finished here.

	ROOF EDGE - FROM STREET

	as the broken guitar SAILS OUT over the building edge.

	INT. LOFT BUILDING STAIRWELL - DUSK

	As Eric comes down the stairs.  Notices the open door.

	INT. LOFT - DUSK

	He enters, cautiously, to find an envelope laying in the middle
	of the floor.  He opens it.

	INSERT - THE POLAROID OF ELLY

	with a note.

	UP ANGLE AT ERIC READING THE NOTE - FROM FLOOR

	The crow flies past behind him as his expression hardens.

	NEW ANGLE -  A MOMENT LATER - FAST AND HARD

	Eric brutally crisscrosses his arms with black vinyl tape.

	ANGLE - ERIC DRESSING

	Pulling on black night-fighting clothes, skintight.

	ANGLE - THE VANITY

	as Eric (seen in mirror) jabs his fingers into the white
	makeup and smears it on.

							SMASH CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET NEAR CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Eric marches along in plain view since everyone around him seems
	to be in costume.  The wind whips his coat.  KIDS bustle around
	him with trick-or-treat bags.  The crow perched on his shoulder.

	ERIC'S POV - CITY SKYLINE

	Somewhere, a few blocks over, a building is burning.

	ANGLE - ERIC WALKING

	A fire engine races past on the street.  He steps out in its
	wake and crosses over to --

	MEDIUM MOVING SHOT - THE CEMETERY

	waiting for him as he crosses to the fence.  Beyond the fence,
	in the distance, the church looms.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	He pauses.  A KID in a Creature from the Black Lagoon mask
	comes, passes Eric, then comes back for a touch.

				CREATURE KID
		Trick or treat!

	Eric smiles.  Not tonight.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Eric is standing over the grave of Shelly Webster, looking down.
	He holds for a moment then moves on.

	EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

	Eric ascends toward giant oak doors, tres Gothique.  The crow
	flaps past, leading him.

	NEW ANGLE - TOP OF STEPS -- where waits the Skull Cowboy.  As
	Eric approaches, the Skull Cowboy interposes himself between
	Eric and the huge double doors.

	Eric glares up, defiant.  Moves up the steps.  The Skull Cowboy
	extends a skeletal hand.  STOP.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Stop screwing around.

	TIGHT ON ERIC

	Angry, ready to battle:  You talking to me?

				SKULL COWBOY (CONT'D)
		Your job is done.  You interfere
		with the living again.

				ERIC
		Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I 
		might die.
			(beat)
		I've already done that.  I don't 
		need anyone's help.  Yours 
		included.

	STAIR ANGLE - ERIC AND SKULL COWBOY

	Eric lower, Skull Cowboy superior, the storm wild around them.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Do this thing and you will be
		vulnerable.  The blood will not
		return.
			(beat)
		No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.

				ERIC
		Fine with me.

	He ADVANCES a step up; the Skull Cowboy Hold fast.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You'll be alone.

				ERIC
		I'm already alone.

	INT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT

	Through a castle keep-like slit, Grange monitors Eric's
	arrival.  He speaks into a headset.

				GRANGE
		We've got company.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		Is he inside?

	GRANGE'S POV - ERIC

	Eric Talking to dead air.  Almost arguing with it.  Eerie.

	RESUME GRANGE

	As he talks into his mike he hefts a nightscoped, laser-sighted
	sniper's rifle.

				GRANGE
		He's just out front talking to
		himself.  You tell me. 

	EXT. CHURCH - RESUMING ERIC ON STEPS - NIGHT

	Eric, eyes steely, stares down the Skull Cowboy.

				ERIC
		Don't waste my time.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Very well, it's your ass.

	And the wind kicks up around them both, powerfully.

	ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY (EFFECT)

	As the force of the storm dust-devils around him and begins to
	disassemble him.  The fire in his eye sockets goes out.  His hat
	flies off an is pulverized by the wind.  The garments begin to
	disintegrate and blow around, rotten cerements falling apart in
	mid-air.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS -- transfixed by this unexpected
	development.  A shard of the Skull Cowboy blows past Eric's face 
	and transmutes to dust!

	RESUME SKULL COWBOY AT TOP OF STEPS (EFFECT)

	Transparent, ancient bones, crumbling and blowing away.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS

	As Eric lunges for what's left of his mysterious, smart-ass
	mentor
	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S LUNGING HAND

	Meeting only a swirl of vaporous dust where the Skull Cowboy's
	heart would have been.

	TIGHT ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS

	He has time to register the dust in his palm before it, too,
	renders down to nothingness,  leaving a vague green glow that
	dies.  And as he looks to the sky --

	UP ANGLE - THE CROW

	flapping down to land on Eric's shoulder.  Eric is astonished.

				ERIC
		But why are you still here?

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	No answer in the crow's eyes.

	RESUME AND FOLLOW ERIC

	That's good enough for Eric.  He marches to the double doors and
	shoves them back.

	INT. CHURCH - AS ERIC COMES THROUGH THE DOORS - NIGHT

	The high breeze blows in with him, disturbing dust in the
	disused Gothic dark.  Hollow cathedral ECHOES to sounds.  A
	giant 27" TV positioned on the alter, broadcasting static.

	LONG SHOT - ERIC AS HE APPROACHES THE ALTER - ("CROWVISION")

	Leery of potential danger from a thousand dark places.

	ANGLE - THE TV - AS ERIC ENTERS FRAME

	Onscreen:  Elly, gagged with duct tape and handcuffed to an iron
	ring bolted to a flagstone wall.  Could be anywhere inside the
	church.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		I believe our friend Elly call
		you Mister Crow.
			(beat)
		Please acknowledge; the mike
		will pick you up.
		
				ERIC
		I can see her.

				LAO
		Of course you can.
	ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running
	lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which
	THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.

				LAO (CONT'D; O.S./FILTERED)
		Don't permit your rage to cloud
		the issue.  I believe in barter.
		I propose a simple trade.

	Grange sights his weapon.

	CROSSHAIR POV - ERIC AT THE ALTER

	Bluring as Grange resights.  Eric is not the target.  Blur
	FINDS the crow at the far end of the nave, perched in front of
	a giant stained glass window.

	NEW ANGLE - GRANGE -- squeezing off two quick, SILENCED shots.

	ANGLE - STAINED GLASS WINDOW -- the first shot blows a hole in
	some pastoral religious presentation.  TINKLE of glass.

	ANGLE - ERIC -- Spinning at the quiet !pfut! sound, to witness.

	ANGLE - INCOMING DART - ("CROWVISION")

	SPinning and hissing venomously.

	ANGLE - ERIC DUCKS

	As before, but the crow is not as fast.

	TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

	As it catches the dart and goes down in a flurry of feathers.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC AT ALTER - INCLUDE TV

	His knees buckle.  Sympathetic PAIN from the hit.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		You intended to finish this
		evening in the cemetery.  I am 
		here to help you on your way.

	ANGLE - RESUMING GRANGE IN GALLERY

	Swapping his tranquilizer gun for a more lethal rifle, similarly 
	scoped.  He sights the fallen Eric in a spray of green light.

	HIGH ANGLE - HAND HELD - ERIC AT ALTER

	Groping for support to drag himself back to standing.

				GRANGE (O.S.)
		I've got him if you want him.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		No shooting.

				GRANGE
			(into headset)
		Move in, guys.

	HIGH ANGLE - THE SANCTUARY -- as Lao Guards #3 and #4 move
	into light, closing on Eric's position in the center of isle.
	Both wield calico's and one bears a sword.

	CLOSE ANGLE - ALTER -- Lao makes his entrance from shadow
	wearing a brisk pugilist get-up, a practical fighting outfit.
	Makes a show of drawing the killing blade.

				LAO
		I wish to possess what you have now.

				ERIC
		I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.

				LAO
		I know.  That is why I will
		prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?

	Eric CRAMPS UP, CLUTCHING his throat in obvious pain.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AT STAINED GLASS WINDOW

	Holding the crow by the neck, TIGHTLY.  He plucks the tranq dart
	from the its body.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AS LAO MOVES IN CLOSER

	Crashing to one knee, invisibly bludgeoned, struggling to
	breathe.  Lao has no fear, walking around the stricken Eric.

				LAO
		Sooner or later, my action were
		destined to bring me a genuine
		Fury.  And it turned out to be you.
		At last.  I appreciate your
		abilities as few mortals can.
		That's why I desire them.

				ERIC
		You're too late.  There was a guy
		outside - on the stairs - you
		really need to talk to.  But he 
		turned to dust and blew away.
			(beat, gasping)
		I don't have any power for you to take.

				LAO
		I don't believe that.
	Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES
	his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may
	perceive a palpable degree of relief.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Time for you to die for me.
			 (beat)
		Funny, how the dead can still
		bleed.  How they need air.

	Eric IMMOBILIZED as Lao DRAWS BACK the Blade.  To Grange:

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Break its neck.

	ANGLE - RESUMING GRANGE AT WINDOW as he prepares to do dirty on
	the bird.

	Over his shoulder, we PUSH in to the BULLETHOLE from the first
	dart until we're in TIGHT CLOSE-UP of an eye watching through 
	the hole.

	EXT. CHURCH - OBVERSE OF WINDOW - NIGHT

	Albrecht digs through a sling bag of weaponry, trying to
	simultaneously monitor the peephole, muttering sotto to
	himself.

				ALBRECHT
		Had to go get yourself hip-deep in
		shit, didn't you, my friend.

	It begins to rain.  Albrecht glances resentfully toward the 
	sky.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Give it a rest, huh?

	A hefts a machinegun, clipped over and under.  CUTS LOOSE on
	full auto into the Madonna on the window.

	INT.  CHURCH NAVE - NIGHT

	As the window EXPLODES toward Grange and he sucks big hits from
	behind, DROPPING the crow.  The bird hits the ground, flapping
	weakly.

	LAO GUARDS #3 & #4 exchange a look and whip up their Calicos,
	RETURNING FIRE.

	EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

	Albrecht takes cover as a lot of religious stuff is noisily
	destroyed all around his position.  Chunks of the window
	continue to disintegrate. 

	INT. CHURCH ALTER (NIGHT)

	Eric tuck-and-rolls out of the way as we go CLOSE on Lao, 
	screaming.

				LAO
		I said no shooting!

	Then he's ducking bullets himself as Albrecht STEPS IN through
	the blown out window, the machine gun stuttering on slugs.

	The sanctuary comes apart around Lao.  He RETREATS to the alter
	and EXITS whence he came.

	TIGHT ON PEW -- ERIC DIVES just as Guard #4 comes after him with
	the sword, which chomps into the wood and gets stuck there.
	Guard #4 releases it and cross draws his Calico as ERIC springs
	back into the frame -- STRAIGHT UP.

	TIGHT ON GUARD #4 as Eric's lancing foot propels him backward
	before he can fire.

	INTERCUTS -- ALBRECHT AND GUARD #3 scrambling to reload.  Guard
	changes magazine; Albrecht swaps clips.

	ANGLE - DOWN LENGTH OF PEW -- Guard #4 slides.  Sits up with his 
	gun as Eric, down-pew, grabs the sword.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT WINDOW  firing now with a gun in each hand.

	RESUME ERIC AND GUARD #4, who eats it from Albrecht's gunfire,
	but not before he puts a round through Eric.

	Eric staggers back from the impact but keeps his feet.  

	RESUME ALBRECHT as he tosses away the dry pistol.  His machine
	gun jams, he fights to get the clip.

	ANGLE - GUARD #3 -- reloaded and rising, having caught Albrecht
	dead-bang in the open by the window.

	MOVING ANGLE - WITH ERIC --  A complex leap with the sword
	flashing.  He lands near Guard #3 and SLASHES UPWARDS, blade up.

	CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3 -- screaming in pain, gaping DOWN O.S.

	TIGHT ON ALBRECHT - looking UP, following the trajectory of
	something AIRBORNE toward him.

	CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3'S Calico spinning mid-air with Guard #3s
	HANDS still attached, severed mid-forearm by Eric's devastating
	strike.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT drops Guard #3 -- to REVEAL Eric in the
	background.  Eric salutes Albrecht with the tip of the sword.

	WITH ALBRECHT as he moves into the nave, which has been torn
	apart by gunfire.  Hazy smoke.  Two dead guys.  And Eric.

				ALBRECHT
		You sorta looked like you might
		need my help.

				ERIC
		This isn't your place.  This isn't
		your fight.  And I don't need
		your help.

				ALBRECHT
		You're welcome.

				ERIC
		Leave here.  Don't do this.  I
		don't want you here.

				ALBRECHT
		The hell you say.  This isn't just 
		about you any more.

	Eric stares dead-on at Albrecht, acidly, then BREAKS the Guard's 
	sword, dropping the pieces and turning his back on Albrecht, who
	pursues Eric to: 

	INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE - TO BELL TOWER - NIGHT

	The crow FLAPS UPWARD through the void.  Eric grabs the thick
	bellrope, testing it.  A final look to Albrecht.

				ERIC
		Don't interfere.

				ALBRECHT
		You're bleeding, man.  You can't
		make it.

	Eric shinnies up the bellrope, ignoring Albrecht.

	ON ALBRECHT

	Watching as Eric dissappears from view, fast..  Grumbles.

				ALBRECHT
		You won't mind if I just take the
		stairs, then, smartass...

	He hefts his arsenal bag of hardware and begins to plod up the
	steps.

	ANGLE - MOVING WITH ERIC ON THE ROPE -- A weird perspective of
	speed climb.  Zip!  All the way to the top.

	EXT - CHURCH ROOF - NIGHT

	Slanted, shingled, slippery, dark.  Lightning deep in the turbid
	clouds.  The crow circles as Eric RISES INTO FRAME.

				ERIC
		Here I am.

	DOWNFRAME lightning STRIKES the ornate LIGHTNING ROD (large,
	Victorian, lance-like) at the far end of the roof from the bell
	tower.

	SILHOUETTING Lao and Elly standing in front of it.  Elly
	flinches at the strike.

				LAO
		Can you fly, Crow man?

	INT. BELLTOWER SPIRAL STAIRS - RESUMING ALBRECHT

	He stops his ascent to light a cigarette.

				ALBRECHT
		I ain't cut out for this superhero
		shit.

	EXT. CHURCH ROOF - RESUMING LAO - NIGHT

	Lao SNAPS Elly's free handcuff to the dimly glowing  lightning
	rod and advances, one foot on either side of the peak of the
	roof, his blade brandished.

	CLOSE MOVING SHOT - ERIC -- Hands up to grapple, but
	weaponless.  He spiders to meet Lao, suddenly PICKING UP SPEED
	and RUNNING along the precarious peak.

	Lao sees him coming, braces to strike, but Eric executes a BROAD
	FLYING LEAP right over Lao's head.

	ERIC LANDS, SLIPS, sprawls sideways, clinging to the peak of the
	roof.  Lao hurries in to slash with the blade, as Eric averts.
	The steel RINGS.  Eric converts his dodge into a low spin kick
	that DUMPS Lao.

	Eric SPREAD-EAGLES to keep from falling.  Distantly, Lao
	similarly saves himself.

	NEW ANGLE -- THE FIGHT -- Here comes Lao, crabbing back toward
	the peak.  Eric ROLLS to Elly's position, GRABS the lightning
	rod and tries to wrest it loose.

	SIZZLE OF FLESH as Eric's hands are scorched: the metal is still
	blue-hot.

	MOVING WITH LAO as Eric battles to free the lightning rod.  Lao
	closes up distance, gives a warcry and prepares to swing as - 

	Eric WRENCHES the rod loose and turns to deflect Lao's blow.
	The weapons spark as they meet... and there goes Elly, her
	handcuff freed, SLIDING DOWN THE ROOF SLOPE.

	ANGLE  -- ROOF SLOPE -- WITH ERIC  as he dodges Lao by using the
	lightning rod to vault down to where Elly is about to slip off
	the roof.

	With the rod embedded in the roof, Eric hangs on, and elly hangs 
	on to Eric.

	UP ANGLE -- LAO, a dark figure against the night sky, raising
	the sword.

				LAO
		Face me!

	Eric guides Elly to the top of one of the flying buttresses.
	When he looks up, Lao is gone.

	ANGLE - BELL TOWER -- Albrecht's head pokes up at last.  Looks
	around, finally spots Eric below and to the left.  YELLS, serio-comic.

				ALBRECHT
		Is he dead yet?

	INSERT - ALBRECHT'S HOLSTER as Lao's hand draws Albrecht's
	gun quickly.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND LAO --Lao has blindsided Albrecht.

				LAO
		No.  You are.

	He jams the gun into the base of ALbrecht's neck and fires three times.

	CLOSE ANGLE - ERIC - He's too far away to matter.  Shock.

	INSERT - ALBRECHT'S CIGARETTE as it rolls down the slope,
	trailing sparks, snuffing out.

	ANGLE - ERIC holding onto the lightning rod as lightning CUTS the
	night above him.

	ANGLE -- LAO AT BELL TOWER, triumphant and a bit wild, SHOUTING.
				LAO
		You've caused another death,
		Mister Draven!  The girl will die
		as well -- because of you!

	ANGLE - ELLY ON FLYING BUTTRESS

	The base of a triangle - Lao, Eric, Elly.

				ELLY
		You go to hell, you pervert!

	RESUME ERIC

	Rage over the loss of Albrecht.  He RISES, hurting but mad as
	hell.  GLARES UP toward Lao.

				ERIC
		And how many lives have you destroyed?

				LAO
		I took yours from you.  Your
		little girlfriend?  I took hers,
		too.  Your meaningless, petty
		life?  I took it so that tonight
		your existence might gain a
		purpose.  You're no avenger.
		You're mine.

	PUSH IN TIGHT ON ERIC.

	Eyes alight with hatred for Lao.

				ERIC
			 (to himself)
		You're right, I'm not an avenger. 
		Not any more.

	As lightning strikes, Eric Fires his gaze TOWARD THE SKY.

	HIGH ANGLE - LAO ON ROOFTOP - ("CROWVISION")

	SEEING the crash dive toward Lao through the row's eyes.

	ANGLE  - LAO ON ROOFTOP

	As the crow wings down INTO FRAME and lights on Lao's head, CLAWING!

	CLOSE-UP -- THE CROW ON LAO'S HEAD slashing with its claws.
	Pecking out Lao's eyes.

	WITH ERIC -- on the roofslope as he totters but maintains his
	climb, the crow/Lao UPFRAME B.G.

	RESUME LAO -- as the crow abandons him.  Lao STAGGERS AND FALLS
	down the roof - toward Eric.
	SLANTED ANGLE -- ERIC AND LAO -- Eric ARRESTS Lao's fall,
	fisting lapels and bringing him nose to nose.  Fury.

				ERIC
		Time for a sacrifice.

	Lao's face is a hideous bloody mask with black holes where the
	eyes used to be.  He smiles gruesomely.

				LAO
		I don't need eyes to take what I
		want from you.

	He EMBRACES Eric and RAMS the killing blade deep into Eric's
	back!

	ON ERIC as he looks down to see the blade protruding from his
	sternum.  Tight grimace.  A lot of pain.

				ERIC
		Can you fly?

	He pulls Lao into a BACKWARD ROLL down the roof, HOLDING HIM
	TIGHT.

	MOVING ANGLE -- INTERCUTS -- ERIC AND LAO FALL

	Eric lands on his back, forcing the blade THROUGH himself and
	INTO Lao.  Eric completes the roll and KICKS Lao off INTO SPACE,
	the killing blade still embedded in him!

	WITH LAO as crashes, sliding, sprawling down PAST Elly's
	position.  Gets to his knees atop the flying buttress.  Sees the
	blade in his own chest.

	CLOSE-UP - ELLY - she sees it all happen.

	RESUME LAO - a regretful look toward Eric.  He PLUMMETS off the 
	roof edge.

	ANGLE - ERIC SLIDES DOWN ROOF --  He slows, stopping when Elly
	is in frame.  He clutches his own chest.  Regards his own
	shaking hand, drenched in his won blood.  Glazed.

	ON ELLY, as she finally gets the duct tape off her mouth, trying
	to get to Eric.  She flails and cries out.

				ELLY
		Don't let me fall!

	CLOSE-UP -- their hands finally meet and GRASP TIGHT.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (LATER) (RAIN)

	A low angle TRACKING SHOT (as when we first met Elly).

	Eric's and Elly's feet pass graves.  Eric's pace is slow, crippled, 
	limping.  They STOP at a grave where elly BENDS INTO FRAME to steal 
	the flowers there.

	Eric is bloody and out of it.  She helps him walk.

				ELLY
		Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.

				ERIC
		In a better place.  I hope.

				ELLY
		You're not gonna come back, are you?

	Eric's response is halting and uncertain.  But he tries to give
	her hope.  He reaches for Shelly's ring around her neck, holds
	it up to her.

				ERIC
		I don't know if I can.  But you
		have this... and you know where to come.

				ELLY
		You mean you'll, like' dig your way
		out of the grave?  Euww.

	Eric is amused by this in spite of his grievous injuries.

	He grasps Elly's face in his hands and bends, painfully,to kiss
	her on the forehead.

				ERIC
		For you, I'll try.  Promise.

	MOVE WITH ERIC

	Spent, empty, he holds the rose determinedly, but he's never
	going to make it the few yards back to his own grave.  So close.

	His legs finally go and he collapses onto the humus.  One
	groping hand tries to drag him further.

				ERIC
		Leave me now.

	ANGLE - ELLY

	Tears on her face.  She can't watch this.  She TURNS and drops
	the flowers on Shelly's grave.

	ERIC'S POV - HIS OWN GRAVE

	Still too far away to matter.

	RESUME ERIC ON GROUND

	He gives it up, his face sinking into the wet grass for a beat
	before SHELLY'S HAND intrudes INTO FRAME to GRASP his hand.

	No ethereal glow, no heavenly choir... just a near-dead Eric's
	blank-faced astonishment, and he moves forward.

	ANGLE - ELLY - SHELLY'S GRAVE BG

	She struggles to get her hood up against the rain and roughly
	wipes the moisture from her face with her sleeve.  She turns
	toward Eric's grave.  Then, surprised, she looks close.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S GRAVE

	Eric is gone.  The white rose lies neatly on the top of the
	undisturbed  earth there.

	HIGH ANGLE - CEMETERY

	Emphasizing that Elly is now ALONE in the graveyard.

	LOW ANGLE on Elly, ROSE in the foreground --

	She walks OFF.  HOLD the rose.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY (OVERCAST)

	A grey day but no rain.  Elly stands wistfully by the window,
	her doll on standby.  The apartment is in order and perhaps we
	notice a few new items.  Gabriel the cat, miraculously ALIVE, is
	sprawled on a chair, licking himself.  Darla BUSTLES INTO FRAME
	B.G.  Her wardrobe more upscale, her hair done.  Her manner is
	hectic but natural.

				DARLA
		Worktime, kiddo.  First day, new
		job, gotta go.

	This does not get the expected smile from Elly.

				DARLA (CONT'D)
		You sure you're gonna be okay?

	Elly turns from the window and NODS silently.

	ELLY'S POV - OUTSIDE

	The aforementioned grey day in the city.

	ANGLE - DARLA AND ELLY AT THE WINDOW.

	Darla comes up.  Arm around Elly.  Cheer up; he attitude much
	more connected and loving.  PUSH IN ON ELLY so we know she is
	clutching SHelly's ring tightly in her hand.  Darla looks past
	Elly, out the window.

				DARLA
		At least it finally stopped
		raining.

				ELLY
		It can't rain all the time.

	Darla kisses Elly on the temple and it out the door.  Elly OPENS
	her hand to consider the ring.  She looks back out the window --

	ANGLE - THE CROW ON THE LEDGE

	Elly is looking right at it.  Same crow.  We're positive.  So is
	Elly.  It TAKES WING and flies away.

	EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

	An UP ANGLE from Eric's grave toward the tree as the crow FLIES
	INTO FRAME and perches there, shucking water.  PUSH IN on the
	crow.  Watching.  Waiting.

	TIGHT ANGLE - FRESH GRAVE

	As a spade smooths the walls of a new double-decker plot.

				DIMITRI (O.S.)

	ANGLE - DIMITRI AND ALEXI

	TWO GRAVEDIGGERS.  Scoop digger parked f.g. towering gothic-

				ALEXI
		Snow, maybe?

				DIMITRI
		What, you gonna ski on this?

	He indicates the mound of fresh dirt.  Spits into the grave.

				DIMITRI (CONT'D)
		Come on, let's bag this.  It's
		beer time.

	Alexi nods and unfurls the tarp over the dirt.

	LOW ANGLE TRACKING SHOT - FLOWERS ON GRAVES

	As we MOVE alongside a pair of canvas-sided combat boots, as the 
	wearer collects the most lively flowers from each grave in 
	sequence.

	TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

	Cemetery DEFOCUSED b.g.  Large, glossy-black, the bird follows
	the arc of movement in the previous shot.  Ruffles its feathers
	as it begins to sprinkle rain.

	ANGLE - ELLY - RESUMING HER MOTION

	A dirty-blondish tenement KID of eleven, clad in a blend of cast-
	offs and hand-me-downs; her version of street punk chic.  She
	totes a skateboard under one arm (itself a berserk Jackson
	Pollock chaos of band stickers, silver marker and graffiti, with
	day-glo wheels), and transfers her impromptu bouquet so she may
	unzip a flap and hike up a ragged hood against the rain.  She 
	stops to watch the grave diggers pack up and EXIT b.g.

				ELLY
		Guess the picnic got rained out.

	She looks down o.s. at --

	ANGLE - SHELLY WEBSTER'S GRAVE

	as Elly places the gathered flowers down.  Almost reverent.

	RESUME CROW ANGLE - ELLY B.G.

	as Elly takes a single white rose and places it atop the grave
	near Shelly Webster's.

	ANGLE ON GRAVE - AS ELLY LEAVES

	TILT UP from rose to the name: ERIC DRAVEN. Rain spatters the 
	granite, darkening it.

	EXTREME CLOSE-UP - CROW's EYE

	It blinks in its alien way.

	WITH THE CROW

	as it takes wing from it's unseen perch.  Lands stop Eric's
	headstone.  It pecks tentatively at the top of the monument.

	ANGLE - ELLY NEAR ERIC'S GRAVE

	She hasn't gotten too far before she notices the bird.

				ELLY
		Oh, scary.

	The bird blinks at her from the headstone.
				ELLY
		What are you, like, the night
		watchman?

	Another blink from El Birdo.

	CAMERA WITH ELLY -  BOOMING BACK HIGH

	as she exits the iron gates of the cemetery without looking
	back.  Brutal building facades, like dead eyes, and bad
	alleyways, like hungry mouths, are gradually revealed as we
	continue PULLING BACK to unveil that the cemetery is smack in
	the middle of the city.

	EXT. MAXI-DOGS - TWILIGHT - RAIN CONTINUES

	CLOSE-UP of a foot-long hot dog being drowned in mustard.

				MICKEY (O.S.)
		What this place needs is a good
		natural catastrophe.  Earthquake,
		tornado...

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND MICKEY

	ALBRECHT is a black beat cop, 35, in a rain slicker.

	MICKEY is the grease-aproned entrepreneur of MAXI DOGS, a steamy
	open-front fast foodery.

				ALBRECHT
		You gotta put the mustard
		underneath first.

				MICKEY
		Maybe a flood, like in the Bible.

				ALBRECHT
		Here, let me do it.

	He grabs the dog from Mickey.  Mickey puffs his cigar while he
	cooks.  Albrecht methodically spreads a napkin and performs
	surgery on the hot dog, coating the bun with mustard, rolling
	the dog in the bun.  Flashes Mickey a "gimme" look. 

				ALBRECHT
		Come on... onion.  Don't cheap
		out on me.  Lotta onions.

	MOVING ANGLE - AS ELLY SKATEBOARDS TOWARDS MAXI DOGS

				MICKEY
		Heyyy -- it's the Elly monster.

				ALBRECHT
		How do you ride that thing on a 
		wet street?

				ELLY
		Talent. Hi.

				ALBRECHT
		Care for a hot dog?

				ELLY
		You buying?

				ALBRECHT
		I'm buying.

	Elly grabs the stool next to Albrecht.  They`ve done this routine before.

				ELLY
		No onions though, okay?

				ALBRECHT
			(horror)
		No onions?

				ELLY
		They make you fart.

	Mickey laughs.  Spots Elly a Coke.

				MICKEY
		What's goin' on, Elly?

				ELLY
		I went to see a friend of mine.

				MICKEY
		Well, how's your friend?

				ELLY
		She's still dead.

	Albrecht and Mickey exchange a look re:  Elly's matter-of-
	factness.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (RAIN)

	Thunder KABOOMS o.s.  The crow pecks the top of the stone again
	and a chip of granite flies off, bang!

	EXTREME CLOSE - THE HEADSTONE

	as the crow pecks again and draws blood from the rock.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	A dot of blood on its ebony beak.

	LOW ANGLE - HEADSTONE

	A thin, watery trickle of blood wanders from the top of the
	stone towards the earth.  Rain does not interfere.  Lightning
	plays in the rolling cloud cover, b.g.

	RESUME THE CROW

	as it takes off from the gravestone, into the rain.

	CLOSE-UP - THE BLOOD

	It slowly fills the name Eric Draven into the rock.

	CLOSE-UP - FOOT TAPPER

	A LOW ANGLE like the SHOT introducing Elly's boot.  This time
	we see cowboy boots, leather chaps.  The foot taps.  Waiting.

	MEDIUM ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER

	as lightning strikes.  Just enough for us to see a figure in a 
	long duster and a cowboy hat.

	RESUME ERIC'S HEADSTONE

	DRAVEN fills with blood.  Blood continues groundward.

	NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER

	Turning to meet FRAME as the crow alights on his outstretched 
	arm.  This is the SKULL COWBOY.  We glimpse the deathshead,
	beneath the brim of the cowboy hat.

	RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE

	as blood trickles into the turf at the base of the grave.

	TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

	shaking off rain.  Watching intently.

	CLOSE-UP - THE SKULL COWBOY'S FREE HAND

	Black gloved.  It walks a flat silver throwing knife across it's
	knuckles, like a quarter somersaulting.

	RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE

	The turf stirs beneath the white rose.  Magically, a slim white
	parts the earth to grasp the rose.

	SKULL COWBOY POV - ERIC's GRAVE

	as the figure of Eric Draven stands up from behind his own
	headstone.

	LOW ANGLE (FROM GRAVE) - ERIC

	Pale.  Clad in cerements: cheap black burial suit, slit open in 
	back.  WHite shirt.  A nothing tie.  No shoes.  Rain sluices mud
	from his upturned face.  He looks to the sky.  Lightning.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - FOLLOW ERIC

	as he weaves to lean against a nearby tree.  Looks o.s.

	ERIC's POV - THE SKULL COWBOY

	water-blurred, through the rain, standing with the crow perched
	on his arm like a hunting falcon.  He releases it and it flies
	to the tree.

	ANGLE -  ERIC

	Watching this.  Wipes mud from his eyes, tries to clear vision.
	The crow lights in the tree and they meet eye-to-eye.  Eric
	looks back o.s. and we RACK to include the Skull Cowboy.

				ERIC
		What the hell are you?

				SKULL COWBOY
		Interested?  Follow the crow.

	NB.  The Skull Cowboy speaks in nicely distorted, buzzlike
	charnal house whisper.  Unsettling and hackle-raising.

	Eric turns back to the bird, which takes wing in the rain, His
	eyes follow it.  He looks back, disoriented, doubtful, but the 
	Skull Cowboy is gone.

	LOW DEEP ANGLE - THE CROW

	Taking wing in the rain, showing the way.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC

	alone in the cemetery.  After a moments hesitation, he lurches
	off, following the crow.

	EXT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH:

	A candy-flaked muscle T-bird is parked at the curb.

	INT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT

	A MOVING SHOT during o.s. lines.  Past dead video and pinball
	devices.  Pasta desk with an open briefcase, coffee cup,
	ashtray -- someone was just there.  Then past a WOMAN, trussed
	with duct tape to her office chair, gagged, hot fear in her 
	darting eyes.

	COMPLETE CAMERA MOVE to include SKANK, a blade-thin speed freak 
	with pattern baldness, always loud, jittery, a manic dust puppy.
	And T-BIRD, an arrogant Arayan, brush-cut iron pumper, who is
	prepping an incendiary.  He exhibits a small squeeze bottle of
	arson cocktail to Skank.

				T-BIRD
		Uncle T-Bird's 100-proof
		accelerator.  I squirt you with
		this, you could jump in the 
		Detroit river and burn all the way

	INSERT A CLOSE-UP of the bomb in his hands as he works.  Silver
	canisters, an LED timer, wires.

				T-BIRD (CONT'D)
		You know, Lake Erie actually
		caught on fire once, from all the
		crap in it.  Wish I coulda seen
		that.

	He CLICKS a switch.  PEEP.  LED countdown blurs.

				T-BIRD (CONT'D)
		We're ready to rock.

	Skank notices the captive woman's handbag on the floor.  Picks
	it up.  Looks through it for valuables.

				SKANK
		What about working girl?

	INTERCUT the woman's increasingly horrified reactions.

				T-BIRD
		What about her?

				SKANK
		I say we leave her here to fry,

	T-Bird looks casually at the woman.  Smiles hideously.

				T-BIRD
		No.  Let's take her with us.

	ANGLE - THE WOMAN

	Her eyes bug in a terrified NO!

	EXT. STREET - MOVING - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird fishtails wildly around the corner and eats street.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

	TB drives.  One eye on his digital watch (doing an equally
	fast countdown).  Skank wrestles their captive, the woman, in
	the back seat.

				TB
			(pissed off)
		Skank, shut her the fuck up!

	SKank punches her and she sags.  Then he looks forward.

				SKANK
		Whoaaa -- T-Bird, red light, red

	EXT. STREET CORNER NEAR MAXI-DOGS - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird slews wide, cutting sidewalk, scattering
	nightwalkers, immediately attracting everybody's attention.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT - AT MAXI-DOGS

	Reacting, with a mouthful.

				ALBRECHT
		Goddammit.

	Mickey grabs the counter phone instantly.

				MICKEY
		Call it in?

	Albrecht is off and running for the corner already.

				ALBRECHT
		Yeah, do it!

		Stay right there!

	EXT. MOUTH OF ALLEY ACROSS FROM CEMETERY - NIGHT

	The car slides to a nose-down panic stop.

				SKANK (O.S.)
		Dump her, man, dump her!

	The woman comes tumbling from the car, which blasts off with a
	war hoop from the guys inside.

	ANGLE - CORNER - ON ALBRECHT

	Gun out, hauling ass on wet pavement.  Aims at the departing
	car.  Gives it up.  Still too far away.  Pedestrians in the way.

	ANGLE - THE WOMAN

	hurting, cut, bleeding, tottering toward the dumpster.  Duct tape 
	stuck to her face but cut away around her mouth.  With her as
	she falls into the alley darkness... straight into the arms of

	CLOSE TWO-SHOT - ERIC AND THE WOMAN

	Their eyes lock.  Eric stiffens with his first FLASH.

	NB:  Eric's flashes of past memory are conditioned by the nature
	of things with which he makes physical contact.  Hints and
	fragments in fierce, super-saturated COLOR.  Puzzle pieces he
	must assemble.  Each flash keynoted by a BLOWBACK NOISE and 
	accompanied by a degree of pain.  It hurts to remember.

	FLASH:  INT. T-BIRD - WOMAN'S STRUGGLE

	The faces of Skank and T-Bird are murky, ephemeral, their voices
	hideous, distorted echoes.  A knife snaps open.  We see the 
	blade.  Blood.  Skank hits her, pow! and --

				FLASH ENDS.

	An airborne crow POV spiralling up and away from them.

	perched on a fire escape, high above, watching and waiting.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AND WOMAN

	She fades.  He lets her drop away, horrified.  And staggers back
	into the cover of the alley.  Her blood is on his hands.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT RUNNING

	Skidding in, spotting the woman.  Kneeling to her.

				ALBRECHT
		Here now!  You're gonna be okay!
		Can you understand me?  I'm a

	The woman is no longer in pain.  Deathly calm now.

	Her eyes roll back and she dies in Albrecht's arms.

	HIGH ANGLE CROW POV - THE ALLEY

	BOOMING BACK from Albrecht, the woman, onlookers, as police
	units screech up to assist.

	EXT. ALLEY BEHIND ARCADES GAMES SUPPLY HOUSE - ON ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric in lurching flight, panting.  Stops and steadies against
	the wall across from the backside of Arcade Games.

	ANGLE - THE CROW (FLYING)

	Circling, then lighting on the fire escape above Eric.

	BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES - ("CROWVISION")

	"CROWVISION" is what the crow "gives" Eric to see.  Visually 
	distinct and immediately identifiable.

	ERIC'S POV - BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES

	Which he's already seen through the crow's eyes.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	looking up at the crow.  Disoriented.  Doesn't understand.
	Suddenly he cottons, and covers his eyes just in time to shield
	from:

	ANGLE - BACK OF ARCADE GAMES

	The rear windows EXPLODING outward in a spray of fire and
	debris.

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC

	he reels back, crashes into a dumpster.  Falls.

	ANGLE - THE CROW

	landing on the dumpsters edge near a pair of discarded combat
	boots in the trash.  Flames.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC

	The blood from his hands mars his burial shirt.  He tears the
	shirt away, leaving his tie absurdly intact.  Wipes his face
	with his shirt.  Discards it.  Stops, held by his discovery --

	PUSH IN ON ERIC

	as his fingers explore the five puckered bullet punctures in his
	chest.  Almost a circle.  Comically, he feels his back foe exit
	wounds.  Then hauls himself upright, coming level with the crow.
	His glance at the bird is almost accusatory.

	ANGLE - THe CROW

	Inscrutable.  We should get the idea that some silent
	communication is taking place.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S FEET 

	bare, muddied, frozen.  TILT to Eric.  His gaze moves from the
	crow to the boots in the trash.  He grabs them, pushes them onto
	his bare feet.  His eyes catch the firelight.  Distant o.s.
	SIRENS

				ERIC
		Fire.  In the rain.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT

	We are now within the neon techno-depths of Club Trash.  The BG
	music is hard, savage, primal:  a doom-laden Radio Werewolf band
	rules.  Cabaret Blitzkrieg, packed with Death-to-Yup
	trendazoids.  We'll see more of this circus later.  Right now
	the BG SOUND is our biggest clue to the flavor of this
	establishment since we are --

	TIGHT CLOSE-UP A FRAMED 8X10

	Thinly filmed in dust, mounted among dozens of other band shots.
	Visible among the posed members of a group called Diabolique is
	Eric, wielding guitar on the club stage.  ND BLUR as people 
	CROSS FRAME.

	GRANGE, 45-50, powerful, a seasoned assassin, cruel but loyal.
	His facade remains stony as he leads three other men briskly
	down the corridor.:  NGO NWA, 50ish, clad Chinese gangster style
	- white topcoat, white scarf, tinted shades - and two body guards
	supplying a power perimeter around him,lean, dark-haired Asian
	killers who would gladly die for Ngo Nwa, which they will in 
	just a minute.

	They have just passed the Diabolique 8X10.  Ngo Nwa's gloved
	fingers, in passing, leave little skid tracks in the dust that
	clear the eyes of Eric in the photo.

	As the foursome reaches the DOOR, Grange turns doubtfully -- 
	suspiciously -- to Nwa.

				NGO NWA
		He will see me... unannounced.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE DOOR

	As Grange keys in the enter code the door hisses open.  Without
	a word, Nwa passes inside and the door is pulled shut in
	Grange's face by the Bodyguards, who post themselves to either
	side.

	INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	The door CLOSES and the BG NOISE is GONE.  Through a large window
	(mirrored on the club side) all sorts of activity is visible
	through automatic mini-blinds.  A fly-vision bank of 12 TV
	monitors is hot with surveillance.

	LAO, a painfully clean-cut, Armani-clad Asian, impeccable,
	almost dashing, but the dynamic here is crystal clear: Nwa is
	the King: Lao, the dark prince in this hierarchy.

	At the desk, Lao is startled from his contemplation of a tiny,
	perfect rat skeleton by Ngo Nwa's unheralded entry.  The desktop
	is bare except for and Arcane Vietnamese fighting knife, half a
	meter long with an ideogrammed blade, dramatically positioned
	beneath an Artemide lamp.  Lao rises and feigns servility.

	NB:  The following exchange will play FAST, and entirely in
	VIETNAMESE.

				LAO
		(formal greeting)

				NWA
		(dismissiveness, contempt, then
		chastizing anger as:)

	Nwa INDICATES the blade with some ridicule.

				LAO
		(phony assuagement)

				NWA
		(knows it's bullshit)

	Lao turns, staring out the blinds, fighting for control.  Deep
	breath.  He turns back to his "master."  Nwa gestures broadly at
	the oppulent office, indicating that Lao should be grateful, but 
	is somehow errant
	 
				NWA
		(respect is required)

				LAO
		(begrudging agreement)

	Lao sees the blade.  An idea.  He lifts it reverently, bears it
	the Nwa hilt-first in both hands, as if bestowing a thing of
	immeasurable worth.

				NGO NWA
		(why give me this?)

	Nonetheless, Nwa accepts the blade.  It gleams.  Hypnotic. Even
	Nwa has to admire it.  Turns it so the blade is pointed at his
	sternum.  His attitude indicates Lao is too far away to do
	anything untoward.

				LAO
		(sinister punchline)

	Lao spins through the air and HEEL-KICKS the blade THROUGH Nwa's
	chest, pinning him to the door.  It's over so fast the gasp of
	astonishment never escapes Nwa.  Lao is much more than merely 
	treacherous, he is extremely capable.

				LAO
			(in perfect English)
		When I spoke of an offering, I
		didn't mean an offering to you.

	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

	Grange, standing out of arm's reach in the corridor, kills both
	Bodyguards with a double headshot as they turn in greeting as the
	door OPENS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR - LAO, GRANGE, AND CORPSES

	Lao exchanges a look with his right arm; Grange nods
	affirmatively.

				GRANGE
		You gonna smoke his bones now, or
		however it is you do it?

	Lao smiles indulgently.  He wipes the blood from the blade on
	the jacket of his ex-lord.  Lao now bows to no one. 

	EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - ANOTHER ALLEY - NIGHT

	Eric, wearing the combat boots, climbs as the crow leads him.
	Up.  He jams his hand on a rusty wedge of metal.  Ouch.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM

	Blood flows from the gash.  He vises his fist shut.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE

	Eye-to-eye with the crow.  Opens his hand.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM

	The blood flows back into the wound, which closes itself, 
	leaving another scar.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Vising the rail.  Speaks to the night.  Almost a mantra.

				ERIC
		"My kitten walks on velvet feet,
		and makes no sound at all.  And in
		the doorway nightly sits to watch
		the darkness fall.  I think
		he loves the lady night..."
			(to crow)
		Am I alive?  Am I dead?  Something
		else?  Something in between?

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	Inscrutable.  No answer here.

	RESUME ERIC

	Almost bemused.  Steadier.  A hint of friendliness.

				ERIC
		Thanks for sharing that.

	ETC. GIDEON`S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird grumbles tp park curbside.  Menacing.

	INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	A junkyard of loot and dusty discards.  Junkie thievings and
	other people's stereos.  Behind a wire-meshed security counter
	GIDEON reads a racing form, chain-smoking throughout the scene.  He
	is pear-shaped, stubbled, unkempt.  Food on his shirt.  JINGLE
	of doorbells.  Gideon lowers his paper to reveal Skank and
	T-Bird on approach.

				GIDEON
		Ahhh, jesus, the creatures of the 
		night, here they come.  Tweedledum
		and Tweedledummer.

	Skank riles

				SKANK
		Hey, blow me, fat boy!

	Just as quick, Gideon cocks and levels a Magnum at Skank.

				GIDEON
		Blow yourself, bigmouth.

				T-BIRD
			(interposing)
		Whoa, hey, whoa.
			(hands up)
		Business.

	He lifts a small carton onto the counter.

				GIDEON
		Whatcha got?

	NEW ANGLE - COUNTER

	Transaction time.  T-Bird passes items through the screen slot 
	and Gideon gives each one cursory, doubtful inspection.

				T-BIRD
		Coupla more rings... 24k.

				GIDEON
		18k.  Crap.

				T-BIRD
		...necklace... pearls...

				GIDEON
		Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,

				T-BIRD
		Leather purse...

	He hands though the bag rested from the woman.

				GIDEON
		What's this -- a little, ah,
		bloodstain, right?
			(doesn't matter)
		Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm
		doin' you a --

				T-BIRD
		Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a 
		favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.

				SKANK
		You wouldn't want Top Dollar not 
		to smile.

	Mention of Top Dollar clams Gideon efficiently up.  He hands
	over the cash to T-Bird with a grimace.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - ON ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric stares upward at the crow as it drops like a bomber from
	the night sky, flying past him, skimming the roof, leading him
	on.  Eric exhales, shrugs, feeling mocked by the bird.

				ERIC
		All right.

	And he takes off on a run.  Only to stumble and fall.  But the
	falls turns into a TUMBLING ROLL that lands Eric back on his feet
	still moving.  He looks back as if to ask: "Did I do that?" and
	runs out of the frame.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON THE RUN.

	as he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up.
	TRACK WITH HIM to the edge of the roof, heavily misted in rain.

	He jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof.  The next 
	roof-top is a one-story jump down.  Eric clears the jump with a
	WOOF of air.  Keeping his eyes on the flying crow; gaining
	strength.  His next leap is more like a broad-jump.  Athletic.

	FAST MOVING ANGLE - THE CROW

	keeping airborne, keeping ahead.

	MOVING ANGLE - ERIC

	Eyes confidently on the sky as he arches out into space...

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - BUILDINGS

	As Eric is seen to jump across the gap at least three stories up
	where there is no connecting building.

	CLOSE ANGLE - TARGET BUILDING LEDGE

	as Eric smashes into it, just missing, hinging at the waist,
	grabbing for purchase, suddenly panicked, gravity pulling him 
	downward.

	ANGLE - AT ERIC FROM PHONE CABLE BRACKET

	Eric falls but manages to grab the bracket one-handed.  He hangs
	for another deadly moment, then slowly, to his own astonishment,
	executes a one-handed pull-up that will save his ass.
				ERIC
		Gotcha.

	He completes the pull-up, bringing his chin level with the 
	ledge.  As he reaches for it with his other hand the bracket
	rips from the wall and Eric plummets, with a howl of defeat.

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S DOWNFALL

	It's a looooooong way down.

	ANGLE - ALLEYWAY

	as Eric lands and splits a trash can in two.  A beat as we wonder
	if any bones are left unpulped.  PUSH IN as Eric rolls from
	facedown to his back.

	TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE

	as he completes the roll, gasping, amazed he's still in one 
	piece.

	ANGLE - TRASHCAN - ON THE CROW

	It flies easily down to inspect Eric as he slowly sits up,
	examining his hands.  Frustrated and pissed off.

				ERIC
		Thanks.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	Not "your welcome", but other-worldly patience.  It waits.

	RESUME ERIC

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Where're we going next -- the
		sewer?

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Still, dark silence until Eric lands from ABOVE FRAME, feline.
	The crow lands simultaneously b.g., perched near a roof access
	door with a shaded, dim-yellow bulb.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	It just blinks at him. 

	INT. ABANDONED STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	as Eric yanks open the rusty rooftop door from the outside and
	sweeps down the steps in a swirl of night mist

	ANGLE - FOOT OF STAIRS

	Trash and detritus all around, clogging the arteries of the
	building, which is old, unoccupied, forsaken.  The crow lights
	on a scarred banister knob.  Eric's footsteps come down into frame.

	ANGLE ON LOFT DOOR - INCLUDE ERIC

	A year ago this door was sealed with police barricade tape...
	which now sags, faded.

	A sticker across the jam notifies potential trespassers that
	this is -- was -- a crime scene.  Eric slows, stops, his hand
	on the banister.

	ANGLE - THE CROW

	as is wafts ahead of Eric, arriving at the door first.

	ANGLE ON ERIC, THE DOOR, THE CROW

	Eric has had enough.

				ERIC
		Are we finished yet?

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND ON BANISTER
	sliding along, as he speaks, until it hits a cigarette burn.

	PUSH IN ON ERIC - TIGHT

	stiffening as he suffers his second --

	FLASH:  IMAGES and DIALOG are not linked.  A rapidfire MONTAGE set
	in the loft, a year earlier (it is decorated for Halloween).
	The broken door.  The stairwell is filled with cops and cop 
	noise; lab guys bustle.  Albrecht is there, making notes as a
	DETECTIVE steps over to him.

				ALBRECHT
		Victim's name is Shelly Webster.
		The guy who got tossed is, uh ...--

	Albrecht grinds out his smoke on the banister.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC ON THE STAIRS.

	He sits down hard, hurting from the flash.  His eyes seek the 
	crow.  He completes Albrecht's line:

				ERIC
		"Draven, Eric."

	EXT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	LOW DOLLY of Elly's little combat boots moving toward the
	entryway of the pit.  MUSIC gradually UP LOUDER O.s. as she
	nears.

	ANGLE - ELLY IN DOORWAY

	Luridly-lit.  A grown-up's place.  A burly BOUNCER appraises
	her, his tone jokey.  He knows Elly.

				BOUNCER
		Hey!  You got any ID?

				ELLY
		Very funny.  Ha.  Ha.  Oh my,
		sides.

	The Bouncer jerks a thumb.  Go on in. 

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	A grungy sawdust-floored shot-and-beer joint packed tight
	with urban BURNOUTS rushing to drink their lives away.  Hammering
	MUSIC and rude whorehouse lighting.  Each predator straining to
	be badder than the next.

	TRACK THROUGH this maze at Elly's eye level until we reach 
	DARLA, waitressing her heart out, the drug mileage on her 
	obvious.

				ELLY
		Mom --?

				DARLA
		I told you you're not supposed
		to come in here.

				ELLY
			(a quick lie)
		I lost my key.

	Disgustedly -- goddamn kids -- Darla fishes up a key and slaps
	it into Elly's hand.

				FUNBOY (O.S.)
		Hey, Darla -- before we die of old
		age, how about it --?

				DARLA
			(to Elly)
		Out.  Now.  I gotta work.

	RACK PAST Darla and MOVE IN CLOSE on a corner table -- where sit
	Funboy, Skank, T-Bird and a black, vested muscle gypsy, TIN-TIN. 

	INT. LOFT - NIGHT

	As Eric shoves the door open from the outside.  The lock, popped
	from the frame, spins on the wooden floor.  The barrier tape
	whisps and dust roils.  Dark, chilly, damp.  A rat's nest of
	disuse.

	PULL BACK THROUGH THE BROKEN PICTURE WINDOW

	as Eric enters.  Glass blown out.  Shards poking.  Jagged.

	NEW ANGLE - AS ERIC WALKS IN

	He scans the loft.  Sees reflecting golden eyes near the floor.

	ERIC'S POV - FLOOR NEAR WINDOW

	A white, long-haired cat walks into a pool of night light.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND THE CAT

	He kneels.  Extends his hand.  The cat nears; likes Eric.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND.

	as the cat makes contact.  Sudden white jolt - a FLASH.

	FLASH:  we HEAR Eric strumming his Strat o.s.  We see what he
	saw:  Shelly, holding the cat.

							FLASH ENDS.

	UP ANGLE - ERIC

	Wincing.  Recovering from the flash.  He purposefully gathers
	the cat into his arms and braces for more, harder, stronger...

	FLASH:  A MAN and a WOMAN make love on a big bed amidst a hundred
	points of candlelight.  Shelly and Eric, once upon a time.

							FLASH ENDS.

	REVERSE ANGLE FROM BEDROOM DOOR - ON ERIC

	as the cat, dropped, hits the floor and scrambles out of the way.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	vising his head, teary-eyed, his nose bleeding.

				ERIC
		No!  Don't look!  No! No!

	He whirls unexpectedly and punches his fist completely through
	the masonry wall.
	FLASH:  Eric and Shelly in a mock waltz.  He spins her and they
	collapse on the bed.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	slowly pulling his arm out of the wall.

				ERIC
			(whispering)
		Stop it.

	His eyes roll up and he slumps the length of the door frame like
	a drowning man.

	ANGLE - GABRIEL

	watching Eric.  He hits with an o.s. THUD.

	INT. THE PIT - ON FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT

	As a gloved hand sets up four bullets next to four shots.

				FUNBOY (O.S.)
		Let's have some fun.

	Funboy pops the bullet, like a contact capsule and washes it down.
	T-Bird turns to Tin-Tin, the new guy.

				T-BIRD	You first.

				TIN-TIN
		You're outta your fuckin' mind.

	Into it, almost jazzed, Tin-Tin downs his bullet and shot, and
	T-Bird does likewise.  Points to Skank.

				T-BIRD
		No.  I'm not the lunatic.  He is.

	Skank riles, pulls a huge Auto Mag and sticks it in T-Bird's
	face, cocking.

				SKANK
		Fuck you, T-Bird.

	Just as lightning fast, T-Bird has his own gun out and jammed
	right under Skank's jawbone.  He makes a kissy face.

				T-BIRD
		I love you too, you madman.

	They all crack up laughing like ax murderers.  Skank drinks,
	Tin-Tin spot checks the satchell from Top Dollar's.  Darla
	delivers more shots and funboy feels her ass.

				FUNBOY
		Hey, pussycat.

	INT. LOFT - DOWN ANGLE (CROW POV) - ERIC ON FLOOR

	He's awake.  Pushes himself up.

	REVERSE ANGLE - THE CROW

	Is perched in a dead light fixture, monitoring Eric.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON FLOOR

	He's awake.  Pushes himself up.  Realizes he is in the center of a 
	faint chalk outline on the hardwood floor.  He reaches to touch
	the dark stain of old blood.

	FLASH:  Shelly spills into frame, mouth bloodied.  T-Bird
	instantly on top of her, rough.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC

	as he abandons the outline and staggers to the window... where
	he cuts open his hand on jags of glass.

	FLASH:  Eric held firm in the grasp of T-Bird and Funboy, one
	arm each.  Five bloody bullet holes in Eric's chest.

	The thugs 1-2-3 and hurl Eric backwards through the window,
	which shatters.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - ERIC AT THE WINDOW

	Reeling backward, same trajectory as in the Flash, but toward
	the floor, in SLO-MO.  Overloaded.  Blacking out.

	AS ERIC FALLS - INTERCUT MONTAGE

	A jumble of good/bad images from the loft:  Tin-Tin embedding a
	page of paper in the loft wall with a throwing knife...
	Shelly's face as she lights a candle... a POPPING champagne
	cork... the echoing CANNONADE of the shots that killed Eric...
	Skank backhanding Shelly... Shelly blowing bubbles from a
	clawfoot tub full of suds... Eric catching Funboy's first slug 
	high in the chest... NEW ANGLE of the glass in the window
	blowing out as T-Bird and Funboy through Eric through...

	ANGLE - ERIC'S REAL TIME FALL

	He plummets to BLACK OUT FRAME.  THUMP.  Out cold.

	INT. PIT - RESUMING FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT

	Funboy contemplates his drink as the previous scene reverbs.

				FUNBOY
		More fun than a torture chamber.

	Tin-Tin's pocket pager goes BEEP and startles them all.  Skank
	nearly shoots it, jumpy.  Tin-Tin pulls back on a black leather 
	trenchcoat after clicking off the pager.

				TIN-TIN
		I hate this goddamn thing...

	ANGLE - DARLA watching them from a distance as Tin exits.

	INT. LOFT - FLOOR LEVEL - NIGHT

	An enormous cockroach trundles past, large in FRAME.  RACK to
	show Eric lying on floor b.g. as his eyes pop open.  A flurry of
	dark motion as the crow flies past frame.

	ANGLE -- THE CROW -- Having snatched the bug in it's beak.  Eats
	it.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	rising from the floor.  Careful.  Stealthy.  Watches his fireplace.

				ERIC
		We have company.

	ANGLE ON FIREPLACE

	Huge.  Marble.  COld.  Eric's paper mache masks of Comedy and
	Tragedy still hang there.  The Skull Cowboy steps out of the
	dark and into the vague blue light.  Shadowy as ever.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Having fun yet?  No?
			(beat)
		I'll give you a hint.  Remember
		whatshername?

				ERIC
		Shelly?

				SKULL COWBOY
		Miss her?

				ERIC
		Yes.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Kill the men who killed you both,
		and the Day of the Dead will be
		your reunion.

	The Skull Cowboy prestidigitates a flat throwing knife(like Tin-
	Tin's).  Eric's gaze follow it closely.

				SKULL COWBOY (CONT'D)
		You must use your eyes.

	He points to the crow.

	ANGLE - THE COMING KNIFE - ("CROWVISION")

	Weirdly distorted, a shared vision between Eric and the crow.

	TIGHT ON ERIC

	As he DUCKS out of the path of the knife he sees through the
	bird's eyes.  He rolls.

	ON THE CROW

	It hops out of the way as the knife embeds in the wall.  Eric's
	ROLL finishes him up nearby.

				ERIC
		Goddammit.

	He grabs for the knife as if to use it on the Skull Cowboy, but
	the knife causes an unexpected painful FLASH.

	FLASH:  Eric bouncing off the bedroom doorframe, Tin-Tin's knife
	stuck in his shoulder.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC

	vising his head with his hands, in pain.  Too much pain.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Get it?

				ERIC
		Leave me alone -- !

	He looks up, the Skull Cowboy is still there.

				SKULL COWBOY
			(contempt)
		Do something about it.
	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND THE SKULL COWBOY.

	A horrible beat between them.  The Eric runs full tilt across
	the room, bounding to the open window and then leaping.

	ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY

	as close to surprise as he gets.  Steps out to watch as --

	ANGLE ON WINDOW - ERIC

	FLIES feet first out into space.

	CLOSE-UP - BRICKWORK ABOVE WINDOWFRAME

	Eric's fingers smash into grip the tiny mortared gaps!

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING - UP ANGLE FROM STREET - NIGHT

	High above, Eric's feet shoot out the window, knocking loose
	stray shards that fall toward frame.  He swings into an upside-
	down pose, impossibly holding himself rigid against the
	building's side, face down. by his quarter-inch finger grip.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	Every muscle rigid, quivering with tension.  Hold.  Then he
	relaxes, and swings back inside.

	INT. LOFT - AT WINDOW, PICKING UP ERIC - NIGHT

	He arches, flips, to land on his feet.  The Skull Cowboy is
	gone.  No knife either.  The crow watches.  O.S. "meow".

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC AS HE TURNS TO SEE THE CAT

				ERIC
		I guess I'm not ready to leave...
		just yet.

	He picks up the cat -- wary of flashes, which don't come this
	time -- and returns to the window.  Feeling safer.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		The last time we saw each other,
		I didn't do so well.
			(holds cat up)
		Huh, Gabriel?

	He moves to the fireplace.  With his free hand, lifts the
	Tragedy mask off its hook.  Puzzles it, fact-to-mask.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I bet you need some cat food...
		right?

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT -ESTABLISHING:

	Eric walking, the Tragedy mask hanging from his hip.  An
	occasional PEDESTRIAN passes without comment, brutalized
	by the city.  Eric, more confident, smells the night's bouquet.

	EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT ("CROWVISION")

	Two men around a trashcan fire.  We should recognize Tin-Tin by 
	his black leather trench coat.  A wonderfully rude Rap tune, "Got
	a White WOman Tied Up In My Closet, Gonna Jab Her With A Stick,"
	RAZZLES b.g.

	EXT. STREET - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

	As Eric reacts to what the crow has just seen.  Slows.  Stops.
	And directs his attention toward the mouth of the alley.

	EXT. ALLEY - TIGHT ON TIN-TIN - NIGHT

	He pulls the nickel plated revolver from the satchel.  FOLLOW as
	he hands it across to RATSO, who removes the suitcase-sized boom 
	box (the source of the music) from his shoulder to accept.
	Ratso is a feral skull-head; street trash.

				TIN-TIN
		Three hundred and your a 
		gunslinger.

	HIGH ANGLE - TIN-TIN and RATSO

	As the crow is still watching, yet perched.  A brief
	shove-and-standoff.  The gun deal has gone bad.

				RATSO
		Please, TIn-Tin, you know I'm good
		for the money, man, I promise,
		Leslie put me up to it, please,
		man, don't --
			(choking scream)

	Tin-Tin has just up-rammed a throwing knife into Ratso.

				TIN-TIN
		Ratty -- shut the fuck up.

	Tin-Tin lifts Ratso on the knife, gutting him.  Ratso goes
	slack, deader'n hell.  Tin-Tin reaches around to click OFF 
	the boom box... then let's Ratso`s corpse fall.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		Another satisfied customer?

	TIGHT ANGLE - TIN-TIN

	galvanized by the surprise voice.  He automatically draw a
	fresh knife from the bandolero of knives across his chest inside
	the coat.  Can't yet track the source of the voice.

				TIN-TIN
		Who the hell is that?
			(beat, venomous)
		Come on out man, I won't hurt
		you.

	ANGLE - ERIC IN ALLEY

	He steps out from behind another flaming trashcan.  Wearing a 
	long black scarf and the Tragedy mask.

				ERIC
		Hello, Tin-Tin.

	ANGLE ON TIN-TIN - AS HE RISES (FROM RATSO)

	trying to process what he sees.  And cover.  And buy time.

				TIN-TIN
		Little early from trick-or-treat,
		homie.
			(re: Ratso)
		This dick trying to bushwack me.

				ERIC
		Murderer.

	Tin-Tin blows out a breath.  No bluff.  Time to kill again.

				TIN-TIN
		Guess you got that goddamn right.

	He shrugs.  The shrug becomes the launch of a knife.

	TIGHT SHOT - MOVING - ERIC

	His black-gloved hand slaps away the incoming knife and inch from
	his nose.  It CLATTERS.  Eric continues striding toward Tin-TIn.

				ERIC
		Try harder.  Try again.

	SHIFTING ANGLE - ERIC NEARS TIN-TIN

	as Tin-TIn throws another knife.  Eric closing in.  He claps
	hand together, immobilizing the next knife.  Opens his hands,
	almost an "oops" gesture.  Keeps on coming.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND TIN-TIN

	As they meet.  Tin-Tin attempts a roundhouse.  Eric blocks it
	and smashes Tin-Tin into the alley wall.

				ERIC
		A year ago.  Halloween.  A man
		and a woman.  In a loft.  You
		helped to murder them.

				TIN-TIN
		Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...
			(beat)
		Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her
		too, I think.

				ERIC
		You cut her.  You raped her.
			(rage)
		You watched!

				TIN-TIN
		Hey, I got my rocks off, so
		fuck you in the ass, man.
		
	They're face-to-face now, sweaty and tense.  Eric peels off
	the Tragedy mask.

				ERIC
		I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.

				TIN-TIN
		I don't know you...

	But, as Eric bears down on Tin-TIn, Tin begins to recognize him.
	Fear.  Sweat.

	For the first time, Tin-Tin starts to loose control.

				TIN-TIN (CONT'D)
		Holy shit... you're dead, man...

	EXTREME CLOSE-UP - ERIC

				ERIC
		Victims.  Aren't we all.

	INT. LOFT - NIGHT

	TIGHT ANGLE - TABLETOP

	as Eric's hands place Ratso's boom box on the table and click on 
	suitable weird b.g. MUSIC.

	ANGLE - FLOOR LEVEL

	Eric's boots pass frame.  An open can of cat food CLANKS down
	big in f.g.  as Eric walks b.g. obviously wearing Tin-Tin's 
	trenchcoat.  Gabriel noses into to frame to eat from the can.

	INT. LOFT, BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

	Shelly's vanity.  Dusty, disused.  The mirror spiderwebbed with
	cracks but still hanging precariously in its frame.  Eric is 
	seated, his image crazily split into many.  He pulls on a long-
	sleeved, tight-knit, black shirt.

	WIDEN ANGLE to reveal the loft now lit with dozens of candle
	stubs.  Placed all around.  Ceremonial and weird.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

				ERIC
		Halloween is coming.  The Day of the Dead...

	In the mirror, multi Eric's.  He touches the glass, tightening up 
	as he realizes he's in for another --

	FLASH:  Shelly, sleeping on her divan, a year ago, wakes as Eric
	(O.S.) says "Boo".  She cracks an eye open.

				SHELLY
		Your scary quotient needs work.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY

	Considering old cosmetics.  Everything he touches will hurt him.
	But he's ready to eat this pain.  He grabs a lipstick.

	FLASH:  Shelly at the vanity in happier times

				SHELLY
		I think red's my color, don't you?

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC

	wincing.  He drops the lipstick on the floor.  Grabs a
	hairbrush.

	FLASH:  Eric smashes into the street after his death-fall,
	trailing broken glass.

							FLASH ENDS.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY

	Later.  He's wearing white pancake makeup on his cheeks.  Shaky.

	FLASH:  Eric sucks up Funboy's gunshots in the chest.  1-2-3-4.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY

	his face a crazy warpaint maze of white streaks, not blended
	yet.  He looks at his own reflection.  In one cracked,
	triangular facet of the mirror is not a multiple of his face,
	but the Skull Cowboy.  Just one.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Glad to see you're finally with
		the program.

				ERIC
		Bugger off to the graveyard, skull-
		face, I'm busy.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You work for the dead.  Forget
		that, and you can forget it all.

	The Cowboy tips his hat and isn't there.  Eric sees the crow
	perched on the edge of the mirror now.

				ERIC
		Forget this.

	He smears the streaks until his face is uniformly grave-wave
	white.

	ANGLE - GABRIEL THE CAT

	coming in to sniff around the clutter at the foot of the vanity.
	Eric looks down towards him... and toward the lipstick he dropped.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND

	as it glides down to pick up the lipstick.  CONTACT, and --

	FLASH:  Eric, smashed on the street, T-Bird's car b.g., upside down
	in Eric's POV as he rolls over and blood courses from both
	corners of his mouth,  a definite foreshadow of the "Crow" face.

							FLASH ENDS.
	RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY - TIGHT

				ERIC
		She always red red was her color.

	EXTREME CLOSE - THE MIRROR

	We see only a reflected corner of Eric's mouth as he duplicates
	the blood trail in red lipstick, making one one half of a crow
	harlequin smile.

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING - LATER - NIGHT

	A MEDIUM SHOT as lightning strikes; a storm brews.

	EXT. LOFT - LATER - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S BOOTS

	crossing the floor.  Tin-Tin's knife slotted to the bucklework.

	CLOSE-UP - VANITY

	Eric's hands discard a hairbrush there.  He moves off.

	CLOSE-UP - GABRIEL

	looking up o.s., watching his master stalk around with purpose.
	Thunder rumbles long o.s.

	ANGLE - AT ERIC IN WINDOW FROM OUTSIDE

	The storm boils.  Eric framed in broken window.

	CLOSER ANGLE - ERIC IN WINDOW

	Eric all in black,  Firm-wrapped.  Tight-wired.  The trenchcoat
	flutters, cloak-like.  His shadowy face framed by the upturned
	collar, his hair punkish and spiky.

	SIDE ANGLE - ERIC

	as he moves forward in the light.  The crow lights on his shoulder.

				ERIC
		All right, bad guys...

	FRONT VIEW - ERIC

	Full crow regalia.  Face makeup streamlined.  Eric's eyes flash.

				ERIC
			(in drawn out yell)
		Here I commme -- !

	PULL BACK swiftly, vertiginously, as Eric swan dives from the
	window, his voice a howl.

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S FALL

	Coat, wing-like.  MATCH his dive yell with o.s. crow SCREECH.
	SLOW MOTION as Eric fills the frame and we --

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. ALLEY - WHERE TIN-TIN GOT IT - NIGHT

	Cop lights bounce, competing with the trash fires.  Albrecht and
	several other UNIFORMS assess the double-death scene.  A
	detective, TORRES tries to appear in charge.

				TORRES
		Couldn't have happened to a nicer 
		couple.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND TORRES OVER DEAD TIN-TIN

	Tin-Tin frozen in deathshock, all of his knives sticking out of 
	him.  Dead Ratso, b.g., where he fell.

				ALBRECHT
		Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not
		here, neither is T-Bird -- none
		of Top Dollar's number ones.

				TORRES
		You know, you sure got a hard-on for
		a guy that's guilty of zip on
		paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime;
		what's the matter, don't you like
		adult entertainment?

				ALBRECHT
		This sack of shit is called Tin-
		Tin.

				TORRES
		Don't any of your little pals have
		real, grown up names?

				ALBRECHT
		He was a runner for Top Dollar.
		Just muscle.

				TORRES
		Was.
				ALBRECHT
			(sigh)
		This isn't Top Dollar's style
		anyway.  This was somebody else.
		Somebody new.

	Albrecht lights a fresh smoke.  Torres waves the smoke away.

				TORRES
		And you're gonna tell me who.

				ALBRECHT
		Who ever made that.

	Albrecht points.  CAMERA FOLLOWS to wall behind Tin-Tin.  A crow
	silhouette has been daubed in blood there, now dry.

				TORRES
		What in the hell... do you
		call that?

				ALBRECHT
		I call it blood, Detective.  If
		you want, you can call it graffiti.

	INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of Gideon's thick fingers shuffling grimy currency.
	Some scratchy 1920's TUNE plays throughout b.g., like a broadcast
	from another time and place.

	TIGHTER ANGLE - GIDEON

	looking up at a metallic SOUND, o.s.  Irritated.

				GIDEON
		Piss off, we're closed.

	As the outside security gate rattles, Gideon draws his magnum
	and approaches the front door.

				GIDEON
		Fucking creatures of the night;
		they never goddamn learn.

	Sudden surprise as he sees the silhouette of the gate SCREE back
	against the frosted glass of the front door.

				GIDEON (CONT'D)
		HEY!!

	And he hustles to close up the distance between himself and the
	door, gun up.  Before he can touch the door, the crowbar comes
	rocketing through the glass, pegging Gideon in the forehead and 
	knocking him flat on his ass.  He loses the pistol.
	Eric walks through the door, causing the fractured glass to
	disintegrate around him.  He disclaims, thespian.

				ERIC
		"Suddenly I heard a tapping, as of
		someone gently rapping, rapping at
		my chamber door."
			(pause)
		You heard me rapping, right?

	LOW ANGLE - GIDEON ON THE FLOOR

	reacting to Eric's weird appearance and looking for his gun.

				GIDEON
		Oh, bullshit!  You're trespassing
		asshole, you're breakin'
		and enterin' and you just bought me a
		fucking door!

	During Gideon's rant, Eric brushes glass cubes from his
	shoulders, nonplussed.  Now he flings Gideon across the room.

	Gideon crashes into the counter cage.  As Eric advances on him:

				ERIC
		I'm looking for something in an
		engagement ring.  Gold.

	As Eric comes up behind him, Gideon reaches through the open
	cage door and pulls a big combat knife from beneath the counter.

				GIDEON
		You're looking for a coroner,shit-
		for-brains!

	And he tries to nail Eric with the knife.

	NEW ANGLE - BEHIND GIDEON - AS GIDEON SWINGS

	No Eric behind him.  TILT to reveal Eric hanging off the cage
	above Gideon.  Eric slams the cage door against Gideon's head.
	Drops down like a spider and collects the knife.

				ERIC
		I repeat: a gold engagement ring.
		It was pawned here, a year ago, by
		another gentleman whose name, I
		believe was... "T-Bird"?

	IN TIGHT ON ERIC AND GIDEON

	Eric twists Gideon's sail-like shirt and Gideon turns bright red.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Cute nickname, don't you think?

				GIDEON
			(gasping)
		I ain't got no fuckin' ring.

				ERIC
		Wrong answer.

	Eric nails Gideon's hand to the counter top.  Gideon howls!

				GIDEON
		All's I got is in a box!  Behind
		the counter!

	Eric jumps through the cage door.  Gideon's eyes bug as he sees 
	his own pierced hand, immobilized.

	ANGLE - ON ERIC BEHIND THE COUNTER

	scans the shelves.  Rows of boxed ammo.  Kerosene tins.  A shotgun.  
	Knives and assorted knuckle duster curios.  And the ring box.

	CLOSE-UP - THE RING BOX IN ERIC'S HAND.

	Dozens of gold rings.  Eric's fingers sift through them.

	TIGHTER ON ERIC

	He brings each ring to his face.  INTERCUT with Gideon's feeble
	struggles and invective, o.s.

				ERIC
		No... no... no... no...

	He tosses each rejected ring over his shoulder.  Until:

	CLOSE-UP - THE RING IN ERIC'S HAND

	Obliterated by a stab of brilliant white light --

	FLASH:  Shelly's face.  A perfect vision...

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUMING ERIC

	He closes his fist tightly around the ring.  A moment of
	decision.  Then he draws the shotgun from beneath the counter.
	Uses the butt to knock the knife free of Gideon's hand.  It goes
	spinning across the countertop.  Eric shucks the shotgun and
	rams it into Gideon's nose as the big man slumps to the floor.

				ERIC
		Tin-Tin confided in me, before he
		ran out of breath.  You have one
		chance to live.
				GIDEON
		No fucking way.  He'll kill me.

				ERIC
		Who would waste time killing you...
		besides me?

	Gideon sweats, pants, contemplates the hole in his hand.

				GIDEON
			(cowed)
		Top Dollar.

				ERIC
		Another jolly nickname?

				GIDEON
		You want those assholes, you want 
		Top Dollar.

				ERIC
		T-Bird?

				GIDEON
		Like the car.  He hangs out with
		Skank. that little ass-hair, and
		they hang at the Pit -- hell,
		Funboy lives there.  Ask Top
		Dollar.

				ERIC
		A whole club of pirates, with
		pirate names...

	Eric seems to go berserk, SMASHING and PUNCTURING cans of
	flammables and powder while Gideon flinches, nursing his holed
	hand.  Blows just miss Gideon's head.  Soon he's cowering.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC

	Looking down at Gideon in revulsion.

				ERIC
		You feed off the living.

	SMASH!  as another tin ceases to exist next to Gideon.  Then
	Eric is gone, past him without further word, ignoring him
	entirely.  As he exits, shotgun shouldered, he pauses to admire
	a white Fender Strat hanging among the pawnables.  He reaches 
	for it.

	ON GIDEON

	As he summons some last minute budget bravery.

				GIDEON
		You walk outta here Top Dollar
		will erase your ass!  Top Dollar
		owns the fucking street here and
		you can't dick with me, you son of
		a bitch! 

	RESUME ERIC - FRAMED IN DOORWAY

	The guitar now bowslung across his back, the shotgun levelled at
	Gideon's position.

				ERIC
		One chance to live.  Take it.

	MOVE IN TIGHT ON GIDEON

	as he realizes what Eric means.  Hauls ass and bangs through the
	rear door with a bleat of terror.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC IN DOOR  

	as he cuts loose with the shotgun.

	EXT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	as seen from across the street.  Eric silhouetted, unmoving as
	the whole store front blows hellaciously out around him, raining
	glass and debris.  Stirring his hair.  Eric is the black eye of
	the fireball.

	LOW ANGLE - FRONT OF PAWN SHOP - EMPHASIZE ERIC

	lit by flames and residual explosions.  He hurls the shotgun
	into the inferno.  Casually brushes flaming/smoking detritus
	from his own clothes.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		Don't move! I said don't move.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC

	as he turns slowly, to see Albrecht, out of reach, gun drawn.
	Eric's attitude lightens; Albrecht is not the threat here.

				ERIC
		I thought the police always said
		"freeze:.

	Albrecht divides his attention, jumpy, between the odd sight of
	Eric (guitar on his back), and the raging instant inferno of
	Gideon's.

				ALBRECHT
		I'm the police and I say don't
		move, Snow White.  You're under
		arrest; I don't care what else is 
		wrong with you!  You move and
		you're dead.

	Eric has begun to pace towards Albrecht.  Palms up.  A gesture of
	submission.  Albrecht's battle calm begins to waiver.

				ERIC
		And I say I'm dead... and I move.

				ALBRECHT
		No further.  I'm serious.

	Eric bows, bringing his forehead in line with the gun's muzzle.

				ERIC
		Then shoot, if you will.

	TIGHT ANGLE - ALBRECHT

	He gives it up.  Can't shoot.  This is too weird for him.

				ALBRECHT
		Are you nuts, walking into a gun?

	NEW ANGLE - LESS THREATENING - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

				ERIC
		You must listen carefully:  the 
		Fire Department will be here soon.
		There is an injured man in the 
		alley who needs assistance.
			(meaningfully)
		As Shelly Webster once needed your 
		assistance, and as you are shortly 
		going to need my assistance.

	Albrecht gestures casually, almost comically, with his pointed
	gun.  B.g., the crow lands on a fire escape to monitor them.

				ALBRECHT
		You wanna run that back for me one
		time?

	SIRENS near, o.s.  Eric listens to them, to the night.

				ERIC
		Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the
		street here."  He will "erase
		my ass."

				ALBRECHT
		You don't say.

				ERIC
		I know Top Dollar has turned your 
		streets into his hell.

				ALBRECHT
		Fucking A, my friend.

				ERIC
		The others are called Skank, T-
		Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.
			(beat)
		Watch me, office Albrecht.

	Eric lifts a chunk of glass from the sidewalk.  Slow and easy.
	Albrecht doesn't completely trust him.  Up comes the gun.

				ALBRECHT
		Watch it...

	Eric slices open his palm.  Blood flows.  To his fingertips.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

	as Eric quickly daubs a crow silhouette in blood on the wall...
	then exhibits the gashed hand to Albrecht.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND

	as the blood retreats and the wound seals itself up.

	TIGHT ON ALBRECHT

	and the silhouette.  Mouth hangs.

				ALBRECHT
		You're the one who did Tin-Tin...

	PULL BACK FAST to reveal Eric is gone from the frame.  Albrecht does
	a quick 180.  No Eric.  Flashbars from incoming units begin
	to bounce red and blue off his face.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Great.  Good night.  Guy shows up
		looking like a mime from hell.
			(beat)
		Least he didn't do that "walking
		against the wind" shit;  I hate
		that.

	EXT. SHOWTIME - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH.

	A night-owl pornucopia.  T-Bird enters beneath a garish theater
	marquee.  The 2-bill:  RUMP ROMP with BUTTBUSTERS II.

	INT. SHOWTIME LOBBY - NIGHT

	T-Bird approaches the snack bar.  Wet, breathy mating NOISES
	from the auditorium throughout, o.s.  Looking supremely bored,
	the counterman, DICKEY BIRD, thumbs a porn tabloid.  So what.

				DICKEY BIRD
		T-Bird.  Thrill me.

				T-BIRD
		Business.

	T-bird heads left through s steal door that Dickie buzzes
	open for him.

	INT.  SHOWTIME AUDITORIUM (BACKSTAGE) - NIGHT

	T-Bird walks past dust-covered boxy black speakers as we glimpse
	Lance and Angelique making history in reverse, on the back of the 
	movie screen: oratoria as good as porn films can make it.

				PORN QUEEN (O.S.)
		I don't know how to describe how
		I feel, Lance -- so restless --

				PORN KING (O.S.)
		You're my Moon Queen, Angelique.

				PORN QUEEN (o.S.)
		Oooh -- I want you're rocket right
		now in my Sea of Tranquility -- 
		Lance --

	ANGLE - CATWALK STAIRS

	As T-Bird approaches, the movie sounds dwindle o.s.  He ascends
	the skinny metal stairway two steps at a time.

	ANGLE - STEEL FACED DOOR AT TOP OF STAIRS.

	As T-Bird nears it, a viewplate SNAPS open to asses him.  By
	the time he reaches the top, the door unbolts to admit him.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	As T-Bird enters.  The room is organized around a long meeting
	table and flavored with a taste of everything illegal:  drug
	paraphernalia, weapons.

	Across the table are a couple of Sentries like the one that
	admits T-Bird to the room.  TRACK PAST them to a lank-haired
	silhouette as he turns away from a windowshade, backlit by
	Showtime's exterior neon.

	This is TOP DOLLAR.  Who looks like a Johnny Winter acid 
	casualty but is deadly cold, definitely the man in charge.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Wild fucking night.  I hear our
		pal Tin-Tin got himself very dead.

				T-BIRD
		And Gideon's just burned all the
		down to the foundation.

	Top's eyebrows go up.  Oh really?

				T-BIRD (CONT'D) 
		I didn't have nothin to do with
		that.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Bet that pisses you off, right?

				T-BIRD
		Top, what the fuck is going on
		tonight?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Stay normal, T.  Cops'll be all
		hotwired and aggressive.  No
		combat moves until I check this
		out.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT - (~CROWVISION") HIGH ANGLE

	Taking in the street, the Pit, and a little girl seated on an
	abandoned car.

	ANGLE - STREET LEVEL - ON ELLY.

	Seated on the looted wheelless car, playing with a small doll.

	CLOSER ANGLE - ON ELLY

	She doesn't notice someone is watching her yet.

	TIGHT ON DOLL, THEN ELLY

	She looks up o.s. at Eric, who is still out of the frame.

				ELLY
		What are you supposed to be?  A clown?

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	He smiles for what seems to be the first time.  Warm, even past
	his crow makeup.

				ERIC
		Sometimes.

	He glances back and logs the location of the Pit for later, not
	in a big hurry just now.  Turns back to Elly.

	WIDE ANGLE - ERIC AND ELLY

				ELLY
		You look like a rock star without a
		job.

				ERIC
		I dabble.  May I?

	He indicates the car hood, a "seat" next to Elly from which he
	may observe the Pit.

				ELLY
		If you're not some kinda child 
		molester.

	Eric looks behind himself.  Who, me?  Genuinely amused.  He 
	shakes his head no and sits down next to Elly. 

	INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT

	The music POUNDS and smoke is everywhere, like incense.
	INTERCUTS of the clientele, retro, robotic, clove cigarettes and
	rubber clothing; fetish casual wear.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR

	right in the center of the noise, looking downscale and dirty
	in this milieu.

	ANGLE - ANOTHER CUSTOMER

	Passing Top, appraising him, finding him as boring as life
	itself.  Undertaker chic, she stares at Top.

				TOP DOLLAR
		I thought Halloween was tomorrow
		night.

	An Oriental bodyguard passes him in f.g., motioning to follow.

	INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	Lao watches club activity on his flybank of TVs.  When Top
	Dollar shows up at the office door two Sentries try to bar his 
	passage.  He shoves through.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Get outta my way, you mooks.

	Lao's demeanor indicates that they should not kill Top.

				LAO
		An unexpected pleasure.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Bad news.  Alot of action on the
		streets tonight, and nobody
		bothered to clear it with me.  Tin-
		Tin got himself whacked.

				LAO
		Who got himself what?

				TOP DOLLAR
		One of mine.  And it wasn't a 
		standard hit.

				LAO
		I had heard something like this.
			(beat)
		Describe it for me.  The "hit".

				TOP DOLLAR
		I was wondering if you could tell
		me anything... about a wildcat
		operative.

				LAO
		I know of no one.
			(beat)
		But even if there is, I am sure it
		is nothing outside your capacity 
		to deal with?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Anybody violates my turf -- our 
		turf -- I'll rip out there heart 
		and show it to 'em.

				LAO
		To be sure.  Now tell how your 
		friend died.

	INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT

	ANNABELLA, a comfortable large, spider-in-the-web deskworker,
	sits typing at a terminal.  Miked headphone in one ear, police
	scanner chatter o.s.  She blows and pops a pink bubble of gum.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		Annie?

	ANGLE - ANNABELLA AND ALBRECHT

	Albrecht enters frame from across her countertop.

				ANNABELLA
		Whatever it is, the answer's no,
		Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.

				ALBRECHT
		Annie, I need a file.

	There is a desperate edge to Albrecht's voice.

				ANNABELLA
		Speak up.
			(beat; her guard up)
		Clear it with the Captain if you
		need a file.

				ALBRECHT
		This is special, darlin'.  Please?

	Annabella eyes Albrecht doubtfully.  Fatalistic sigh.

				ANNABELLA
		Just don't tell me you "owe me
		one."  What file?

				ALBRECHT
		Double homicide.  A year ago.
		Las Halloween.

	EXT. STREET NEAR THE PIT - ERIC AND ELLY - NIGHT

	Still hanging by the car, a bit more familiar with each other
	now.  A low-slung mirror-windowed LIMOUSINE hisses past them and
	curbs across the street from the Pit.

				ELLY
		My mom works over there.  I'm
		waiting for her, but she's
		probably with him, right now.

				ERIC
		Who?
				
				ELLY
		Mister Funboy.

				ERIC
		Mister Funboy lives there?

	TWO SHOT - ELLY AND ERIC - (PIT B.G.)

				ELLY
		He has a room, upstairs.  I don't
		like him very much.

	Elly is not happy about this.  B.G. we see Grange get out of the 
	car, heading to the Pit, and notice in passing a guy with the
	white face talking to the little girl down on the block.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		Can you play that thing or do you
		just carry it around everywhere?

	Elly indicates the guitar strapped to Eric' back.

				ERIC
		I can pick out a tune now 
		and again.

				ELLY
		Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"
			(re: doll)
		It used to be her favorite.

				ERIC
		Does she have a name?

				ELLY
		No name.  You sure ask a lot of
		questions.

	Elly HANDS the doll to Eric and he experiences a wholly 
	unexpected flash.

	FLASH:  Elly and SHelly sitting as SHelly's vanity, goofing with
	makeup, test-driving lipstick, the doll visible on the vanity.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC - AS THE DOLL DROPS FROM HIS HAND

	Pain is trying to fight it's way out of Eric in surges. 

				ELLY (OS)
			(smart alec)
		Hel-lo?  Earth to anybody...?

	Eric snaps out of it.  Elly retrieves the doll.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		Do you feel okay.

				ERIC
		No.

				ELLY
		You gotta go now, I bet.

				ERIC
		I have to go.

	Half-zomboid, half-determined, he exits.

	INT. PIT - NIGHT - WITH GRANGE

	As he circulates to the bar, unimpressed.  To the bouncer:

				GRANGE
		Top Dollar?

				BOUNCE
		Never heard of him.

				GRANGE
		Funboy?

				BOUNCER
		Oh, prob'ly upstairs bangin'
		Darla.  Pay for your own beer and
		they'll prob'ly be down before you 
		can drink it.

	INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of an 8x10 of the loft slaughter in Albrecht's hands.
	Subject: a document pinned to the wall with a knife.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT DESK.

	flipping through the file. Smoking.

	ANGLE - THE 8X10 IN ALBRECHT'S HAND

	Subject: Eric, dead in the street in front of the loft 
	building.  The blood on his face reminiscent of his crow face.

	As Albrecht's hand moves the photo we can see in the file
	several band shots of Eric as a member of Diabolique... 
	including the shot on Lao's wall gallery of past performers at
	Club Trash.

	A DOUGHUT on a paper plate suddenly touches down in the middle
	of all this research, startling Albrecht.

	ANGLE - ANNABELLA BEHIND HIM

				ANNABELLA
		Don't thank me.  Your ass is
		already in enough trouble for this shit.

				ALBRECHT
		I knew that.

	Albrecht holds a typewritten page closer to the the light.

	CLOSE-UP DOCUMENT, torn by the knife hole made by Tin-Tin.

	It reads:  We, the Undersigned tenants of 1929 Calderone Court
	Apartments...

				ALBRECHT
		Another nice white girl with a
		cause.  Like a big KICK ME sign.

	Albrecht takes up and 8x10 of Eric's face.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Shelly Webster.  And her nice 
		white boyfriend, Eric Draven.

	With a felt-tip pen he superimposes the crow smile, like the make-
	up, like the blood.

				ANNABELLA
		Your last little wild goose chase
		got you busted back to the Beat 
		Patrol, just like in a bad
		detective story, Eddie. Are we
		doing the wildgoose thing again?

	UNDER THIS Albrecht sketches in Eric's spiky Crow hairdo.

				ALBRECHT
		Could be.

				ANNABELLA
		You gonna wind up working at a school
		crosswalk.   that doughnut's 
		chocolate you, know.

	PUSH IN on the doctored photo.  It's Eric.  It's the Crow.

	PUSH IN on ALbrecht.

				ALBRECHT
		Well, hello there...chocolate,

				ANNABELLA
		Don't thank me.

				ALBRECHT
		Thanks, babe.

	INT. THE PIT (REAR) - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

	Climbing.  The crow perched on his shoulder.  Not in a hurry.

				ERIC
		It's a Raymond Chandler evening
		And the pavements are all wet, And
		I'm lurking in the shadows, for it 
		hasn't happened ...

	TIGHT CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	Impish.  Clown killer.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		... yet.

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	Grange at a table.  SMoking and waiting.  No beer.  His back
	protected, he is stationed near the fire stair door and has a
	good overview of the room.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of a base pipe being lit and hit hard.

	EXT. THE PIT (REAR) - FIRE ESCAPE - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric's gloved hand slides sinuously up rusted railing.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	A hypodermic needle rises into frame.  A nicotined fingernail
	flicks bubbles in the syringe.  FOLLOW needle down and BROADEN
	ANGLE: Funboy taps up a vein in Darla's arm and shoots her up.
	Both are naked in a shabby bed.  Bare lightbulb above.

				DARLA
		Ooh, baby -- gimme all of it.

	CLOSE-UP - THE NEEDLE

	As the plunger depresses.

	ANGLE - ON THE WINDOW

	As the crow quite unexpectedly arrives and perches on the sill,
	scaring the shit out of our two dopey friends.  Funboy pulls a
	giant auto pistol; mock aims, calms down, doesn't fire.

				DARLA
		It's a big fucking bird...

	She falls back against her pillow, eyes dreamily defocusing.
	Funboy giggles.  Relaxes the gun, which half-disappears into the 
	sheets at his side.

				FUNBOY
		It's a squab.  Here bird, Here,
		birdie...

	NEW ANGLE - DARLA AND FUNBOY

	Except that Eric now stands near their bed, across from the 
	bird's position, the guitar bowslung.

				ERIC
		Here Funboy.

	Contained panic as Funboy and Darla both startle.  The needle 
	flies and lands at Eric's feet.  Empty.  Funboy struggles to
	maintain against his high.

				FUNBOY
		Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do
		that, man.  I nearly had a fucking
		heart attack.

				DARLA
		Fun -- look at that guy...

				FUNBOY
		It's just the dope, don't worry

				DARLA
		Fun, he's not going away; he's 
		scaring the piss outta me!

				FUNBOY
		Not me.

	Funboy draws the gun from underneath the sheers.  Suddenly he seems
	totally focused.

				FUNBOY (CONT'D)
		Time for you to take your bird and 
		leave, freako.

	Eric rips open his shirtfront to reveal a circlet of bullet
	punctures.  This gives Funboy pause.
				ERIC
		Take your shot funboy.  You got 
		me, dead bang.

	Funboy tilts the gun off target.  Grins as Eric flat handedly
	past his chest, indicating where to shoot.

				FUNBOY
		You are seriously fucked up, man.
		Just look at yourself.

	In a blur, he sighs, and shoots Eric through the heart.

				FUNBOY (CONT'D)
		BANG!  He shoots, he scores!

	Then his expression drags a little bit.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Looking down and daubing his hand in the bullet wound on his chest.

				ERIC
		Bull's eye.  Good shot.

	ANGLE - DARLA

	who starts scrambling to get out.  Grabbing clothes on the floor
	around herself. she runs right into Eric's outstretched hands.

				ERIC
		Stay.

	Eric twists her arm.

	CLOSE-UP - DARLA'S FOREARM.

	where we may clearly see the needle tracks.  

	UP ANGLE - ERIC 

				ERIC
		Morphine is bad for you.

	He holds her arm captive.  Tight, and we PUSH IN CLOSER to see
	the dope evacuating from the punctures, a reverse of Eric's,
	Blood trail.  The dope drips from Darla's arm to the floor.
	Darla's eyes roll up into the unconscious.  She slumps.

	ANGLE - ON FUNBOY - GAWPING

				FUNBOY
		How the hell did you do that?
		
				ERIC
		Magic.

	Funboy regards Eric's battlescars and guitar.

				FUNBOY
		Either die or do a solo.

	Eric looks briefly to his chest wound, wincing.  He can't seem
	to make it tie off fast enough.  He turns his attention back to
	Funboy.  But his strength is mysteriously ebbing.

				ERIC
		Neither.

				FUNBOY
		Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.

	Funboy lashes out and broadsides Eric across the temple with the
	gun.  Eric falls, rolls back to a stance, but Funboy is right on
	top of him, howling like a lunatic and pistol-whipping Eric
	relentlessly.

				FUNBOY
		I hate trespassers!
			(whack!)
		I hate prowlers!
			(whack!)
		I hate peeping toms!
			(whack!)
		And right now I hate you!

	ANGLE - WALL NEAR BATHROOM

	as Eric, caught off-guard by Funboy's hyper high and weakened by
	his wound, comes slamming into the wall, losing his footing.
	Here comes Funboy, and we TILT UP from Eric's position as he 
	looms, cocking the pistol, which now has Eric's blood on it.

				FUNBOY
		Ahh, the hell with it, I still got
		five shots left.

	In a blur, Eric grabs Funboy`s gun hand.  Twists to the 
	crunching of bones.  Funboy's skewed-around gun hand blows a
	hole in his own thigh.  Funboy fall back across the bed.

				FUNBOY
		Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what
		you did to my sheets, you lame
		piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!

				ERIC
		Does it hurt?

				FUNBOY
		Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass,
		clown-faced fuck, of course it
		fucking hurts!  What the shit are
		you gonna do about this?!

	Eric sits on the bed next to Funboy; inspects the ampule of
	morphine on the nightstand, the needle of the syringe already 
	inserted.

				ERIC
		I have some pain killer right here.

	And he fills the syringe all the way.

	ANGLE ON FUNBOY

	as he begins to see the light.  He can't get away.  Growing
	terror.

				FUNBOY
		No, wait, no WAIT, that's too
		much, man, that's like overkill,
		nobody can take that much, you're
		wasting it -- !

				ERIC
		Your pain ends now.

	And Eric rams the needle into Funboy's heart, driving home
	the full dose.  Funboy begins to convulse.

	Eric falls back on the bed, his force spent.  Darla COMES TO in
	the corner, shock-traumatized.  On O.S. COUGH, and Eric opens
	his eyes.

	The Skull Cowboy, standing in the room, tips his hat.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Howdy
			(beat)
		You look a mess.  Like an ole
		cooter dog.

	TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE

	streaked with -- mostly -- his own blood.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE SKULL COWBOY AND ERIC

				SKULL COWBOY
		Getting a little ambitious and
		extracurricular, aren't we?

				ERIC
		Go away.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You need to learn to mind your own
		business or you'll never get where
		you think you're going.

				ERIC
		Shut up.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Maybe I was wrong about you.

	The Skull Cowboy seems saddened or disappointed.  All we get is
	a little shake of his skull-head.

	Darla makes a SOUND and Eric turns toward her.  She's really
	confused.  She's looking to Eric for some kind of answer.

				ERIC
		Your daughter is out there, on the
		street, waiting for you.

	She's stunned, utterly speechless.  All she can do is look in
	Eric's eyes, try to ponder the phantoms there.

				ERIC
		Go.  Now.

	Darla shoves helter-skelter past Eric and out the door without 
	a glance back at Funboy.

	Eric, recovering, follows slowly, staring at the open door,
	stooping to lift the guitar dropped during the fight with 
	Funboy.  The Skull Cowboy has vanished.  PUSH IN.  Grimly, Eric
	takes a syringe and begins to draw blood from the late Funboy.

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	As a hastily dressed Darla BANGS out through the fire stair door
	behind Grange and FLEES the Pit.

				BOUNCER
		Hey, g'night, Darla.
			(to Grange)
		That there is Darla.

				GRANGE
		Funboy?

	Bartender indicates UP with his thumb.  Grange moves to the fire
	stairs door.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Grange has seen the door ajar and now ENTERS gun-first.  Freezes
	when he sees:

	GRANGE POV - FUNBOY

	Half-sheeted, bloody, a hypo hanging out of his heart.

	RESUME GRANGE

	Eyes darting, drawn to --

	GRANGE'S POV - THE WALL NEAR FUNBOY

	A crow silhouette spray-painted with a syringe of Funboy's
	blood.  A thin outline, drippy.

	RESUME GRANGE

	whirling with his gun to bring it to bear on --

	ANGLE - GRANGE SEES THE WINDOW

	The crow is no longer in the room.  Eric is perched on the sill,
	guitar and all, looking right at Grange as if waiting from him.
	He winks, holds a finger to his lips -- sshh --and jumps out
	into the night.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - GRANGE

	He almost fires, but doesn't.  We see instead the priceless
	expression on his face as we --

							CUT TO:

	INT. PRECINCT FOYER - NIGHT

	Albrecht lights another smoke, quitting for the night.  Waves to
	the late-working Annabella en route.

	EXT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT

	Albrecht hasn't gone three steps before Eric appears behind him,
	cat silent, matching pace.

	NB:  Eric has got a new black rock-n-roll shirt on... and a
	shell casing from Funboy's gun tied in his hair.

				ERIC
		Freeze.

	Albrecht startles; drops his file.  Nearly draws his gun.

				ALBRECHT
		Jeezus!  Don't ever do that, man!

	Albrecht pants, hysterical but calming down.  Eric waits.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		I told you cops don't say
		"freeze".

	He retrieves Eric's doctored photo from the spill of papers.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		You, my friend, are dead.  I saw
		your body.  You got buried.

				ERIC
		I saw it, too.

	Albrecht gathers up the file.  Eric stands there.  We realize he
	is hesitant about touching the file.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Walk with me.

	As Albrecht comes up with the file as they walk.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT ON THE STREET

				ALBRECHT
		You died, man.  I can't believe it
		but here you are.  Last year,
		you and your girlfriend --

				ERIC
		I need you to tell me what you
		remember.  What happened to us?

				ALBRECHT
		You went out the window.  She was
		beaten and raped.  She died in the 
		hospital.

	They stop.  Eric didn't know this.  Fixes Albrecht with a look.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Hey, you asked, man.
			(beat)
		She held on for thirty hours in 
		intensive care.  Hemorrhage,
		trauma.  He body just finally
		gave it up.
			(beat; regret)
		I saw it and couldn't do jack for 
		her.

	Eric has grown increasingly distraught over Albrecht's lines.
	Now he turns to Albrecht and, holding Albrecht's temples with
	his fingers, puts his thumbs over Albrecht's eyes.

	TIGHT ON ERIC - ALBRECHT AGAINST WALL

	We see Eric react to a brutal Flash... but we don't see the 
	Flash.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

	And Eric tears from Albrecht; staggers back, now holding his own
	head.  His crow face slacked in realized horror.

				ALBRECHT
		You okay, man?  I mean, what just
		happened.

				ERIC
		The venom of bad memories.  You
		were there; you saw her.  I saw
		you seeing her.

	Understandable nervous, Albrecht lights up a cigarette.

				ALBRECHT
		You gotta understand -- I was 
		hoping she'd talk, give me a lead,
		a clue, something to work with.
		But she only said one thing to me 
		before she died.

	Eric lowers his head, penitent.

				ERIC
		My name.

				ALBRECHT
			(fizzles)
		I'm sorry as hell, man.

				ERIC
		Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus
		change...

	TIGHT TWO-SHOT - ALBRECHT AND ERIC

	Eric plucks the cigarette from Albrecht's lips, taking a single
	contemplative puff from it.

				ERIC
		Halloween is coming, soon.  You
		will have Top Dollar if you watch
		for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.

				ALBRECHT
		I should be trying to stop you.

	Eric nods, keeping his eyes on the cigarette.

				ERIC
		Thank you.  For giving a damn.

				ALBRECHT
		My pleasure.
				ERIC
		Don't smoke these.

	As a bus grumbles past on the street, Eric pitches the butt and 
	simultaneously ducks out of frame.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT TURNS

	to see a blank building wall.  Fire escape.  Darkness.  No Eric.
	He does a full 360 degree turn.  Eric is gone again.

				ALBRECHT
		Damn, I wish he wouldn't do that.

	MOVING ANGLE - FROM BUS ROOF

	Coat flapping, Eric is standing on the bus roof as the bus moves
	away from Albrecht's position.

	INT. LAO NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	Lao has the partially disassembled rat skeleton in front of him, 
	as well as a mortar and pestle with some bits of crushed bone, and
	is smoking powdered rat bone in a pipe and Grange reports to
	him.

				GRANGE
		The son of a bitch winked at me.
		The he jumped.  Three stories.

	Lao seems strangely unaffected by the bizarre nature of Grange's
	tale.

				LAO
		Did you see an animal of any kind?
		Did you see a bird?

				GRANGE
			(puzzled)
		No.  I saw a guitar.
			(beat; irritated)
		This isn't some rock-n-roller
		you forgot to pay, is it?
			(beat)
		There was a drawing on the wall 
		that looked like a bird.  In 
		blood.

	Lao's expression is one of sublime content.

				LAO
		Good.

				Grange
		It could've been a chicken...

	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT - ("CROWVISION")

	A LONG SHOT of the T-Bird parked across the street from the
	store as two figures -- T-Bird and Skank -- approach on the
	store side.

				SKANK
		I wish to hell I had torched
		Gideon's, that fat fuck.

				T-BIRD
		I wish to hell I knew who it was
		that made Tin-Tin into a voodoo
		doll last night.

	ANGLE - CLOSER ON T-BIRD AND SKANK - STREET LEVEL

	They stop walking.  Look at each other and sanctimoniously cross 
	themselves.  Tin-Tin's big R.I.P. moment.  T-Bird indicates the
	liquor store.

				T-BIRD
		We need some smokes and some road
		beers.

				SKANK
		Got it.

	Skank hustles toward the store.  T-Bird crosses to the car.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD - THROUGH CAR WINDOWS

	WIDEN ANGLE to include the car as he nears it.  Behind him, two
	12-year-old KIDS, AXEL and CHOPPER, enter the store after Skank,
	one wearing a long duster.

	INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

	as the KIDS enter and split between the counter and magazine
	rack.  East Indian CLERK.  Two boys fight video game wars in the
	corner.  Skank browses, grabbing odds and ends.

	EXT. STREET / INT. CAR - LOWER ANGLE - NIGHT

	as T-Bird climbs in, digs the last cigarette from his pack, 
	snaps his Zippo and in the sudden orange light, sees:

	INSERT - REARVIEW MIRROR

	Eric's purloined Strat in the back sear reflecting the light.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD

	He tries to spin and draw his gun but Eric is upon him, nestling
	one of Tin-Tin's throwing knives right inside T-Bird's ear.
		
				T-BIRD
		What the fuck are you supposed to
		be, man?!

	INSERTS:  Eric liberates T-Bird's automatic from the shoulder 
	holster; Eric's hand closes T-Bird's door for him.

				ERIC
		I'm your passenger.  You drive.
		And stop talking.

	TIGHT ANGLE - T-BIRD'S HANDS

	on ignition key and gearshift, making ready.  As ordered.

	INT. LIQUOR STORE - ON SKANK AT COUNTER - NIGHT

	He looks outside and sees Eric as the car fires up, pipes and
	glasspacks grumbling.  Skank moves, BRISTLING.

				SKANK
		What's all this happy horseshit?

	And the car peels out maniacally!  Skank tries to pursue -- but
	the two KIDS draw weapons and freeze everyone in the store.

				AXEL
		Alright, alright, alright --
		everybody be cool and stay exactly
		where you are.

	Chopper hustles up to the counter and relieves Skank of a 
	gigantic Auto Mag.

				CHOPPER
		Whooooa, cowboy!  Cool gun.

	Off Skank's look of total outfoxed disgust.--

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELING FAST - NIGHT

	Vertiginous windshield POV of onrushing street, highspeed.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		Faster, T-Bird.  Faster.  You're
		a hell of a wheelman; you know you
		can drive faster.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND T-BIRD

	Eric now holds T-Bird's own gun on him.  Eyes locked on T-Bird.
	T-Bird's jump between Eric's nightmare visage and the roadway.

				T-BIRD
		You call it, blood -- you got the
		gun. You just tell me where you want
		to go.

	Clearly T-Bird would relish bisecting Eric with a meat cleaver 
	as he says this.  He's nervous and needs to hold the road.

				ERIC
		That's good.  We're going 
		someplace you've never been
		before.

	EXT. STREET - HIGH ANGLE ON T-BIRD - NIGHT

	as the car burns up the obstacle course of pavement, kicking  
	wake of litter.  PEDESTRIANS scurry to clear the way.

	INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

	Parked in an alley, facing the street.  Two cops work on large
	styro cups of steaming coffee.  MJ (driver) and SPEEG.

				MJ
		Smells like rain.

				SPEEG
		Smells like a septic tank.  You
		got that cream stuff?

				MJ
		In the bag.

	Speeg rummages inside the takeout bag.

				SPEEG   
		I hate this cream stuff.  They
		can't even call it cream, legally.

	They snap to as the T-Bird blazes past, doing ninety.

				MJ
		What in the crap?

	MJ floors the pedal, drenching Speeg in coffee on takeoff.

				SPEEG
		Ow! Owowoowowoowo, goddammit!

	EXT. STREET - ON ALLEY - NIGHT

	as the cruiser roars out to give chase.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING FAST - NIGHT

	Eric lends the chase car a backward look.

				ERIC
		You caught one.  Drive faster.

				T-BIRD
		Man, you gonna get us killed dead
		and I don't even know what you
		want!

	Eric cocks T_Bird's pistol and levels it at his face.

				ERIC
		I want you to stop talking.  And 
		drive.  Drive faster.

	Eric rifles the glove box, tossing items out the window: clips
	for the gun.  Sunglasses.  A giant dildo (brief eyebrows-up to
	T-Bird).  Then: a roll of (previously established) gaffer's
	tape.  What Eric needs.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD AND REARVIEW MIRROR

	as he sees a second cop car join the high speed pursuit, 

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		You're very popular.  Thought
		you could handle this thing.

	T-Bird macho calcifies.  He's going to win.

				T-BIRD
		To hell with you.

				ERIC
			(wry)
		Naturally.

	INSERT - SPEEDOMETER

	Climbing swiftly toward the 100 mark.


	EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS ANGLES - THE CHASE - NIGHT

	A 3-way pursuit until the T-Bird reaches the outskirts of the
	city.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT

	All quiet... until the T-Bird ZOOMS past frame.  The lead cop
	tries to duplicate the T-Bird's corner-cut and starts spinning.
	It clips a light pole.  Rebounds into the path of MJ's unit.

	INT. POLICE CRUISER - ON SPEEG AND MJ - TRAVELING - NIGHT

	as MJ stands on the brakes.  Collision imminent.  They howl.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT

	as MJ's unit broadsides the first cop car.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT

	The T-bird careens through dockside silence, alone, then
	fishtails, SCREECHING, to a lung-compressing halt.

	INT. T-BIRD - ON ERIC AND T-BIRD - NIGHT

	T-bird respirating like a jackhammer.  Eric holds stoic.

				T-BIRD
		So what -- you gonna rape me now?

				ERIC
		Time for your reward, T.  Payback
		with interest earned.

	Eric rips a long strip of tape from the roll.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT

	A HIGH ANGLE of the car as Eric opens the trunk.

	ERIC'S POV - The Trunk.

	loaded with plastique, canisters, timers, arson paraphernalia.

	INT. T-BIRD - FAVOR T-BIRD - NIGHT

	SLOW TILT starting with T-Bird's foot, firmly taped to the
	pedal.  Mummified into his seat.  Hands taped to the wheel.
	Throat taped hard against the headrest.

	The car is now in gear, idling.

	ANGLE - ON ERIC FROM WINDOW

	He drops an incendiary right into T-Bird's lap.  T-Bird squirms.
	No go.  Eric reaches in with a bungie cord.

				ERIC
		A little restrictive?  Good.
			(chilling)
		You held her down and raped her.
		You were the first.  She burned
		while you were inside of her.
			(re: bomb)
		What's the lag on this?  About
		twenty seconds, would you say?

	T-bird thrashes, but he's immobilized.  Can't even budge the
	wheel.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I've comrades in hell, T-bird.
		Give them my best.

	Eric activates the timer.  Yanks up hard on the bungie cord.

	INSERT: T-BIRD FOOTWELL

	The bungie cord pulls T-Bird's foot all the way down on the
	pedal.

	ANGLE - ON CAR, FROM DOCKSIDE

	Eric steps back, plucks the guitar out as the car starts to move.  The
	car roars for the edge of the dock, about a distance of a
	football field.  Eric examines T-bird's auto pistol and pops the
	clip.

	INTERCUTS:  as the car speeds for the water's edge, Eric thumbs
	bullets from the clip, one by one.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELING FAST - NIGHT

	T-bird's eyes bug in horror and he goes MMMMMMMMHHH!

	CLOSE-UP - THE CLIP IN ERIC'S HAND

	thumbing out the final bullet.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

				ERIC
		All gone.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD REACHES DOCKSIDE

	Lifting off and blowing all to hell, a billion smithereens of
	phosphorescent firs pattering into the dark water.  It hits.
	Sinks.  Weird flare glow as the car quickly submerges.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	heaving the gun into the distant water.  Plosh.  He produces T-
	Bird's accelerator.  Squirts it into the ground.  He
	prestidigitates and T-Bird's Zippo appears in his hand.  He 
	flicks it and drops it into the flammable puddle.

	HIGH LONG SHOT - ERIC

	walking slowly out of the scene as the firepool coalesces into
	a burning crow shape. 

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAWN

	CLOSE-UP of a frying pan busy burning some pretty firebombed
	looking eggs.  Kind gross.

	ANGLE - DARLA AT THE STOVE.

	NOT THRILLED WITH HER OWN PROGRESS.

				DARLA
		I never was too good at this 
		domestic shit.

	ANGLE - ELLY AT LIVING ROOM WINDOW

	staring outside at nothing in particular.  Yet.

				ELLY
		Don't say "shit".
			(beat)
		That's okay.  Corn Flakes are
		okay.  Anything.

	She pauses as she hears a lilting, faraway GUITAR STRAIN.
	Across the street she can make out the figure of Eric on his 
	roof playing the guitar.

	EXT. ROOF OF LOFT BUILDING DAWN

	EXTREME CLOSE of a Pignose Amp.  More soft GUITAR strokes as
	CAMERA FOLLOWS a patchwork a taped-together, jerry-rigged
	cables to:

	ANGLE - ERIC ON ROOF -- shirtless, crosslegged, his Crow make-up
	streaked by the night's work.  His fingering is unsure and he 
	tries the tune again.

	INSERT - We she Shelly's engagement ring on a leather thong
	around Eric's neck.  Like an amulet.

	ANGLE - ERIC PLAYING

	He's got it right this time.  Strong, sure CHORDS.  Passionate.
	We can almost imagine him conjuring Shelly via musical sorcery.
	He holds a stroke, letting it ring.  Sun rises behind him.

				IRATE VOICE (O.S.)
		Hey, shut the fuck up!

	Eric's eyes, closed with the moment, dart left.  Funny.

	EXT. MAXI-DOGS - DAY

	Later.  Elly is seated on a stool..  Mickey gives her a chili
	dog.

				MICKEY
		Chili dog for breakfast... it's
		original.

				ELLY
		Mom tried to cook.

				MICKEY
		Oh.

				CUSTOMER (O.S.)
		Hey, Mickey, I need a special
		with everything.  No sawdust.

				MICKEY
			(to Elly)
		Everyone's a comedian.  Enjoy.

	Mickey EXITS FRAME.

				GRANGE (O.S.)
		You're Elly, right?  I know your
		mom.

	Elly turns.  Grange sits next to her.  Lao's mirrored-windowed car
	is parked across the street, b.g.

				ELLY
		A lot of people "know" my mom.

	Grange points o.s., indicating he wants coffee from Mickey.

				GRANGE
		I know your friend, too -- the one
		that looks like a rock star.

				ELLY
		I don't know you.

				GRANGE
			(easily)
		I'd like to get in touch with him.

	Elly sizes Grange up.

				ELLY
		You're not a cop, either.  What do
		you want him for?

				GRANGE
		I'm looking for a good guitar man.

				ELLY
		Right.

	Grange withdraws a $10 bill from his wallet and slides it across
	the countertop to Mickey.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		You buying?
			(cuts him some slack)
		He kinda wanders around.  You'll
		see him if you pay attention.

				GRANGE
		I need to find him kind of soon,
		Elly.


	INT. LOFT - ON ERIC - DAY

	No shirt, the ring on the thong around his neck -- workout mode.

	He twirls and performs odd Crow moves of increasing complexity
	in the big open living room.  On purpose, he stretches hard
	against the bedroom doorframe.

	FLASH:  Shelly stands in the blue moonlight near the picture window
	wearing a rococo Victorian gown.  PUSH IN TIGHT as she is
	embraced by a nude Eric.  He undoes the last few remaining ties
	that hold the gown in place.  FOLLOW THE GOWN as it crumples
	down the length of Shelly's (also otherwise nude) body to the
	floor...

							FLASH ENDS.

	LOW ANGEL - FROM INSIDE THE BEDROOM - ON ERIC

	hanging there, inviting the pain the FLASHES bring.  Breathing
	as though he is pumping iron, pumping up.

	ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN BEDROOM

	embracing a ragged full-length dress that used to be Shelly's.

	FLASH: Eric and Shelly (wearing the same dress), exchange an
	extremely passionate and intimate KISS in the moonlight.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC

	as he drops the dress.  Absorbing the pain and memories.

	ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN LIVING ROOM

	executing a complex roll that winds him up at the windowsill.
	He grasps it with both hands.

	FLASH:  A series of CLOSE SHOTS of Eric and Shelly's HANDS, each
	moving along the other's body.  Curves and dips and contours.
	But Eric's gaze never leaves SHelly's eyes.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AT WINDOW

	His GAZE similarly FIXED.  Bringing his hands away and clapping
	them together, deep breath, fingertips pressed to his face, like
	Kung Fu prep.  When he opens his eyes, the crow is there before
	him on the sill.

				ERIC
		That's better.

	He wipes his torso down with a towel.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		It's almost time.

	He holds his hand in front of his face and he flexes it.  We can
	HEAR tendons CRACKLE like a harness.  Closes it into a powerful
	fist.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	TIGHT on Skank as he slams his fist down on the table.  He has
	a black eye and facial scuffs from his liquor store encounter.

				SKANK
		Top, I made the sumbitch!  Face
		all painted white like some kinda
		fuckin' kabuki homo!

	WIDE ANGLE to include all present:  Lao, Grange, Lao Guards #1 
	and #2, Top Dollar, and a Sentry.  Top dusts up a line and
	rinses his nostrils with brandy.

				LAO
		Sounds like our "Crow" is
		out-maneuvering you.

				TOP DOLLAR
		"Our" Crow...?

				LAO
		Come now.  You've seen the 
		graffiti -- all over the city in
		the few hors it has taken your
		men to drop like plague victims.
		What about your turf, Top?
			(mockingly)
		You don't seem to have ripped out
		anyone's heart yet.

				TOP DOLLAR
			(pissed off)
		The night is young.

				SKANK
			(hot)
		The found T-bird flash-fried to
		what was left of his fucking car!

	Top is angry too, but won't show it to Lao.  He rises and goes
	to the window.  Neon glow.  Top sees something outside, below,
	that really torques him off.

	EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SHOWTIME - NIGHT (TOP'S POV)

	A phantom GRAFFITI ARTIST is spray-painting a crow shape on the
	condemned building right across the street.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	Top whip-drawing an auto pistol and shooting below.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Hey, you little fuckweed!  That's
		against the law!

	His gun smoking.  Momentary empowerment.

				TOP DOLLAR (CONT'D)
		I don't give a shit what kinda
		bird this guy is.

	EXT. WINDOW - NIGHT

	As Top turns from the window,  PULL BACK to incorporate the
	chunky shadows where the lights don't fall.  Eric is there,
	perched on the narrow exterior ledge...but we don't know it
	until he opens his eyes, two dots of white in the blackness.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	LAO AT TABLE -- angered by this macho horseshit, annoyed at his
	time being frittered.

				LAO
		I am sitting over here.

	He SLAMS a palm on the table and the room goes silent.  Top
	looks sheepish.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Do you think this childish
		machismo impresses me?
			(regains composure)
		When I was a boy in Saigon I
		watched my country change one 
		block at a time,  one building at
		a time.  Whole lives erased.  A
		way of life, polluted.  Today, no 
		one forces me to move.  I use my
		powers to change your country, one
		block at a time,  one building at
		a time.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Nice speech.  What's it supposed
		to mean?

				LAO
		Your comprehension is not
		required.  Your cooperation and,
		indeed, your ability are the
		issues on the table.

	Top rallies to this.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Whatever you say, I can do.

	Skank looks around, nervous and jumpy, a contradiction to Top's
	guarantee.

				LAO
		That's reassuring.

	CLOSE-UP - TOP'S SHELL CASING IN ERIC'S HAND

	from the ledge.  Endstamp is for a .45 caliber.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON LEDGE

	He sniffs the cartridge.  We can see Funboy's cartridge in his
	hair.  He fists the shell casing tightly.

	ANGLE - DOWN-TABLE, AT SKANK

	Jittery, grabbing a clip for his own automatic.

				SKANK
		What was that -- !?

	It wasn't anything.  Skank loads, stands and jacks the action on
	his gun.  Lao looks questioningly to Top Dollar.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Too many poppers, Skank.  Relax.  Heel.

	ANGLE - WINDOW BEHIND TOP DOLLAR

	A black blur as Eric arches through, spilling Top.

	ANGLE - MEN SEATED AT TABLE

	Eric back flips the length of the table and kicks the gun from
	Skank's hand.  All react.  Weapons out.

	CLOSE-UP - SKANK'S GUN

	spinning mid-air to land in Eric's open hand!

	GENERAL ANGLE - BIG MOBY SHOOTOUT - (VARIOUS)

	Death cleans house.  Standing on the table, Eric fires rearward
	under his own arm to clip Lao Guard #1.  He pivots, shooting,
	and takes out Lao Guard #2 -- who slams backward into the steel
	door as it being opened by the Sentry outside.  Crash!  The
	door is shut again.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AND LAO

	Grange sprays the room with a Calico 950 Auto, shoving Lao
	beneath the table for cover.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Bullets hit him and demolish everything behind him.  Skank hits
	the deck again.  Eric fires and Lao Guard #1 sucks three hits 
	across the chest, firing convulsively against the ceiling, blowing
	the lights.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR

	springing up from behind table.  But Eric is gone from the field
	of fire and one shot strikes Skank, rising at the far end.

	ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE

	making for the door, Grange as shield.  Lao draws a pistol.  The door
	opens and Lao shoots a Sentry to clear him out of the way.

	ANGLE - TIGHTER ON LAO

	A last look back toward Eric and Grange hustle Lao out.

	Door SLAM o.s.  Top is out of ammo as Eric lands from above
	frame right in front of him and slaps the gun from his hand.

				TOP DOLLAR
			(awed but maintained)
		You want my attention, man you
		got it.

	ANGLE - SKANK UNDER TABLE

	Wounded but clawing toward Eric just the same.

				SKANK
		It's him, Top!  He dusted T-Bird!

	ANGLE - ERIC AND TOP DOLLAR, FACE-TO-FACE

				ERIC
		You have to be SKank.
			(to Top Dollar)
		One moment.

	As he speaks, WIDEN FRAME as he turns and grabs the incoming
	Skank by the hair.

				ERIC
		Thank of a snappy comeback for me
		on your way down.

	Without a beat he pitches Skank right out the window!  Skank howls
	all the way down.

	EXT. STREET - ON POLICE CAR - NIGHT

	Damaged from the wreck, limping home, piloted by our pals Speeg
	and MJ.  Skank smashes down into the roof, imploding the
	flashbar and windshield.  MJ drenches his lap in fresh coffee.

				MJ
		OwwwAAHHH son of a BITCH!

	ANGLE - SIDEWALK ACROSS THE STREET - ON ALBRECHT

	who watches with slow marvel from the shadows
				ALBRECHT
		Jesus Christ...

	He runs to assist the demolished cruiser.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - RESUMING - NIGHT

	Just Top, Eric, corpses, and lazily drifting gunsmoke.

				ERIC
		Top Dollar, you're the only one
		here still wasting good air...

				TOP DOLLAR
		Five large, in the drawer right 
		over there.  I never saw you.

				ERIC
		Do you know what you destroyed?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Take the dope, too.

	Eric backhands Top into the wall.  Gets in his face, seething.

				ERIC
		A year ago.  A very nice lady
		circulated a petition.  She died.
		Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.

				TOP DOLLAR
		That's ancient history.

				ERIC
		It's yesterday!  Do you know what
		you destroyed?

	Top Dollar yells right back at Eric's anger.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Who gives a fuck!  I'm a
		businessman.  You gonna do me,
		then do me and shut you're face!

				ERIC
		You don't even remember...

				TOP DOLLAR
		I never forget anything, dickhead.
		That building was a sweep-and-
		clear; the bitch was a nuisance
		with her goddamned petition.  It
		got a little rowdy... end of
		story.

				ERIC
		Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps 
		for you.

	And he grabs Top's head the way he grabbed ALbrecht's earlier,
	slams Top into the wall.  Nose-to-nose.

	FLASH:  Shelly backing away from oncoming Funboy in the loft,
	trying to retreat, nowhere to run, her home invaded, scared.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

	Top is quivering, almost helpless in Eric's hypnotic grasp.
	Eric winces, hard, and --

	FLASH:  Shelly cut, bleeding, struggling against T-Bird.  Wild.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

	Viciously close, more intimate and lethal than anything.

				ERIC
		You're a detail man, Top -- you
		need to see more.

	This time Top tries to twist from Eric's grasp but it's no good.

	FLASH: Shelly, comatose in ICU, eyes fixed and staring, 
	hoses darting in and out, cold blue refrigerator light.

	Bloody, bruised and broken (from Albrecht;s memory)

							FLASH ENDS.

	CLOSE-UP - TOP DOLLAR

	arching, stiffening in pain.

	CLOSE-UP - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

				ERIC
		All of her pain, Top.  Thirty
		hours.  All at once...

	Eric bears down on Top Dollar again.  Top screams.  Blood begins
	to leak from his eyes, nose, ears.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		...all for you.

	FLASH:  Rapidfire CLOSE-UPS.  A jagged compound fracture,
	jutting, Shelly's eye, blood-red sclera, purpled and sunken.

	Her scraped-raw hand clawing at air.  Icebox lighting.  A TIGHT
	SHOT of her monitor going flatline: eeeeeeeeeeeeee...

	TWO-SHOT - RESUMING ERIC AND TOP DOLLAR.

	as Top sags in Eric's grasp, terror fixing his wide-staring dead
	eyes.  Eric lets him drop like a laundry sack.

				ERIC
		I didn't think you could handle it
		either.

	O.S. BANG of impact, heavy against the steel door.  Eric turns.

	ANGLE - STEEL DOOR

	as it is battered down by a squad of police using a power-ram.
	All weapons snap up to bear on Eric.

				LEAD SWAT
		That's all she wrote, Bozo!  You
		stand down now, and that's an
		order!

	ANGLE - ERIC AS HE MOVES

	using his foot to shove the massive conference table at the 
	incoming SWATS while launching himself into the air, flipping
	toward the window and arching through cleanly as the cops open
	fire on command.  Bullets tear the room to pieces.

				LEAD SWAT
		The fire escape's covered.

	EXT. SHOWTIME - FRONT FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

	Picking up Eric on his dive through the window, bullets chasing
	him.  Immediate police fire from below sparks off the ironwork.
	Eric ducks slugs balletically and scampers to the roof.

	ANGLE - SHOWTIME ROOFTOP EDGE

	Eric somersaults over.  Bullets chip brick in his wake.

	STREET LEVEL - UP ANGLE TOWARD ROOF.

	Showtime girded police cars and MARKSMEN, Eric a distant
	shadow figure above.  Here comes a TEAM LEADER with a bullhorn.

				TEAM LEADER (FILTERED)
		On the roof!  Keep firing!  Keep
		firing!

	A fury of law enforcement ordnance cuts loose all around him.

	RESUMING ERIC ON SHOWTIME ROOF EDGE

	A forearm up against the fusillade.  Below him --

	ANGLE - PIT FRONT FIRE ESCAPE 

	Here come Lead SWAT and his Merry MEN.

	MOVING ANGLE - WITH ERIC - ADJACENT ROOFTOP

	Eric runs for it.  Half a story higher.  He hits the wall and
	skitters up, gripping tiny cracks in the brickwork.

	ANGLE - RESUMING MEN ON FRONT SHOWTIME FIRE ESCAPE.

	Lead SWAT hesitates -- because of what he sees.

				LEAD SWAT
		Holy shit, it's spiderman.

	He tries to pull a bead and fires too late.

				LEAD SWAT (CONT'D)
		What're you boy scouts staring at!
		Let's Go!  Let's go!  Let's go!

	MOVING ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON NEXT ROOF

	He sprints to the far edge and dives to the next lower rooftop.
	As he lands he is nailed by a helicopter spotlight, boring in 
	from behind and above the row of buildings.

	MOVING ANGLE - THE STREET BELOW

	COPS below, COPS in the chopper, everyone rushing parallel to 
	Eric, trying to keep up.

	ERIC'S POV - THE STREET, THE HELICOPTER

	PAN QUICK to the next ledge.  COPS right behind him on the roof
	as well.

	WITH ERIC - AS HE RUNS TO THE EDGE.

	and finds a void waiting there.  No connecting building.

	ANOTHER MOVING ANGLE - ERIC

	staying ahead of the search light.  A fantastic series of artful
	moves that wind him up at the rear edge of the roof.

	ANGLE - SWAT MEN ON NEXT ROOF

	sighting Eric as the light picks him out.  Eric glances at 
	them... then jumps.

				CHOPPER PILOT (O.S./FILTERED)
		He's off the roof.  We can't see
		him.

	CLOSE-UP - LEAD SWAT

	pulling his weapon off target, because there is not target.  

				LEAD SWAT
		Dammit to hell!
			(beat; to men)
		Come on.

	ANGLE - ALLEY - STREET LEVEL

	Eric lands like a falling safe, scattering garbage.  But he's 
	okay, up and running.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S RUNNING POV - END OF ALLEY

	as his escape is cut off by a police car that screeches to a 
	stop, blocking the exit.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC

	as he backpedals, scanning for an alternate escape.

				ALBRECHT
			(from car)
		Come on!

	CLOSER ANGLE  - POLICE CAR

	We can see Albrecht.  Eric dives inside and the car burns rubber.

	INT. ALBRECHT'S CAR - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

	Albrecht harried and frantic, but in control.

				ALBRECHT
		Keep your head down!

	He twists and turns the car, glancing rearward for pursuit.  

	Gradually he calms down.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		I figured you might need a ride 
		home.

	Eric looks up at him from his half-concealed crouch.

				ERIC
		It's done.
				ALBRECHT
		I figured as much.  Did you cap
		off Funboy.

				ERIC
		Funboy had to leave this mortal 
		coil.

				ALBRECHT
		Yeah, among others.
			(sees Eric's condition)
		Hey, man -- you're hit.

				ERIC
		It's only a flesh wound.

				ALBRECHT
		It's only fourteen or fifteen 
		flesh wounds.

	Eric sits up as the car gains distance.  Grabs the cigarette out 
	of ALbrecht's mouth.  Takes his single puff.

				ERIC
		You shouldn't smoke these.

	He pitches the smoke out the open car window.

				ALBRECHT
		Great.  Litterbug of the Living
		Dead.

	Eric turns back to Albrecht.

				ERIC
		I'm finished.

	Eric shoots him a doubtful look.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I mean, I've done what I came to
		do.  It shouldn't hurt this much.
		But it will pass...

				ALBRECHT
			(not buying it)
		Right.
			(beat)
		You sure I can't just take you to 
		the emergency ward?

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT - ON ALBRECHT'S CAR

	It hangs a turn and their escape is made.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		They couldn't do anything for me.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		How 'bout the morgue?

				ERIC (O.S.)
		No.  I have one more thing to do.

	EXT. STREET - ANOTHER PART OF THE CITY - NIGHT

	Lonelier, less traffic, more deserted.

	ANGLE - ON ALBRECHT AND ERIC THROUGH WINDSHIELD - TRAVELLING

				ALBRECHT
		You're gonna kill somebody else.
			(beat; no response)
		We're gonna stop and get a shit-load
		of Band-Aids?

	Eric is obviously fighting to stay centered, stay conscious.
	His last fight has caused him a great deal of damage, taken a
	lot out of him.  He needs to recharge.

				ERIC
		I have to prepare for an 
		anniversary.  This coming night.

	HOLD on their two kinds of determination. as we

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY

	High blue sky.  It might even be pretty if it wasn't Detroit.

	INT. LAO'S CLUB OFFICE - DAY

	The TV flybank pulses with videotaped images of Club Trash's of
	various performers -- including Diabolique.  On several screens,
	one-by-one, various images of a guitar-playing Eric Draven
	FREEZE-FRAME as we PULL BACK to the desk.  Lao has the 8x10 from
	the corridor gallery.  He places it within eyeshot and resumes
	work on the desk BELOW FRAME;  we can't see it yet, among other
	scattered research and inconcubula.

	ANGLE - GRANGE

	Entering and crossing to the desk.  As he comes up to the desk,
	he DRAWS BACK.

				GRANGE
		What... the hell is that?

				LAO
			(calmly)
		This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes,
		it is real.

	NEW ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE

	Revealing Lao with a sealed cage, holding a large, live cobra in
	his hands.  The killing blade is nearby.

				GRANGE
		That thing is poisonous.

				LAO
		Extremely so.
			(beat)
		You and I are the recipients of
		unwanted good fortune, in the form 
		of a man everyone is calling The Crow.

	Grange makes a face.  Can't keep his eyes off the cobra.

				GRANGE
		Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...

				LAO
		I intend no slight to you, but I
		cannot find the English to
		adequately express just what he
		is.  I suppose Western mythology
		would describe him as a Fury.
		
				GRANGE
		Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.

	Lao chuckles indulgently.

				LAO
		Do you know of spirit assassins?
		You do know the dead can rise?
		Properly motivated, of course.

				GRANGE
		Like some sort of zombie on a 
		revenge trip.

				LAO
		Mmm.  But tonight I can take what
		is his.

				GRANGE
		Only thing you'll get from that
		clown is a faster way to die.
				LAO
		To the contrary...

	ZZLIP!  Lao smoothly BEHEADS the snake with the Blade against
	the stone surface of the desk and discards the writhing body.
	He squeezes behind one of the eyes and a VENOM SAC protrudes
	like a dark pimento.

	LAO pulls it free of the milky, clinging tissue and EATS IT.
	Off Grange's stunned expression.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		...all the dying tonight will be 
		done by the former Eric Draven.

	Lao exhibits the blade to Grange as though it explains all.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Who is only invulnerable so long
		as he cares about the dead.  When
		he begins to care about the living,
		you'll find his heart can bleed...
		and I want it to bleed for me.

				GRANGE
		Kill a dead guy?

	Lao POPS the second venom sac; swallows it.  Pleased.

				LAO
		Truly kill him.  So I may crush
		his skull and smoke it.

	Lao SHRUGS.  Grange can handle it.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Let it suffice that I need him...
		and to get to him, we'll need his 
		little friend.

	Finally, an assignment Grange can comfortable understand. 

	INT. LOFT - DAY

	Eric, barechested, emotionally tapped, clean of makeup and blood
	but exhausted, his movements retarded and slack.  Staring
	fixedly into the fireplace,  where he burns everything he could
	find of his past:  the junk from the makeup table, the masques,
	photos of himself and Shelly.

	INT. LOFT - STAIRWELL - DAY

	Moving with Elly as she nears the open loft door.  She PEEKS
	cautiously inside.

	RESUME ERIC

	Without looking toward the door, he speaks.

				ELLY
		What's going on...?

				ERIC
		A remembrance.
			(beat)
		A closure.

	And Eric consigns to the fire the DRESS we saw earlier.

	Holds a photograph in a broken frame.  Cracked glass.  Subject:
	Eric and Shelly, goofing for the camera.

	He chucks it into the fire.  Draws a deep breath.

				ERIC
		Better now.  I feel good.  How are
		you, Elly, my friend?

	Elly is clearly uncomfortable, groping for an excuse just to see 
	Eric.  Eric is staring at her, intently.

				ERIC
		What is it?
				ELLY
		I knew.  I knew I knew you.  Even
		with the makeup and stuff you
		wore.
			(beat)
		You really loved her, didn't you?

	CLOSE-UP - FIREPLACE

	The photo burns and blackens in the grate.

				ERIC
		You brought flowers.  As long as 
		you don't forget her, Elly, she 
		lives.

				ELLY
			(upset)
		She's dead.  She's gone.  And now
		you're just gonna go away and
		never come back, too.  I hate this
		place; it isn't fair.

				ERIC
		Elly...

	He draws her close.  Wipes away an errant tear with his thumb.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Sometimes the people we care about
		are gone, for no reason.  Sometimes
		that's really tough.  I cry.  But if 
		the people we love are gone, we keep them --

	He taps Elly's temple, then his won.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		-- right here.  It's a big
		responsibility.  And that makes it 
		okay to mourn.
			(beat)
		I know that if you weren't here,
		I'd be very sad.

	Elly gives Eric a hug.

				ELLY
		You look funny without your white
		face on.  Like it's your day off
		or something.

	He quizzical expression amuses him.

				ERIC
		Somebody here wants to meet you. Gabriel?

	Gabriel the cat has wandered near the fireplace to join them.  
	Elly is immediately smitten.  Happy.
		
				ELLY
		I remember him!  Here, Gabriel...
		here kitty... Gabriel... Is he
		still yours?

				ERIC
		I think he's yours, now.

	The cat seems to like that idea.  Elly wraps him hugely up in
	her arms, talking to him: "How're you, Gabriel, whatcha doin'"

	ANOTHER ANGLE - TIGHTER ON ERIC

	While Elly is preoccupied with the cat, Eric gives up his last
	bit of Shelly to the fire - a portrait photo of her, small and 
	creased.  He puts it in the fire, watches it burn for a beat,
	then turns to Elly.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I have something else for you.

	BACK FOCUS as Eric lifts off his neck Shelly's ring for Elly's
	inspection.  The ring twirls large in f.g.

				ELLY
		Nobody ever gave me something like
		that before.  Ever.

	Eric places it around her neck.  Elly BEAMS.

				ERIC
		Shelly would've wanted you to have
		it.  This way, you'll think of her 
		every time you see it...

				ELLY
		And she'll be alive.  Up here.

	Elly TAPS her own temple with a smile, keeping one hand on the
	ring.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Blowing wind.  TRICK-OR-TREATERS wisp past.  Ghosts, witches,

	ANGLE - PUSH IN ON CAR

	as the window cranks down to reveal Grange at the wheel.

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Darla nervously smoking, doing her best to stay clean, but
	jittery.  Elly enters the shabby living room with Gabriel in her
	arms.

				DARLA
		I was wonderin' where you'd
		gotten to --
			(she sees Gabriel)
		Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?

				ELLY
		He was a present.  Besides, we're
		moving anyway.  You said.

				DARLA
		We'll discuss this later.
		Obviously.  You left the door open.

	DARLA points.  As Elly goes to close the door it opens.

	NEW ANGLE - FAVOR THE DOOR

	Grange enters accompanied by two Asian martial arts STRONGARMS
	(Lao Guards #3 & #4).  Grange looks around, bemused, his manner
	avuncular.

				GRANGE
		Hi, Elly.  Remember me?

	Elly's surprise is evident.  Darla is just plain pissed off.

				DARLA
		I don't remember you.  And I don't
		remember inviting...

				GRANGE
			(to his MEN)
		If she opens her face again, shoot
		her in the head.

	ANGLE - DARLA

	Mouth stalling in the ON position as Lao Guard #3 pulls a

	as he scoops her up, captive.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AND GABRIEL

	He strolls the circuit of the room, stopping near the window.

				GRANGE
		You should listen to your mother.
		She said no cats.

	Grange pitches Gabriel right out the window.

				ELLY
		Gabriel!

	Grange pulls out a compact Polaroid camera.

				GRANGE
		Now that's the expression I want.

	ANGLE - ELLY AND GUARD #4

	As she struggle mightily, to no avail, as Grange moves in to
	snap his shot.

				GRANGE (CONT'D)
		Say cheese.

	He snaps.  On the SX-70 WHIRR and flash white-out, we --

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING ROOFTOP - SUNSET

	Dark clouds have gathered to highlight the sunset.  Eric plays
	the guitar - LOUD, the SHelly theme in a major key.  Where
	before it was wandering, uncertain, now it's bold and
	heartbreaking.  Definitive.  Pain replaced by strength and a
	sense of homecoming.

	As Eric gets to the end of it, the notes are flying out... At
	the climax, rips the guitar up over his head and brings it 
	down -- SMASH -- on the Pignose.  He's finished here.

	ROOF EDGE - FROM STREET

	as the broken guitar SAILS OUT over the building edge.

	INT. LOFT BUILDING STAIRWELL - DUSK

	As Eric comes down the stairs.  Notices the open door.

	INT. LOFT - DUSK

	He enters, cautiously, to find an envelope laying in the middle
	of the floor.  He opens it.

	INSERT - THE POLAROID OF ELLY

	with a note.

	UP ANGLE AT ERIC READING THE NOTE - FROM FLOOR

	The crow flies past behind him as his expression hardens.

	NEW ANGLE -  A MOMENT LATER - FAST AND HARD

	Eric brutally crisscrosses his arms with black vinyl tape.

	ANGLE - ERIC DRESSING

	Pulling on black night-fighting clothes, skintight.

	ANGLE - THE VANITY

	as Eric (seen in mirror) jabs his fingers into the white
	makeup and smears it on.

							SMASH CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET NEAR CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Eric marches along in plain view since everyone around him seems
	to be in costume.  The wind whips his coat.  KIDS bustle around
	him with trick-or-treat bags.  The crow perched on his shoulder.

	ERIC'S POV - CITY SKYLINE

	Somewhere, a few blocks over, a building is burning.

	ANGLE - ERIC WALKING

	A fire engine races past on the street.  He steps out in its
	wake and crosses over to --

	MEDIUM MOVING SHOT - THE CEMETERY

	waiting for him as he crosses to the fence.  Beyond the fence,
	in the distance, the church looms.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	He pauses.  A KID in a Creature from the Black Lagoon mask
	comes, passes Eric, then comes back for a touch.

				CREATURE KID
		Trick or treat!

	Eric smiles.  Not tonight.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Eric is standing over the grave of Shelly Webster, looking down.
	He holds for a moment then moves on.

	EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

	Eric ascends toward giant oak doors, tres Gothique.  The crow
	flaps past, leading him.

	NEW ANGLE - TOP OF STEPS -- where waits the Skull Cowboy.  As
	Eric approaches, the Skull Cowboy interposes himself between
	Eric and the huge double doors.

	Eric glares up, defiant.  Moves up the steps.  The Skull Cowboy
	extends a skeletal hand.  STOP.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Stop screwing around.

	TIGHT ON ERIC

	Angry, ready to battle:  You talking to me?

				SKULL COWBOY (CONT'D)
		Your job is done.  You interfere
		with the living again.

				ERIC
		Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I 
		might die.
			(beat)
		I've already done that.  I don't 
		need anyone's help.  Yours 
		included.

	STAIR ANGLE - ERIC AND SKULL COWBOY

	Eric lower, Skull Cowboy superior, the storm wild around them.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Do this thing and you will be
		vulnerable.  The blood will not
		return.
			(beat)
		No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.

				ERIC
		Fine with me.

	He ADVANCES a step up; the Skull Cowboy Hold fast.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You'll be alone.

				ERIC
		I'm already alone.

	INT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT

	Through a castle keep-like slit, Grange monitors Eric's
	arrival.  He speaks into a headset.

				GRANGE
		We've got company.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		Is he inside?

	GRANGE'S POV - ERIC

	Eric Talking to dead air.  Almost arguing with it.  Eerie.

	RESUME GRANGE

	As he talks into his mike he hefts a nightscoped, laser-sighted
	sniper's rifle.

	EXT. CHURCH - RESUMING ERIC ON STEPS - NIGHT

	Eric, eyes steely, stares down the Skull Cowboy.

				ERIC
		Don't waste my time.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Very well, it's your ass.

	And the wind kicks up around them both, powerfully.

	ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY (EFFECT)

	As the force of the storm dust-devils around him and begins to
	disassemble him.  The fire in his eye sockets goes out.  His hat
	flies off an is pulverized by the wind.  The garments begin to
	disintegrate and blow around, rotten cerements falling apart in
	mid-air.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS -- transfixed by this unexpected
	development.  A shard of the Skull Cowboy blows past Eric's face 
	and transmutes to dust!

	RESUME SKULL COWBOY AT TOP OF STEPS (EFFECT)

	Transparent, ancient bones, crumbling and blowing away.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS

	As Eric lunges for what's left of his mysterious, smart-ass
	mentor
	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S LUNGING HAND

	Meeting only a swirl of vaporous dust where the Skull Cowboy's
	heart would have been.

	TIGHT ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS

	He has time to register the dust in his palm before it, too,
	renders down to nothingness,  leaving a vague green glow that
	dies.  And as he looks to the sky --

	UP ANGLE - THE CROW

	flapping down to land on Eric's shoulder.  Eric is astonished.

				ERIC
		But why are you still here?

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	No answer in the crow's eyes.

	RESUME AND FOLLOW ERIC

	That's good enough for Eric.  He marches to the double doors and
	shoves them back.

	INT. CHURCH - AS ERIC COMES THROUGH THE DOORS - NIGHT

	The high breeze blows in with him, disturbing dust in the
	disused Gothic dark.  Hollow cathedral ECHOES to sounds.  A
	giant 27" TV positioned on the alter, broadcasting static.

	LONG SHOT - ERIC AS HE APPROACHES THE ALTER - ("CROWVISION")

	Leery of potential danger from a thousand dark places.

	ANGLE - THE TV - AS ERIC ENTERS FRAME

	Onscreen:  Elly, gagged with duct tape and handcuffed to an iron
	ring bolted to a flagstone wall.  Could be anywhere inside the
	church.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		I believe our friend Elly call
		you Mister Crow.
			(beat)
		Please acknowledge; the mike
		will pick you up.
		
				ERIC
		I can see her.

				LAO
		Of course you can.
	ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running
	lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which
	THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.

				LAO (CONT'D; O.S./FILTERED)
		Don't permit your rage to cloud
		the issue.  I believe in barter.
		I propose a simple trade.

	Grange sights his weapon.

	CROSSHAIR POV - ERIC AT THE ALTER

	Bluring as Grange resights.  Eric is not the target.  Blur
	FINDS the crow at the far end of the nave, perched in front of
	a giant stained glass window.

	NEW ANGLE - GRANGE -- squeezing off two quick, SILENCED shots.

	ANGLE - STAINED GLASS WINDOW -- the first shot blows a hole in
	some pastoral religious presentation.  TINKLE of glass.

	ANGLE - ERIC -- Spinning at the quiet !pfut! sound, to witness.

	ANGLE - INCOMING DART - ("CROWVISION")

	SPinning and hissing venomously.

	ANGLE - ERIC DUCKS

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC AT ALTER - INCLUDE TV

	His knees buckle.  Sympathetic PAIN from the hit.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		You intended to finish this
		evening in the cemetery.  I am 
		here to help you on your way.

	ANGLE - RESUMING GRANGE IN GALLERY

	Swapping his tranquilizer gun for a more lethal rifle, similarly 
	scoped.  He sights the fallen Eric in a spray of green light.

	HIGH ANGLE - HAND HELD - ERIC AT ALTER

	Groping for support to drag himself back to standing.

				GRANGE (O.S.)
		I've got him if you want him.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		No shooting.

				GRANGE
			(into headset)
		Move in, guys.

	HIGH ANGLE - THE SANCTUARY -- as Lao Guards #3 and #4 move
	into light, closing on Eric's position in the center of isle.
	Both wield calico's and one bears a sword.

	CLOSE ANGLE - ALTER -- Lao makes his entrance from shadow
	wearing a brisk pugilist get-up, a practical fighting outfit.
	Makes a show of drawing the killing blade.

				LAO
		I wish to possess what you have now.

				ERIC
		I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.

				LAO
		I know.  That is why I will
		prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?

	Eric CRAMPS UP, CLUTCHING his throat in obvious pain.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AT STAINED GLASS WINDOW

	Holding the crow by the neck, TIGHTLY.  He plucks the tranq dart
	from the its body.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AS LAO MOVES IN CLOSER

	Crashing to one knee, invisibly bludgeoned, struggling to
	breathe.  Lao has no fear, walking around the stricken Eric.

				LAO
		Sooner or later, my action were
		destined to bring me a genuine
		Fury.  And it turned out to be you.
		At last.  I appreciate your
		abilities as few mortals can.
		That's why I desire them.

				ERIC
		You're too late.  There was a guy
		outside - on the stairs - you
		really need to talk to.  But he 
		turned to dust and blew away.
			(beat, gasping)
		I don't have any power for you to take.

				LAO
		I don't believe that.
	Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES
	his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may
	perceive a palpable degree of relief.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Time for you to die for me.
			 (beat)
		Funny, how the dead can still

	Albrecht digs through a sling bag of weaponry, trying to
	simultaneously monitor the peephole, muttering sotto to

				ALBRECHT
		Had to go get yourself hip-deep in
		shit, didn't you, my friend.

	It begins to rain.  Albrecht glances resentfully toward the 
	sky.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Give it a rest, huh?

	A hefts a machinegun, clipped over and under.  CUTS LOOSE on
	full auto into the Madonna on the window.

	INT.  CHURCH NAVE - NIGHT

	As the window EXPLODES toward Grange and he sucks big hits from
	behind, DROPPING the crow.  The bird hits the ground, flapping
	weakly.

	LAO GUARDS #3 & #4 exchange a look and whip up their Calicos,
	RETURNING FIRE.

	EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

	Albrecht takes cover as a lot of religious stuff is noisily
	destroyed all around his position.  Chunks of the window
	continue to disintegrate. 

	INT. CHURCH ALTER (NIGHT)

	Eric tuck-and-rolls out of the way as we go CLOSE on Lao, 
	screaming.

				LAO
		I said no shooting!

	Then he's ducking bullets himself as Albrecht STEPS IN through
	the blown out window, the machine gun stuttering on slugs.

	The sanctuary comes apart around Lao.  He RETREATS to the alter
	and EXITS whence he came.

	TIGHT ON PEW -- ERIC DIVES just as Guard #4 comes after him with
	the sword, which chomps into the wood and gets stuck there.
	Guard #4 releases it and cross draws his Calico as ERIC springs
	back into the frame -- STRAIGHT UP.

	TIGHT ON GUARD #4 as Eric's lancing foot propels him backward
	before he can fire.

	INTERCUTS -- ALBRECHT AND GUARD #3 scrambling to reload.  Guard
	changes magazine; Albrecht swaps clips.

	ANGLE - DOWN LENGTH OF PEW -- Guard #4 slides.  Sits up with his 
	gun as Eric, down-pew, grabs the sword.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT WINDOW  firing now with a gun in each hand.

	RESUME ERIC AND GUARD #4, who eats it from Albrecht's gunfire,
	but not before he puts a round through Eric.

	Eric staggers back from the impact but keeps his feet.  

	RESUME ALBRECHT as he tosses away the dry pistol.  His machine
	gun jams, he fights to get the clip.

	ANGLE - GUARD #3 -- reloaded and rising, having caught Albrecht
	dead-bang in the open by the window.

	MOVING ANGLE - WITH ERIC --  A complex leap with the sword
	flashing.  He lands near Guard #3 and SLASHES UPWARDS, blade up.

	CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3 -- screaming in pain, gaping DOWN O.S.

	TIGHT ON ALBRECHT - looking UP, following the trajectory of
	something AIRBORNE toward him.

	CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3'S Calico spinning mid-air with Guard #3s
	HANDS still attached, severed mid-forearm by Eric's devastating
	strike.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT drops Guard #3 -- to REVEAL Eric in the
	background.  Eric salutes Albrecht with the tip of the sword.

	WITH ALBRECHT as he moves into the nave, which has been torn
	apart by gunfire.  Hazy smoke.  Two dead guys.  And Eric.

				ALBRECHT
		You sorta looked like you might
		need my help.

				ERIC
		This isn't your place.  This isn't
		your fight.  And I don't need
		your help.

				ALBRECHT
		You're welcome.

				ERIC
		Leave here.  Don't do this.  I
		don't want you here.

				ALBRECHT
		The hell you say.  This isn't just 
		about you any more.

	Eric stares dead-on at Albrecht, acidly, then BREAKS the Guard's 
	sword, dropping the pieces and turning his back on Albrecht, who
	pursues Eric to: 

	INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE - TO BELL TOWER - NIGHT

	The crow FLAPS UPWARD through the void.  Eric grabs the thick
	bellrope, testing it.  A final look to Albrecht.

				ERIC
		Don't interfere.

				ALBRECHT
		You're bleeding, man.  You can't
		make it.

	Eric shinnies up the bellrope, ignoring Albrecht.

	ON ALBRECHT

	Watching as Eric dissappears from view, fast..  Grumbles.

				ALBRECHT
		You won't mind if I just take the
		stairs, then, smartass...

	He hefts his arsenal bag of hardware and begins to plod up the
	steps.

	ANGLE - MOVING WITH ERIC ON THE ROPE -- A weird perspective of
	speed climb.  Zip!  All the way to the top.

	EXT - CHURCH ROOF - NIGHT

	Slanted, shingled, slippery, dark.  Lightning deep in the turbid
	clouds.  The crow circles as Eric RISES INTO FRAME.

				ERIC
		Here I am.

	DOWNFRAME lightning STRIKES the ornate LIGHTNING ROD (large,
	Victorian, lance-like) at the far end of the roof from the bell
	tower.

	SILHOUETTING Lao and Elly standing in front of it.  Elly
	flinches at the strike.

				LAO
		Can you fly, Crow man?

	INT. BELLTOWER SPIRAL STAIRS - RESUMING ALBRECHT

	He stops his ascent to light a cigarette.

				ALBRECHT
		I ain't cut out for this superhero
		shit.

	EXT. CHURCH ROOF - RESUMING LAO - NIGHT

	Lao SNAPS Elly's free handcuff to the dimly glowing  lightning
	rod and advances, one foot on either side of the peak of the
	roof, his blade brandished.

	CLOSE MOVING SHOT - ERIC -- Hands up to grapple, but
	weaponless.  He spiders to meet Lao, suddenly PICKING UP SPEED
	and RUNNING along the precarious peak.

	Lao sees him coming, braces to strike, but Eric executes a BROAD
	FLYING LEAP right over Lao's head.

	ERIC LANDS, SLIPS, sprawls sideways, clinging to the peak of the
	roof.  Lao hurries in to slash with the blade, as Eric averts.
	The steel RINGS.  Eric converts his dodge into a low spin kick
	that DUMPS Lao.

	Eric SPREAD-EAGLES to keep from falling.  Distantly, Lao
	similarly saves himself.

	NEW ANGLE -- THE FIGHT -- Here comes Lao, crabbing back toward
	the peak.  Eric ROLLS to Elly's position, GRABS the lightning
	rod and tries to wrest it loose.

	SIZZLE OF FLESH as Eric's hands are scorched: the metal is still
	blue-hot.

	MOVING WITH LAO as Eric battles to free the lightning rod.  Lao
	closes up distance, gives a warcry and prepares to swing as - 

	Eric WRENCHES the rod loose and turns to deflect Lao's blow.
	The weapons spark as they meet... and there goes Elly, her
	handcuff freed, SLIDING DOWN THE ROOF SLOPE.

	ANGLE  -- ROOF SLOPE -- WITH ERIC  as he dodges Lao by using the
	lightning rod to vault down to where Elly is about to slip off
	the roof.

	With the rod embedded in the roof, Eric hangs on, and elly hangs 
	on to Eric.

	UP ANGLE -- LAO, a dark figure against the night sky, raising
	the sword.

				LAO
		Face me!

	Eric guides Elly to the top of one of the flying buttresses.
	When he looks up, Lao is gone.

	ANGLE - BELL TOWER -- Albrecht's head pokes up at last.  Looks
	around, finally spots Eric below and to the left.  YELLS, serio-comic.

				ALBRECHT
		Is he dead yet?

	INSERT - ALBRECHT'S HOLSTER as Lao's hand draws Albrecht's
	gun quickly.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND LAO --Lao has blindsided Albrecht.

				LAO
		No.  You are.

	He jams the gun into the base of ALbrecht's neck and fires three times.

	CLOSE ANGLE - ERIC - He's too far away to matter.  Shock.

	INSERT - ALBRECHT'S CIGARETTE as it rolls down the slope,
	trailing sparks, snuffing out.

	ANGLE - ERIC holding onto the lightning rod as lightning CUTS the
	night above him.

	ANGLE -- LAO AT BELL TOWER, triumphant and a bit wild, SHOUTING.
				LAO
		You've caused another death,
		Mister Draven!  The girl will die
		as well -- because of you!

	ANGLE - ELLY ON FLYING BUTTRESS

	The base of a triangle - Lao, Eric, Elly.

				ELLY
		You go to hell, you pervert!

	RESUME ERIC

	Rage over the loss of Albrecht.  He RISES, hurting but mad as
	hell.  GLARES UP toward Lao.

				ERIC
		And how many lives have you destroyed?

				LAO
		I took yours from you.  Your
		little girlfriend?  I took hers,
		too.  Your meaningless, petty
		life?  I took it so that tonight
		your existence might gain a
		purpose.  You're no avenger.
		You're mine.

	PUSH IN TIGHT ON ERIC.

	Eyes alight with hatred for Lao.

				ERIC
			 (to himself)
		You're right, I'm not an avenger. 
		Not any more.

	As lightning strikes, Eric Fires his gaze TOWARD THE SKY.

	HIGH ANGLE - LAO ON ROOFTOP - ("CROWVISION")

	SEEING the crash dive toward Lao through the row's eyes.

	ANGLE  - LAO ON ROOFTOP

	As the crow wings down INTO FRAME and lights on Lao's head, CLAWING!

	CLOSE-UP -- THE CROW ON LAO'S HEAD slashing with its claws.
	Pecking out Lao's eyes.

	WITH ERIC -- on the roofslope as he totters but maintains his
	climb, the crow/Lao UPFRAME B.G.

	RESUME LAO -- as the crow abandons him.  Lao STAGGERS AND FALLS
	down the roof - toward Eric.
	SLANTED ANGLE -- ERIC AND LAO -- Eric ARRESTS Lao's fall,
	fisting lapels and bringing him nose to nose.  Fury.

				ERIC
		Time for a sacrifice.

	Lao's face is a hideous bloody mask with black holes where the
	eyes used to be.  He smiles gruesomely.

				LAO
		I don't need eyes to take what I
		want from you.

	He EMBRACES Eric and RAMS the killing blade deep into Eric's
	back!

	ON ERIC as he looks down to see the blade protruding from his
	sternum.  Tight grimace.  A lot of pain.

				ERIC
		Can you fly?

	He pulls Lao into a BACKWARD ROLL down the roof, HOLDING HIM
	TIGHT.

	MOVING ANGLE -- INTERCUTS -- ERIC AND LAO FALL

	Eric lands on his back, forcing the blade THROUGH himself and
	INTO Lao.  Eric completes the roll and KICKS Lao off INTO SPACE,
	the killing blade still embedded in him!

	WITH LAO as crashes, sliding, sprawling down PAST Elly's
	position.  Gets to his knees atop the flying buttress.  Sees the
	blade in his own chest.

	CLOSE-UP - ELLY - she sees it all happen.

	RESUME LAO - a regretful look toward Eric.  He PLUMMETS off the 
	roof edge.

	ANGLE - ERIC SLIDES DOWN ROOF --  He slows, stopping when Elly
	is in frame.  He clutches his own chest.  Regards his own
	shaking hand, drenched in his won blood.  Glazed.

	ON ELLY, as she finally gets the duct tape off her mouth, trying
	to get to Eric.  She flails and cries out.

				ELLY
		Don't let me fall!

	CLOSE-UP -- their hands finally meet and GRASP TIGHT.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (LATER) (RAIN)

	A low angle TRACKING SHOT (as when we first met Elly).

	Eric's and Elly's feet pass graves.  Eric's pace is slow, crippled, 
	limping.  They STOP at a grave where elly BENDS INTO FRAME to steal 
	the flowers there.

	Eric is bloody and out of it.  She helps him walk.

				ELLY
		Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.

				ERIC
		In a better place.  I hope.

				ELLY
		You're not gonna come back, are you?

	Eric's response is halting and uncertain.  But he tries to give
	her hope.  He reaches for Shelly's ring around her neck, holds
	it up to her.

				ERIC
		I don't know if I can.  But you
		have this... and you know where to come.

				ELLY
		You mean you'll, like' dig your way
		out of the grave?  Euww.

	Eric is amused by this in spite of his grievous injuries.

	He grasps Elly's face in his hands and bends, painfully,to kiss
	her on the forehead.

				ERIC
		For you, I'll try.  Promise.

	MOVE WITH ERIC

	Spent, empty, he holds the rose determinedly, but he's never
	going to make it the few yards back to his own grave.  So close.

	His legs finally go and he collapses onto the humus.  One
	groping hand tries to drag him further.

				ERIC
		Leave me now.

	ANGLE - ELLY

	Tears on her face.  She can't watch this.  She TURNS and drops
	the flowers on Shelly's grave.

	ERIC'S POV - HIS OWN GRAVE

	Still too far away to matter.

	RESUME ERIC ON GROUND

	He gives it up, his face sinking into the wet grass for a beat
	before SHELLY'S HAND intrudes INTO FRAME to GRASP his hand.

	No ethereal glow, no heavenly choir... just a near-dead Eric's
	blank-faced astonishment, and he moves forward.

	ANGLE - ELLY - SHELLY'S GRAVE BG

	She struggles to get her hood up against the rain and roughly
	wipes the moisture from her face with her sleeve.  She turns
	toward Eric's grave.  Then, surprised, she looks close.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S GRAVE

	Eric is gone.  The white rose lies neatly on the top of the
	undisturbed  earth there.

	HIGH ANGLE - CEMETERY

	Emphasizing that Elly is now ALONE in the graveyard.

	LOW ANGLE on Elly, ROSE in the foreground --

	She walks OFF.  HOLD the rose.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY (OVERCAST)

	A grey day but no rain.  Elly stands wistfully by the window,
	her doll on standby.  The apartment is in order and perhaps we
	notice a few new items.  Gabriel the cat, miraculously ALIVE, is
	sprawled on a chair, licking himself.  Darla BUSTLES INTO FRAME
	B.G.  Her wardrobe more upscale, her hair done.  Her manner is
	hectic but natural.

				DARLA
		Worktime, kiddo.  First day, new
		job, gotta go.

	This does not get the expected smile from Elly.

				DARLA (CONT'D)
		You sure you're gonna be okay?

	Elly turns from the window and NODS silently.

	ELLY'S POV - OUTSIDE

	The aforementioned grey day in the city.

	ANGLE - DARLA AND ELLY AT THE WINDOW.

	Darla comes up.  Arm around Elly.  Cheer up; he attitude much
	more connected and loving.  PUSH IN ON ELLY so we know she is
	clutching SHelly's ring tightly in her hand.  Darla looks past
	Elly, out the window.

				DARLA
		At least it finally stopped
		raining.

				ELLY
		It can't rain all the time.

	Darla kisses Elly on the temple and it out the door.  Elly OPENS
	her hand to consider the ring.  She looks back out the window --

	ANGLE - THE CROW ON THE LEDGE

	Elly is looking right at it.  Same crow.  We're positive.  So is
	Elly.  It TAKES WING and flies away.

	EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

	An UP ANGLE from Eric's grave toward the tree as the crow FLIES
	INTO FRAME and perches there, shucking water.  PUSH IN on the
	crow.  Watching.  Waiting.

							SLOW FADE TO DEAD BLACK.

          EXT. LIMBO - DAY/NIGHT
          
          A heavy mist hangs before us - endless and impenetrable. And
          out of that primordial fog a CROW materializes, flying toward
          the camera in slow motion.
          
           
          
          SARAH (O.S.)
          
          I believe there's a place where the restless souls wander. Burdened
          by the weight of their own sadness, they cannot enter Heaven...
          
           
          
          Presently a second shape materializes - a FIGURE ON HORSEBACK.
          A warrior whose baleful eyes shine behind the familiar irony
          mask war paint.
          
           
          
          SARAH (O.S.)
          
          And so they wait, trapped between our world and the next, endlessly
          searching for a way to rid themselves of their pain - in the
          hopes that somehow, some day...
          
           
          
          The figure on horseback sweeps past us, disappearing once again
          into the mists of time.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)

          "CITY OF ANGELS - OCTOBER 29TH - LA NOCHE DE SAN LUCAS"
          
          CLOSE ON A PAIR OF HANDS tearing open a tiny glassine envelope
          filled with powder - our drug du jour - Trinity. The face of
          the envelope has been stamped with an image - a cartoon imp with
          a shit-eating gring giving us the thumbs-up sign.
          
          A MAN lowers his face to the envelope, snorts up the powder.
          The man discards the glassine envelope...
          
          FOLLOWING THE ENVELOPE
          
          as it flutters to the ground, landing "imp-side" up. Let the

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          
          Garbage-poisoned waters wreathed in fog. Although once part of
          a thriving shipping industry, decades of decline have seen these
          docks become a hellish dumping ground. Case in point:
          
          A FATHER AND HIS YOUNG SON
          
          are kneeling next to one another at the end of a pier, their
          arms linked together, then tied behind their backs. DANNY CORVEN
          (8) is quietly sobbing. ASHE (late 20s), tries to calm the frightened
          boy.
          
           
          
          DANNY
          
          I'm sorry, Dad...I'm sorry... I didn't mean to look...

          A bright light comes on. Ashe and Danny turn their heads to avoid

          A camcorder lens as it auto-focuses, bringing Danny's distorted
          face into view via the lens' reflection.

          NEMO, a post-modern sleaze-hound, circles Danny and Ashe with
          a camcorder. He Pats Ashe's face.

          Spider Monkey tucks the flower behind his ear. Danny is praying

          WHOOSH!
          
          We cut to an extreme high-angle shot - God's omniscient POV,
          perhaps.
          
          CURVE
          
          leans up against his motorcycle a few yards away - big, burly,
          shaved head, a ciggie hanging from his lips. He's got a custom
          paint-job on his pearl drop gas tank - a buxom blonde doing the
          "wild thing" with the Grim Reaper. Curve's also the one who just
          dusted himself

          Kali, a cold-eyed heavy-metal femme with a killer's casual stoicism,
          is methodically loading bullets into her revolver. She's taking
          her own sweet time, in defiance of Curve. There's a tension between
          them. Finally, she flicks her wrist, snaps the revolver shut.
          Kali walks up to them...
          
           
          
          DANNY
          
          I'm scared, Dad.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          I know...
          
           
          
          Ashe turns to his executioners, pleading with them...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Listen to me, please. He's just a kid. Let him go. He can't hurt
          you. He doesn't even know who you are...
          
           
          
          ...and puts a bullet through Danny's chest. Ashe SCREAMS.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          NO!!!
          
           
          
          Danny's body slumps forward, dragging Ashe down next to him.
          Ashe stares into his son's lifeless eyes.
          
          Curve saunters over, stares down at Ashe, flicks his cigarette
          butt off into the water.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Nothing personal, sport. Guess you were just in the wrong place
          at the wrong time.
          
           
          
          BANG! BANG! BANG! Curve FIRES a gun into Ashe's back. As Ashe
          crumples...
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Dump 'em. Let's get this cluster-fuck on the road.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          motions to Kali and Spider Monkey. Together, the three of them
          heave Ashe and Danny into the ocean.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Bon voyage, shitheads.
          
           
          
          EXT. OCEAN DEPTHS - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Ashe and Danny sink down into the murky underworld, taking their
          place amongst a thousand other deep-sixed dreams.
          
          ASHE'S POV
          
          falling further and further away from the light of the surface
          world. Bit by bit, Ashe's struggles subside. All we hear now
          is an ever-slowing HEARTBEAT. Darkness begins to close in around
          us, womblike, peaceful...
          
          ...AND OUT OF THE DARKNESS,
          
          something takes shape - a CROW. Winging its way from Ashe's dream-like
          death up through watery depths into a smog-bound cityscape...
          
           
          
          EXT. CITY OF ANGELS - NIGHT
          
           
          
          The Crow flies over a bridge with spans the Styx - the city's
          polluted, man-made river.
          
          THE CROW
          
          rides the thermals above an urban sprawl riven by fires, floods,
          and earthquakes. Smog hangs in the air like an army of ever-present
          ghosts. We pass over a roof where someone has painted a smart-ass
          welcome mat for the benefit of anyone flying overhead - "GO BACK".
          Nevertheless, we continue on.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          They say that time cancels pain. I don't know about that. Eight
          years ago I lost two of my best friends. Two thousand miles later
          I find I'm still living in the past...
          
           
          
          THE CROW
          
          sweeps down into man-made caverns of pigeon-shit concrete and
          grimy glass. Through the bird's eyes we glimpse the city's silent
          HOMELESS. Automobile hulks littering the streets like insect
          husks. The shifting searchlights of police helicopters...
          
          WE PASS OVER SARAH'S ROOFTOP
          
          The Crow circles downward...
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          Every night when I close my eyes the dreams come. That's how
          the dead talk to us, I guess. In the dark, when our souls are
          off wandering...
          
           
          
          INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT
          
           
          
          The Crow lands next to an open window. It perches on the edge,
          looking into the loft.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          I just wish I understood what they were telling me.
          
           
          
          CROW'S POV (ANAMORPHIC)
          
          SARAH, early 20s, lies asleep in bed. She stirs, troubled by
          uneasy dreams, rolls over, opens her eyes...
          
           
          
          INT. SARAH'S LOFT, SLEEPING AREA - NIGHT
          
           
          
          As Sarah rises the Crow flits away like yesterday's memory. Sarah's
          not sure whether or not she dreamed the bird. GABRIEL, the cat
          Sarah inherited from Eric and Shelly, is perched on the end of
          the bed.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Hey, Gabriel...
          
           
          
          Sarah gives the cat an obligatory behind-the-ear scratch, then
          climbs from bed, making her way across the loft.
          
          SARAH'S ARTIST LOFT
          
          is furnished in thrift-store treasures. The loft has an earthy
          warmth to it, in stark contrast to the urban decay outside -
          an island amidst a sea of unrest, dominated by an arching half-circle
          window through which Sarah can view the local wildlife on the
          streets below.
          
          ON SARAH'S CANVASSES
          
          Turbulent oils reminiscent of history's brooding symbolist painters.
          Give Sarah's childhood inspiration, the subject matter is no
          real surprise.
          
          CAMERA ISOLATES a work-in-progress. The painting depicts a woman
          resembling Sarah being cradled in the arms of her pale-faced
          lover, surrounded by a sea of watchful dead.
          
          SARAH
          
          reaches the shower, strips off her clothes. Her back and upper
          arms are decorated with graceful tattoo work - a pair of black
          angel wings sweeping over her shoulder blades. She's got a ring
          in her navel, another in a nipple...
          
          In short, the skate-waif we knew back in Detroit has matured
          quite a bit since that fateful Devil's Night. Sarah shuts here
          eyes, turns her face up into the spray. For a brief second we
          see a flash of...
          
           
          
          EXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Ashe's death. Plunging into the icy waters, down into darkness.
          Just as suddenly we are back in...
          
           
          
          INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Sarah's eyes snap open. She holds a hand out to the shower wall,
          takes a moment to collect herself.
          
          Troubled, Sarah climbs from the shower, shrugs on some clothes.
          Among her accourterments is a necklace featuring a silver ankh,
          the symbol of eternity.
          
          As Sarah sites in front of her vanity we catch sight of the irony
          mask that used to hang by Shelly's mirror. Next to the mask is
          a...
          
          TARNISHED WEDDING RING
          
          Once Shelly's. There's an inscription inside - "FOREVER".
          
          Sarah fingers the ring a moment, glancing at the irony mask.
          Lots of memories. Lots of ghosts.
          
          Gabriel creeps up, MEOWING forlornly.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          (WISTFULLY)
          
          Me too.
          
           
          
          She threads the ring onto her necklace, letting it fall next
          to the ankh, then slips the silver chain over her head. Sarah
          stands, pulls on a jacket, heads out.
          
           
          
          EXT. SARAH'S LOFT, STREET - DUSK
          
           
          
          An ill-wind kicks up trash and grit. Sarah glances down. Dozens
          of the glassine imp envelopes swirl around Sarah's feet like
          confetti. One of the envelopes has stuck to her heel. As she
          peels it off, she catches sight of...
          
           
          
          A PALE FACE
          
          in a shadowed entryway. It's a TEENAGED GIRL (16), strung out
          on drugs. The girl cowers in a narrow stairway, hugging herself,
          shivering from withdrawal.
          
          Sarah draws closer, notices some of the grinning imp drug sachets
          at the girl's feet. The girl shies away, frightened, suspicious.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          (DRYLY)
          
          Nice place you've got here.
          
           
          
          GRACE
          
          (a muttered whisper)
          
          No place else to go.
          
           
          
          Sarah can't help but recognize a part of herself in this lost
          soul.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Gotta name?
          
           
          
          GRACE
          
          Grace. So what?
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Listen, Grace, how does some hot coffee sound? Maybe a little
          food?
          
           
          
          GRACE
          
          What do you want?
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Nothing. Guess you just remind me of someone I used to know.
          
           
          
          After a moment, Grace offers a reluctant nod. Sarah helps her
          from the entryway, into the warmth of the dying light. Grace
          blinks, shields her eyes.
          
          As they walk away down the street, camera rises up to include...
          
          THE CROW
          
          perched on a nearby rooftop, watching them.
          
          CUT TO:
          
          EXT. GRAY GARGOYLE TATTOO SHOP - NIGHT
          
           
          
          the Gargoyle is an usassuming ink shop - the sole oasis of light
          in an otherwise desolated block populated by derelict warehouse
          buildings. Flickering neon BUZZES in the window.
          
          Nearby is a battered road sign - "END CITY LIMITS". Someone has
          spray-painted "OF THE FUCKING WORLD" over "city limits". In the
          distance, the bridge of the River Styx rises through the mist
          like a skeletal dinosaur.
          
          SUPER TITLE:
          
          "OCTOBER 30TH - LA NOCHE DE LA SANTA MUERTE"
          
           
          
          INT. GRAY GARGOYLE TATTOO SHOP - NIGHT
          
           
          
          CLOSE ON a sparking tattoo "gun", the needle WHIRRING as it travels
          over a patch of Vaseline-smeared skin.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          Almost finished. Doing okay?
          
           
          
          CUSTOMER (V.O.)
          
          Yeah, stings a little.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          That's why they call me the Mistress of Pain.
          
           
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL Sarah expertly guiding the needle, wearing
          glasses, surgical gloves, concentrating.
          
          Sarah's buzz-headed CUSTOMER sits in a ratty dentist's chair.
          Sarah is finishing coloring a Japanese dragon which winds its
          way over the man's forearm. She makes another line of color then
          sits back, smoothing more Vaseline over the man's arm. She picks
          up a jeweler's loupe, makes an adjustment on her needle...
          
          Behind Sarah we glimpse the cluttered tattoo shop - walls covered
          with sheets of flash (ready-made art), bookshelves crammed with
          reference works. Sarah's partner, NOAH, a chain-smoking proto-punk
          Brit, consults with a YOUNG GRUNGE COUPLE.
          
          LATER -
          
          Noah is closing up shop, while Sarah sterilizes some needles
          in an autoclave.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          What a downer - this kid wanted me to tattoo "If you're reading
          this, you're too close" on his bleedin' bum!
          
           
          
          Sarah smiles. Noah fires up a fag, flops down into a dentist
          chair. The two slip into a familiar, good-natured banter.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          Christ, I'm knackered.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Beats pushing ink in Detroit.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          That it does, Princess, that it does.
          
          (REMEMBERING)
          
          Oh, I bought you a little present...
          
           
          
          Noah reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls something out. It's
          a handmade candy sugar skull with a little strip of paper glued
          to the bottom - a fortune.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          They do 'em for the Day of the Dead.
          
          (tossing the skull to Sarah)
          
          Nice, huh? Necrophagia, Princess. Eat the dead.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          (reading fortune)
          
          "Life is just a dream on the way to death." I like that.
          
           
          
          Sarah studies the skull, then pops it in her mouth, nodding.
          Noah rises, stretching.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          Want to grab a beer, then?
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          No, I gotta go home. Haven't been sleeping much lately.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          So, what's the dirty dog's name?
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I've just been having some weird dreams.
          
          (REFLECTING)
          
          You ever dream that you're dying someone else's death?
          
           
          
          Outside we hear a MOTORCYCLE pulling up, then someone KNOCKS
          on the front door.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          (calling out)
          
          Sorry, we're closed.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          appears outside. He POUNDS harder on the door.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Open the fucking door!
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          stands, moves to the door.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          Look, I said we're...
          
           
          
          BANG! Curve kicks open the door and storms in. He PUNCHES Noah
          in the nose, then heads straight for Sarah.

          You think what you did to me is funny? Some kind of joke?
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          What are you talking about?!
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          I'm talking about the fucking tattoo you gave me! I took off
          the bandages. Look...!!!
          
           
          
          Curve rips open his shirt, revealing his chest.
          
          CURVE'S TATTOO
          
          It's a crow, rendered in bold slashes of black. Or is it? Upon
          closer examination the crow looks like something else - two demons
          fighting. The design is a classic ambiguous figure - like the
          picture of the woman in front of a vanity which can also be seen
          as a skull.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          A crow...
          
          Damn right, it's a crow. And did I ask for a fucking bird on
          my chest? Did I?!
          
           
          
          Sarah shakes her head.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Then what-the-fuck is it doing there?!
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I don't know, I was just going from the design you gave me...
          
           
          
          SMACK! Curve backhands Sarah across the face. Noah rushes forward,
          blood still running from his nose.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          Stop it!
          
           
          
          Curve pulls an automatic from his waist-band and points the gun
          at Noah. Noah freezes...
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          What's it going to be, hero? Ready to kiss your faggot-ass good-bye?
          I think so. I think you're shitting yourself you're so goddamn
          ready.
          
           
          
          Curve snaps open an imp bag of his favorite drug, snorts up the
          contents. He presses the gun against Noah's forehead.
          
           
          
          SARAH (O.S.)
          
          Over here, ass-hole...
          
           
          
          As Curve turns, Sarah squeezes a bottle of tattoo ink into the
          killer's eyes, blinding him.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Agh!!! SHIT!!!
          
           
          
          Sarah plants one of her Doc Marten boots in Curve's groin. He
          SCREAMS, doubles over. Sarah pulls the automatic from his grasp
          and trains it on him.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Get up.
          
           
          
          Curve cups his balls, slowly rises. His eyes are glowing with
          manic intensity. A slow smile creeps across Curve's face. He
          backs away towards the front door.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Shoulda killed me while you had the chance, sugarplum. Be seeing
          you.
          
           
          
          Curve smashes his fist into the neon sign, then ducks out thedoor.
          Moments later we hear his motorcycle ROAR to life. He takes off,
          ENGINE SCREAMING away into the night.
          
          Sarah lowers the gun, takes a deep breath, looks to Noah.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          You okay?
          
           
          
          Noah wipes his bloody nose, looks to the floor where Curve discarded
          the drug sachet, shakes his head in disgust.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          Fuck me, wonder what they'll be snorting next?
          
           
          
          Sarah shakes her head, at wits end.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I just can't do this anymore... I'm so tired of this.
          
           
          
          Noah pulls Sarah toward him, gives her a big hug.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          Easy there, luv. It'll all work out.

          Sarah, still clutching Curve's gun, hurries to her Galaxy 500
          which is parked along the nearby train tracks.

          SARAH'S POV (THROUGH WINDSHIELD)
          
          The Crow is perched on the hood of her car. Sarah HONKS her horn

          Get out of here! Go!!!
          
           
          
          Sarah FIRES a wild shot into the sky. The Crow files off into
          the night. Sarah collapses against the hood of her Galaxy and
          starts to cry.

          The Crow soars away from the Gargoyle, toward the beckoning lights
          of Downtown. In the distance, a flashing "JESUS SAVES" sign draws
          our attention to a monolithic tower.
          
           
          
          EXT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT
          
           
          
          The Crow makes its way towards the decaying tower, which is crowned
          by a weather-worn campanile. The campanile is a complex arabesque
          of rusted iron scrollwork, like something Antonio Gaudi conjured
          up from an art nouveau fever-dream.
          
          Just as the Crow is about to reach the campanile, it banks away.
          We, however, continue to rush onward, right through one of the
          dark openings in the scrollwork...
          
          INT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT
          
           
          
          SCRITCH! SCRITCH! All we see is black, then some vague, shiny
          reflections...
          
          CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a stag beetle, imprisoned within
          a box, leashed to a nail with a piece of thread. We were tight
          on its shiny carapace. The beetle strains at its leash, moving
          in a perpetual circle around the nail.
          
          CAMERA MOVES UP
          
          over the side of the box. Although mere inches in height, this
          enclosure might as well be the Great Wall as far as our little
          member of the Coleoptera is concerned.
          
          AS THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK
          
          we see crime lord Judah Earl's lair in all its sepulchral glory...
          
          Dark, filled with shadows. The decor is a cross between ruinous
          palatial splendor and a SoHo industrial art installation. The
          upper reaches of the campanile are laced with a spiderweb network
          of steel girders.
          
          Look close enough and you might see PEOPLE bound to the supporting
          pillars, like the half-glimpsed shapes crouching at the foot
          of your bed in the middle of the night.
          
          VOICES draw our attention to an area partitioned off by chain-mail
          curtains. CAMERA MOVES IN towards a break in the curtains. We
          linger there for a tantalizing moment...
          
           
          
          JUDAH (V.O.)

          SIBYL (V.O.)
          
          I see Death returning from the veil of tears. He has your name
          on his tongue.
          
           
          
          Now we plunge in through the curtains...
          
          The "camera" consists of a series of lenses and mirrors which
          project images from the outside world onto a circular table,
          offering the ultimate voyeuristic view of the crumbling cityscape.
          TWO FIGURES stand with their backs to us, studying the camera's
          view. The first is...
          
          JUDAH EARL,
          
          A sinewy, slash-mouthed Byronic figure with a guttural voice.
          Old before his time, touched by childhood visions of his own
          death. The tower is Judah's prison in more ways than one.
          
          SIBYL, Judah's blind oracle, waits by his side. Attractive, though
          of indeterminate sex. His/her dour features are hidden beneath
          a black cowl.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          (FATALISTIC)
          
          It's finally beginning, isn't it? What mask will Death wear,
          can you tell me that?
          
           
          
          SIBYL
          
          I see the face of one of your victims.
          
           
          
          Judah lifts his head up and we see his luminous amber eyes for
          the first time. A kind of madness dances within them.
          
           
          
          JUDAH

          of bubbles rushes from his mouth, obscuring our view.
          
          ASHE'S POV
          
          As the bubbles clear, Danny's face comes into focus just a few
          inches from his own.
          
          Ashe panics, jerks back. The razor-wire barbs cut into his flesh.
          The more he struggles, the tighter the coils become, slashing
          his hands and face, shredding his clothes. He's caught in his
          son's embrace, the two of them thrashing about in a grotesque
          underwater ballet.

          The headlights of Sarah's Galaxy cut through the fog. She pulls
          up just in time to see the Crow disappearing into the mist which
          cloaks the bridge. Sarah follows, trying to keep up with the
          bird.

          Ashe suddenly bursts from the sea with his arms outstretched.
          A hellish Venus on the half-shell. Gasping, full of terror and
          rage. He lets loose a TORTURED HOWL.
          
          ASHE
          
          digs his fingers into the wood-rot pulp of the pilings and claws

          ASHE
          
          crouches before us, his face hidden from view. He reaches out

          Ashe lifts his head, WAILING. He's covered from head to toe in
          ocean-bottom silt. Blood from the razor-wire wounds has smeared
          across his face in patterns which eerily recall the Crow make-up.
          Strips of the wire still cling to his arms and chest, the barbs
          buried deep in his flesh.
          
          Reliving the violent moment is more than his mind can bear. Ashe's
          eyes roll up into his head. The world spins around him. But even
          as the lights are going out, Ashe glimpses...
          
          A DARK FIGURE
          
          standing in front of him. It's the last thing Ashe sees before
          consciousness escapes him.
          
          SARAH
          
          emerges from the shadows, staring down at Ashe in wonder.

          Ashe opens his eyes. The mud-silt which covers his face has dried
          and cracked, causing it to crumble away in flakes.
          
          Ashe is lying on a cot in the middle of the loft. We see scattered
          images: candles burning, a reilgious altar overflowing with trinkets,
          mirrors, mannequins, canvases, and finally...
          
          GABRIEL
          
          perched at the end of the bed, watching Ashe intently.
          
          SARAH
          
          sits on the other side of the loft in a paint-smeared work-shirt,
          brush in hand. She's studying a half-finished canvas, contemplating
          her next move.

          The eerie scene depicting a woman on her death-bed being cradled
          in the arms of her ghostly lover.
          
          Sarah tenses, feeling Ashe's eyes burning into the back of her
          neck. She turns around, sees Ashe.

          Ashe looks down at his chest, tracing his fingers over the area
          where bullet holes should be. Instead, he finds a series of indented
          welts.

          Sarah suddenly comes to the terrible realization that Ashe does
          not know he has died.
          
           
          
          SARAH

          You didn't.
          
           
          
          Ashe looks up at Sarah, uncomprehending.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          You're dead.

          No...
          
           
          
          Ashe stands, enraged. He starts toward Sarah. She backs away...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Stop looking at me that way -- stop looking -- this isn't real,
          none of this is real! I'm dreaming this.
          
           
          
          SARAH

          No.
          
           
          
          The two of the struggle a moment, Ashe pushes Sarah back. Sarah
          reaches for him, trying to restrain him, trying to somehow keep
          his rising terror in check... she's not getting through to him,
          he can't be made to listen...
          
          Finally, Sarah grabs a kitchen knife from the counter and plunges
          it into Ashe's chest.
          
          Ashe gasps. He stares down at the incongruous sight of a knife-handle
          stickout out from his sternum, then he yanks the knife back out.
          No pain. No wound. A moment of shock, then...

          flinging her back and running for the door.

          He's not here anymore.
          
           
          
          Sarah draws closer, touched by Ashe's inner struggle. She reaches
          out to him, drawing him into her arms. He stares up at her, eyes
          distant.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          There's no moon...
          
           
          
          Sarah touches Ashe's face, calming him, trying to reach through
          his pain.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          You've been given another chance, Ashe -- to put the wrong things
          right...
          
           
          
          Sarah's eyes drop to the canisters of paint which have been scattered
          nearby. She reaches for the canister of white and unscrews the
          lid, dipping her fingers inside...
          
          Sarah's re-creation of the irony war mask has an oddly ritualistic
          feel to it. Yet the act is also quite erotic, for the mutual
          attraction between these two battered souls is almost palpable.
          
          As Sarah continues to speak, she begins to paint Ashe's face
          using Danny's art supplies.
          
          We see this transformation in bits and pieces - an eye here,
          fingers dipping into the canister of white there, ruby lips being
          smeared with black...
          
          ...the face that is taking shape is both similar to and different
          from Eric's. It's the legacy of the Crow, as funneled through
          Ashe's own, unique pain.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I believe there've always been people like you...
          
           
          
          Sarah has finished. She sits back, surveying her work...
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          It's the pain that brings people back. It makes us strong again.
          
           
          
          CLOSE ON ASHE'S FACE as he turns towards us. A slash of light
          illuminates the signature black and white war-paint of the Crow
          in all its glory. Ashe looks like a dark saint.

          Ashe rockets beneath the gothic arches of the freeway overpass
          on his motorcycle, hellfire burning in his eyes, his coat flapping
          behind him like a fallen angel's wings.
          
          THE CROW
          
          flies alongside Ashe.
          
          THE CROW
          
          lands on a telephone wire, studying the warehouse.
          
          Presently we hear Ashe's MOTORCYCLE approaching, then we see
          the front wheel of his bike pulling into the foreground.
          
          CROW'S POV (ANAMORPHIC)
          
          Ashe turns to the Crow, slyly giving the bird the thumbs-up sign...

          INT. SPIDER MONKEY'S WAREHOUSE LAB - NIGHT
          
           
          
          CA-CHUNK, CA-CHUNK, CA-CHUNK. CLOSE ON a sheet of glassine drug
          bags as a hand-powered printing press comes down, mass-producing
          the image of the imp giving us the thumbs up...
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL the lab set up in a maze of barrells. The
          walls are stained from the toxic fumes. Blacked-out windows sweat
          with moisture. There are heating mantles rigged with flasks and
          condensers, vacuum pumps - along with ingredients like battery
          acid, paint thinner, and Epsom salts. Nearby are dozens of 50-gallon
          drums containing the finished product.
          
          Spider Monkey is working away at the printing press, pausing
          to snoot some of Judah's drug. Nearby is an old TV featuring
          lurid videos of amateur bull riding - we watch as a drunken participant
          gets gored.
          
          Suddenly the power in the lab goes out, the TV screen sputters
          and goes dark.
          
           
          
          SPIDER MONKEY

          'My mother was accursed the night she bore me and I am faint
          with envy of all the dead'.
          
           
          
          Spider Monkey whirls around, startled. Ashe is sitting cross-legged
          on one of the tables, grinning like a black leather Buddha.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Tell me, Monkey. Does the corpse have a familiar face?
          
           
          
          SPIDER MONKEY
          
          Who the fuck are you?
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          You have to learn to look beyond the mask.
          
           
          
          Ashe jumps down from the table, walking into the light. Spider
          Monkey's eyes widen in recognition.
          
           
          
          SPIDER MONKEY
          
          No way, man...we put you under...you and that little snot-nosed
          kid...
          
           
          
          Ashe dips his hand into one of the 50-gallon drums. He blows
          a handful of the Trinity dust at Spider Monkey. Spider Monkey,
          terminally spooked, reaches back to the counter behind him, searching
          for something...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Looking for this?
          
           
          
          Ashe holds up a pistol and puts it to his head.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          (an evil grin)
          
          Don't try this at home, kids.
          
           
          
          BOOM! ASHE
          
          puts a bullet through his own forehead. His head snaps backward
          and his body collapses onto the floor. Spider Monkey creeps forward
          toward Ashe's body...
          
          ASHE
          
          springs from the ground, SLAMMING Spider Monkey against a table
          of chemicals. Bottles SHATTER on the floor, spilling their toxic
          contents.
          
           
          
          SPIDER MONKEY
          
          What are you?! What the fuck are you?!
          
           
          
          Ashe leans in so he's eye to eye with Spider Monkey.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          I wasn't sure at first. Now I know. I'm the boiling man, Monkey.
          I'm the plague of Darkness and the death of the first-born. All
          your nightmares rolled into one.
          
           
          
          Ashe removes a wooden match from his inside coat pocket. He scrapes
          his thumb-nail over the head, igniting it.
          
           
          
          SPIDER MONKEY

          ASHE
          
          I'll start with Nemo, then work my way up the food chain. Where
          is he?
          
           
          
          SPIDER MONKEY
          
          Nemo? Nemo's an old gash-hound. He hangs out at the Peep-O-Rama
          on Deacon Street!
          
           
          
          WHOOSH! Ashe blows the match out.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Congratulations, monkey. You just bought yourself a fighting
          chance.
          
           
          
          Ashe reaches into his coat pocket, pulling out a deck of cards.
          He fans them out, points...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Pick a card, monkey.
          
           
          
          Spider Monkey slowly extends his hand, half-expecting Ashe to
          pounce on him. He pulls a card out.
          
          Spider Monkey tosses the card down, face up. He's got the Jack
          of Hearts. he smiles tentatively. Ashe pulls out a card of his
          own and flips it around - the King of Clubs.

          OUTWARDS in a HAIL STORM OF GLASS... ASHE
          
          emerges from the raging conflagration, walking right through
          the flames, indifferent to the heat. A flurry of the tiny glassine
          drug bags swirl around him like snow.

          Sarah rises, reaching for her bag. As she heads for the exit,

          sweeping aside one of the curtains surrounding the camera obscura.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          The Crow. Death's avatar. I've heard the legends.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          looks down at a view of the seething landscape.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          Let him come, then.

          EXT. PEEP-O-RAMA PORN SHOP - NIGHT
          
           
          
          The Peep-O-Rama occupies an old Japanese movie house. A geisha-girl
          sign flashes over the marquee. Beneath that is a blinking neon
          eye which opens and closes. Other signs offer enticements like
          "ONLY 25 CENTS A PEEP!" and "REAL GIRLS WORKING THEIR WAY THROUGH
          COLLEGE!"
          
          As Nemo approaches, a laconic HINDU with a throat microphone
          sits outside, reciting his tired schpiel.
          
           
          
          HINDU
          
          Tokens for the buddy booths, live girls. Tokens for the buddy
          booths, live girls...
          
           
          
          Nemo hands the Hindu a twenty.
          
           
          
          INT. BUDDY BOOTH - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Nemo enters a cramped booth, clutching a handful of tokens embossed
          with the Peep-O-Rama eye logo on them. There's a seat, a box
          of Kleenex, a phone, and a grimy Plexiglas window with a metal
          shutter over it.
          
          Nemo starts popping tokens into the slot next to the window,
          pockets the rest of them.
          
          With a WHIR the metal shutter rises, revealing a WOMAN in a garter-belt
          get-up perched on a stool. In a forgiving light, she might even
          be beautiful.
          
          An LED display starts counting down from sixty - the seconds
          remaining on the metered shutter. Nemo picks up the receiver.
          
           
          
          NEMO
          
          You got a name?

          Holly Daze. Do you want me, baby?
          
           
          
          NEMO
          
          I need to see some sugar.
          
           
          
          Holly shrugs out of her bra, plants her scuffed-up high heels
          on either side of the window, runs her hands up and down her
          body, utters some tired-ass MOANS.
          
           
          
          NEMO

          Nemo unbuckles his belt, drops his drawers...

          NEMO
          
          Yeah, we're gonna celebrate Christmas a little early this year.
          
           
          
          HOLLY

          Holly is still MOANING. Over on the LED display, Nemo's time
          has just about expired.
          
           
          
          HOLLY
          
          Time's almost up, lover. Better hurry up with those tokens.

          Nemo fumbles with his pants, scoops out some more tokens...
          
          Too late, the shutter is already closing. Nemo feeds some more
          tokens into the slot. Nothing happens. Nemo punches the LED display.
          
           
          
          NEMO
          
          Come on, fucker!
          
           
          
          The shutter starts rattling up again, only this time...
          
          ASHE
          
          is standing on the other side of the Plexiglas. His mouth splits
          into an evil grin.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          "Do you want me, baby?"
          
           
          
          Nemo's eyes just about pop from his skull.
          
           
          
          NEMO

          CRASH! Ashe slams his fists through the Plexiglas window, reaching
          for Nemo's throat.
          
           
          
          INT. PEEP-O-RAMA, HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Nemo comes flying out the booth door. He struggles to rise. A
          CHORUS OF ORGASMIC SIGHS and cheesy SURF MUSIC drifts out from
          the other booths.
          
           
          
          ZEKE
          
          (o.s.)
          
          Hey, mime boy.
          
           
          
          AT THE FRONT COUNTER.
          
          ZEKE, the Peep-O-Rama's corpulent manager, is cradling a sawed-off
          shotgun. BOOM! He blows a blast into Ashe's chest!
          
          Ashe starts toward Zeke, unfazed. Zeke moves to fire again...
          
          Ashe snatches the shotgun from the fat man's grasp, smashing
          him in the face with the butt-end. Zeke falls back into a video
          display, sending an avalanche of porno tapes raining down on
          top of him.
          
          Seizing the moment, Nemo rushes for the exit...
          
          Ashe spins, pumps the shotgun, blows out one of Nemo's kneecaps.
          Nemo collapses on the floor, wailing like a child. Ashe strides
          over to him.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          One crow sorrow...
          
           
          
          He HEAVES Nemo through a glass display booth filled with sex
          toys. Ashe punctuates each line of the nursery rhyme with a new
          assault on Nemo.
          
           
          
          ASHE

          Nemo starts dragging his broken body across the floor. He finds
          himself face to face with an anatomically-correct blow-up sex
          doll - the kind with a built-in pre-recorded memory chip.
          
           
          
          DOLL
          
          Ooh, oh baby, I like it like that. You're so good. You're so

          Three crows a letter, four crows a boy...
          
           
          
          Ashe HEAVES Nemo back the other way, sending him SMASHING into
          the front counter. Peep-O-Rama tokens go flying, bouncing and
          spinning every which way...
          
          CLOSE ON A SPINNING TOKEN
          
          On one side of the coin the eye is open, on the other it's closed
          - this creates the illusion of the eye blinking.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Five crows silver, six crows gold...
          
           
          
          Nemo utters a half-sob and rolls over, feebly wiping away the
          blood which is clouding his eyes.
          
           
          
          ASHE

          Ashe pries open Nemo's eyes with his fingers.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          You killed my son, Nemo. You took away the only piece of light
          left in my soul.
          
           
          
          NEMO
          
          We had to! Judah's orders. Never leave any witnesses! We didn't
          have a choice!
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          We always have a choice.
          
           
          
          Ashe plunges his fingers into Nemo's eyes - killing him off-camera.
          He lifts up his now blood-covered hands and turns...
          
          Just then, Holly Daze bursts out into the hall. She sees Ashe
          and YELPS, certain her number's up. Ashe grabs her by the wrist,
          spinning her around.

          Ashe touches her face and sees a split-second FLASH of...
          
          HOLLY DAZE DANCING
          
          Jump-cut bump and grind, CAT-CALLS, LAUGHTER, the distorted faces
          of men leering with their hungry eyes, tongues and sweaty palms
          and heavy breath and I wanna be your fucking dog, baby, and...
          
          BANG! ASHE
          
          shuts his eyes, reeling...
          
          Ashe looks up at Holly - one victim to another. His eyes burn
          a laser beam into her soul.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          If you value what you've lost, you'll walk away from this place
          and never look back.
          
           
          
          Holly Daze nods with conviction. Ashe releases her. She bolts
          like a rabbit flushed from cover.

          stops, sensing something. He spins around...
          
          THE CROW
          
          is sitting atop one of the cars, watching him.

          VOICES from the vid-booths continue their ORGIASTIC MOANS, but
          one voice in particular stand out.

          CAMERA FINDS NEMO'S BODY
          
          at the end of the corridor, lounging in the arms of the sex doll
          which is still repeating its tinny refrain. Nemo's neck has been
          snapped and his head hangs at an awkward angle.
          
           
          
          DOLL
          
          ...oh! Oh yea, that's the spot. Do me, baby. Do me.
          
           
          
          There's a folded piece of paper shoved into Nemo's mouth. Curve
          pries it out. The paper unfolds like one of those snowflake cut-outs
          we used to make in grade school - only this cut-out is of a crow.
          
          Written across the paper crow are the following words:
          
          " I KNOW WHY JESUS WEPT"
          
           
          
          A phone on the wall is RINGING. RINGING and RINGING. Finally,
          Curve leans in, snatches up he receiver...
          
           
          
          ASHE'S VOICE
          
          Do you know what they call a gathering of crows, Curve?
          
           
          
          At the sound of Ashe's voice, Curve's eyes widen with fear.
          
           
          
          ASHE'S VOICE
          
          A murder. A murder of crows. Think about it.
          
           
          
          CLICK! The line goes dead. Furious, Curve tears the phone from
          the wall, HEAVING it across the porno shop.

          Ashe exits a phone booth, leaving the receiver dangling. A DOG
          BARKS nearby, followed by the sound of CHILDREN LAUGHING. Ashe
          turns and sees...
          
          A GROUP OF CHILDREN running away, giggling, their FOOTSTEPS receding
          into the night.
          
          A BLACK DOG trots toward Ashe. The children have tied a plastic
          skull mask to the dog's head. The skull dog trots up the street
          towards...
          
          A SMALL, INNER-CITY LATINO CHURCH
          
          sandwiched between two derelict buildings. The doors are open
          - there's a path of marigold petals leading up the front steps.
          The skull dog trots up the steps and enters.

          Ashe moves into the sanctuary. He watches from the rear, entranced.
          PEOPLE are scattered amongst the pews.
          
          At the altar is a lavish offrenda - an offering of food and drink
          for the wandering dead decorated with sugar skulls and floral
          garlands. Amidst the decorations are photos of departed loved
          ones. There are tiers of candles surrounding these, scores of
          them.
          
          An ELDERLY PRIEST emerges from a confessional, looking to Ashe
          with a raised eyebrow..."Next?".
          
           
          
          PRIEST

          PRIEST
          
          Our doors are open.
          
           
          
          The Priest moves to a candelabra and lights some tapers.

          What is this for?
          
           
          
          PRIEST
          
          Dias de los Muertos, the Days of the Dead. We light the candles
          for our loved ones - so that they might find their way back to
          earth and share in the pleasures of the living.
          
           
          
          Ashe watches an OLD WOMAN place a toy motorcycle in front of
          a picture of a child.
          
           
          
          PRIEST
          
          Tomorrow night we will celebrate. The people will dance, sing...
          
          (indicating Ashe's makeup)
          
          ...many will wear masks.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Why?
          
           
          
          PRIEST
          
          Some spirits linger here too long. They become confused, mistaking
          themselves for the living. They have to be frightened away.
          
           
          
          The priest nods to Ashe and moves down the aisle to the next
          candelabra.
          
          A LITTLE BOY
          
          is watching Ashe from one of the back pews. He clutches a striped
          ball. He drops it.
          
          The boy rolls the ball across the floor to Ashe. Ashe kneels
          and catches it, rolling it back. The boy smiles.
          
           
          
          BOY
          
          Santa Muerte.
          
           
          
          Unnerved, Ashe retreats out of the sanctuarly, letting the night's
          shadows swallow him up once more.

          Sarah sits by her paintings. Gabriel suddenly stands, arching
          his back, hair standing on end.
          
          ASHE
          
          appears on the ledge of the broken window, crouching there like
          a gargoyle in silhouette.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          (hesitant, but relieved)
          
          You came back...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Heaven wouldn't have me and Hell was afraid I'd take the place
          over.
          
           
          
          Ashe drops into the loft.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          I needed to see you again.
          
           
          
          Ashe moves towards Sarah's paintings, pausing to study the one
          of the woman being cradled in the arms of her ghostly lover.
          He touches the woman's face.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          She looks like you.
          
           
          
          After a long moment, Sarah responds.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I paint what I see.
          
           
          
          Ashe approaches Sarah. He points to the wedding ring which hands
          from her neck.
          
           
          
          ASHE

          Sarah turns the ring around her finger, fidgeting with it.
          
           
          
          SARAH

          Sarah reaches for a cigarette and lights up, taking a long drag.
          Ashe notices a number of scars on her forearm, possibly some
          track marks...
          
          Sarah catches him looking, self-consciously pulls her hand back.
          
           
          
          SARAH

          I left Detroit because I wanted to put the past behind me.
          
          (STRUGGLING)
          
          The problem is, I know how it ends. Blood. Violence. I don't
          want a part of it anymore.
          
           
          
          Gabriel approaches Ashe. He crouches, runs his fingers along
          the cat's back.
          
           
          
          ASHE

          You go back.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          What if I don't want to go back?
          
           
          
          Sarah looks away.

          Ashe's death. We see Ashe's face sinking beneath the water's
          surface. The image freezes.

          Curve turns on Kali, furious, ready to strike her. In a flash,
          Kali has one of her katanas out.
          
          Curve backs away, bristling.

          come back from the other side.

          You tell me.
          
           
          
          A stare-down ensues. Judah doesn't avert his gaze.

          The Crow is the source of his power - his link between this world

          SEES the knick-knacks and mementos gathered there, then SEES
          the ceramic irony mask which hangs above. Ashe approaches, reaching
          a hand out to trace its features.
          
          At the bottom of the mirror, a FADED POSTCARD has been tucked
          between the frame and the glass. Ashe pulls it free, studying
          it...

          Ashe stares at the picture, entranced, caught up in a moment
          of wistful nostalgia for the life he's lost.
          
           
          
          ASHE

          It was cold up there. I remember we could see each other's breath.
          
           
          
          Ashe catches himself, setting the postcard down. He turns his
          back to Sarah, hiding his face form her, overcome by emotion.
          
          Sarah stands, drawing near. She reaches out to console him, touching
          his shoulder. She alone, among all the souls of the world, understands
          the isolation that is consuming Ashe.

          Ashe finally turns around, a sense of deep and profound loss
          in his eyes...
          
          Something unspoken passes between them. Sarah leans into Ashe,
          tentative, eyes searching. It's one of those fragile moments
          where things could go either way. And then...

          Within the bakery are mountains of sugar skulls, candy skeletons,

          Judah grips Curve's shoulders tightly, shaking him.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          Everything, you idiot! Find her. If she gave you his mark, then
          she's connected to him in some way. She can lead us to him.

          Ashe stands at the end of the pier, staring down into the silent
          waters where his natural life ended. He takes something from
          his coat...
          
          THE PAINTING
          
          which Danny had been working on. It's got bullet holes in it
          now.
          
          Ashe throws his arms back and lifts his face to the heavens,
          SCREAMING, cursing his fate.
          
          ON ASHE,
          
          as seen from afar. A tiny figure dwarfed by the endless expanse

          Curve and Kali have duct-taped Noah to one of the dentist chairs
          - even his mouth and nose have been sealed shut. Curve lets Noah
          thrash a moment, then violently rips the tape from Noah's face.

          We're looking for Sarah. Where is she, Noah?
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          I'm not going to tell you that...

          Oh, but I think you are...
          
           
          
          Kali sites astride Noah. She reaches for one of the tattoo machines.
          She motions to Curve, who hits the treadlight foot switch. Noah
          eyes the sparking tattoo machine with rising apprehension as
          Kali moves it towards his face.
          
          CLOSE ON THE NEEDLE
          
          a vibrating blur just a few centimeters from Noah's blinking
          eye. Noah tries to shut his eyes. Kali forces an eye open with
          the thumb and forefinger of her other hand.

          From behind, we see Kali lower the vibrating needle towards Noah's

          Curve and Kali are leaving the shop. Suddenly Curve clutches
          at his chest, wincing in pain. He opens his coat, looks down
          at his chest...
          
          THE CROW TATTOO
          
          is dripping blood from its beak and talons.
          
          Curve staggers back, horrified. Kali is watching him.

          But Curve isn't listening. He leaps onto his motorcycle and hits
          the ignition. He takes off with a ROAR...

          Curve makes his way to the bar. He rips open a glassine bag of
          Trinity and vacuum snorts it. His eyes roll up in his head as
          the chemicals flow. Another wave of pain washes over him. Curve
          claws at his chest, falls against the bar...

          TIME SLOWS TO A CRAWL
          
          The MUSIC fades to a muted echo of distant WAR DRUMS. As a feeling
          of inexorable doom settles over him, Curve lifts his head and
          sees...
          
          ASHE
          
          reflected in the bar mirror, materializing out of the narcotic
          haze. He's wading through the ocean of bodies. In his face paint
          and black leather Ashe looks like he's just another part of the
          twisted scene. people are stroking him, brushing up against him
          - like they can leech off some of his morbid angel charisma.
          
          Ashe lifts his hand - he's clutching House o' Peep Zeke's sawed-off
          shotgun.
          
          Curve DIVES to the floor as Ashe's shotgun blast shatters the
          bar mirror, taking out his own reflection. Curve rolls, climbs
          to his feet, starts running...
          
          The Samoan bartender grabs a semi-auto pistol, opens up on Ashe.
          Now some of the other ARMED DOORMEN are FIRING too...
          
          ...but Ashe keeps on coming, trudging through the HAIL OF GUNFIRE.
          Bullets are EXPLODING over his body at an insane rate. Ashe is
          a human roman candle. Nothing is going to stop him from reaching
          Curve, nothing.
          
          The Samoan stops firing. He takes one look at Ashe, who's still
          coming at them...
          
          Fuck this. He turns tail and run.

          Curve comes storming out the back door like a bat out of Hell.
          He takes the rear stairs three at a time, spilling into a couple
          of back-alley JUNKIES. He stumbles into a pile of garbage, scatters
          some rats...
          
          Curve makes for his bike, which is parked nearby. He fumbles
          with the key, hits the starter switch...
          
          Ashe comes flying off from a second story fire escape, landing
          atop a car roof on all fours, popping the windows.

          THE CROW
          
          plunges down from the night sky, wings flapping madly, quickly

          Curve leans in low, trying to urge his bike on by will-power
          alone. He races by a warehouse, veering off the road onto the
          railroad tracks.
          
          UP ABOVE,
          
          Ashe appears on the overpass, riding on his own motorcycle, matching
          Curve's speed.
          
          THE CROW
          
          soars higher for a bird's eye view, tracking Curve's progress
          as it sweeps past chimneys, swerves around billboards, ducks
          under laundry lines...
          
          ON ASHE
          
          as he ROCKETS along the overpass. The Crow lands on his shoulder.
          Ahead is a break in the guard rail. Ashe cuts sharply to the
          right, taking the motorcycle airborne through the break in the
          rail and...
          
          ASHE

          the Crow lands on the skylight, staring down at Sarah, watching...
          
          There's a KNOCK at her door. Sarah approaches, looks through

          The chase continues. Curve approaches the bridge doing well past
          ninety. Abruptly, he cuts down a roadway which parallels the
          river. There's a chain-link running across the mouth of the tunnel.
          
          Up ahead is a hole in the fence leading down to a tunnel spillway.
          Curve guides his bike through the hole...

          Curve speeds into the dark tunnel, splashing through puddles
          of water, whipping past graffiti. As he nears the mouth at the
          other end, Curve brakes hard, TIRES SQUEALING, almost going down...
          
          CURVE'S POV
          
          We are now beneath the bridge. It's a stone-cold dead-end. The
          roadway slopes sharply downward, spilling out into the concrete
          river bed which is filled to capacity with rushing flood waters.
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          We hear the ROAR of an approaching motorcycle, then an engine
          cutting out. Curve looks back the way he came...
          
          AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE TUNNEL
          
          Ashe's siilhouette steps into view. He's on foot now, clutching
          the sawed-off shotgun. He lets loose a LAUGH which chills Curve
          to the bone.

          Ashe starts into the tunnel. His WET FOOTSTEPS echo off the weeping
          walls...

          As Ashe draws closer, his death-like face emerges from the gloom
          - a ghastly visage floating in the ether...

          Ashe stops some twenty feet away, grinning like the Cheshire
          Cat.

          Silence like knives. Ashe and Curve facing one another. Curve

          Curve SCREAMS and guns his cycle forward, rolling the throttle
          all the way open - a kamikaze run aimed straight at Ashe.
          
          Ashe stands his groupd, lifts the shotgun, FIRST at Curve's customized
          teardrop gas tank. There's the woman doing the wild thing with
          Death and...
          
          BOOM! CURVE'S MOTORCYCLE
          
          disintegrates beneath him, breaking apart into a RUSHING COMET
          OF FLAMING WRECKAGE. Shrapnel skids along the tunnel walls, SPEWING
          SPARKS.
          
          CURVE
          
          lies on the garbage-strewn tunnel floor in a spreading pool of
          blood - burnt, battered, a barb of steel sticking up from his
          chest. Still, Curve has one glorious, giddy moment where he thinks
          he's actually succeeded in defeeating Ashe, then...
          
          CURVE'S POV
          
          as Ashe steps through the gasoline flames.
          
          Curve's elation vaporizes.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Can you hear me, Curve?
          
           
          
          Curve offers a weak nod.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          You're going to die now.
          
           
          
          Curve tries to speak, blood spills from his mouth. Ashe places
          a finger to his lips.
          
          Ashe drops down, kneeling over Curve's chest.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          People used to put coins in the mouths of the dead. Do you know
          why? So they could pay the ferryman to take them across the river
          Styx.

          What's this?
          
           
          
          In a parody of a stage magician, Ashe retrieves one of the Peep-O-Rama
          tokens from Curve's ear. The embossed eye logo flashes.

          Open your mouth, Curve.
          
           
          
          Curve,s eyes are wide, filled with terror. He MOANS.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Shhh. It's not so bad. Trust me. I've been there.
          
           
          
          Curve slowly opens his mouth. Tears run from his eyes. Ashe places
          the coin on Curve's tongue, like a priest administering a Holy
          wafer.
          
          Ashe stands, grabs Curve by the coat collar. He pulls him back
          towards the end of the tunnel...

          Ashe drags Curve down the sloping end of the spillway to the
          waters edge.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          I want to thank you for showing me my pain, Curve. You made me
          what I am.
          
           
          
          ON ASHE
          
          As he releases Curve, letting the current carry him away. Ashe
          stands, tracking Curve's progress.
          
          ON CURVE
          
          as he floats downstream, limbs outstretched, consciousness fading
          fast.
          
          CURVE'S POV
          
          GHOSTLY FACES stare down at him from the girders - people who
          have made their home in the underbelly of the bridge which stretches
          overhead.
          
          A WOMAN lets loose a cloud of marigold petals. They flutter down
          around Curve, swirling in the currents.
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          
          the petals have clustered around Curve's body in the shape of
          a Crow. Curve continues to float downstream towards an estuary,
          borne away on the wings of the bird.

          down, lowering his head. Whether out of respect for the dead
          or his own condition, we'll never know.
          
          After a minute, Ashe lifts his head again and stands. It's time

          KALI
          
          who had been standing still amidst the shadows, now moves from

          As Kali steps closer we see that she's dressed for war -- a katana
          secured in a black scabbard, twin daggers on each hip, a bandoleer
          of throwing stars.

          Kali unsheathes her katana. The blade edge catches the streetlight's
          glare coming in from the window.

          Kali comes at Ashe blindingly fast. She spins and cartwheels
          end over end, somersaulting. As she lands, Kali shifts into Ginsu-mode,
          her blade a whirling blur...
          
          Ashe ducks under the blade, trapping Kali's sword arm. He twists
          his hands, SNAPPING her arm...
          
          As Kali CRIES OUT, Ashe pivots, THROWING HER towards the half-moon
          window looking out over the street...

          Sarah's eyelids flutter open with a start. She's waking on the
          heels of a dream.
          
          PULL BACK to reveal Sarah curled up on the cold tile floor, a
          number of candles burning nearby. Sarah sits up, disoriented.
          Upon moving her arm she finds that it's been shackled to one
          of the pillars via a long chain.
          
          Sarah wastes a few moments tugging at her tether, trying to snap
          one of the links, but it's no good.
          
          Frustrated, Sarah looks around, trying to get her bearings...
          
          SIBYL
          
          is standing a few yards away, cloaked in darkness, head bowed.
          Sarah didn't notice her at first.
          
           
          
          SARAH

          Sarah rises from the floor, a little unsteady. She moves towards
          Sibyl, reaches out to touch her shoulder. The prophetess abruptly
          lifts her head, causing her hood to fall back. Sarah takes a
          step back, GASPING...
          
          SIBYL'S EMPTY EYE SOCKETS
          
          have been sewn shut with black thread.

          Judah brushes the back of his hand affectionately against Sibyl's

          lift her head.

          When I was a boy I fell through the ice of a lake. I remember
          seeing the sky through the ice above me, close enough to touch.
          The world grew cold around me. Dark. Eventually my heart stopped
          beating. And in that moment, I died.
          
           
          
          Judah sweeps his hand through one of the candle flames, then

          up into shadow.

          Forbidden knowledge.
          
           
          
          Judah leans in close to Sarah, his lambent eyes glowing like

          from her neck.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          I've been living on borrowed time ever since. I've always known
          Death would be coming for me.
          
          (BEAT)
          
          I see now that your friend is the one I've been waiting for.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          You can't stop him.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          You're wrong, Sarah.
          
          (RISING)
          
          There is a way to defeat Death... and that's to trade places
          with him.

          piloted by a man in a devil mask suddenly looms up in front of

          barricades. There's some kind of street fiesta going on...
          
          Ashe swerves, BRAKING HARD to avoid hitting the carriage. Ashe's
          bike slips out from under him and Ashe goes CRASHING into the
          barricades. But even as the carriage's skull-faced costumed occupants
          rush up to help him...

          CROW'S POV
          
          Sarah sits within one of the pools of illumination far below,
          still bound to the bed by the chain. Judah and Sibyl are nowhere
          in sight.
          
          THE CROW
          
          flies down from the rafters, landing on the floor at Sarah's
          feet. It CAWS at her, trying to communicate.

          WHOOSH! A steel cage on a wire and pulley system CLATTERS down
          from above, SLAMMING to the floor and trapping the bird within
          it. The bird CAWS angrily, flitting from one side of the cage

          MUMMERS in garish costumes dance, MUSICIANS stroll. People are
          holding giant papier-mache skulls on sticks along with torches
          and calavera placards.
          
          There are stalls offering marigolds and cockscomb, black beeswax

          Judah, now carrying the cage which contains the Crow, sweeps
          aside the curtain of the camera obscura. He reaches up to a lever
          which opens the camera's lens. Moonlight shines down on the camera
          table. With another lever, Judah adjusts the camera's view.
          
          CAMERA TABLE
          
          The camera lens is now trained on the night sky. A churning landscape
          of night-sky coulds drifts across the table's surface, creating
          an eerie effect.
          
          JUDAH
          
          sets a package wrapped in velvet on the camera table. He peels
          back the cloth, revealing a set of ornately decorated, tapered
          daggers. He looks back at Sarah.

          Judah removes one of the blades from its sheath, running the
          glinting edge along his finger.
          
           
          
          JUDAH In the Dark Ages, these were used to deliver the death

          Judah turns to the steel cage in which the Crow has been trapped.
          
          He pulls on a leather falconer's glove and opens the door to
          the cage. The Crow flaps his wings madly, desperately trying
          to strike at Judah with its beak and claws...
          
          ... but Judah secures his grip around the bird's throat, pulling
          it out. He pins the Crow to the focusing table of the camera

          Shaking terribly, trying to fight back the pain, Ashe continues

          STONE MAIDEN
          
          which protrudes from the building's facade. The maiden's face

          Ashe clutches the back of the maiden in a parody of a lover's
          embrace. Using the statue for support, he drags himself back
          up to relative safety. Now Ashe is face to face with the maiden,

          The Crow is dead, transfixed by the gleaming misericords. Blood
          is pooling beneath black flight feathers.
          
          Judah steps back, momentarily overwhelmed by the enormity of
          his crime.

          Judah looks to the camera obscura's table. The blood from the
          Crow has completely covered the table's concave surface, filling
          it to the brim like liquid in a shallow bowl. The end result
          is an eerie reflecting pool.

          CLOSE ON JUDAH'S FACE
          
          his once-pallid features now glow with a kind of beatific radiance.
          
          WE RISE UP
          
          from Judah, up and up into the darkest reaches of his tower.
          Judah is LAUGHING, laughing in the face of Death itself.
          
          CUT TO:
          
           
          
          EXT. JUDAH'S TOWER - STREET
          
           
          
          Ashe lies amidst a field of shimmering glass shards and flowers.
          
          THE MASKED CELEBRANTS
          
          slowly gather around Ashe, craning their necks for a view of
          the fallen angel.
          
          CLOSE ON ASHE'S FACE
          
          Relaxed, peaceful, even. For a moment, we aren't sure whether
          or not Ashe's soul has fled.
          
          The peripheral noise from the street festival dies away. We're
          in the eye of the hurricane now. Once again, time seems to shudder
          to a stop. And the only thing we hear are...
          
          THE CROWS
          
          Thousands of them, filling the heavens with their KEENING WAILS.
          
          Ashe slowly opens his eyes, tentative. When you're this deep
          in the bosom of bliss, the last thing you want to do is waken,
          but waken he does...
          
          ASHE'S POV - THE SKY ABOVE JUDAH'S TOWER
          
          is black with crows. And endless army of carrion-creatures, swirling
          madly about.
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          Ashe sits up, stares at the crows, fascinated, frightened. Then
          his eyes fall to the faces of the people around him. We are in
          dream-time now, blurring the edges of reality.
          
          A CHILD
          
          wearing a skull mask pushes to the front of the crowd. He stares
          at Ashe a moment, then lifts the mask from his face...
          
          It's Danny.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          (CONFUSED)
          
          Danny...?
          
           
          
          Ashe rushes to Danny's side, holding him tight, his disbelief
          overpowered by the unfettered joy of seeing his son once again.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          What are you doing here?!
          
           
          
          DANNY
          
          It's time to go back, Dad.
          
           
          
          Ashe looks up at the screaming crows above them.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Is that why they're here?
          
           
          
          DANNY
          
          (NODDING)
          
          They're the souls who came before you. They're crying for the
          people they've lost.
          
          (BEAT)
          
          Now they're crying for you.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          But Sarah still needs me.
          
           
          
          DANNY
          
          You don't understand, Dad. You work for the dead, not the living.
          Your work here is done.
          
           
          
          Ashe reaches for his son's shoulders, all but pleading with him.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          I can't go, not yet, not now...
          
           
          
          DANNY
          
          You have to.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Danny, I can't leave her like this...
          
           
          
          The CRIES of the crows grow louder as the sky above becomes darker.
          
          A shadow passes over Danny's face. He Seems Saddened. For a moment,
          it seems as if another entity creeps into Danny's voice.
          
           
          
          DANNY
          
          If you turn your back on the dead now, you'll be trapped between
          the worlds. You'll never be allowed to cross over.
          
          (BEAT)
          
          You'll be alone, Dad. Forever.
          
           
          
          Ashe hesitates a moment, realizing the enormity of what he is
          about to do. It's an agonizing choice.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          I have to stay.
          
           
          
          Danny nods.
          
           
          
          DANNY
          
          I know.
          
           
          
          Danny reaches out to touch Ashe's painted face...
          
           
          
          DANNY
          
          (FORLORN)
          
          Good-bye, Dad.
          
           
          
          As Danny says his parting words, the SOUNDS of the world around
          them come rushing back with startling clarity. Danny starts to
          turn away...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Danny, wait...!
          
           
          
          WHAM! Ashe bolts up from the bed of flowers and glass. The spell
          is broken. Was he dreaming...?
          
          No, there's Danny slipping back into the crows, the mask pulled
          down over his face once again.
          
          Ashe reaches for Danny, spinning him around, pulling off the
          mask...
          
          ...only it's not Danny! It's a drunken DWARF with fucked-up teeth
          who's laughing his ass of at Ashe. Ashe recoils, horrified, then
          spins around, suddenly finding himself face to face with...
          
          JUDAH
          
          standing just a few yards away, emerging from the doorway of
          his tower. He got the anti-Crow blood mask on his face. His eyes
          are glowing like twin stars and his lips are curled back in a
          feral snarl. In his hands, he holds one of the chains from his
          campanile.
          
          Judah grabs Ashe by the lapels of his coat, draging him close
          so they're eye to eye -- close enough to breathe the same beath
          -- two sides of a coin.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          Tell me, Ashe. Do you every get the feeling we're all just dead
          men on leave?
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          (seething with hatred)
          
          Judah.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          In the flesh.
          
           
          
          Judah flings Ashe backwards...
          
          Ashe reaches his hand into his coat, pulling out a .45. He FIRES
          into Judah's chest - once, twice, thrice...
          
          Judah doesn't even stagger, he just keeps on grinning. Wisps
          of smoke rise up from the holes in his chest.
          
          Ashe stares at Judah, dumbfounded.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          What...are...you?
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          I'm your shadow, Ashe. Every angel's got a devil. Didn't you
          know that? Or maybe you just slept your way through Sunday school?
          
           
          
          Judah lashes out with the rope. Ashe spins and falters. Incredibly,
          he finds himself feeling pain.
          
          Judah follows with a series of blows, each more savage than the
          next, driving Ashe back...
          
          Ashe stumbles, falls to his hands and knees. He reaches to his
          mouth, his hand comes away spattered with blood. Ashe shakes
          his head to clear it.
          
          Judah kicks Ashe in the face, knocking him onto his back...
          
          ...but Ashe springs back to his feet. He tries to strike Judah.
          Judah catches Ashe's hand and squeezes tight. We hear bones snapping.
          
          CRACK! Judah smashes out with his other fist, Ashe spins around
          and collapses...
          
          Ashe tries to push himself up by his hands. He coughs, spitting
          up more blood, crawls forward...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          What... did you do to me...?
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          I've tasted the blood of the Crow and taken your power.
          
           
          
          WHOOSH! Judah whips the rope about, snapping the end around Ashe's
          neck, dragging him off his feet.
          
          Judah pulls Ashe forward, crouching over him like a spider ready
          to devour its prey.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          You're flesh and blood now, Ashe. You can die like any other
          man.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Go to hell.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          Already been there. And I must confess, I liked what I saw.

          Sarah sobs quietly, still chained to the pillar. A figure suddenly
          appears at her side -- Sibyl. Sarah looks up...
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          What...?
          
           
          
          Sibyl produces a key from within her robes. She places the key
          in the lock on Sarah's manacles. With a turn of the key, the
          manacles fall away and Sarah is free.
          
          Sarah looks back at the blind oracle, uncertain.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Why are you doing this?
          
           
          
          Sibyl fixes Sarah with her blind stare.
          
           
          
          SIBYL
          
          Ashe needs you now. More than ever.
          
           
          
          Sibyl raises her other hand. She's holding one of the misericords
          which she extends to Sarah.
          
           
          
          SIBYL
          
          Go to him.
          
           
          
          Sarah takes the misericord and racees for the end of the campanile,
          towards a beckoning doorway and a stairwell beyond. Printed on
          a grime-smeared placard nearby are the words...
          
          "THIS IS NOT AN EXIT"
          
           
          
          Sarah rushes through the doorway, heedless.

          Judah plants his foot on Ashe's chest, tightening the chain around
          Ashe's throat.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          Looks like the dead have forsaken you, my friend.
          
           
          
          Ashe clutches at the rusty chain links which bite into his flesh,
          choking.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          Look at you, bleeding like a stuck pig. Where's your precious
          strength? Where's your power?
          
          (drawing closer, whispering)
          
          You're nothing now, Ashe, not even a ghost.
          
           
          
          Judah rises. He grabs a hold of the chain, pulling...
          
          ASHE
          
          down the street. Ashe SCREAMS as his body is dragged across the
          asphalt...

          Sarah rushes into a rickety old elevator, pulling the accordion-style
          security gate shut. She punches the "DOWN" arrow on the tarnished
          control panel. With a lurch and HUM the elevator car starts its
          journey downward.

          Judah has dragged Ashe over to the East side of the street, in
          front of an old movie palace. He leaps atop one of the vending
          stalls and clambers onto the marquee itself.
          
          JUDAH
          
          shouts to the crowds below, his eyes on fire.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          You want death?! Here he is, people!!! Take a good look!!!
          
           
          
          Even as Ashe fights to free himself of the chain, Judah loops
          one end of it over a street lamp. He jumps from the marquee,
          using his body weight to pull Ashe from the ground...
          
          ASHE
          
          is dragged up into the air, dangling above the faces of the crowd.

          Sarah rushes out the front entrance of the tower, into the Day
          of the Dead crowd which swarms below. She pushes through the
          mob, trying to fight her way across the street.

          Ashe swings like a puppet from Judah's improvised hangman's noose.
          His coat and short have been all but torn to shreds.
          
          Judah drags down on the chain harder, lifting Ashe even higher,
          tightening the noose. He secures the chain on a hydrant, then
          strolls forward, inspecting his work. Judah circles Ashe, grinning
          like the cat who swallowed the canary.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          Now don't we look pretty...
          
           
          
          Ashe struggles, choking, causing...
          
          THE TATTERED PAINTING
          
          of Danny's that Ashe had kept in his coat pocket to fall free.
          It flutters to the ground, landing at Judah's feet.
          
          Judah kneels, picking it up. As he unfolds the painting, we see
          that it has been stained with Ashe's own blood. He tilts it this
          way and that -- as if he were appraising the craftsmanship of
          the piece.

          Nice. If you prick him, does he not bleed?
          
           
          
          Judah looks up at Ashe, his eyes full of crazed humor, then he
          very deliberately tears the painting to shreds, letting the pieces
          fall away into the night wind.
          
          Judah reaches for metal rod, lashing out at Ashe's bare, bloodied
          back...
          
          WHACK! Ashe SCREAMS. Judah is hell-bent on beating Ashe into
          oblivion. With every stroke of the switch the crowd CHEERS.
          
          CLOSE ON ASHE
          
          His eyes are rolling to whites as consciousness begins to recede...
          
          ASHE'S POV
          
          The swirling faces of the masked celebrants, with Judah front
          and center. Mob mentality, everyone drunk and LAUGHING, jeering
          at Ashe, the dangling fool. It's a scene out of Hell...
          
          .. and behind Judah, a familiar figure pushing her way to the
          front of the crowd...
          
          SARAH
          
          lunges forward, clutching the misericord, shoving a reveller
          aside...
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Get away from him!
          
           
          
          Judah turns. Sarah drives the misericord into Judah's eye. Judah,
          momentarily blinded, falls back...
          
          Sarah unlashes the end of the chain from the hydrant...
          
          ASHE
          
          falls to the street as the chain CLATTERS over the street lamp.
          He unravels the chain from his throat and drags himself back
          up...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Sarah, get back!
          
           
          
          Too late. Judah has torn the misericord from his eye. He rushes
          up to Sarah and...
          
          ...THUNK! Drives it deep into her chest.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          SARAH!!!
          
           
          
          Sarah gasps, drops to her knees, clutching at the dagger's handle.
          She pulls the misericord out. Blood begins to well up from the
          wound. She stares at her blood-covered hands in disbelief, then
          falls back.
          
          Silence now as the crowd begins to back away. The mood has shifted.
          
          Ashe drops by Sarah's side. She stares up at the sky, eyes wide
          with wonder...
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          The crows...I can see them coming...
          
           
          
          SARAH'S POV
          
          Once again, the crows are wheeling around the ceiling of the
          sky.
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          Ashe looks up at Judah, fueled by a righteous rage that's been
          burning since the moment of his resurrection. He rises. All reason
          is gone. The only think that remains for Ashe is an unbridled
          animal fury.
          
          Ashe launches himself at Judah, sending the villain tumbling
          back into a nest of scaffolding. One of the pipes punches clear
          through Judah's chest, impaling him!
          
          Judah hangs there, transfixed like a butterfly with a pin stuck
          through it. He struggles to pull himself from the piping, but
          even so, he's laughing hysterically...
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          You can't stop me anymore, Ashe. You don't have the power.
          
           
          
          Ashe's eyes boil with hatred.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          If it were just me, you'd be right, Judah. But I have an eternity
          of pain to call upon...
          
           
          
          Ashe lifts his hands up, exposing his bleeding palms.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          And the pain gives me strength.
          
           
          
          ASHE'S PALMS
          
          As we watch the stigmata close themselves up, blood drawing itself
          back into the wounds.
          
          Ashe raises his arms to the sky, gesturing to the crows which
          spin high above his head.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          TAKE HIM!!!
          
           
          
          EXT. JUDAH'S CAMPANILE - NIGHT
          
           
          
          The murder of crows spirals down from the sky like a black tidal
          wave. They descend on Judah as one entity, SCREAMING down from
          the heavens like a storm of razor blades.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          NO!!!
          
           
          
          We get one final glimpse of horrified Judah's face, eyes wide
          with terror, before the tidal wave of black wings engulfs him.
          
          JUDAH
          
          lets loose a DEATH-SHRIEK that all but splits the sky as the
          myriad beaks and talons rend him limb from limb.
          
          DOWN IN THE STREET,
          
          Ashe returns to Sarah's side, lifting her up off the ground and
          cradling her in his arms.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          You can't die, Sarah... I stayed for you.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          (GASPING)
          
          There's a balance that needs to be kept...someone had to cross
          over...
          
           
          
          Sarah takes a ragged breath, wincing as a wave of pain washes
          over her.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I didn't want it to be you...
          
           
          
          Sarah looks up at Ashe, tries her level best to smile. She's
          at death's door now - one foot already over the threshold. Her
          face is pale, having lost so much blood. Tears spill down Ashe's
          cheeks, causing the war-paint makeup to run in rivulets.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          (in anguish)
          
          I can't go with you, Sarah. I have to stay here now.
          
          (cursing his fate)
          
          I have to stay.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Do you love me?
          
           
          
          Ashe nods.
          
          Sarah reaches down to the wedding ring which hangs from her neck
          on the chain. She tugs at the chain, snapping it apart. She holds
          the ring out to Ashe.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Take...this...
          
           
          
          Ashe takes the ring from Sarah. She closes Ashe's hand around
          the ring, gripping his fist tightly.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I'll wait for you. Forever, if I have to.
          
           
          
          She shuts her eyes, riding through another wave of pain.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Oh God...
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Listen...if two people really love each other...
          
           
          
          She inhales sharply. Breathing has become a labor for her now.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          ...nothing can keep them apart.
          
          (her voice fading)
          
          ...nothing.
          
           
          
          Ashe nods, trying to let this thought reassure him. It's the
          only thing he has left to cling to.
          
          SARAH'S POV
          
          Ashe's face, surrounded by a nimbus of light. We're falling away
          from him. Down, down, down. And as we fall, we hear a FLUTTERING
          OF WINGS.
          
          ON SARAH'S FACE
          
          Her eyes lose focus. Her head goes slack in Ashe's arms. She's
          gone.
          
          Ashe lowers his lips to her, kissing her one final time.
          
          Ashe cradles Sarah's lifeless body in his arms, gently rocking
          back and forth, tears streaming down his cheeks.
          
          And as we pull back from them, we realize that the scene mirrors
          the prophetic image from Sarah's own painting - the woman dying
          in the arms of her lover, surrounded by a gallery of skull-masked
          celebrants.
          
          Ashe stands, lifting Sarah in his arms. He turns to leave...
          
          THE DAY OF THE DEAD CROWD
          
          slowly part for him, revealing a path of marigold petals leading
          away down the street. It's almost as if, by silent consensus,
          the crowd has come to understand what has happened here this
          night.
          
          ASHE
          
          moves through the crowd carrying Sarah in his arms. The people
          close ranks behind him and we...
          
          CUT TO:
          
           
          
          INT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMERA OBSCURA - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Sibyl stands over the camera obscura. On the table's focusing
          surface we see the street below.
          
          ASHE
          
          is carrying Sarah in his arms, moving through the crowd of silent
          witnesses.
          
          SIBYL
          
          nods to herself, satisfied. We see what might be a trace of a
          smile cross her lips.
          
          Sibyl turns and exits the camera obscura.
          
           
          
          INT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Sibyl approaches the table where the stag beetle is tethered.
          Removing a pair of scissors from within her robes, Sibyl cuts
          the thread which binds the beetle.
          
          THE STAG BEETLE,
          
          free at last, quickly scurries out of the box and across the
          table, disappearing into the shadows.
          
          Sibyl follows suit, gathering her robes about her and stepping
          on into the darkness.
          
          DISSOLVE TO:
          
           
          
          EXT. INNER-CITY CHURCH - DAWN
          
           
          
          The same church we visited the night before. Ashe, still carrying
          Sarah in his arms, enters the sanctuary.
          
          The church is aglow with candles. Ashe lays Sarah's body down
          in front of the offrenda, folding her arms across her chest,
          leaving her in a state of repose. He stands, taking in one last
          look.
          
          As Ashe moves to leave, he sees the elderly priest he had spoken
          to earlier.
          
           
          
          PRIEST
          
          Why are you still here?
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Because I have nowhere left to go.
          
           
          
          Ashe steps past the priest, moving towards the doorway and the
          daylight beyond.
          
           
          
          PRIEST
          
          What will you do, then?
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          (looking back)
          
          This city is filled with shadows. One more won't make it any
          darker.
          
           
          
          EXT. CHURCH - DAWN
          
           
          
          Ashe exits the church, finding haven in a shadowed doorway. He
          reaches into his pocket, removing the wedding ring Sarah had
          given to him...
          
          CLOSE ON THE RING
          
          as Ashe turns it over in his hands, seeing the word "FOREVER"
          inscribed on the inside of the band. He slips it on his finger.
          
           
          
          GRACE (O.S.)
          
          (CONCERNED)
          
          Are you all right?
          
           
          
          Ashe looks up to see...
          
          GRACE,
          
          the drugged-out girl that Sarah helped at the beginning of the
          film. She's looking good now, clean of the poison that once possessed
          her. And damned if she isn't holding Gabriel in her arms.
          
           
          
          GRACE
          
          Long night, huh?
          
           
          
          Gabriel MEOWS to Ashe. Ashe reaches out and scratches the cat's
          ear.
          
           
          
          GRACE
          
          Isn't he cool? I found him on the street. I was going to take
          him home with me.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          You should. Looks like he needs a home.
          
           
          
          GRACE
          
          Well, see ya.
          
           
          
          She smiles at him and starts off down the street. Gabriel turns
          around in Grace's arms and peers back at Ashe from over her shoulder.
          
          Ashe moves out from the shadows into the steadily growing light,
          watching them. We see just a hint of hope in his eyes - hope
          that someday he and Sarah will be reunited.
          
          As we hold on Ashe's face, Sarah's VOICE-OVER begins.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          I believe there's a place where the restless souls wanter...

          EXT. LIMBO - DAWN
          
           
          
          The same scene as the beginning of our film. We've made a circle.
          A heavy mist hangs before us - endless and impenetrable. And
          out of that primordial fog a CROW materializes, flying towards
          the camera in slow motion.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          Burdened by the weight of their own sadness, they cannot enter
          Heaven...
          
           
          
          Presently a second shape materializes - a FIGURE ON HORSEBACK,
          galloping after the Crow.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          And so they wait, trapped between our world and the next, endlessly
          searching for a way to rid themselves of their pain - in the
          hopes that somehow, some day, they will be reunited...
          
           
          
          As the dark rider comes towards us, we realize that it's Sarah
          whose baleful eyes are now shining behind the irony mask war
          paint.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          ...with the ones they love.
          
           
          
          CUT TO:
          
           
          
          EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAWN
          
           
          
          Ashe is back on his bike, racing beneath the cathedral-like arches
          of the overpass. As he sweeps past a concrete pillar we...
          
          CUT TO:
          
           
          
          EXT. LIMBO - DAY/NIGHT
          
           
          
          Sarah on her horse, galloping in parallel action. As she sweeps
          last a tree we...
          
          CUT TO:
          
           
          
          EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAWN
          
           
          
          Ashe on the bike. Now we intercut between the two doomed lovers,
          each on their respective steeds. Worlds apart, and yet, somehow
          traveling the same road.
          
          We are intercutting faster and faster, until the sound of HOOFBEATS
          and the MOTORCYCLE'S ROAR are indistinguishable.
          
          Until the two figures themselves begin to blur.
          
          Faster and faster and faster until we...
          
          CUT TO BLACK.
          
          Over the darkness we hear Sarah's final words to Ashe:
          
           
          
          SARAH'S VOICE
          
          If two people really love each other, nothing can keep them apart...
          
          (BEAT)
          
          Nothing.

The Crying Game
 

The Crying Game


FADE IN:

EXT. CARNIVAL - DAY

A loudspeaker playing Percy Sledge's "When a Man Loves a
Woman," as we see a carnival in the distance - with a Ferris
Wheel turning round and round.

A black man is by a stall. On his arm is an Irish girl with
blond hair. The black man is drunk, and is tossing rings
around a bowling pin.

                       JODY
            And that's cricket, hon.

An attendant hands him the teddy bear. It looks ridiculous in
his huge hands. He gives it to the girl.

                       JODY
            You want it?

                       GIRL
            Sure.

                       JODY
            Doesn't matter if you don't.

He puts his arm around her and drags her on.

                       JODY
            Jody won't be offended. Jody's never
            offended. What'd you say your name was?

                       GIRL
            Jude.

                       JODY
            Jude. Suits you, Jude.

                       JUDE
            The teddy bear?

                       JODY
            No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And
            it's June. Jude in June.

He comes to a small canvas tent with a sign on it - TOILET.



                                                               2.



                        JODY
          Gotta piss, Jude.

He holds her hand.

                        JODY
          Don't run off, Jude.

                        JUDE
          You don't know me, do you?

Jody walks inside the canvas flap and vanishes from sight. We
can still see his hand, holding Jude's. She leans against the
canvas, looking bored.

                        JODY
              (inside)
          What if I did?

                        JUDE
          You'd know I wouldn't run off.

She stands there, listening to the sound of him urinate. Her
eyes flick around the carnival. They settle on a tall dark-
haired man in a dark jacket. He nods.

                        JODY
          Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.

                        JUDE
          You didn't?

                        JODY
          And you know what?

                        JUDE
          Tell me, Jody

He staggers out, buttoning up.

                        JODY
          It's nice.

He goes to kiss her. She turns her head away.

                        JUDE
          Not here.

                        JODY
          Who gives a fuck.

                        JUDE
          You never know.



                                                               3.



She pulls him over toward the water.

                       JODY
             I never know nothing.

                       JUDE
             People. They could be looking.

Jody follows her, as she walks backward, drawing him on. He
moves his hips to a song as Jude leads him over the beach,
under a train trestle.

                       JUDE
             Come and get me, soldier --

                       JODY
             Whatever you say, Jude...

He sinks down on his knees toward her. She wraps her arms
around his neck and kisses him. Jody writhes on top of her,
fumbling with his belt. Jude cocks one eye upward. A shadow
falls across them.

CLOSE ON JODY, kissing her. A gun is put to his head. He
turns around, drunkenly.

                       JODY
             What the fuck --

The gun whacks him across the cheek and he falls sideways.

Jude scrambles to her feet and darts like an animal through a
field.

Jody feels his cheek. He can see her blond head vanishing
among the fields. He looks up and sees a group of men around
him. The tallest of them, Fergus, cocks the gun.

INT. CAR - DAY

A mini, driving down a country road. Two men in the front,
three in the back.

On the floor of the car Jody lies, with three pairs of feet
on top of him, a black bag over his head and the barrel of a
gun dangling close to his face. Fergus holds the gun. He is
smoking a cigarette. His movements are slow and somewhat
innocent.

                       FERGUS
             So what's your name, soldier?



                                                               4.



                       JODY
          Fuck you.

                       FERGUS
          Yeah.

EXT. SMALL FARMHOUSE - EVENING.

INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Jody pulled through and tied to a chair. Maguire, a small
lean man, talks to him through the hood.

                       MAGUIRE
          The situation is simple. You're being
          held hostage by the Irish Republican
          Army. They've got one of our senior
          members under interrogation in
          Castleraigh. We've informed them that if
          they don't release him within three days,
          you'll be shot. You'll be treated as our
          guest until further developments. Have
          you anything to say?

Jody is motionless under the black hood.

                       FERGUS
          Give him a cup of tea.

                       MAGUIRE
          Do you want a cup of tea?

He still says nothing.

                                                       DISSOLVE.

All the men are drinking tea. The blond woman comes in with a
plate and some food on it.

                       FERGUS
          See does he want some.

                       JUDE
          Do you want some food?

Jody sits as still as a grave, saying nothing.

                                                       DISSOLVE.

Late at night -- it is dark. The men are sleeping. Fergus is
sitting by a chair, gun in his hand, watching the prisoner.
Jude comes in, with a flashlight.



                                                               5.



                    FERGUS
          Hey -- what's he like?

                    JUDE
          Horny bastard.

                    FERGUS
          Did you give him it?

                    JUDE
          There are certain things I wouldn't do
          for my country.

                    FERGUS
          Have a look at him.

                    JUDE
          Can't.

                    FERGUS
          Poke him or something. See if he's still
          alive.

                    JUDE
          He's all right.

                    FERGUS
          Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on.
          Have a heart.

She moves over to him. She prods him in the legs with her
foot. He doesn't move. Then she lifts the hood ever so
slightly, to peer inside. Suddenly the man moves like
lightning, jerking his head down so the hood comes off,
throwing his body, tied to the chair, over Jude.

                    JODY
          You fucking bitch -- you fucking whore --

He pins her to the ground, his body bent with the chair. He
writhes on top of her in a grotesque parody of love. She is
screaming and the room is alive, each man awake, grabbing
guns, screaming.

                    MAGUIRE
          Turn the fucking thing off --

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus follows Jude out a back door, holding her by the arm.

                    FERGUS
          You all right?



                                                               6.



                        JUDE
          Fucking animal.

She takes in huge gobs of air.

                        FERGUS
          You don't know that.

                        JUDE
          Fucking do. I had him all over me.

He touches her face.

                        FERGUS
          Tough work, that.

                        JUDE
          Someone's got to do it.

She rubs her hand on his chest.

                        JUDE
          Nah, it was a breeze. Just thought of
          you.

She sidles closer, coming on to him.

                        JUDE
          And you know what, Fergus? One of you
          made me want it...

She puts her lips to his neck.

                        FERGUS
          Which one?

She doesn't answer. They embrace.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING.

A hot summer's day. There are tall hedges all around the
house. Fergus leads Jody, still bound and hooded, over toward
a greenhouse.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Dusty tomato plants and vines everywhere. Broken glass. The
sun pouring through. Fergus leads Jody over to a wrought iron
chair and sits him in it. He sits opposite, gun on his lap.
Fergus takes some sandwiches out of a brown paper bag. He
holds one out toward him.



                                                               7.



                     FERGUS
           Eat something, would you?

                     JODY
           Can't.

                     FERGUS
           What do you mean you can't?

                     JODY
           Can't eat through a canvas bag.

Fergus walks over to him, lifts the hood up so his mouth is
revealed, and pushes the sandwich toward his lips. Jody eats,
slowly.

                     JODY
           This is a farce, man.

                     FERGUS
           How is it a farce?

                     JODY
           I seen your fucking face.

                     FERGUS
           So, what do I look like?

                     JODY
           You're the one about five ten with the
           killer smile and the baby face.

                     FERGUS
           Am I?

                     JODY
           Yeah. And the brown eyes.

Fergus pushes the last crumbs of the sandwich toward Jody's
mouth.

                     JODY
           You're the handsome one.

Jody eats the last bits.

                     JODY
           Thank you, handsome.

                     FERGUS
           My pleasure.



                                                               8.



EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Jude makes her way from the door toward the greenhouse. She
is carrying a pot of tea and two cups.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

It is sweltering now in the greenhouse. CLOSE ON JODY'S
COWLED HEAD. The hood is drenched with sweat.

                        JODY
          I can't fucking breathe, man. Be a
          Christian, will you?

Jude comes into view.

                        JODY
          Tell him to take the hood off, honey...

Jude says nothing. Lays the tea on the ground.

                        FERGUS
          How did you know it was her?

                        JODY
          I can smell her perfume.

Jude pours out the tea.

                        JUDE
          See, if we took the hood off, we'd have
          to shoot you. As it is, you've got a
          fifty-fifty chance.

                        JODY
          Thought you liked me, bitch.

                        JUDE
          It was fun while it lasted.

                        JODY
          Nice lady.

His breathing becomes labored.

                        JODY
          Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.

                        FERGUS
          Can't we take it off?

                        JUDE
          Have to check with himself.



                                                             9.



Fergus gives her the gun.

                        FERGUS
          You look after him.

Jody's head follows Fergus while he leaves.

                        JODY
          Don't leave me with her, man. She's
          dangerous...

Jude smiles, holding the gun on her lap.

INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Fergus enters. Maguire and the others. Maguire has a
newspaper, which has a headline regarding the kidnapping.

                        MAGUIRE
          Made the front page. They'll move now,
          the fuckers.

                        FERGUS
          Request permission to take the hood off,
          Tommy.

                        MAGUIRE
          Why would you do that?

                        FERGUS
          The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.

                        MAGUIRE
          So?

                        FERGUS
          And anyway, he's seen our faces.

                        MAGUIRE
          You sure?

                        FERGUS
          He described me down to a T. Knows what
          Jude looks like.

Maguire reads the paper.

                        FERGUS
          Tommy --



                                                            10.



                     MAGUIRE
          You're his keeper. If you don't mind him
          seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the
          only one he looks at.

                     FERGUS
          Thanks.

                     MAGUIRE
          It's your decision.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Jude, drinking tea, looking at Jody sweating. Fergus enters.
He puts his arm casually around her.

                     FERGUS
          Leave us, Judie.

                     JUDE
          My pleasure.

She goes. Fergus walks to Jody and slowly takes the hood off.
Jody looks up at him, his face bathed in sweat. He breathes
in mighty gulps of air. He smiles.

                     JODY
          Thank you, soldier.

Fergus smiles.

                     JODY
          Never thought fresh air would taste this
          good.

Fergus pours out a cup of tea and brings it to his lips.

                     JODY
          Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be
          able to feed myself.

                     FERGUS
          No fucking way.

                     JODY
          Only joking.

Fergus drinks.

                     JODY
          You know, I was wrong about one thing.



                                                              11.



                          FERGUS
            What's that?

                          JODY
            Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no
            pinup.

                          FERGUS
            No?

                          JODY
            Nope. Not handsome at all.

                          FERGUS
            You trying to hurt my feelings?

                          JODY
            No. It's the truth.

                          FERGUS
            Well, I could say the same about you.

                          JODY
            Could you?

                          FERGUS
            But I won't. We're more polite around
            these parts.

                          JODY
            So I've noticed.

Fergus looks at him. Jody isn't smiling anymore. Fergus goes
back to his seat and drinks his tea. He fingers the gun on
his lap.

                          JODY
            Hey --

                          FERGUS
            What is it now?

                          JODY
            You're going to have to do it, aren't
            you?

                          FERGUS
            Do what?

                          JODY
            Kill me.



                                            12.



           FERGUS
What makes you think that?

           JODY
They're going to let that guy die. And
you're going to kill me.

           FERGUS
They won't let him die.

           JODY
You want to bet?

           FERGUS
I'm not a gambling man.

           JODY
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't
just let me loose.

           FERGUS
Why can't we?

           JODY
Not in your nature.

           FERGUS
What do you know about my nature?

           JODY
I'm talking about your people, not you.

           FERGUS
What the fuck do you know about my
people?

           JODY
Only that you're all tough undeluded
motherfuckers. And that it's not in your
nature to let me go.

           FERGUS
Shut the fuck up, would you?

           JODY
And you know the funny thing?

           FERGUS
No, what's the funny thing?

           JODY
I didn't even fancy her.



                                                             13.



                       FERGUS
          Didn't look like that to me...

                       JODY
          She's not my type.

He looks at Fergus.

                       JODY
          C'mere.

                       FERGUS
          No.

                       JODY
          Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.

                       FERGUS
          What?

                       JODY
          My inside pocket.

Fergus holds the gun to his face. He fishes inside Jody's
inside pocket.

                       JODY
          Take out the wallet.

Fergus's hand emerges with a wallet.

                       JODY
          Open it.

CLOSE ON THE WALLET. Credit cards, army identification
photograph.

                       JODY
          Inside. There's a picture.

Fergus takes out a picture. It is of Jody, in cricket whites,
smiling, holding a bat. Fergus smiles.

                       JODY
          No, not that one. There's another.

Fergus takes out another picture of Jody and of a beautiful
black woman, smiling.

                       JODY
          Now she's my type.



                                                       14.



                      FERGUS
          She'd be anyone's type.

                      JODY
          Don't you think of it, fucker.

                      FERGUS
          Why not?

                      JODY
          She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit
          you.

                      FERGUS
          No?

                      JODY
          Absolutely not.

                      FERGUS
          She your wife?

                      JODY
          Suppose you could say that.

Jody chuckles.

                      FERGUS
          You make a nice couple.

                      JODY
          Don't I know it.

                      FERGUS
          So what were you fucking around for,
          then?

                      JODY
          You fuckers set me up. That bitch --

                      FERGUS
          She's a friend of mine

                      JODY
          Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar.
          I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here
          anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my
          hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't
          like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe
          I'll get to understand.

                      FERGUS
          What?



                                             15.



          JODY
What the fuck am I doing here.

          FERGUS
What the fuck were you doing here?

          JODY
I got sent.

          FERGUS
You could have said no.

          JODY
Can't. Once I signed up.

          FERGUS
Why did you sign up?

          JODY
It was a job. So I get sent to the only
place in the world they call you nigger
to your face.

          FERGUS
Shouldn't take it personally.

          JODY
    (He imitates a Belfast accent)
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No
use telling them I came from Tottenham.

          FERGUS
And you play cricket?.

          JODY
Best game in the world.

          FERGUS
Ever see hurling?

          JODY
That game where a bunch of paddies whack
sticks at each other?

          FERGUS
Best game in the world.

          JODY
Never.

          FERGUS
The fastest.



                                                           16.



                        JODY
          Well, in Antigua cricket's the black
          man's game. The kids play it from the age
          of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies
          from the age of five. Then we moved to
          Tottenham and it was something different.

                        FERGUS
          How different?

                        JODY
          Toffs' game there. But not at home.     .

Fergus looks at him.

                        JODY
          So when you come to shoot me, Paddy,
          remember, you're getting rid of a shit-
          hot bowler.

                        FERGUS
          I'll bear that in mind.

He keeps looking at him.

                        FERGUS
          And by the way, it's not Paddy. It's
          Fergus.

Jody smiles.

                        JODY
          Nice to meet you, Fergus.

                        FERGUS
          My pleasure, Jody

EXT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus leads Jody outside, holding the gun against him.

                        FERGUS
          Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by
          that tree.

                        JODY
          Tree.

He walks toward it, breathing heavily.

                        JODY
          You've got to loosen my hands.



                                                           17.



                       FERGUS
          Can't.

                       JODY
          Well then, you're going to have to take
          my dick out for me, aren t you?

Fergus, in the dark, stands motionless, looking at him.

                       JODY
          Come on, man, I'm going to wet my pants!

Fergus turns him around and unzips his fly.

                       JODY
          Take the fucker out, man, I'm dying --

Fergus takes Jody's penis out.

Jody takes two steps toward the wall.

                       JODY
          I gotta lean forward or I'll dribble all
          over myself. Will you hold my hands for
          me.

Fergus holds his hands from behind, so Jody can lean forward.
Jody now pisses with immense relief

                       JODY
          Now, that was worth waiting for.

                       FERGUS
          Hurry up, would you?

                       JODY
          These things take time, Fergus.

He shakes his body.

                       JODY
          It's amazing how these small details take
          on such importance...

He steps back.

                       JODY
          Now put it back in.

                       FERGUS
          Give us a break.



                                                            18.



                          JODY
             I can't do it! It's only a piece of meat.
             For fuck's sake, it's got no major
             diseases.

Fergus puts Jody's penis back in his pants and zips him up.

                          JODY
             Thank you. I had a case of the clap two
             years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in
             all it's served me well.

                          FERGUS
             Shut up, would you?

                          JODY
             I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you,
             Fergus.

Fergus leads him hack toward the greenhouse.

INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus leads Jody back to his chair.

                          JODY
             Fergus?

                          FERGUS
             Yeah?

                          JODY
             Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.

He begins to laugh.

                          FERGUS
             The pleasure was all mine.

Fergus begins to laugh, without knowing why.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Maguire, walking out of the house, woken by the sound of
laughter.

INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Jody, still laughing. Suddenly the hood is slammed back over
his head.

Maguire, standing there in the dark, looking at Fergus.



                                                              19.



                    MAGUIRE
          What the fuck is this?

                    FERGUS
          It's nothing. He's just got a sense of
          humor, that's all.

                    MAGUIRE
          You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth
          shut. Go in and get some sleep.

Fergus gets up slowly, walks toward the door.

                    JODY
          Yeah. Get some sleep.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus, walking toward the house. He looks back and sees the
figures of Maguire and Jody in the dark, in absolute silence.

INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus sleeping.

INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Jody sleeping. Maguire sitting with an Armalite in his hands,
watching him.

EXT. FARMHOUSE AND FIELDS - DAY

The sun coming up over the low hills around the farmhouse.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Fergus enters, with a tray and some breakfast. Maguire is
sitting where he sat before, stock-still.

                    FERGUS
          Did he talk?

Maguire shakes his head.

                    FERGUS
          Didn't make you laugh?

Maguire shakes his head.

                    FERGUS
          Here. Have some breakfast.

He hands Maguire a plate. Jody stirs.



                                                              20.



                    JODY
          Good morning, Fergus?

Maguire looks hard at him.

                    MAGUIRE
          So he knows your name?

                    FERGUS
          I told him.

                    MAGUIRE
          Are you all there?

He rises, and drags Fergus out the door.

                    FERGUS
          Back in a minute, Jody

EXT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

                    MAGUIRE
          You'll have minimal contact with the
          prisoner, do you hear me?

                    FERGUS
          Yes.

                    MAGUIRE
          And do you know why?

                    FERGUS
          Why?

                    MAGUIRE
          Because tomorrow we might have to shoot
          him, that's why.

Maguire goes back to the house.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Jody sitting with the hood on again. Fergus enters.

                    JODY
          They giving you trouble, Fergus?

Fergus says nothing. He takes a plate and brings it toward
Jody



                                                           21.



                         JODY
             It happens. Y'see, there's two kinds of
             people. Those who give and those who
             take.

Fergus lifts up Jody's hood to expose his mouth and begins to
feed him.

                         JODY
             Ah, take the thing off, man.

Fergus says nothing and keeps feeding him.

                         JODY
             It's okay. I understand. Don't mind if I
             prattle on, do you?

Fergus shakes his head and says nothing.

                         JODY
             I will take it by your silence that you
             don't.

He eats. Fergus feeds himself, then feeds more to Jody.

                         JODY
             Two types, Fergus. The scorpion and the
             frog. Ever heard of them?

Fergus says nothing.

                         JODY
             Scorpion wants to cross a river, but he
             can't swim. Goes to the frog, who can,
             and asks for a ride. Frog says, "If I
             give you a ride on my back, you'll go and
             sting me." Scorpion replies, "It would
             not be in my interest to sting you since
             as I'll be on your back we both would
             drown." Frog thinks about this logic for
             a while and accepts the deal. Takes the
             scorpion on his back. Braves the waters.
             Halfway over feels a burning spear in his
             side and realizes the scorpion has stung
             him after all. And as they both sink
             beneath the waves the frog cries out,
             "Why did you sting me, Mr. Scorpion, for
             now we both will drown?" Scorpion
             replies, "I can't help it, it's in my
             nature."

Jody chuckles under his hood.



                                                           22.



                            FERGUS
              So what's that supposed to mean?

                            JODY
              Means what it says. The scorpion does
              what is in his nature. Take off the hood,
              man.

                            FERGUS
              Why?

                            JODY
              'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.

Fergus walks toward him and pulls off the hood. Jody smiles
up at him.

                            JODY
              See? I was right about you.

                            FERGUS
              Don't be so sure.

                            JODY
              Jody's always right.

INT. GREENHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON.

Both men dozing in the heat.

                            JODY
              Where would you most like to be now, man?

                            FERGUS
              Doesn't matter where.

                            JODY
              Come on, man. If this shit was all over.

                            FERGUS
              Having a pint in the Rock.

                            JODY
              You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of
              something more alluring.

                            FERGUS
              Like what?

                            JODY
              Like having a pint in the Metro --

Fergus laughs.



                                             23.



              FERGUS
Having two pints in the Rock.

              JODY
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's
having a margarita.

              FERGUS
Who's Dil?

              JODY
My special friend.

              FERGUS
Oh, yeah.

              JODY
We got simple tastes, you and me.

              FERGUS
The best.

              JODY
But you fellas never get a break, do you?

              FERGUS
Do you?

              JODY
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're
finished. But you guys are never
finished, are you?

              FERGUS
We don't look on it like that.

              JODY
I've often wondered how you do it.

              FERGUS
Depends on what you believe in.

              JODY
What do you believe in?

              FERGUS
That you guys shouldn't be here.

              JODY
It's as simple as that?

              FERGUS
Yes.



                                                            24.



Jude enters.

                        JUDE
          Put that thing back on him, Fergus.

                        FERGUS
          He's hot.

                        JUDE
          Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover
          the fucker up.

                        JODY
          Have you no feelings, woman?

                        JUDE
          You shut your face --

She pulls the hood down over him.

                        JUDE
          You're heading for trouble, Fergus --

                        JODY
          He's a good soldier, Jude.

She whacks him with a pistol.

                        JUDE
          I said shut the fuck up --

                        JODY
          He believes in the future --

INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Jody, sitting in the hood. Fergus lifts it a bit; Jody's
mouth, with blood now in his lips.

                        FERGUS
          Is it bad?

                        JODY
          No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know
          that, Fergus?

                        FERGUS
          I didn't.

                        JODY
          Some kinds of women are...



                                                          25.



                      FERGUS
            She can't help it.

                      JODY
            Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.

                      FERGUS
            You liked her?

                      JODY
            Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever
            she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus.
            Will you think of her too?

                      FERGUS
            Don't know her.

                      JODY
            Want you to do something, Fergus.

                      FERGUS
            What?

                      JODY
            If they kill me --

                      FERGUS
            Don't think that way.

                      JODY
            But they will. As sure as night follows
            day. They have to. I want you to find her
            out. Tell her I was thinking of her.

Fergus is moved. He can't reply.

                      JODY
            See if she's all right.

                      FERGUS
            I don't know her.

                      JODY
            Take her picture. C'mere.

Fergus walks toward him.

                      JODY
            Take it. In the inside pocket.

Their faces, close to each other as Fergus searches out her
picture.



                                                             26.



                        JODY
          Take the whole lot. I won't need it.

                        FERGUS
          I told you not to talk that way --

                        JODY
          Go to Millie's Hair Salon in
          Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a
          margarita. Don't have to tell her who you
          are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --

                        FERGUS
          Stop it --

The door opens. Maguire is there, with another.

                        MAGUIRE
          Volunteer?

Fergus turns toward him.

                        MAGUIRE
          We need you inside.

Fergus walks toward Maguire and the other man walks forward,
takes his seat. Fergus, unseen by Maguire, puts the wallet in
his pocket.

INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Maguire, Jude, Fergus, and the others.

                        MAGUIRE
          We've had word. They've used every trick
          in the book on him. He's starting to
          talk. You're going to have to do it in
          the morning.

Maguire lights a cigarette. Fergus looks at him and nods.

                        MAGUIRE
          You OK about that?

                        FERGUS
          I'm a volunteer, am n't I?

                        MAGUIRE
          Good. I was beginning to have my doubts
          about you for the last few days.

                        JUDE
          Not the only one --



                                                          27.



                            MAGUIRE
              Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep
              tonight, Fergus.

                            FERGUS
              Peter.

                            MAGUIRE
              What?

                            FERGUS
              Request permission to guard the prisoner
              tonight --

                            JUDE
              You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.

                            MAGUIRE
              Shut the fuck up, Jude.

He turns back to Fergus. He puts his arm on Fergus's
shoulder.

                            MAGUIRE
              Why do you want to do that for?

                            FERGUS
              Would make me feel better about it.

                            MAGUIRE
              You sure about that?

                            FERGUS
              I'm sure.

                            MAGUIRE
              Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.

Fergus leaves.

INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus takes his place in the chair beside Jody.

Jody begins to laugh under the hood. It turns into the sound
of crying.

                            FERGUS
              Don't.

                            JODY
              I'm sorry.



                                                              28.



The crying stops.

                        JODY
          Help me.

                        FERGUS
          How can I?

                        JODY
          I don't know. Just help me. Give me a
          cigarette.

Fergus takes out a cigarette, lights it, and lifts up Jody's
hood so he can smoke.

                        JODY
          Don't even smoke, you know that? It just
          seemed the right thing to do.

Fergus watches him puff the cigarette, the hood just above
his lips. Jody coughs, but keeps the cigarette in his lips.
Fergus gently takes the cigarette from his mouth.

                        FERGUS
          Go to sleep now.

                        JODY
          I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.

                        FERGUS
          What?

                        JODY
          A story.

                        FERGUS
          Like the one about the frog?

                        JODY
          And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.

                        FERGUS
          When I was a child...

                        JODY
          Yeah?

                        FERGUS
          I thought as a child. But when I became a
          man I put away childish things...

                        JODY
          What does that mean?



                                                             29.



                       FERGUS
          Nothing.

                       JODY
          Tell me something, anything.

Fergus is silent; his eyes wet.

                       JODY
          Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?

                       FERGUS
          Me? No, I'm not good for much...

EXT. FIELDS - MORNING.

The farmhouse covered in mist. The sun coming through it.

EXT. GREENHOUSE - MORNING.

Maguire opens the door to the greenhouse and clicks the
chamber of his gun. Fergus has a gun in his hand. He checks
the chamber.

Fergus takes Jody, whose hands are still tied behind his
back, by the elbow.

                       FERGUS
          Stand up, now --

Jody rises. Fergus leads him through the door, past Maguire.

                       MAGUIRE
          I wish to say on behalf of the Irish
          Republican Army --

Fergus turns with sudden fierceness.

                       FERGUS
          Leave him be --

He pulls Jody through the fields.

EXT. TREES - MORNING.

Fergus pushing Jody through a copse of trees, the gun at his
back.

                       JODY
          Take the hood off, Fergus --

                       FERGUS
          No.



                                                              30.



                     JODY
          I want to see a bit. Please, please.
          Don't make me die like an animal.

Fergus pulls the hood off. Jody looks around him. He has a
cut lip where Jude struck him.

Fergus prods him on with the gun. Jody stumbles forward.
Fergus is all cold and businesslike.

                     JODY
          I'm glad you're doing it, do you know
          that, Fergus?

                     FERGUS
          Why?

                     JODY
          Cause you're my friend. And I want you to
          go to the Metro --

                     FERGUS
          Stop that talk now --

                     JODY
          Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?

                     FERGUS
          The fastest.

                     JODY
          Faster than cricket?

                     FERGUS
          Cricket's in the halfpenny place.

                     JODY
          So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat
          you, is there?

                     FERGUS
          You won't run.

                     JODY
          But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a
          brother in the back --

Jody suddenly sprints, and, loosening the ties on his hands,
then freeing them, he is off like a hare. Fergus screams in
fury after him.

                     FERGUS
          JODY!!!



                                                              31.



Fergus aims, then changes his mind and runs.

                            FERGUS
              You stupid bastard --

                            JODY
              What you say, faster?

                            FERGUS
              I said you bastard -- stop --

                            JODY
              Got to catch me first --

Fergus gains on him -- stretches his arm out -- but Jody
sprints ahead again -- as if he has been playing with him. He
laughs in exhilaration. Fergus pants behind him, wheezing,
almost laughing.

                            JODY
              Used to run the mile, you know -- four
              times round the cricket pitch -- what was
              that game called?

                            FERGUS
              Hurling --

                            JODY
              What?

                            FERGUS
              Hurling --

Jody runs, whipping through the trees -- always ahead of him.

                            JODY
              Come on, Fergie -- you can do it -- a bit
              more wind --

Fergus grabs his shoulder and Jody shrugs it off, gaining on
him again.

                            JODY
              Bit of fun, Fergus, eh?

And suddenly the trees give way. Jody turns, laughing, to
Fergus.

                            JODY
              Told you I was fast --

Fergus is panting, pointing the gun at Jody



                                                             32.



                        JODY
             Don't do it.

And suddenly a Saracen tank whips around the corner, hits
Jody with the full of its fender. His body flies in the air
and bounces forward as another tank tries to grind to a halt
and the huge wheels grind over him.

Fergus, screaming, "No-!" He almost moves forward, then sees
soldiers spilling from the tank around the body. Fergus turns
and runs.

EXT. TREES - DAY

Fergus whipping through the trees, his body crouched low as
he runs.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Tinker sitting in the greenhouse. A helicopter screams into
view through the panes and automatic fire comes from it,
shattering every pane in seconds and tearing Tinker to bits.

INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Bullets whipping through every window, taking chunks from the
masonry, tearing the walls apart. Maguire, Jude, and the
others on the floor, scrambling for weapons.

EXT. TREES - DAY

Fergus, hearing the gunfire, runs through overhanging
branches till eventually he is hidden from sight.

EXT. CARNIVAL ON THE MONAGHAN BORDER - DAWN.

A forlorn-looking building over nondescript fields.

An old man wheels a bicycle slowly toward it; a rusty car
appears; and Fergus gets out of it.

                        TOMMY
             Fergus!

                        FERGUS
             You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're
             you keeping?

INT. CARAVAN - DAY

The old man pouring whiskey into a teacup.



                                                                33.



                        TOMMY
             You'll notice I've asked you nothing.

                        FERGUS
             That's wise, Tommy.

                        TOMMY
             All right, then. I like to be wise.

He pours Fergus more whiskey.

                        TOMMY
             So what do you need, Fergus?

                        FERGUS
             Need to go across the water.

                        TOMMY
             Do you now.

                        FERGUS
             Need to lose myself awhile.

                        TOMMY
             Aha.

He looks at Fergus and lights a cigarette.

He puffs.

                        TOMMY
             There's a man I know ships cattle to
             London.

EXT. DUBLIN BAY - EVENING.

The ferry, churning into the sunset.

                                                      FADE TO BLACK.

INT. BUILDING SITE - DAY

FADE UP into an elegant, empty Georgian room, covered in
clouds of dust. A figure among the clouds of dust, hacking at
a wall with a sledgehammer. It is Fergus, dressed in
laborer's overalls, covered in dust. He is knocking the
bricks from an outer wall. He works furiously and
relentlessly, like a machine.

We see the wall, with the hammer striking it. One brick falls
away, then another. Daylight pours through the clouds of dust
and the growing hole.



                                                              34.



Fergus's face, as he works.

The hole. More bricks falling away. Through the clouds of
dust and the streams of daylight we now see a patch of green.

Fergus's face, working. His rhythm slows.

The hole. More bricks fall away. Then the hammer stops. The
dust begins to clear.

His face.

The jagged hole. The dust drifts across it, revealing a
cricket pitch, with tiny sticklike figures running on the
green.

EXT. HOSTEL - DAY

Fergus, returning from work, crosses the street, and enters
through a white door.

INT. HOSTEL - DAY

Fergus dressing. He puts on a cheap suit, like any country
boy in a big city. He takes Jody's wallet from the trousers
of his overalls. He flips it open, sees the picture of the
soldier and Dil. He puts it in the pocket of his suit.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Fergus walking down a street looking for an address. Some
distance down the street is a sign -- MILLIE'S UNISEX HAIR
SALON.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Fergus, standing as the crowds go by him, looking in the
window. He has the picture in his hand. We see Dil from his
point of view, then Fergus walks inside.

INT. HAIR SALON - DAY

Fergus enters. The door gives a loud ping.

                       A GIRL
             We're closing. I'll see you tomorrow, Dil

She leaves the salon.

                       DIL
             You want something in particular?



                                                              35.



                        FERGUS
          Just a bit of a trim...

Dil checks her watch and stubs out a cigarette.

                        DIL
          Come on...

She gestures toward a chair. Fergus sits down. She comes
toward him and fiddles with his hair.

She pushes his head back into a basin behind him. She begins
to knead his hair in hot water and shampoo.

                        DIL
          Someone recommend you?

                        FERGUS
          In a way.

                        DIL
          Who?

                        FERGUS
          Guy I work with.

                        DIL
          What's his name?

Fergus can't think of an answer. The hands with the purple
nails run over his scalp.

                        FERGUS
          Doesn't the water get to your nails?

                        DIL
          What's it to you?

                        FERGUS
          Nothing.

Fergus, sitting up. She begins to cut.

                        DIL
          You American?

                        FERGUS
          No.

                        DIL
          Not English.



                                                              36.



                           FERGUS
             No.

                           DIL
             Scottish?

                           FERGUS
             How'd you guess?

                           DIL
             The accent, I suppose.

                           FERGUS
             And what's it like?

                           DIL
             Like treacle.

She imitates his accent saying it. Fergus laughs.

                           DIL
             Nice laugh.

Dil raises Fergus's head up, with his new-cut hair and holds
a mirror up behind his head so he can see the back. He looks
like a young London stockbroker. The hair salon around them
is empty.

                           DIL
             That should make her happy.

                           FERGUS
             Who's she?

                           DIL
             Don't know. Who is she?

EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.

Fergus emerges from the shop. He takes one last look through
the window where Dil is taking off her smock, touching up her
hair, etc. It is as if she has forgotten all about him. He
walks off through the crowds and then ducks into a doorway.

The doorway of the shop. Dil comes out, dressed in a pair of
high heels, a very short skirt, different, more raunchy
clothes on her than we saw inside. She locks the glass door
and walks down the street, across the road, and into a pub
called the Metro. Fergus follows.



                                                             37.



INT. METRO - EVENING.

Half full, with an after-work crowd. Dil makes her way
through it.

                        BARMAN
          Hi, Dil

                        DIL
          Hiya, hon.

She sits down at the bar. Fergus comes toward the bar and
takes a seat.

                        BARMAN
          What'll it be?

                        FERGUS
          A bottle of Guinness.

Dil, looking at Fergus.

                        DIL
          See that, Col?

                        COL
          See what, Dil?

                        DIL
          He gave me a look.

                        COL
          Did he?

Fergus blushes. He buries himself in his drink.

                        DIL
          Just cut his hair, you know.

                        COL
          Yeah?

                        DIL
          What you think?

                        COL
          Nice.

Fergus throws his eyes toward her again. She has her face
turned away, but sees him in the mirror.

                        DIL
          There, he did it again.



                                                             38.



                           COL
              Saw that one.

                           DIL
              What would you call it?

                           COL
              Now, that was a look.

She eyes Fergus in the mirror.

                           DIL
              Ask him to ask me what I'm drinking.

The barman, with infinite weariness, approaches Fergus.

                           COL
              She wants to know do you want to know
              what she's drinking.

Fergus is about to talk when she pipes up.

                           DIL
              A margarita.

The barman mixes it. She stares at the mirror, staring at
Fergus, who is trying to avoid her eyes. The barman hands her
the drink.

                           DIL
              Now he can look.... Ask him does he like
              his hair, Col.

                           COL
              She wants to know, sir, do you like your
              hair.

                           FERGUS
              Tell her I'm very happy with it.

                           DIL
              He's Scottish, Col.

                           COL
              Scottish?

                           FERGUS
              Yeah.

                           DIL
              What'd he say, Col?



                                                              39.



                         COL
           He agreed that he was.

                         DIL
           What do you think his name is?

                         COL
           I've no thoughts on the subject.

                         FERGUS
           Jimmy.

                         DIL
           Jimmy?

                         COL
           That's what he said. Jimmy.

                         DIL
           Hi, Jimmy.

                         FERGUS
           Hiya, Dil

A burly man sits down beside her. He puts his hand on her
knee.

                         MAN
           Sing the song, Dil --

She slaps the hand away.

                         DIL
           Fuck off, Dave.

                         DAVE
           C'mon, babe! You know what I like...
           Easy!

She turns back to Fergus and finds his seat empty.

EXT. METRO - NIGHT.

Fergus, standing across the road from the pub. He is
sweating. Dil comes out of the pub. She looks this way and
that, as if searching for Fergus. Fergus stands back into a
shadow.

Dave, the burly man, comes out. He grabs her by the elbow.
She shrugs him off. She walks off. Dave follows, grabs her by
the elbow again. The sense of an old argument. Dave suddenly
strikes her across the face with his open palm.



                                                              40.


She leans her head against a wall. Dave then puts his arms
around her, consoles her.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT.

Dave walking, holding Dil by the arm. The street is
dilapidated, full of squats. They stop outside a door. Dil
opens the door with a key from her purse and they both walk
inside.

Fergus stands there, observing.

A light comes on in an upstairs room. Dil enters; we see her
shadow in silhouette behind the curtain and the shadow of
Dave coming in behind her. He begins to remove her blouse.
She stands absolutely still as he does so.

Fergus backs away, then walks off.

INT. HOSTEL - NIGHT.

Fergus, in bed. Fade to black as we see Jody as a bowler,
running in slow motion, toward the camera. He releases the
ball; we see Fergus in bed, breathing heavily.

INT. SITE - NEXT DAY

Fergus takes a break and watches the batsman hit a ball. He
imitates the batsman's motion with his sledgehammer. Then a
voice interrupts him.

                        DEVEROUX
           So Pat's a cricket fan, eh?

Fergus turns. We see Tristram Deveroux, a young Sloane type
in a three-piece suit, whose house it is. Beside him is
Franknum, the cockney foreman.

                        FERGUS
           It's not Pat. It's Jim.

                        DEVEROUX
           Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as
           you remember you're not at Lords.

Fergus resumes work.

INT. METRO - NIGHT.

It is now crowded with people, black, white, punky and street
chic, a lot of leather All the women are heavily made-up.
Someone is singing from the tiny stage and rows of cheap
colored bulbs are flashing around it.



                                                              41.



From the way Fergus walks through, it is obvious he has never
been here at night. He seems most out of place in his cheap
suit, making his way through the crowd to the bar.

AT THE BAR.

Fergus looks through the odd crowd, but can't find Dil. Col,
the barman, sees him and smiles.

                     COL
          So can we consider you a regular, sir?

                     FERGUS
          Is that good or bad?

                     COL
          Well, you get to say, The usual, Col.
          Things like that.

Col pushes a colored cocktail with one of those Japanese
umbrellas toward him.

                     COL
          So let's call this the usual.

                     FERGUS
          Thanks.

Fergus reaches for his wallet to pay, but Col interrupts.

                     COL
          No, no. It's on me.

Fergus tries to pretend he's familiar with the drink, and by
implication, whatever are the norms of the place. He lifts
the glass to his mouth, but the umbrella keeps getting in the
way.

                     COL
          Take it out, if you want.

Fergus takes out the umbrella. He holds it in one hand and
drinks with the other.

                     COL
          You came to see her, didn't you?

Fergus shrugs. He takes out a cigarette. A guy in leather to
his left smiles at him.

                     COL
          Something I should tell you. She's --



                                                              42.



                       FERGUS
          She's what?

The barman looks up toward the stage.

                       COL
          She's on.

THE JUKEBOX.

A hand presses a button. The needle selects a disk. A song by
Dave Berry, "The Crying Game."

AT THE BAR.

Fergus looks up. Close-up of Dil's hand, as music begins,
making movements to the music. We see Dil, standing on a
stage, swaying slightly. She seems a little drunk. She mimes
to the song. She mouths the words so perfectly and the voice
on the song is so feminine that there is no way of knowing
who is doing the singing. She does all sorts of strange
movements, as if she is drawing moonbeams with her hands.

The crowd seems to know this act. They cheer, whether out of
approval or derision we can't be sure.

Fergus watching.

Dil singing, noticing him. She comes to the end of the song.
The crowd cheers.

Fergus, watching her make her way through the crowded bar,
toward him.

                       DIL
          He's still looking, Col.

                       COL
          Persistent.

                       DIL
          Good thing in a man.

                       COL
          An excellent quality.

                       DIL
          Maybe he wants something.

                       COL
          I would expect he does.



                                                             43.



                      DIL
          Ask him.

                      COL
          Ask him yourself.

She looks at Fergus directly, sits down next to him.

                      DIL
          So tell me.

Fergus says nothing. He shrugs.

                      DIL
          Everybody wants something.

                      FERGUS
          Not me.

                      DIL
          Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned
          and quaint. Isn't it, Col?

Col shrugs.

                      DIL
          You old-fashioned?

                      FERGUS
          Must be.

The burly man comes up to her.

                      MAN
          Got the money, Dil?

                      DIL
          Fuck off, Dave.

                      DAVE
          You fucking promised.

                      DIL
          Did I?

                      DAVE
          You fucking did.

He suddenly jerks her roughly off the stool, spilling her
drink.

                      DAVE
          Didn't you? Well, come on!



                                                              44.



He drags her through the crowd. In the mirror, Fergus watches
them go. The barman eyes him.

                        COL
              It takes all types.

                        FERGUS
              So who's he?

                        COL
              He's what she should run a mile from.

                        FERGUS
              Then why doesn't she?

                        COL
              Who knows the secrets of the human heart.

Fergus suddenly stands and makes his way to the door.

EXT. PUB - NIGHT.

Fergus comes out. A black bouncer is there, but there is no
sign of Dil. He walks a few yards and hears voices down an
alley. He looks up it.

P0V - ALLEY.

We see Dil pushing Dave away. He grabs her, turns her
roughly.

                        DAVE
              Don't be like that --

                        DIL
              You heard me --

She beats his arms away. Money falls on the ground. She
staggers away from him. He picks up the money, then runs
after her.

                        DAVE
              Got very fucking grand, haven't we --

He tries to pull her back.

                        DAVE
              Talk to me, you stupid bitch --

They both bump into Fergus, who just stands there and doesn't
move an inch. She smiles.



                                                             45.



                        DIL
          Hi.

                        FERGUS
          Hi. You forgot your bag.

He holds it up to show her.

                        DIL
          Thank you.

                        DAVE
          Who the fuck is he?

                        DIL
          Jimmy.

                        DAVE
          It's him, isn't it?

                        DIL
          Maybe.

Dave eyes Fergus. Fergus grabs his wrists and upends him on
the ground.

                        DIL
          See, they get the wrong idea.

                        DAVE
                 (from the ground)
          Cunt.

Fergus puts his foot on Dave's neck.

                        FERGUS
          What was that?

                        DIL
          They all get the wrong idea.

                        DAVE
          Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.

                        DIL
          Charming.

Dave grabs for her ankle. She kicks his hand away. Fergus
presses down his foot. He looks to Dil.

                        FERGUS
          What'll I do?



                                                          46.



                          DIL
            Break his neck.

Fergus presses his foot.

                          DIL
            No, don't.

She bends low to Dave.

                          DIL
            He's going to take his foot off slowly,
            David. Then you're to go home, like a
            good boy. You hear me?

                          DAVE
            Cunt.

But his voice is softer. Fergus removes his foot. Dil grabs
his arm.

                          DIL
            Come on, honey.

She draws him away.

EXT. METRO - NIGHT.

They walk out of the alley.

                          FERGUS
            You all right?

                          DIL
            Yes, thank you.

                          FERGUS
            What was that all about?

                          DIL
            He wants me to perform for him.

                          FERGUS
            Perform?

                          DIL
            You know.

                          FERGUS
            You on the game?

                          DIL
            God no. I'm a hairdresser.



                                                              47.



Fergus looks back. Dave is rising.

                     FERGUS
          He's getting up.

                     DIL
          You can't leave me then, can you?

EXT. STAIRCASE OUTSIDE DIL'S FLAT

Fergus and Dil climb slowly upstairs.

                     DIL
          You want me to ask you in, right?

                     FERGUS
          No, I didn't --

                     DIL
          But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud,
          but never cheap.

There is a movement lower down the staircase. We see Dave,
holding his neck.

                     DAVE
          Fucking dumb dyke carrot cunt.

Dil leans close to Fergus.

                     DIL
          If you kissed me, it would really get his
          goat.

She tilts up her face. Fergus kisses her, tenderly.

                     DIL
          Now, if you asked me to meet you
          tomorrow, it would really drive him
          insane.

                     FERGUS
          Where?

                     DIL
          Half-five. At Millie's.

She goes in and closes the door. Fergus stands and looks down
at Dave, who turns to leave.

EXT. HAIR SALON - DAY

Dil walks out of the salon, smiling, and walks toward Fergus.



                                                             48.



                        DIL
          Give me that look again.

                        FERGUS
          What look?

                        DIL
          The one you gave me in the Metro.

Fergus takes a bunch of flowers from behind his back. She
holds them, with theatrical feeling.

                        DIL
          Darling, you shouldn't have.

She laughs and leans toward him and kisses him in a
classically old-fashioned way. The girls inside the salon
pull back a curtain, and they all clap.

                        FERGUS
          What's that about?

                        DIL
          They're jealous.

                        FERGUS
          Why?

                        DIL
          I wonder.

She takes his arm and walks off with him.

INT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT.

Fergus and Dil looking at their menus. A waiter places drinks
on their table, then leaves.

                        DIL
          Now's the time you're meant to do
          something, isn't it?

                        FERGUS
          Like what?

                        DIL
          Make a pass or something. Isn't that the
          way it goes?

                        FERGUS
          Must be.



                                                              49.



EXT. STREET - NIGHT.

They are walking in an alleyway toward her house.

                        DIL
          You got a special friend, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          How special?

                        DIL
          You want one?

And suddenly a car drives very fast toward them, headlights
on. Fergus pulls her into a doorway to avoid it.

                        FERGUS
          Jesus Christ!

                        DIL
          Jesus.

The car continues down the road, stops, and then screeches
off.

                        FERGUS
          That Dave?

                        DIL
          The things a girl has to put up with.

She looks down toward where the car has pulled away.

                        DIL
          I'm frightened, Jimmy. That's not like
          him.

EXT. DIL'S FLAT.

A car pulls up behind Dil and Fergus.

                        DIL
          Piss off, Dave!

                        FERGUS
          Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all
          right on your own?

                        DIL
          I'm not on my own, am I?

She touches his cheek.



                                                             50.



                        DIL
          Come on up, would you?

INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.

Dil comes in in the darkness. Fergus stands like a shadow in
the doorway. The light comes on; she takes off her raincoat.

                        DIL
          Won't hurt you to come in.

Fergus enters slowly. He looks around the room; there is an
exaggerated femininity about everything in it.

                        DIL
          Would you like a drink?

                        FERGUS
          Yes, please.

                        DIL
          What'll it be?

                        FERGUS
          Whiskey.

She goes into a small kitchen. Fergus looks at the
mantelpiece and sees a picture of Jody. The camera tracks
into the soldier's smiling face. Then into Fergus's face. His
reverie is broken by the sound of a voice outside -- Dave's.

She comes through with two drinks.

                        FERGUS
          Someone out there.

                        DIL
          Jesus fucking Christ.

She opens the window door, and we see Dave on the street, in
a neck brace.

                        DIL
          Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --

                        DAVE
          It's Dave.

She goes back into the room and begins taking things up.

                        DAVE
          Talk to me, Dil --



                                                              51.



                        DIL
           Sure, Dave --

                        DAVE
           Please, Dil --

She flings things down: men's clothes, leather trousers, a
suitcase, a teddy bear.

                        DIL
           Take your clothes.

                        DAVE
           Don't throw my clothes out the window!

                        DIL
           Fuck off back to Essex!

                        DAVE
           Fucking mad!

Fergus looks to the man down in the street, a parody of
rejection with his things in his arms.

                        DAVE
           Don't chuck my clothes out!

                        DIL
           Take your fucking goldfish, too!

Dil grabs a large goldfish bowl and flings it down. The bowl
breaks to bits on the pavement. Goldfish thrash around in the
street.

                        DAVE
           You fucking bitch!

He tries to pick up the flapping fish in his hands.

                        DAVE
           Murderer!

Upstairs, Dil closes the window shut.

                        DIL
           Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a
           brace?

                        FERGUS
           Must be in love to manage that.

                        DIL
           Doesn't know the meaning of the word.



                                                              52.



Fergus stands as Dil hands him a glass.

                       FERGUS
          He lived here with you?

                       DIL
          Tried to. Sit down, will you?

Fergus walks past the photograph and sits down. He looks from
her to the picture.

                       FERGUS
          What about him?

He nods toward the picture. She looks down into her drink.

                       DIL
          He was different.

                       FERGUS
          How different?

                       DIL
          As different as it's possible to be.

                       FERGUS
          Tell me about him.

                       DIL
          No.

                       FERGUS
          Shouldn't I go?

                       DIL
          Yes.

And they fall into one another's arms. She stretches up with
her whole body over him. They grow suddenly and violently
passionate.

They fall into the cushions of the couch onto the floor. The
photograph above them seems to smile. He draws up her dress
with his hands. She suddenly pulls away.

                       DIL
          No --

                       FERGUS
          Did you do that to him?

She comes up toward him once more. She puts her mouth close
to his ear.



                                                              53.



                        DIL
          You want to know how I kissed him?

                        FERGUS
          Yes...

                        DIL
          Are you jealous of him?

                        FERGUS
          Maybe.

                        DIL
          That's good...

She opens the buttons on his shirt and her mouth travels down
his chest. Fergus tries to draw her up toward him, but her
hand reaches up to his mouth and presses his head back while
her other hand undoes his pants. She kisses his stomach; her
mouth moves down his body. Fergus stares at the picture of
Jody. Jody's eyes seem to burn through him. Dil raises her
head and kisses his mouth. There are tears in his eyes.

                        FERGUS
          What would he think?

                        DIL
          Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He
          was a soldier. Went there like a fool.

She sits in front of the mirror.

                        FERGUS
          Do you miss him?

                        DIL
          What do you think?

                        FERGUS
          I think you do.

                        DIL
                  (dreamily)
          You say that like a gentleman.

                        FERGUS
          Do I?

                        DIL
          Like you're concerned.

Fergus gets up and stands behind her, gently pushes the hair
from her face.



                                                             54.



                        DIL
          But you can t stay, you know that?

                        FERGUS
          Didn't think I could.

                        DIL
          A real gentleman...

She embraces him.

                        FERGUS
          Shouldn't you be in mourning?

                        DIL
          I am.

She sits back down in front of the mirror. Fergus leaves. She
reapplies her lipstick.

INT. METRO - NIGHT.

Singer in a blue dress. Dil and Fergus by the bar. Both
drinking drinks with umbrellas. Dave comes up behind them
with his neck brace.

                        DAVE
          Look, I'm sorry.

                        DIL
          Fuck off, Dave.

                        DAVE
          No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm
          sorry, didn't I?

                        DIL
          Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?

Fergus nods. He stands. Dave steps two feet back.

                        FERGUS
          I was only going to ask her for a dance.

Fergus takes Dil's arm.

                        FERGUS
          Shall we?

The woman is singing.

As they circle, people begin to look at them admiringly. Dil
holds her cheek close to his.



                                                             55.



                      FERGUS
          Did he come here too?

                      DIL
          Is this an obsession of yours?

                      FERGUS
          Maybe.

                      DIL
          He did sometimes.

                      FERGUS
          Did he dance with you?

Dil doesn't answer. Looks at him out of the corner of her
eye.

                      DIL
          So what do you want with me, Jimmy?

                      FERGUS
          Want to look after you.

                      DIL
          What does that mean?

                      FERGUS
          Something I heard someone say once.

She draws back and looks at him.

                      DIL
          You mean that?

                      FERGUS
          Yeah.

She dances closer.

                      DIL
          Why?

                      FERGUS
          If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.

In the bar, people singing along with the music. Col sings.
Dave sitting at the bar, sulking.

                      DIL
          You're not having me on, are you? 'Cause
          Dil can't stand that.



                                                             56.



                     FERGUS
          No.

She puts her cheek against his. Dave, at the bar, slams his
drink down.

                     DIL
          And she does get very upset...

Dave stands up to leave. On the stage the act finishes. Dil
draws Fergus back to the bar.

AT THE BAR.

Col, the barman, pours her drink.

                     DIL
          One for him, too.

Col pours and smiles.

                     DIL
          Drink.

                     FERGUS
          What is this?

                     DIL
          I'm superstitious. Drink.

He drinks. He grimaces. She throws it back in one.

                     DIL
          Can't leave me now.

                     FERGUS
          Aha.

                     DIL
          The thing is, can you go the distance?

                     FERGUS
          Depends what it is.

                     DIL
          No, depends on nothing.

She takes the bottle herself and fills their glasses. She
slams it back. He sips.

                     DIL
          In one.



                                                              57.



She tilts his glass back. He swallows it in one.

INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.

She enters; Fergus walks in slowly. He looks from the cricket
whites that are hanging up behind a curtain to the
photographs.

                           DIL
              What you thinking of, hon?

                           FERGUS
              I'm thinking of your man.

                           DIL
              Why?

                           FERGUS
              I'm wondering why you keep his things.

                           DIL
              Told you, I'm superstitious.

She turns toward him and undoes her hair. It falls around her
shoulders.

                           FERGUS
              Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?

                           DIL
              All the time.

Fergus runs his hand down her throat.

                           DIL
              Even now.

                           FERGUS
              No...

                           DIL
              He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.

She draws him behind a curtain toward the bed, pulls him
down. They kiss passionately.

                           DIL
              Give me one minute.

She walks into the bathroom. Fergus lies there, looking at
the picture, listening to the sound of running water. She
comes out then, dressed in a silk kimono. She looks
extraordinarily beautiful.



                                                              58.


He reaches out his hand and grasps hers. He draws her toward
him. He begins to kiss her face and neck.

                            FERGUS
              Would he have minded?

She murmurs no. His hands slip the wrap down from her
shoulders.

CLOSE ON HIS HANDS, traveling down her neck, in the darkness.
Then the hands stop. The kimono falls to the floor gently,
with a whisper. The camera travels with it, and we see, in a
close-up, that she is a man.

Fergus sits there, frozen, staring at her.

                            DIL
              You did know, didn't you?

Fergus says nothing.

                            DIL
              Oh my God.

She gives a strange little laugh, then reaches out to touch
him. Fergus smacks the hand away.

                            FERGUS
              Jesus. I feel sick --

He gets up and runs to the bathroom. She grabs his feet.

                            DIL
              Don't go, Jimmy --

He kicks her away. He runs into the bathroom and vomits into
the tub.

She crouches on the floor.

                            DIL
              I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

He retches again.

                            DIL
              What were you doing in the bar if you
              didn't know -- I'm bleeding...

She lights a cigarette.

Fergus runs the taps. He washes his face, rinses his mouth.



                                                              59.



                        DIL
          It's all right, Jimmy. I can take it.
          Just not on the face.

Fergus slams the door shut. She is sitting on the couch, the
kimono round her once more, looking very much like a woman. A
trace of blood on her mouth.

                        DIL
          Y'see, I'm not a young thing any
          longer.... Funny the way things go. Don't
          you find that, Jimmy? Never the way you
          expected.

Fergus comes out of the bathroom.

                        FERGUS
          I'm sorry.

She looks up. Some hope in her face.

                        DIL
          You mean that?

And he makes to go. She grabs him to stop him.

                        DIL
          Don't go like that. Say something...

He pulls away from her. She falls to the floor.

                        DIL
          Jesus.

He drags himself away and runs down the stairs.

INT. FERGUS'S FLAT

Fergus in bed. Flash to shot of blackness, Jody grinning in
cricket whites, throwing the ball up and down in his hand.

INT. METRO - NIGHT.

The place is hopping. Fergus enters. He now sees it as he
should have seen it the first night -- as a transvestite bar.
He makes his way through the crowds. All the women too-
heavily made-up. Some beautifully sleek young things he looks
at he realizes are young men. He makes his way to the bar
where Dil is sitting, nursing a drink with an umbrella in it.
Her face is bruised. She is wearing dark glasses.

As he walks toward her she sees him in the mirror. She talks
to Col the barman.



                                                          60.



                          DIL
            He's back, Col

                          COL
            Hi.

                          DIL
            Don't want any of those looks, Col. They
            don't mean much.

                          COL
            Stop it, Dil --

                          DIL
            No. Tell him to go fuck himself.

Fergus sits. Col turns to him.

                          COL
            She wants me to tell you go fuck
            yourself.

                          FERGUS
            I'm sorry.

There is a tear running down her cheek, under the dark
glasses.

                          DIL
            Tell him to stop messing Dil around --

                          FERGUS
            Dil --

                          DIL
            Tell him it hurt --

                          FERGUS
            I have to talk to her, Col --

                          COL
            Says he's got to talk to you --

Fergus touches her arm.

                          FERGUS
            Come on, Dil --

                          DIL
            Where?

She whips her arm away.



                                                              61.



                        DIL
          Tell him again, Col. Go fuck himself --

She walks into the crowd, toward the door.

Fergus leaves.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT.

Fergus, walking outside Dil's place. The blinds in her room
are down and the light is on inside. We see her outline,
pacing up and down behind the blinds, smoking a cigarette. We
hear the song "The Crying Game."

Fergus stands beneath her doorway, scribbles a note, and
sticks it in the letter box.

EXT. CRICKET PITCH - DAY

A man removes a large number six from a huge scoreboard with
a pole and replaces it with a number nine.

Below the scoreboard we can see Dil walking across a lawn
toward the building where Fergus is working.

INT. SITE - DAY

Fergus, fitting a new window into the finished wall. On the
pitch we see the cricketers, distorted through the moving
glass of the window. Across the pitch Dil walks, with a lunch
basket in her hand, dressed in a very short skirt with high
heels. As she approaches the site a chorus of whistles breaks
out.

Fergus, hearing the whistling, stares out. He sees Dil moving
toward the site. He drops the window and the glass shatters.
As the whistles continue, we see Dil in the site's lift,
which rises up. We see Deveroux and Franknum climbing up a
ladder toward Fergus .

                        DEVEROUX
          How much did that frame cost, Mr.
          Franknum?

                        FRANKNUM
          Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.

                        DEVEROUX
          Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid.

                        FERGUS
          Sorry.



                                                              62.



                        DEVEROUX
          Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back,
          will it, Mr. Franknum?

                        FRANKNUM
          Not in my experience.

                        DEVEROUX
          Off his wages.

                        FERGUS
          Do you mean that?

                        DEVEROUX
          He wants to know do I mean that.

                        FRANKNUM
          I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.

                        DEVEROUX
          Bloody right I do...

Through this conversation Fergus can hear the chorus of wolf
whistles increasing. He looks out the gap where the window
should be and sees Dil in the lift. The laborers whistle at
her, looking up her skirt, etc.

She passes by a gap in the wall and blows a kiss at him.

                        DEVEROUX
          Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?

                        FERGUS
          She's not a tart.

                        DEVEROUX
          No, of course not, she's a lady.

                        FERGUS
          She's not that either.

Fergus walks out of the room.

Fergus walks round the scaffolding. Dil sees him and waves,
sits on some bricks and opens the hamper.

                        DIL
          Darling --

She is acting bright and businesslike, like any wife. She is
wearing dark glasses to cover the bruise on her face. She
pecks him on the cheek.



                                                       63.



                      DIL
          Never let the sun go down on an argument,
          Jody used to say.

                      FERGUS
          What you doing here?

                      DIL
          Got your note. So let's kiss and make up,
          hon.

                      FERGUS
          Don't call me that.

                      DIL
          Sorry, darling.

                      FERGUS
          Give it over, Dil --

                      DIL
          Apologies, my sweet.

Fergus smiles in spite of himself.

                      DIL
          That's more like it, dear. Have a cuppa.

She takes out a thermos and pours him some tea.

                      FERGUS
          You're something else, Dil, you know
          that?

                      DIL
          Never said a truer word.

She hands him a neatly cut sandwich.

                      DIL
          See, I was always best looking after
          someone. Must be something in the genes.

                      FERGUS
          Must be.

                      DIL
          And the fact that you didn't know is
          basically the fault of yours truly. And
          even when you were throwing up, I could
          tell you cared.



                                                       64.



                        FERGUS
          You could?

                        DIL
          Do you care, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Sure I do.

                        DIL
          You mean that?

                        FERGUS
          Yeah. I care, Dil.

She lowers her head.

                        FERGUS
          You crying, Dil?

He removes her glasses and looks at her moist eyes.

                        DIL
          I'm tired and emotional.

Then he hears a voice behind him.

                        DEVEROUX
          Do it on your own time, Paddy.

                        FERGUS
          What?

                        DEVEROUX
          Whatever it is she does for you.

Fergus looks from Dil to Deveroux.

                        FERGUS
          If I was her I'd consider that an insult.

                        DEVEROUX
          Consider it how you like. Just get that
          bloody tart out of here.

Fergus stands up suddenly. He speaks quietly.

                        FERGUS
          Did you ever pick your teeth up with
          broken fingers?

Deveroux stares, suddenly chilled.



                                                          65.



                      DEVEROUX
          What's that supposed to mean?

                      FERGUS
          It's a simple question.

Deveroux says nothing. Fergus looks down to Dil.

                      FERGUS
          Come on, dear.

He holds out his arm. Dil gathers up her things and takes it.
Her face is wreathed in a smile.

                      DIL
          He didn't answer, honey --

Fergus walks her down the scaffolding ramp.

                      FRANKNUM
          Sorry about that, Mr. Deveroux.

Dil and Fergus descend from the site in the lift.

                      DIL
          My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.

                      FERGUS
          Shut up.

                      DIL
          Made me feel all funny inside.

                      FERGUS
          I said stop it.

                      DIL
          Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.

                      FERGUS
          You think that's wise?

                      DIL
          Nothing's wise.

The lift stops with a thud.

                      FERGUS
          I didn't mean to hit you.

                      DIL
          I know that.



                                                            66.



                        FERGUS
          Kind of liked you as a girl.

                        DIL
          That's a start.

                        FERGUS
          So I'm sorry.

                        DIL
          Make it up to me, then.

                        FERGUS
          How?

                        DIL
          Ask to meet me again.

                        FERGUS
          Will you meet me again?

                        DIL
          When?

                        FERGUS
          Whenever. Tonight.

She leans forward and kisses him. Fergus hears a wail of
catcalls behind him. He watches Dil go as the lift takes him
back up to the site.

EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.

Fergus, outside the hair salon. Dil, inside, is throwing off
her smock and walking toward him. All the girls are smiling.
Fergus looks from Dil to the girls as they approach.

                        FERGUS
          Do they know?

                        DIL
          Know what, honey?

                        FERGUS
          Know what I didn't know. And don't call
          me that.

                        DIL
          Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her
          feelings.

                        FERGUS
          Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.



                                                          67.



                       DIL
          Details, baby, details.

                       FERGUS
          So they do know.

                       DIL
          All right, they do.

She takes his arm as they walk off.

                       FERGUS
          Don't.

                       DIL
          Sorry.

                       FERGUS
          I should have known, shouldn't I?

                       DIL
          Probably.

                       FERGUS
          Kind of wish I didn't.

                       DIL
          You can always pretend.

                       FERGUS
          That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't
          he?

                       DIL
          Absolutely.

                       FERGUS
          Won't be quite the same though, will it?

                       DIL
          Are you pretending yet?

                       FERGUS
          I'm working on it.

Fergus hears a car following them, and turns around to look.

                       FERGUS
          There's Dave. He knew too.

                       DIL
          Stop it, Jimmy.



                                                          68.



                        FERGUS
          Am I becoming repetitious?

                        DIL
          A little.

                        FERGUS
          Sorry.

They reach her door. The car stops.

                        FERGUS
          Don't ask me in.

                        DIL
          Please, Jimmy.

                        FERGUS
          No. Can't pretend that much.

                        DIL
          I miss you, Jimmy.

                        FERGUS
          Should have stayed a girl.

                        DIL
          Don't be cruel.

                        FERGUS
          Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.

                        DIL
          Only if you kiss me.

Fergus kisses her. He looks at her open lips as if in
disbelief at himself.

                        FERGUS
          Happy now?

                        DIL
          Delirious.

She goes inside.

INT. HOSTEL - NIGHT.

Fergus walks into the room and turns on a small desk-light.
Then he hears a voice.

                        JUDE
          Hello, stranger.



                                                            69.



He sees Jude sitting in the corner. Her hair is now dark
brown.

                        JUDE
          You vanished.

He stares at her, says nothing.

                        JUDE
          What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the
          gaff on us or did you just fuck up?

                        FERGUS
          Leave me alone, Jude.

                        JUDE
          No. That's the last thing I'll do. You
          never asked what happened.

                        FERGUS
          I heard.

                        JUDE
          Eddie and Tinker died.

                        FERGUS
          I know.

                        JUDE
          Maguire and me got out by the skin of our
          teeth. No thanks to you.... What you
          think of the hair?

                        FERGUS
          Suits you.

She walks round the room.

                        JUDE
          Aye, I was sick of being blond. Needed a
          tougher look, if you know what I mean.

She lies down on the bed beside him, takes off a black
leather glove, and puts her hand on his crotch.

                        JUDE
          Fuck me, Fergus.

He takes her hand away.

                        JUDE
          Am I to take it that's a no?



                                                       70.



He says nothing.

                     JUDE
          We had a court-martial in your absence.
          They wanted to put a bullet in your head.
          I pleaded for clemency. Said we should
          find out what happened first. So what did
          happen?

                     FERGUS
          He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back.
          I tried to catch him. He made it to the
          road and got hit by a Saracen.

                     JUDE
          So you did fuck up.

                     FERGUS
          Yes.

                     JUDE
          But you know what the thing is, Fergus?

                     FERGUS
          No, what is the thing?

                     JUDE
          You vanished quite effectively. Became
          Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how
          useful that could be.

                     FERGUS
          What do you mean?

                     JUDE
          We've got some plans here. And we'll need
          a Mister Nobody to execute them.

                     FERGUS
          No way, Jude. I'm out.

                     JUDE
          You're never out, Fergus.

She looks at him hard. He looks away.

                     JUDE
          Maybe you don't care whether you die or
          not. But consider the girl, Fergus. The
          wee black chick.

He leaps up from the bed.



                                                          71.



                    FERGUS
          Leave her out of this.

                    JUDE
          Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche.
          You know we won't leave her out of this.
          But I'm glad to see you care.

She brings her lips close to his so they touch.

                    JUDE
          And I must admit I'm curious.

He grabs her hair and pulls her head back.

                    FERGUS
          What the fuck do you know, Jude?

She pulls a gun and sticks it between his teeth.

                    JUDE
          You fucking tell me, boy --

Fergus stares at her. Then says quietly:

                    FERGUS
          She's nobody. She likes me.

                    JUDE
          So I suppose a fuck is out of the
          question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No
          sudden moves. And not a whisper to her.
          You'll be hearing from us.

She kisses him briefly, with the gun at his temple.

                    JUDE
          Keep the faith.

She goes. Fergus stands in the darkness.

EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.

Fergus, walking toward the hair salon, flowers in his hand.

He stands outside watching, the flowers behind his back. Then
the chair turns and we see it is Jude.

Fergus freezes. He sees Jude looking at him, smiling
brightly, then talking back to Dil



                                                          72.



INT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.

                        JUDE
          He your boyfriend?

Jude, turning in the chair.

                        JUDE
          Lucky you.

INT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT.

                        DIL
          Carnations.

                        FERGUS
          What?

                        DIL
          He'd bring me carnations.

                        FERGUS
          So I got it wrong, then.

                        DIL
          Not at all, honey.

                        FERGUS
          Don't.

                        DIL
          Okay.

She smiles brightly at something behind Fergus. He turns and
sees Jude is there. Fergus stands, suddenly.

He throws some money on the table, grabs her arm, and frog-
marches her out.

                        FERGUS
          Come on.

                        DIL
          Why, honey --

                        FERGUS
          Come on.

                        DIL
          You gonna tell me why?

                        FERGUS
          No.



                                                              73.



As they pass Jude, she smiles.

EXT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT.

Outside the restaurant. Fergus marches Dil away.

                       DIL
          What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong
          --

                       FERGUS
          Not here.

They pass out of shot. In the background we see Jude rising.

INT. METRO - NIGHT.

Dil and Fergus making their way to their seats at the bar.

                       DIL
          You gonna tell me what it is?

A figure sitting down at the bar. It is Jude.

                       JUDE
          What was it?

                       DIL
          You know her, Jimmy?

                       JUDE
          Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?

                       FERGUS
          Dil, this is Jude.

                       DIL
          You following me?

                       JUDE
          Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to
          you, Dil?

                       DIL
          Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?

                       JUDE
          That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as
          they say.

                       DIL
          Absolutely. The younger the better.
          Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.



                                                    74.



                      JUDE
          Don't go looking for it, Dil.

                      DIL
          Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.

                      JUDE
          A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she,
          Jimmy?

                      DIL
          A girl has to have a bit of glamour.

                      JUDE
          Absolutely. Long as she can keep it.
          Isn't that right, James...

She leaves. Dil watches her go.

                      DIL
          It's her, isn't it?

                      FERGUS
          What's her?

                      DIL
          She's the thing you had to tell me.

                      FERGUS
          Kind of.

                      DIL
          I'm sorry, you know that? I'm really
          sorry.

She looks at Col

                      DIL
          You see that, Col?

                      COL
          Saw it, Dil.

                      DIL
          Fuck it, is what I say.

                      COL
          Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.

                      DIL
          Fucking men, Col --



                                                              75.



                       COL
          Fuck 'em.

There are tears in her eyes. She stands.

                       DIL
          And fuck you, Jimmy --

She staggers out of the pub. Fergus sits there. There is an
expression in Col's eyes that makes Fergus feel very, very
small.

                       COL
          You could always make it up to her.

                       FERGUS
          How?

                       COL
          When a girl runs out like that, she
          generally wants to be followed.

                       FERGUS
          She's not a girl, Col --

                       COL
          Whatever you say.

But Fergus rises and walks out.

EXT. METRO - NIGHT.

A figure standing down the alleyway, smoking. Fergus looks
toward it, but Jude is standing there, waiting.

                       JUDE
          She went that way --

Jude grabs his arm.

                       JUDE
          But you come with me.

She draws him down an alley where the same car is waiting.
They get inside.

ANOTHER CAR - BY THE PUB.

Dil, sitting inside a taxi watching Fergus and Jude getting
in the car.



                                                            76.



INT. CAR - NIGHT.

In the moving car. Jude is driving, Maguire next to her.
Fergus sits in the back.

                     FERGUS
          So it was you all the time.

                     MAGUIRE
          Who'd you think it was?

                     FERGUS
          I thought it was Dave.

                     MAGUIRE
          And who's Dave when he's at home?

                     FERGUS
          He's at home.

                     MAGUIRE
          Should blow you away, you know that?

                     FERGUS
          I know that.

Maguire stubs his cigarette out on Fergus's hand, then whacks
him on the teeth with his closed fist.

                     MAGUIRE
          I'm getting emotional. And I don't want
          to get fucking emotional -- you
          understand, Hennessy?

                     FERGUS
          I understand.

                     MAGUIRE
          Fuck you, too --

Jude drives. Fergus looks through the back window at the
street outside.

                     JUDE
          Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.

                     MAGUIRE
          That true, Fergus? You in love?

                     FERGUS
          Absolutely.



                                                             77.



                           MAGUIRE
             And what's she like between the sheets?

                           FERGUS
             Definitely unusual.

                           MAGUIRE
             And who is she?

                           FERGUS
             Just a girl.

                           MAGUIRE
             And you know what'll happen if you fuck
             up again, don't you?

                           FERGUS
             Aye, I do, Peter.

                           MAGUIRE
             Good.

EXT. REGENCY SQUARE - NIGHT.

The car draws to a halt in a sedate square. Several doors
down is the entrance to what looks like a sedate conservative
club.

In the car, Maguire turns off the engine. He nods toward the
building.

                           MAGUIRE
             So what do you think that is, Hennessy?

                           FERGUS
             A hotel?

                           MAGUIRE
             It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh?
             He visits his ladies on Tuesday and
             Thursday nights and Saturday mornings.
             His security's in the car beyond.

He nods toward a car, a Daimler, parked some distance away.
Fergus looks from the window to the car.

                           FERGUS
             Who is he?

                           MAGUIRE
             Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we
             would call a legitimate target.



                                                          78.



                       FERGUS
          Thank God for that.

                       MAGUIRE
          You being cynical, Hennessy?

                       FERGUS
          Hope not.

                       MAGUIRE
          Good. So what do you think?

                       FERGUS
          Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men
          are any good. And I presume you can't get
          in.

                       MAGUIRE
          Right.

                       FERGUS
          So it's on the street.

                       MAGUIRE
          Right.

                       FERGUS
          Kind of suicide, isn't it?

Jude turns around to look at him.

                       FERGUS
          But, then, I don't have a choice.

                       JUDE
          Och, you do, Fergie.

                       FERGUS
          Of course. I forgot.

                       JUDE
          Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.

Jude and Fergus get out of the car. They walk down the
street, down from the brothel-cum-club, where there is a cafe-
bar with some tables outside.

EXT. REGENCY SQUARE - NIGHT.

Fergus and Jude, crossing the street.

                       JUDE
          You keep your mind on the job, boy --



                                                              79.



                    FERGUS
          And then you'll leave her out of it?

                    JUDE
          Aye. Then we'll leave her be.

They take their seats by the tables. We can see the brothel
down the way.

                    JUDE
          He's arthritic. Takes him two minutes to
          get to the door.

She checks her watch. Fergus is sweating.

                    FERGUS
          And what if I say no?

                    JUDE
          You know what. Go.

Down by the brothel, the door swings open.

Fergus walks like any pedestrian down toward the brothel.
There is an old, portly gent in a City suit emerging from it.
The car by the pavement kicks into action and the door opens.

Fergus quickens his pace.

Jude, by the cafe, watches. Fergus, walking.

The gent makes his way, with gout-ridden slowness, across the
pavement, through the passersby, toward the car.

A burly security man emerging from the car, walking toward
the old gent.

Fergus reaches the car just before he does, and passes
between him and the open door. The old gent's stomach brushes
Fergus's elbow.

                    GENT
          Pardon me, young man --

Fergus walks on.

Jude, from the cafe, watches -- Fergus walking on, the old
man being eased with painstaking care inside the Daimler.
Then the door closing and the Daimler pulling off.

When the Daimler has passed Fergus, he turns around and walks
back.



                                                           80.



Jude smiles and leaps up as he approaches.

                       JUDE
          You were made for this.

                       FERGUS
          Was I?

                       JUDE
          Perfect.

                       FERGUS
          And what happens then?

                       JUDE
          We'll be on the other side. We'll move
          when you do.

                       FERGUS
          And what if you don't?

                       JUDE
          Fergus, I think you don't trust me.

                       FERGUS
          You may be right.

                       JUDE
          Stay late at your work tomorrow night and
          I'll bring you the gear.

Jude begins to walk away.

                       FERGUS
          Jude?

                       JUDE
          Yes?

                       FERGUS
          Who's the old geezer?

                       JUDE
          Some judge...

She walks off, crosses the road to Maguire, in the car.
Fergus turns around to see Dil in front of the cafe. She goes
inside; he follows.

                       FERGUS
          Why'd you follow me, Dil?



                                                              81.



                      DIL
          Was jealous, Jimmy.

She downs a drink and motions for another. She seems high.

                      FERGUS
          Shouldn't be, Dil

                      DIL
          Why shouldn't I be jealous?

There are tears streaming down her face. He takes his hand
and begins to wipe her face.

                      DIL
          Don't. My makeup.

She sits down; he joins her.

                      DIL
          She own you, Jimmy?

                      FERGUS
          Yes.

                      DIL
          She from Scotland too?

                      FERGUS
          You could say that.

                      DIL
          And you're not going to tell me more?

                      FERGUS
          I can't.

He wipes the tears from her face with a tissue then dabs the
tissue in her drink and wipes some more.

                      DIL
          What you doing, Jimmy?

                      FERGUS
          I'm not sure.

                      DIL
          Do you like me even a little bit?

                      FERGUS
          More than that.

Dil's face, staring at him.



                                                            82.



                           FERGUS
             Come on, let's go for a walk.

She allows herself to be led out.

EXT. HAIR SALON - NIGHT.

Dil and Fergus walking. Fergus stops her by the window.

                           FERGUS
             You do something for me, Dil?

                           DIL
             Anything.

                           FERGUS
             You'd do anything for me?

                           DIL
             Afraid so.

                           FERGUS
             You got the keys to the shop?

They walk inside.

INT. HAIR SALON - NIGHT.

Dil and Fergus standing in the darkness.

                           DIL
             You want another haircut, baby?

                           FERGUS
             No. Sit down.

He sits her down in one of the chairs.

                           FERGUS
             You'd do anything for me?

Dil nods.

                           DIL
             Anything.

Fergus takes up a scissors to snip at her hair. Her head
leaps back.

                           DIL
             No way --



                                                             83.



                        FERGUS
          You said anything, Dil

                        DIL
          A girl has to draw the line somewhere --

                        FERGUS
          Want to change you to a man, Dil...

She stares at him.

                        DIL
          Why?

                        FERGUS
          It's a secret.

                        DIL
          You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Yes.

                        DIL
          And you wouldn't leave me?

                        FERGUS
          No.

                        DIL
          You promise?

                        FERGUS
          I promise.

She takes a breath.

                        DIL
          Go on, then.

Fergus begins to cut.

CLOSE-UP ON DlL'S FACE as her hair is shorn. Tears stream
down her cheeks.

                        DIL
          You're no good at this, Jimmy.

                        FERGUS
          I'm sorry.

But he keeps cutting. He gives Dil a short, cropped military
cut like Jody's.



                                                              84.



                    DIL
          You want to make me look like him...

                    FERGUS
          No. Want to make you into something new.
          That nobody recognizes...

She looks in the mirror at it in the dark.

                    DIL
          Don't recognize myself, Jimmy.

INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.

Dil enters, with her new haircut. She goes to turn on the
light. He stops her hand.

                    FERGUS
          No.

She looks at her hand on his.

                    FERGUS
          Better in the dark.

Her fingers close around his.

                    DIL
          So it's true, then?

                    FERGUS
          What?

                    DIL
          You like me better like this.

                    FERGUS
          Yes.

She brings her lips to his neck. He lets them stay there. His
hands travel up to her blouse. He begins to undo the buttons.

                    DIL
          Oh, Jimmy --

Slowly the blouse slips down, exposing her male torso. She
falls down to her knees and tugs at his belt.

                    FERGUS
          No. No. Dil... get up...

He raises her to her feet and leads her toward the bed. She
stretches languorously down on it.



                                                              85.


He unzips her skirt slowly, and draws it off. She turns on
the bed sexily, her face to the mattress. She is wearing
suspender-belts underneath her skirt.

                        DIL
          Baby...

But Fergus stands and walks quietly over to the wardrobe
where the soldier's things are. Dil on the bed, slowly turns.

                        DIL
          What are you doing, honey...

We see Fergus from her point of view, coming toward her with
Jody's white cricket shirt, glowing eerily in the dark.

                        FERGUS
          Don't call me that --

                        DIL
          Sorry. What you doing?

Fergus draws her slowly up to a standing position.

                        FERGUS
          Try this on, Dil

He wraps the shirt around her.

                        DIL
          Why?

                        FERGUS
          For me.

                        DIL
          For you...

She kisses him.

EXT. SMALL HOTEL - NIGHT.

Fergus leading Dil, dressed in Jody's cricket clothes, down
the street and inside.

                        DIL
          Why are we going here, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Look on it like a honeymoon.



                                                              86.



INT. SMALL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT.

From above, we see the figures of Fergus and Dil, sleeping on
a double bed, both fully clothed. Fergus smokes, then puts
out the cigarette.

Time lapse. The light gradually fills the room. Fergus wakes.
Looks at the bedside clock, and very gingerly rises, puts on
his coat, and walks out.

EXT. SITE - EVENING.

A car pulls up at the site. Jude gets out. She has a satchel
in her hand.

INT. SITE - EVENING.

Fergus looking down a ladder-staircase at Jude.

                        JUDE
          You a handyman, Fergie?

                        FERGUS
          I take pride in my work.

                        JUDE
          I sincerely hope so.

Fergus climbs down a ladder to Jude; she hands him something
from the bag.

                        JUDE
          Tools of the trade.

She kisses him. Fergus looks at her expressionlessly.

                        JUDE
          And forget about the girl.

Fergus opens what Jude has given him -- looking inside. There
is a gun wrapped in an oilcloth.

INT. SMALL HOTEL - NIGHT.

Fergus enters. The room is empty. He calls.

                        FERGUS
          Dil?

No reply. He runs outside.



                                                              87.



EXT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.

Fergus looks up at her building, but the lights are off in
her flat. The sound of feet behind him. He turns and sees Dil
walking toward him, a bottle in her hand. He runs toward her.

                        FERGUS
          Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing
          here?

                        DIL
          I'm going home!

                        FERGUS
          Told you to stay in the hotel!

                        DIL
          Thought you was fooling me. Thought you
          was leaving me.

They are tussling in the darkness of the park. She is very
drunk.

                        FERGUS
          I had to go to work!

                        DIL
          Stayed all day in that room thinking
          every noise was you. There's something
          you're not telling me, Jimmy.

He takes her arm.

                        FERGUS
          Come on...

                        DIL
          No! I'm going home...

Fergus and Dil, on the stairs up to Dil's flat.

                        DIL
          So tell me.

                        FERGUS
          I was trying to get out of something.

                        DIL
          No! Tell me everything, Jimmy.

Fergus looks at her.



                                                             88.



                       FERGUS
             You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.

                       DIL
             You mean that?

                       FERGUS
             Yes.

And she suddenly faints into his arms. As if on cue.

                       FERGUS
             Stop it, would you?

There is no response. He shakes her.

                       FERGUS
             Give it over, Dil, for fuck's sake --

Still no response. He grows alarmed. He slaps her cheek. She
opens her eyes slowly.

                       DIL
             Sorry. I get nervous. I got this blood
             condition. Just help me inside, Jimmy,
             then I'll be all right.

INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.

He walks in holding her. Leans her against the wall, then
goes to the window to check the street outside.

She takes a large slug from a bottle of whiskey.

                       FERGUS
             You heard what I said, Dil?

                       DIL
             My pills...

She points weakly to a cabinet through the open door of the
bathroom.

                       FERGUS
             What pills?

                       DIL
             Prescription. For my condition.

                       FERGUS
             What condition?



                                                             89.



                         DIL
           My condition. Ennui.

He goes and gets the pills.

She takes a handful of pills. She drinks from the whiskey
bottle.

                         FERGUS
           Are you supposed to take that many?

                         DIL
           Only in times of extreme stress.

She walks around the room, drinking, then sits down.

                         DIL
           See, they all say good-bye sometime.
           'Cept for him.

She looks at the picture of Jody. Then she looks at Fergus.

                         FERGUS
           Are you all right, Dil?

                         DIL
           I will be.

She stares straight ahead, the bottle clutched in her hands
between her knees.

                         DIL
           Go on, then.

Fergus walks slowly toward the door.

                         FERGUS
           Good-bye, Dil

                         DIL
           Jimmy?

                         FERGUS
           What?

                         DIL
           Don't go like that.

She looks at him, standing up. Something incredibly
attractive about her.

                         DIL
           Can't help what I am.



                                                              90.



He walks slowly toward her. He kisses her, on the lips.

We see the photograph with the soldier's smiling face. Fergus
looks from it to her. She seems to be in a sweet narcotic
haze. She reaches out her hand and strokes his.

                       DIL
          Knew you had a heart...

Fergus sits down on the bed. Dil is lying back on it.

                       FERGUS
          Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your
          man.

                       DIL
          You knew which man?

                       FERGUS
          Your soldier.

                       DIL
          You knew my Jody?

She still strokes his hand. Her voice is dreamily slurred,
her eyes far away.

                       FERGUS
          Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast.
          Held him hostage for three days.

                       DIL
          You knew my Jody?

                       FERGUS
          Are you listening?

Dil smiles woozily.

                       DIL
          Yes.

                       FERGUS
          I got the order to shoot him. Before I
          could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and
          died.

                       DIL
          Died...

                       FERGUS
          Did you hear me?



                                                             91.



                        DIL
          You killed my Jody?

                        FERGUS
          In a manner of speaking.

                        DIL
          It was you...

She is not rational. She is smiling, far away somewhere.

                        FERGUS
          You should scream. You should beat my
          head off.

She woozily tries to hit him round the face.

                        DIL
          You killed my Jody

                        FERGUS
          No.

                        DIL
          You didn't.

                        FERGUS
          I suppose I tried.

                        DIL
          You tried.

                        FERGUS
          Don't you want to kill me?

Dil raises an unsteady hand and points it at him.

                        DIL
          Bang...

He strokes her cheek. She says very slowly and sleepily

                        DIL
          Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me,
          too.

                        FERGUS
          Okay.

Her eyes close. She falls into a deep sleep. Fergus looks
down at her, almost fondly.



                                                             92.



INT. DIL'S FLAT - MORNING.

They are lying on the bed together, fully clothed. Dil wakes.
She rises very quietly and goes to his coat, thrown across a
chair. She searches through the pockets and takes out the
gun.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING.

Jude in bed. An alarm sounds; she reaches to turn it off.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Dil takes several silk stockings out of a drawer and ties
them very securely to each corner of the brass bed. She ties
them round both of Fergus's feet, very gently, so as not to
wake him.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING.

Jude, in front of a mirror, getting ready.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

She draws one of Fergus's hands up, very gingerly, and ties
that securely to the upright. She ties the other and is
drawing it upward when he wakes. She jerks the silk stocking
so it is secure.

                       FERGUS
             What the fuck --

Dil speaks unnaturally quietly.

                       DIL
             So tell me what you're doing, Jimmy.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING.

Jude, fully dressed. She takes a gun from under the bed and
slips it in her handbag.

INT. DIL'S FLAT - MORNING.

Dil crouching beside Fergus, his gun in her hand.

                       DIL
             Didn't really listen last night. I heard
             but I didn't listen.

Fergus, staring at her. He tries to pull on the bindings.



                                                              93.



                     DIL
          That won't do you no good. Dil knows how
          to tie a body.

She stands up, still pointing the gun at Fergus.

                     DIL
          Wondered why you came on to me like that
          when you gave me the look.

                     FERGUS
          He asked me to see were you all right.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Jude on the street. Maguire's car pulls up rapidly and she
gets inside.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

                     DIL
          See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me.
          Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.

                     FERGUS
          Stop it, Dil --

                     DIL
          Just don't kick Dil and she'll be
          touched. Be nice to her and she'll be
          yours forever.

She looks at him, tears in her eyes.

                     DIL
          See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I
          can't do that. Yet.

                     FERGUS
          Let me go, Dil

He drags at his bindings.

                     DIL
          Why?

                     FERGUS
          Got to be somewhere.

                     DIL
          Try and go, then.



                                                              94.



EXT. STREET BY BROTHEL - DAY

The figure of the judge in the window. Outline of a woman.
Jude and Maguire are in the car, parked across the street.
They look toward a paper seller.

                       MAGUIRE
          Where the fuck is he? Christ --

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Fergus pulls furiously at his bindings.

                       FERGUS
          Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or
          they'll be here

                       DIL
          Let them come then.

IN THE CAR. OUTSIDE BROTHEL.

                       JUDE
          Can't stay here, Peter -- drive around
          once more --

He drives off.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Fergus collapsed back on the bed, exhausted.

                       DIL
          Just want your company for a little while
          longer...

EXT. STREET BY BROTHEL - DAY

Maguire's car driving round once more. No sign of Fergus.

                       MAGUIRE
          That fucker's dead --

                       JUDE
          No, we are.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Fergus strains and roars from the bed.

                       FERGUS
          You don't know what you're doing, Dil --



                                                              95.



                        DIL
          Never did...

MAGUIRE'S POINT OF VIEW -- the brothel door opening. The
elderly judge comes out. The car with his security men guns
up.

                        MAGUIRE
          Give me the shooter, Jude --

                        JUDE
          You're crazy --

                        MAGUIRE
          Give me the fucking shooter!

He grabs it from her pocket. Throws open the door and runs
across the street. Jude dives into the driver's seat.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Fergus, pulling at his bindings.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE BROTHEL.

The judge walking toward the open door of the car, held open
by his goon. Maguire, running toward him, gun in hand. The
goon sees him. Maguire shoots as he runs. Once, twice, three
times, four. The judge falls. The goon, hit in the arm, pulls
an Uzi and returns fire. Maguire hit, still shooting. Other
goons tear from the car. Mayhem, screaming. Jude hits the
pedal on her car and screeches off. Maguire, dead.

INT. DIL'S FLAT - DAY

Dil dressed in the soldier's cricket clothes. She looks like
a sweet little boy. She places a cassette in the tape deck --
"The Crying Game" song. She comes to the bed, and points the
gun at Fergus's head.

                        DIL
          You like me now, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          I like you, Dil --

                        DIL
          Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.

                        FERGUS
          More what?



                                                           96.



                       DIL
          More endearments.

                       FERGUS
          I like you, DIl

                       DIL
          Love me.

                       FERGUS
          Yes.

                       DIL
          Tell me you love me.

                       FERGUS
          Whatever you say, Dil.

                       DIL
          Then say it.

                       FERGUS
          Love you, Dil.

                       DIL
          You do?

                       FERGUS
          Yeah.

                       DIL
          What would you do for me?

                       FERGUS
          Anything.

She begins to cry and lays the gun gently on his chest.

                       DIL
          Say it again.

                       FERGUS
          I'd do anything for you, Dil.

She pulls on his bindings to release him.

EXT. STREET.

Two police cars, sirens wailing.



                                                              97.



INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Dil's face, close to Fergus's, as the stockings that bound
his hands are nearly undone.

                        DIL
          And you'll never leave me?

                        FERGUS
          Never.

                        DIL
          I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice
          to hear it.

His arm is free. He strokes her hair.

                        FERGUS
          I'm sorry, Dil.

She shudders with weeping. The music of the song plays in the
background.

Jude walking through the open door, arms extended, holding a
gun.

                        JUDE
          You stupid shit -- Once was bad enough.
          But twice.

Dil rises from the bed and points her gun at Jude.

                        DIL
          You didn't knock, honey --

Dil fires, hits Jude. Jude falls and is writhing on the
floor.

                        FERGUS
          Dil!

                        JUDE
          Get that thing off me, Fergus --

Dil walks closer, holding the gun and pointing it at Jude.

                        DIL
          What was that she called you, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Fergus.



                                                             98.



                    DIL
          What's Fergus?

                    FERGUS
          It's my name, Dil --

                    DIL
          What happened to Jimmy?

                    JUDE
          I said get it off me, Fergus --

Jude, on the floor, reaches for her gun. Manages to grab it.

                    DIL
          What's she going to do, Jimmy? She going
          to blow you away?

Dil shoots again, like a child, playing with a toy. She hits
Jude in her gun shoulder. Jude spins one way, the gun the
other.

                    DIL
          Was she there too? When you got my Jody?

Fergus screams


                    FERGUS
          Dil!!!

                    DIL
          I asked you a question, honey -- were you
          there too --

                    JUDE
          You sick bitch --

As she raises the gun, Dil shoots her repeatedly, saying:

                    DIL
          You was there, wasn't you? You used those
          tits and that ass to get him, didn't you?

Fergus screams from the bed. He rips free his other arm. Dil
shoots Jude in the throat, and she falls dead, covered in
blood. Dil turns the gun on Fergus.

                    DIL
          She was there, wasn't she?



                                                          99.



                        FERGUS
          She was --

                        DIL
          And she used her tits and that cute
          little ass to get him, didn't she?

                        FERGUS
          Yes.

                        DIL
          Tell me what she wore.

                        FERGUS
          Can't remember...

Dil points the gun at him, squeezing on the trigger. Then she
stops.

                        DIL
          Can't do it, Jimmy. He won't let me.

She looks at the picture; walks over and sits down in front
of it.

                        DIL
          You won't let me, Jody --

She raises the gun and places it in her mouth. Fergus takes
it gently from her mouth and places it on the table. He lifts
her up by the shoulders.

                        FERGUS
          You've got to go now, Dil --

                        DIL
          Do I?

                        FERGUS
          Yes. Now.

                        DIL
          Am I in trouble, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Not if you go.

                        DIL
          Will I see you again?

                        FERGUS
          You will, Dil



                                                             100.



                        DIL
          Promise?

                        FERGUS
          I promise.

                        DIL
          Where am I to go, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          The Metro.

                        DIL
          Meet Col --

                        FERGUS
          Yes. Say hello to Col --

He leads her out the door. Fergus goes back into the room,
past Jude's body. Looks out the window to where he can see
Dil staggering down the street, through the crowds that have
gathered. The wail of police sirens coming closer. He watches
Dil run off, with her funny walk. Then looks down and sees
the cop cars pushing through the knot of people around the
house. He picks up the gun, wipes it with a rag to remove
Dil's fingerprints. He turns to the picture of the soldier;
talks to it.

                        FERGUS
          You should have stayed at home.

He sits in the chair by the window, waiting.

                                                FADE TO BLACK.

INT. PRISON VISITING ROOM - DAY

FADE UP to reveal a large interior, with light streaming in
the windows. Large barred doors open and a group of women
come through, with parcels, children in tow, etc. Among them
is Dil, looking resplendent. She walks past the rows of
convicts with their families, up to a glass cage, where
Fergus sits, waiting.

                        DIL
          Got you the multivitamins and the iron
          tablets, hon --

                        FERGUS
          Don't call me that --



                                                        101.



                        DIL
          Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are
          magnesium supplement --

                        FERGUS
          Stop it, Dil --

                        DIL
          I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm
          counting the days. Two thousand three
          hundred and thirty-four left.

                        FERGUS
          Thirty-five.

                        DIL
          I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the
          leap year. What am I supposed to call you
          then, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Fergus.

                        DIL
          Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life -
          -

                        FERGUS
          Please, Dil --

                        DIL
          Can't help it. You're doing time for me.
          No greater love, as the man says. Wish
          you'd tell me why.

                        FERGUS
          As the man said, it's in my nature.

                        DIL
          What's that supposed to mean?

She shakes her head.

                        FERGUS
          Well, there was this scorpion, you see.
          And he wants to go across the river. But
          he can't swim. So he goes to this frog,
          who can swim, and he says to him, "Excuse
          me, Mr. Froggy..."



                                                           102.



CAMERA PULLS BACK, and as Fergus tells the story of the
scorpion and the frog, the music comes up -- "Stand By Your
Man."

                                                    FADE OUT.
The Crying Game


FADE IN:

EXT. CARNIVAL - DAY

A loudspeaker playing Percy Sledge's "When a Man Loves a
Woman," as we see a carnival in the distance - with a Ferris
Wheel turning round and round.

A black man is by a stall. On his arm is an Irish girl with
blond hair. The black man is drunk, and is tossing rings
around a bowling pin.

                       JODY
            And that's cricket, hon.

An attendant hands him the teddy bear. It looks ridiculous in
his huge hands. He gives it to the girl.

                       JODY
            You want it?

                       GIRL
            Sure.

                       JODY
            Doesn't matter if you don't.

He puts his arm around her and drags her on.

                       JODY
            Jody won't be offended. Jody's never
            offended. What'd you say your name was?

                       GIRL
            Jude.

                       JODY
            Jude. Suits you, Jude.

                       JUDE
            The teddy bear?

                       JODY
            No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And
            it's June. Jude in June.

He comes to a small canvas tent with a sign on it - TOILET.



                                                               2.



                        JODY
          Gotta piss, Jude.

He holds her hand.

                        JODY
          Don't run off, Jude.

                        JUDE
          You don't know me, do you?

Jody walks inside the canvas flap and vanishes from sight. We
can still see his hand, holding Jude's. She leans against the
canvas, looking bored.

                        JODY
              (inside)
          What if I did?

                        JUDE
          You'd know I wouldn't run off.

She stands there, listening to the sound of him urinate. Her
eyes flick around the carnival. They settle on a tall dark-
haired man in a dark jacket. He nods.

                        JODY
          Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.

                        JUDE
          You didn't?

                        JODY
          And you know what?

                        JUDE
          Tell me, Jody

He staggers out, buttoning up.

                        JODY
          It's nice.

He goes to kiss her. She turns her head away.

                        JUDE
          Not here.

                        JODY
          Who gives a fuck.

                        JUDE
          You never know.



                                                               3.



She pulls him over toward the water.

                       JODY
             I never know nothing.

                       JUDE
             People. They could be looking.

Jody follows her, as she walks backward, drawing him on. He
moves his hips to a song as Jude leads him over the beach,
under a train trestle.

                       JUDE
             Come and get me, soldier --

                       JODY
             Whatever you say, Jude...

He sinks down on his knees toward her. She wraps her arms
around his neck and kisses him. Jody writhes on top of her,
fumbling with his belt. Jude cocks one eye upward. A shadow
falls across them.

CLOSE ON JODY, kissing her. A gun is put to his head. He
turns around, drunkenly.

                       JODY
             What the fuck --

The gun whacks him across the cheek and he falls sideways.

Jude scrambles to her feet and darts like an animal through a
field.

Jody feels his cheek. He can see her blond head vanishing
among the fields. He looks up and sees a group of men around
him. The tallest of them, Fergus, cocks the gun.

INT. CAR - DAY

A mini, driving down a country road. Two men in the front,
three in the back.

On the floor of the car Jody lies, with three pairs of feet
on top of him, a black bag over his head and the barrel of a
gun dangling close to his face. Fergus holds the gun. He is
smoking a cigarette. His movements are slow and somewhat
innocent.

                       FERGUS
             So what's your name, soldier?



                                                               4.



                       JODY
          Fuck you.

                       FERGUS
          Yeah.

EXT. SMALL FARMHOUSE - EVENING.

INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Jody pulled through and tied to a chair. Maguire, a small
lean man, talks to him through the hood.

                       MAGUIRE
          The situation is simple. You're being
          held hostage by the Irish Republican
          Army. They've got one of our senior
          members under interrogation in
          Castleraigh. We've informed them that if
          they don't release him within three days,
          you'll be shot. You'll be treated as our
          guest until further developments. Have
          you anything to say?

Jody is motionless under the black hood.

                       FERGUS
          Give him a cup of tea.

                       MAGUIRE
          Do you want a cup of tea?

He still says nothing.

                                                       DISSOLVE.

All the men are drinking tea. The blond woman comes in with a
plate and some food on it.

                       FERGUS
          See does he want some.

                       JUDE
          Do you want some food?

Jody sits as still as a grave, saying nothing.

                                                       DISSOLVE.

Late at night -- it is dark. The men are sleeping. Fergus is
sitting by a chair, gun in his hand, watching the prisoner.
Jude comes in, with a flashlight.



                                                               5.



                    FERGUS
          Hey -- what's he like?

                    JUDE
          Horny bastard.

                    FERGUS
          Did you give him it?

                    JUDE
          There are certain things I wouldn't do
          for my country.

                    FERGUS
          Have a look at him.

                    JUDE
          Can't.

                    FERGUS
          Poke him or something. See if he's still
          alive.

                    JUDE
          He's all right.

                    FERGUS
          Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on.
          Have a heart.

She moves over to him. She prods him in the legs with her
foot. He doesn't move. Then she lifts the hood ever so
slightly, to peer inside. Suddenly the man moves like
lightning, jerking his head down so the hood comes off,
throwing his body, tied to the chair, over Jude.

                    JODY
          You fucking bitch -- you fucking whore --

He pins her to the ground, his body bent with the chair. He
writhes on top of her in a grotesque parody of love. She is
screaming and the room is alive, each man awake, grabbing
guns, screaming.

                    MAGUIRE
          Turn the fucking thing off --

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus follows Jude out a back door, holding her by the arm.

                    FERGUS
          You all right?



                                                               6.



                        JUDE
          Fucking animal.

She takes in huge gobs of air.

                        FERGUS
          You don't know that.

                        JUDE
          Fucking do. I had him all over me.

He touches her face.

                        FERGUS
          Tough work, that.

                        JUDE
          Someone's got to do it.

She rubs her hand on his chest.

                        JUDE
          Nah, it was a breeze. Just thought of
          you.

She sidles closer, coming on to him.

                        JUDE
          And you know what, Fergus? One of you
          made me want it...

She puts her lips to his neck.

                        FERGUS
          Which one?

She doesn't answer. They embrace.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING.

A hot summer's day. There are tall hedges all around the
house. Fergus leads Jody, still bound and hooded, over toward
a greenhouse.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Dusty tomato plants and vines everywhere. Broken glass. The
sun pouring through. Fergus leads Jody over to a wrought iron
chair and sits him in it. He sits opposite, gun on his lap.
Fergus takes some sandwiches out of a brown paper bag. He
holds one out toward him.



                                                               7.



                     FERGUS
           Eat something, would you?

                     JODY
           Can't.

                     FERGUS
           What do you mean you can't?

                     JODY
           Can't eat through a canvas bag.

Fergus walks over to him, lifts the hood up so his mouth is
revealed, and pushes the sandwich toward his lips. Jody eats,
slowly.

                     JODY
           This is a farce, man.

                     FERGUS
           How is it a farce?

                     JODY
           I seen your fucking face.

                     FERGUS
           So, what do I look like?

                     JODY
           You're the one about five ten with the
           killer smile and the baby face.

                     FERGUS
           Am I?

                     JODY
           Yeah. And the brown eyes.

Fergus pushes the last crumbs of the sandwich toward Jody's
mouth.

                     JODY
           You're the handsome one.

Jody eats the last bits.

                     JODY
           Thank you, handsome.

                     FERGUS
           My pleasure.



                                                               8.



EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Jude makes her way from the door toward the greenhouse. She
is carrying a pot of tea and two cups.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

It is sweltering now in the greenhouse. CLOSE ON JODY'S
COWLED HEAD. The hood is drenched with sweat.

                        JODY
          I can't fucking breathe, man. Be a
          Christian, will you?

Jude comes into view.

                        JODY
          Tell him to take the hood off, honey...

Jude says nothing. Lays the tea on the ground.

                        FERGUS
          How did you know it was her?

                        JODY
          I can smell her perfume.

Jude pours out the tea.

                        JUDE
          See, if we took the hood off, we'd have
          to shoot you. As it is, you've got a
          fifty-fifty chance.

                        JODY
          Thought you liked me, bitch.

                        JUDE
          It was fun while it lasted.

                        JODY
          Nice lady.

His breathing becomes labored.

                        JODY
          Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.

                        FERGUS
          Can't we take it off?

                        JUDE
          Have to check with himself.



                                                             9.



Fergus gives her the gun.

                        FERGUS
          You look after him.

Jody's head follows Fergus while he leaves.

                        JODY
          Don't leave me with her, man. She's
          dangerous...

Jude smiles, holding the gun on her lap.

INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Fergus enters. Maguire and the others. Maguire has a
newspaper, which has a headline regarding the kidnapping.

                        MAGUIRE
          Made the front page. They'll move now,
          the fuckers.

                        FERGUS
          Request permission to take the hood off,
          Tommy.

                        MAGUIRE
          Why would you do that?

                        FERGUS
          The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.

                        MAGUIRE
          So?

                        FERGUS
          And anyway, he's seen our faces.

                        MAGUIRE
          You sure?

                        FERGUS
          He described me down to a T. Knows what
          Jude looks like.

Maguire reads the paper.

                        FERGUS
          Tommy --



                                                            10.



                     MAGUIRE
          You're his keeper. If you don't mind him
          seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the
          only one he looks at.

                     FERGUS
          Thanks.

                     MAGUIRE
          It's your decision.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Jude, drinking tea, looking at Jody sweating. Fergus enters.
He puts his arm casually around her.

                     FERGUS
          Leave us, Judie.

                     JUDE
          My pleasure.

She goes. Fergus walks to Jody and slowly takes the hood off.
Jody looks up at him, his face bathed in sweat. He breathes
in mighty gulps of air. He smiles.

                     JODY
          Thank you, soldier.

Fergus smiles.

                     JODY
          Never thought fresh air would taste this
          good.

Fergus pours out a cup of tea and brings it to his lips.

                     JODY
          Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be
          able to feed myself.

                     FERGUS
          No fucking way.

                     JODY
          Only joking.

Fergus drinks.

                     JODY
          You know, I was wrong about one thing.



                                                              11.



                          FERGUS
            What's that?

                          JODY
            Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no
            pinup.

                          FERGUS
            No?

                          JODY
            Nope. Not handsome at all.

                          FERGUS
            You trying to hurt my feelings?

                          JODY
            No. It's the truth.

                          FERGUS
            Well, I could say the same about you.

                          JODY
            Could you?

                          FERGUS
            But I won't. We're more polite around
            these parts.

                          JODY
            So I've noticed.

Fergus looks at him. Jody isn't smiling anymore. Fergus goes
back to his seat and drinks his tea. He fingers the gun on
his lap.

                          JODY
            Hey --

                          FERGUS
            What is it now?

                          JODY
            You're going to have to do it, aren't
            you?

                          FERGUS
            Do what?

                          JODY
            Kill me.



                                            12.



           FERGUS
What makes you think that?

           JODY
They're going to let that guy die. And
you're going to kill me.

           FERGUS
They won't let him die.

           JODY
You want to bet?

           FERGUS
I'm not a gambling man.

           JODY
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't
just let me loose.

           FERGUS
Why can't we?

           JODY
Not in your nature.

           FERGUS
What do you know about my nature?

           JODY
I'm talking about your people, not you.

           FERGUS
What the fuck do you know about my
people?

           JODY
Only that you're all tough undeluded
motherfuckers. And that it's not in your
nature to let me go.

           FERGUS
Shut the fuck up, would you?

           JODY
And you know the funny thing?

           FERGUS
No, what's the funny thing?

           JODY
I didn't even fancy her.



                                                             13.



                       FERGUS
          Didn't look like that to me...

                       JODY
          She's not my type.

He looks at Fergus.

                       JODY
          C'mere.

                       FERGUS
          No.

                       JODY
          Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.

                       FERGUS
          What?

                       JODY
          My inside pocket.

Fergus holds the gun to his face. He fishes inside Jody's
inside pocket.

                       JODY
          Take out the wallet.

Fergus's hand emerges with a wallet.

                       JODY
          Open it.

CLOSE ON THE WALLET. Credit cards, army identification
photograph.

                       JODY
          Inside. There's a picture.

Fergus takes out a picture. It is of Jody, in cricket whites,
smiling, holding a bat. Fergus smiles.

                       JODY
          No, not that one. There's another.

Fergus takes out another picture of Jody and of a beautiful
black woman, smiling.

                       JODY
          Now she's my type.



                                                       14.



                      FERGUS
          She'd be anyone's type.

                      JODY
          Don't you think of it, fucker.

                      FERGUS
          Why not?

                      JODY
          She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit
          you.

                      FERGUS
          No?

                      JODY
          Absolutely not.

                      FERGUS
          She your wife?

                      JODY
          Suppose you could say that.

Jody chuckles.

                      FERGUS
          You make a nice couple.

                      JODY
          Don't I know it.

                      FERGUS
          So what were you fucking around for,
          then?

                      JODY
          You fuckers set me up. That bitch --

                      FERGUS
          She's a friend of mine

                      JODY
          Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar.
          I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here
          anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my
          hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't
          like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe
          I'll get to understand.

                      FERGUS
          What?



                                             15.



          JODY
What the fuck am I doing here.

          FERGUS
What the fuck were you doing here?

          JODY
I got sent.

          FERGUS
You could have said no.

          JODY
Can't. Once I signed up.

          FERGUS
Why did you sign up?

          JODY
It was a job. So I get sent to the only
place in the world they call you nigger
to your face.

          FERGUS
Shouldn't take it personally.

          JODY
    (He imitates a Belfast accent)
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No
use telling them I came from Tottenham.

          FERGUS
And you play cricket?.

          JODY
Best game in the world.

          FERGUS
Ever see hurling?

          JODY
That game where a bunch of paddies whack
sticks at each other?

          FERGUS
Best game in the world.

          JODY
Never.

          FERGUS
The fastest.



                                                           16.



                        JODY
          Well, in Antigua cricket's the black
          man's game. The kids play it from the age
          of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies
          from the age of five. Then we moved to
          Tottenham and it was something different.

                        FERGUS
          How different?

                        JODY
          Toffs' game there. But not at home.     .

Fergus looks at him.

                        JODY
          So when you come to shoot me, Paddy,
          remember, you're getting rid of a shit-
          hot bowler.

                        FERGUS
          I'll bear that in mind.

He keeps looking at him.

                        FERGUS
          And by the way, it's not Paddy. It's
          Fergus.

Jody smiles.

                        JODY
          Nice to meet you, Fergus.

                        FERGUS
          My pleasure, Jody

EXT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus leads Jody outside, holding the gun against him.

                        FERGUS
          Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by
          that tree.

                        JODY
          Tree.

He walks toward it, breathing heavily.

                        JODY
          You've got to loosen my hands.



                                                           17.



                       FERGUS
          Can't.

                       JODY
          Well then, you're going to have to take
          my dick out for me, aren t you?

Fergus, in the dark, stands motionless, looking at him.

                       JODY
          Come on, man, I'm going to wet my pants!

Fergus turns him around and unzips his fly.

                       JODY
          Take the fucker out, man, I'm dying --

Fergus takes Jody's penis out.

Jody takes two steps toward the wall.

                       JODY
          I gotta lean forward or I'll dribble all
          over myself. Will you hold my hands for
          me.

Fergus holds his hands from behind, so Jody can lean forward.
Jody now pisses with immense relief

                       JODY
          Now, that was worth waiting for.

                       FERGUS
          Hurry up, would you?

                       JODY
          These things take time, Fergus.

He shakes his body.

                       JODY
          It's amazing how these small details take
          on such importance...

He steps back.

                       JODY
          Now put it back in.

                       FERGUS
          Give us a break.



                                                            18.



                          JODY
             I can't do it! It's only a piece of meat.
             For fuck's sake, it's got no major
             diseases.

Fergus puts Jody's penis back in his pants and zips him up.

                          JODY
             Thank you. I had a case of the clap two
             years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in
             all it's served me well.

                          FERGUS
             Shut up, would you?

                          JODY
             I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you,
             Fergus.

Fergus leads him hack toward the greenhouse.

INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus leads Jody back to his chair.

                          JODY
             Fergus?

                          FERGUS
             Yeah?

                          JODY
             Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.

He begins to laugh.

                          FERGUS
             The pleasure was all mine.

Fergus begins to laugh, without knowing why.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Maguire, walking out of the house, woken by the sound of
laughter.

INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Jody, still laughing. Suddenly the hood is slammed back over
his head.

Maguire, standing there in the dark, looking at Fergus.



                                                              19.



                    MAGUIRE
          What the fuck is this?

                    FERGUS
          It's nothing. He's just got a sense of
          humor, that's all.

                    MAGUIRE
          You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth
          shut. Go in and get some sleep.

Fergus gets up slowly, walks toward the door.

                    JODY
          Yeah. Get some sleep.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus, walking toward the house. He looks back and sees the
figures of Maguire and Jody in the dark, in absolute silence.

INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus sleeping.

INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Jody sleeping. Maguire sitting with an Armalite in his hands,
watching him.

EXT. FARMHOUSE AND FIELDS - DAY

The sun coming up over the low hills around the farmhouse.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Fergus enters, with a tray and some breakfast. Maguire is
sitting where he sat before, stock-still.

                    FERGUS
          Did he talk?

Maguire shakes his head.

                    FERGUS
          Didn't make you laugh?

Maguire shakes his head.

                    FERGUS
          Here. Have some breakfast.

He hands Maguire a plate. Jody stirs.



                                                              20.



                    JODY
          Good morning, Fergus?

Maguire looks hard at him.

                    MAGUIRE
          So he knows your name?

                    FERGUS
          I told him.

                    MAGUIRE
          Are you all there?

He rises, and drags Fergus out the door.

                    FERGUS
          Back in a minute, Jody

EXT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

                    MAGUIRE
          You'll have minimal contact with the
          prisoner, do you hear me?

                    FERGUS
          Yes.

                    MAGUIRE
          And do you know why?

                    FERGUS
          Why?

                    MAGUIRE
          Because tomorrow we might have to shoot
          him, that's why.

Maguire goes back to the house.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Jody sitting with the hood on again. Fergus enters.

                    JODY
          They giving you trouble, Fergus?

Fergus says nothing. He takes a plate and brings it toward
Jody



                                                           21.



                         JODY
             It happens. Y'see, there's two kinds of
             people. Those who give and those who
             take.

Fergus lifts up Jody's hood to expose his mouth and begins to
feed him.

                         JODY
             Ah, take the thing off, man.

Fergus says nothing and keeps feeding him.

                         JODY
             It's okay. I understand. Don't mind if I
             prattle on, do you?

Fergus shakes his head and says nothing.

                         JODY
             I will take it by your silence that you
             don't.

He eats. Fergus feeds himself, then feeds more to Jody.

                         JODY
             Two types, Fergus. The scorpion and the
             frog. Ever heard of them?

Fergus says nothing.

                         JODY
             Scorpion wants to cross a river, but he
             can't swim. Goes to the frog, who can,
             and asks for a ride. Frog says, "If I
             give you a ride on my back, you'll go and
             sting me." Scorpion replies, "It would
             not be in my interest to sting you since
             as I'll be on your back we both would
             drown." Frog thinks about this logic for
             a while and accepts the deal. Takes the
             scorpion on his back. Braves the waters.
             Halfway over feels a burning spear in his
             side and realizes the scorpion has stung
             him after all. And as they both sink
             beneath the waves the frog cries out,
             "Why did you sting me, Mr. Scorpion, for
             now we both will drown?" Scorpion
             replies, "I can't help it, it's in my
             nature."

Jody chuckles under his hood.



                                                           22.



                            FERGUS
              So what's that supposed to mean?

                            JODY
              Means what it says. The scorpion does
              what is in his nature. Take off the hood,
              man.

                            FERGUS
              Why?

                            JODY
              'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.

Fergus walks toward him and pulls off the hood. Jody smiles
up at him.

                            JODY
              See? I was right about you.

                            FERGUS
              Don't be so sure.

                            JODY
              Jody's always right.

INT. GREENHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON.

Both men dozing in the heat.

                            JODY
              Where would you most like to be now, man?

                            FERGUS
              Doesn't matter where.

                            JODY
              Come on, man. If this shit was all over.

                            FERGUS
              Having a pint in the Rock.

                            JODY
              You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of
              something more alluring.

                            FERGUS
              Like what?

                            JODY
              Like having a pint in the Metro --

Fergus laughs.



                                             23.



              FERGUS
Having two pints in the Rock.

              JODY
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's
having a margarita.

              FERGUS
Who's Dil?

              JODY
My special friend.

              FERGUS
Oh, yeah.

              JODY
We got simple tastes, you and me.

              FERGUS
The best.

              JODY
But you fellas never get a break, do you?

              FERGUS
Do you?

              JODY
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're
finished. But you guys are never
finished, are you?

              FERGUS
We don't look on it like that.

              JODY
I've often wondered how you do it.

              FERGUS
Depends on what you believe in.

              JODY
What do you believe in?

              FERGUS
That you guys shouldn't be here.

              JODY
It's as simple as that?

              FERGUS
Yes.



                                                            24.



Jude enters.

                        JUDE
          Put that thing back on him, Fergus.

                        FERGUS
          He's hot.

                        JUDE
          Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover
          the fucker up.

                        JODY
          Have you no feelings, woman?

                        JUDE
          You shut your face --

She pulls the hood down over him.

                        JUDE
          You're heading for trouble, Fergus --

                        JODY
          He's a good soldier, Jude.

She whacks him with a pistol.

                        JUDE
          I said shut the fuck up --

                        JODY
          He believes in the future --

INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Jody, sitting in the hood. Fergus lifts it a bit; Jody's
mouth, with blood now in his lips.

                        FERGUS
          Is it bad?

                        JODY
          No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know
          that, Fergus?

                        FERGUS
          I didn't.

                        JODY
          Some kinds of women are...



                                                          25.



                      FERGUS
            She can't help it.

                      JODY
            Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.

                      FERGUS
            You liked her?

                      JODY
            Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever
            she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus.
            Will you think of her too?

                      FERGUS
            Don't know her.

                      JODY
            Want you to do something, Fergus.

                      FERGUS
            What?

                      JODY
            If they kill me --

                      FERGUS
            Don't think that way.

                      JODY
            But they will. As sure as night follows
            day. They have to. I want you to find her
            out. Tell her I was thinking of her.

Fergus is moved. He can't reply.

                      JODY
            See if she's all right.

                      FERGUS
            I don't know her.

                      JODY
            Take her picture. C'mere.

Fergus walks toward him.

                      JODY
            Take it. In the inside pocket.

Their faces, close to each other as Fergus searches out her
picture.



                                                             26.



                        JODY
          Take the whole lot. I won't need it.

                        FERGUS
          I told you not to talk that way --

                        JODY
          Go to Millie's Hair Salon in
          Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a
          margarita. Don't have to tell her who you
          are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --

                        FERGUS
          Stop it --

The door opens. Maguire is there, with another.

                        MAGUIRE
          Volunteer?

Fergus turns toward him.

                        MAGUIRE
          We need you inside.

Fergus walks toward Maguire and the other man walks forward,
takes his seat. Fergus, unseen by Maguire, puts the wallet in
his pocket.

INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Maguire, Jude, Fergus, and the others.

                        MAGUIRE
          We've had word. They've used every trick
          in the book on him. He's starting to
          talk. You're going to have to do it in
          the morning.

Maguire lights a cigarette. Fergus looks at him and nods.

                        MAGUIRE
          You OK about that?

                        FERGUS
          I'm a volunteer, am n't I?

                        MAGUIRE
          Good. I was beginning to have my doubts
          about you for the last few days.

                        JUDE
          Not the only one --



                                                          27.



                            MAGUIRE
              Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep
              tonight, Fergus.

                            FERGUS
              Peter.

                            MAGUIRE
              What?

                            FERGUS
              Request permission to guard the prisoner
              tonight --

                            JUDE
              You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.

                            MAGUIRE
              Shut the fuck up, Jude.

He turns back to Fergus. He puts his arm on Fergus's
shoulder.

                            MAGUIRE
              Why do you want to do that for?

                            FERGUS
              Would make me feel better about it.

                            MAGUIRE
              You sure about that?

                            FERGUS
              I'm sure.

                            MAGUIRE
              Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.

Fergus leaves.

INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus takes his place in the chair beside Jody.

Jody begins to laugh under the hood. It turns into the sound
of crying.

                            FERGUS
              Don't.

                            JODY
              I'm sorry.



                                                              28.



The crying stops.

                        JODY
          Help me.

                        FERGUS
          How can I?

                        JODY
          I don't know. Just help me. Give me a
          cigarette.

Fergus takes out a cigarette, lights it, and lifts up Jody's
hood so he can smoke.

                        JODY
          Don't even smoke, you know that? It just
          seemed the right thing to do.

Fergus watches him puff the cigarette, the hood just above
his lips. Jody coughs, but keeps the cigarette in his lips.
Fergus gently takes the cigarette from his mouth.

                        FERGUS
          Go to sleep now.

                        JODY
          I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.

                        FERGUS
          What?

                        JODY
          A story.

                        FERGUS
          Like the one about the frog?

                        JODY
          And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.

                        FERGUS
          When I was a child...

                        JODY
          Yeah?

                        FERGUS
          I thought as a child. But when I became a
          man I put away childish things...

                        JODY
          What does that mean?



                                                             29.



                       FERGUS
          Nothing.

                       JODY
          Tell me something, anything.

Fergus is silent; his eyes wet.

                       JODY
          Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?

                       FERGUS
          Me? No, I'm not good for much...

EXT. FIELDS - MORNING.

The farmhouse covered in mist. The sun coming through it.

EXT. GREENHOUSE - MORNING.

Maguire opens the door to the greenhouse and clicks the
chamber of his gun. Fergus has a gun in his hand. He checks
the chamber.

Fergus takes Jody, whose hands are still tied behind his
back, by the elbow.

                       FERGUS
          Stand up, now --

Jody rises. Fergus leads him through the door, past Maguire.

                       MAGUIRE
          I wish to say on behalf of the Irish
          Republican Army --

Fergus turns with sudden fierceness.

                       FERGUS
          Leave him be --

He pulls Jody through the fields.

EXT. TREES - MORNING.

Fergus pushing Jody through a copse of trees, the gun at his
back.

                       JODY
          Take the hood off, Fergus --

                       FERGUS
          No.



                                                              30.



                     JODY
          I want to see a bit. Please, please.
          Don't make me die like an animal.

Fergus pulls the hood off. Jody looks around him. He has a
cut lip where Jude struck him.

Fergus prods him on with the gun. Jody stumbles forward.
Fergus is all cold and businesslike.

                     JODY
          I'm glad you're doing it, do you know
          that, Fergus?

                     FERGUS
          Why?

                     JODY
          Cause you're my friend. And I want you to
          go to the Metro --

                     FERGUS
          Stop that talk now --

                     JODY
          Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?

                     FERGUS
          The fastest.

                     JODY
          Faster than cricket?

                     FERGUS
          Cricket's in the halfpenny place.

                     JODY
          So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat
          you, is there?

                     FERGUS
          You won't run.

                     JODY
          But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a
          brother in the back --

Jody suddenly sprints, and, loosening the ties on his hands,
then freeing them, he is off like a hare. Fergus screams in
fury after him.

                     FERGUS
          JODY!!!



                                                              31.



Fergus aims, then changes his mind and runs.

                            FERGUS
              You stupid bastard --

                            JODY
              What you say, faster?

                            FERGUS
              I said you bastard -- stop --

                            JODY
              Got to catch me first --

Fergus gains on him -- stretches his arm out -- but Jody
sprints ahead again -- as if he has been playing with him. He
laughs in exhilaration. Fergus pants behind him, wheezing,
almost laughing.

                            JODY
              Used to run the mile, you know -- four
              times round the cricket pitch -- what was
              that game called?

                            FERGUS
              Hurling --

                            JODY
              What?

                            FERGUS
              Hurling --

Jody runs, whipping through the trees -- always ahead of him.

                            JODY
              Come on, Fergie -- you can do it -- a bit
              more wind --

Fergus grabs his shoulder and Jody shrugs it off, gaining on
him again.

                            JODY
              Bit of fun, Fergus, eh?

And suddenly the trees give way. Jody turns, laughing, to
Fergus.

                            JODY
              Told you I was fast --

Fergus is panting, pointing the gun at Jody



                                                             32.



                        JODY
             Don't do it.

And suddenly a Saracen tank whips around the corner, hits
Jody with the full of its fender. His body flies in the air
and bounces forward as another tank tries to grind to a halt
and the huge wheels grind over him.

Fergus, screaming, "No-!" He almost moves forward, then sees
soldiers spilling from the tank around the body. Fergus turns
and runs.

EXT. TREES - DAY

Fergus whipping through the trees, his body crouched low as
he runs.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Tinker sitting in the greenhouse. A helicopter screams into
view through the panes and automatic fire comes from it,
shattering every pane in seconds and tearing Tinker to bits.

INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Bullets whipping through every window, taking chunks from the
masonry, tearing the walls apart. Maguire, Jude, and the
others on the floor, scrambling for weapons.

EXT. TREES - DAY

Fergus, hearing the gunfire, runs through overhanging
branches till eventually he is hidden from sight.

EXT. CARNIVAL ON THE MONAGHAN BORDER - DAWN.

A forlorn-looking building over nondescript fields.

An old man wheels a bicycle slowly toward it; a rusty car
appears; and Fergus gets out of it.

                        TOMMY
             Fergus!

                        FERGUS
             You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're
             you keeping?

INT. CARAVAN - DAY

The old man pouring whiskey into a teacup.



                                                                33.



                        TOMMY
             You'll notice I've asked you nothing.

                        FERGUS
             That's wise, Tommy.

                        TOMMY
             All right, then. I like to be wise.

He pours Fergus more whiskey.

                        TOMMY
             So what do you need, Fergus?

                        FERGUS
             Need to go across the water.

                        TOMMY
             Do you now.

                        FERGUS
             Need to lose myself awhile.

                        TOMMY
             Aha.

He looks at Fergus and lights a cigarette.

He puffs.

                        TOMMY
             There's a man I know ships cattle to
             London.

EXT. DUBLIN BAY - EVENING.

The ferry, churning into the sunset.

                                                      FADE TO BLACK.

INT. BUILDING SITE - DAY

FADE UP into an elegant, empty Georgian room, covered in
clouds of dust. A figure among the clouds of dust, hacking at
a wall with a sledgehammer. It is Fergus, dressed in
laborer's overalls, covered in dust. He is knocking the
bricks from an outer wall. He works furiously and
relentlessly, like a machine.

We see the wall, with the hammer striking it. One brick falls
away, then another. Daylight pours through the clouds of dust
and the growing hole.



                                                              34.



Fergus's face, as he works.

The hole. More bricks falling away. Through the clouds of
dust and the streams of daylight we now see a patch of green.

Fergus's face, working. His rhythm slows.

The hole. More bricks fall away. Then the hammer stops. The
dust begins to clear.

His face.

The jagged hole. The dust drifts across it, revealing a
cricket pitch, with tiny sticklike figures running on the
green.

EXT. HOSTEL - DAY

Fergus, returning from work, crosses the street, and enters
through a white door.

INT. HOSTEL - DAY

Fergus dressing. He puts on a cheap suit, like any country
boy in a big city. He takes Jody's wallet from the trousers
of his overalls. He flips it open, sees the picture of the
soldier and Dil. He puts it in the pocket of his suit.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Fergus walking down a street looking for an address. Some
distance down the street is a sign -- MILLIE'S UNISEX HAIR
SALON.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Fergus, standing as the crowds go by him, looking in the
window. He has the picture in his hand. We see Dil from his
point of view, then Fergus walks inside.

INT. HAIR SALON - DAY

Fergus enters. The door gives a loud ping.

                       A GIRL
             We're closing. I'll see you tomorrow, Dil

She leaves the salon.

                       DIL
             You want something in particular?



                                                              35.



                        FERGUS
          Just a bit of a trim...

Dil checks her watch and stubs out a cigarette.

                        DIL
          Come on...

She gestures toward a chair. Fergus sits down. She comes
toward him and fiddles with his hair.

She pushes his head back into a basin behind him. She begins
to knead his hair in hot water and shampoo.

                        DIL
          Someone recommend you?

                        FERGUS
          In a way.

                        DIL
          Who?

                        FERGUS
          Guy I work with.

                        DIL
          What's his name?

Fergus can't think of an answer. The hands with the purple
nails run over his scalp.

                        FERGUS
          Doesn't the water get to your nails?

                        DIL
          What's it to you?

                        FERGUS
          Nothing.

Fergus, sitting up. She begins to cut.

                        DIL
          You American?

                        FERGUS
          No.

                        DIL
          Not English.



                                                              36.



                           FERGUS
             No.

                           DIL
             Scottish?

                           FERGUS
             How'd you guess?

                           DIL
             The accent, I suppose.

                           FERGUS
             And what's it like?

                           DIL
             Like treacle.

She imitates his accent saying it. Fergus laughs.

                           DIL
             Nice laugh.

Dil raises Fergus's head up, with his new-cut hair and holds
a mirror up behind his head so he can see the back. He looks
like a young London stockbroker. The hair salon around them
is empty.

                           DIL
             That should make her happy.

                           FERGUS
             Who's she?

                           DIL
             Don't know. Who is she?

EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.

Fergus emerges from the shop. He takes one last look through
the window where Dil is taking off her smock, touching up her
hair, etc. It is as if she has forgotten all about him. He
walks off through the crowds and then ducks into a doorway.

The doorway of the shop. Dil comes out, dressed in a pair of
high heels, a very short skirt, different, more raunchy
clothes on her than we saw inside. She locks the glass door
and walks down the street, across the road, and into a pub
called the Metro. Fergus follows.



                                                             37.



INT. METRO - EVENING.

Half full, with an after-work crowd. Dil makes her way
through it.

                        BARMAN
          Hi, Dil

                        DIL
          Hiya, hon.

She sits down at the bar. Fergus comes toward the bar and
takes a seat.

                        BARMAN
          What'll it be?

                        FERGUS
          A bottle of Guinness.

Dil, looking at Fergus.

                        DIL
          See that, Col?

                        COL
          See what, Dil?

                        DIL
          He gave me a look.

                        COL
          Did he?

Fergus blushes. He buries himself in his drink.

                        DIL
          Just cut his hair, you know.

                        COL
          Yeah?

                        DIL
          What you think?

                        COL
          Nice.

Fergus throws his eyes toward her again. She has her face
turned away, but sees him in the mirror.

                        DIL
          There, he did it again.



                                                             38.



                           COL
              Saw that one.

                           DIL
              What would you call it?

                           COL
              Now, that was a look.

She eyes Fergus in the mirror.

                           DIL
              Ask him to ask me what I'm drinking.

The barman, with infinite weariness, approaches Fergus.

                           COL
              She wants to know do you want to know
              what she's drinking.

Fergus is about to talk when she pipes up.

                           DIL
              A margarita.

The barman mixes it. She stares at the mirror, staring at
Fergus, who is trying to avoid her eyes. The barman hands her
the drink.

                           DIL
              Now he can look.... Ask him does he like
              his hair, Col.

                           COL
              She wants to know, sir, do you like your
              hair.

                           FERGUS
              Tell her I'm very happy with it.

                           DIL
              He's Scottish, Col.

                           COL
              Scottish?

                           FERGUS
              Yeah.

                           DIL
              What'd he say, Col?



                                                              39.



                         COL
           He agreed that he was.

                         DIL
           What do you think his name is?

                         COL
           I've no thoughts on the subject.

                         FERGUS
           Jimmy.

                         DIL
           Jimmy?

                         COL
           That's what he said. Jimmy.

                         DIL
           Hi, Jimmy.

                         FERGUS
           Hiya, Dil

A burly man sits down beside her. He puts his hand on her
knee.

                         MAN
           Sing the song, Dil --

She slaps the hand away.

                         DIL
           Fuck off, Dave.

                         DAVE
           C'mon, babe! You know what I like...
           Easy!

She turns back to Fergus and finds his seat empty.

EXT. METRO - NIGHT.

Fergus, standing across the road from the pub. He is
sweating. Dil comes out of the pub. She looks this way and
that, as if searching for Fergus. Fergus stands back into a
shadow.

Dave, the burly man, comes out. He grabs her by the elbow.
She shrugs him off. She walks off. Dave follows, grabs her by
the elbow again. The sense of an old argument. Dave suddenly
strikes her across the face with his open palm.



                                                              40.


She leans her head against a wall. Dave then puts his arms
around her, consoles her.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT.

Dave walking, holding Dil by the arm. The street is
dilapidated, full of squats. They stop outside a door. Dil
opens the door with a key from her purse and they both walk
inside.

Fergus stands there, observing.

A light comes on in an upstairs room. Dil enters; we see her
shadow in silhouette behind the curtain and the shadow of
Dave coming in behind her. He begins to remove her blouse.
She stands absolutely still as he does so.

Fergus backs away, then walks off.

INT. HOSTEL - NIGHT.

Fergus, in bed. Fade to black as we see Jody as a bowler,
running in slow motion, toward the camera. He releases the
ball; we see Fergus in bed, breathing heavily.

INT. SITE - NEXT DAY

Fergus takes a break and watches the batsman hit a ball. He
imitates the batsman's motion with his sledgehammer. Then a
voice interrupts him.

                        DEVEROUX
           So Pat's a cricket fan, eh?

Fergus turns. We see Tristram Deveroux, a young Sloane type
in a three-piece suit, whose house it is. Beside him is
Franknum, the cockney foreman.

                        FERGUS
           It's not Pat. It's Jim.

                        DEVEROUX
           Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as
           you remember you're not at Lords.

Fergus resumes work.

INT. METRO - NIGHT.

It is now crowded with people, black, white, punky and street
chic, a lot of leather All the women are heavily made-up.
Someone is singing from the tiny stage and rows of cheap
colored bulbs are flashing around it.



                                                              41.



From the way Fergus walks through, it is obvious he has never
been here at night. He seems most out of place in his cheap
suit, making his way through the crowd to the bar.

AT THE BAR.

Fergus looks through the odd crowd, but can't find Dil. Col,
the barman, sees him and smiles.

                     COL
          So can we consider you a regular, sir?

                     FERGUS
          Is that good or bad?

                     COL
          Well, you get to say, The usual, Col.
          Things like that.

Col pushes a colored cocktail with one of those Japanese
umbrellas toward him.

                     COL
          So let's call this the usual.

                     FERGUS
          Thanks.

Fergus reaches for his wallet to pay, but Col interrupts.

                     COL
          No, no. It's on me.

Fergus tries to pretend he's familiar with the drink, and by
implication, whatever are the norms of the place. He lifts
the glass to his mouth, but the umbrella keeps getting in the
way.

                     COL
          Take it out, if you want.

Fergus takes out the umbrella. He holds it in one hand and
drinks with the other.

                     COL
          You came to see her, didn't you?

Fergus shrugs. He takes out a cigarette. A guy in leather to
his left smiles at him.

                     COL
          Something I should tell you. She's --



                                                              42.



                       FERGUS
          She's what?

The barman looks up toward the stage.

                       COL
          She's on.

THE JUKEBOX.

A hand presses a button. The needle selects a disk. A song by
Dave Berry, "The Crying Game."

AT THE BAR.

Fergus looks up. Close-up of Dil's hand, as music begins,
making movements to the music. We see Dil, standing on a
stage, swaying slightly. She seems a little drunk. She mimes
to the song. She mouths the words so perfectly and the voice
on the song is so feminine that there is no way of knowing
who is doing the singing. She does all sorts of strange
movements, as if she is drawing moonbeams with her hands.

The crowd seems to know this act. They cheer, whether out of
approval or derision we can't be sure.

Fergus watching.

Dil singing, noticing him. She comes to the end of the song.
The crowd cheers.

Fergus, watching her make her way through the crowded bar,
toward him.

                       DIL
          He's still looking, Col.

                       COL
          Persistent.

                       DIL
          Good thing in a man.

                       COL
          An excellent quality.

                       DIL
          Maybe he wants something.

                       COL
          I would expect he does.



                                                             43.



                      DIL
          Ask him.

                      COL
          Ask him yourself.

She looks at Fergus directly, sits down next to him.

                      DIL
          So tell me.

Fergus says nothing. He shrugs.

                      DIL
          Everybody wants something.

                      FERGUS
          Not me.

                      DIL
          Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned
          and quaint. Isn't it, Col?

Col shrugs.

                      DIL
          You old-fashioned?

                      FERGUS
          Must be.

The burly man comes up to her.

                      MAN
          Got the money, Dil?

                      DIL
          Fuck off, Dave.

                      DAVE
          You fucking promised.

                      DIL
          Did I?

                      DAVE
          You fucking did.

He suddenly jerks her roughly off the stool, spilling her
drink.

                      DAVE
          Didn't you? Well, come on!



                                                              44.



He drags her through the crowd. In the mirror, Fergus watches
them go. The barman eyes him.

                        COL
              It takes all types.

                        FERGUS
              So who's he?

                        COL
              He's what she should run a mile from.

                        FERGUS
              Then why doesn't she?

                        COL
              Who knows the secrets of the human heart.

Fergus suddenly stands and makes his way to the door.

EXT. PUB - NIGHT.

Fergus comes out. A black bouncer is there, but there is no
sign of Dil. He walks a few yards and hears voices down an
alley. He looks up it.

P0V - ALLEY.

We see Dil pushing Dave away. He grabs her, turns her
roughly.

                        DAVE
              Don't be like that --

                        DIL
              You heard me --

She beats his arms away. Money falls on the ground. She
staggers away from him. He picks up the money, then runs
after her.

                        DAVE
              Got very fucking grand, haven't we --

He tries to pull her back.

                        DAVE
              Talk to me, you stupid bitch --

They both bump into Fergus, who just stands there and doesn't
move an inch. She smiles.



                                                             45.



                        DIL
          Hi.

                        FERGUS
          Hi. You forgot your bag.

He holds it up to show her.

                        DIL
          Thank you.

                        DAVE
          Who the fuck is he?

                        DIL
          Jimmy.

                        DAVE
          It's him, isn't it?

                        DIL
          Maybe.

Dave eyes Fergus. Fergus grabs his wrists and upends him on
the ground.

                        DIL
          See, they get the wrong idea.

                        DAVE
                 (from the ground)
          Cunt.

Fergus puts his foot on Dave's neck.

                        FERGUS
          What was that?

                        DIL
          They all get the wrong idea.

                        DAVE
          Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.

                        DIL
          Charming.

Dave grabs for her ankle. She kicks his hand away. Fergus
presses down his foot. He looks to Dil.

                        FERGUS
          What'll I do?



                                                          46.



                          DIL
            Break his neck.

Fergus presses his foot.

                          DIL
            No, don't.

She bends low to Dave.

                          DIL
            He's going to take his foot off slowly,
            David. Then you're to go home, like a
            good boy. You hear me?

                          DAVE
            Cunt.

But his voice is softer. Fergus removes his foot. Dil grabs
his arm.

                          DIL
            Come on, honey.

She draws him away.

EXT. METRO - NIGHT.

They walk out of the alley.

                          FERGUS
            You all right?

                          DIL
            Yes, thank you.

                          FERGUS
            What was that all about?

                          DIL
            He wants me to perform for him.

                          FERGUS
            Perform?

                          DIL
            You know.

                          FERGUS
            You on the game?

                          DIL
            God no. I'm a hairdresser.



                                                              47.



Fergus looks back. Dave is rising.

                     FERGUS
          He's getting up.

                     DIL
          You can't leave me then, can you?

EXT. STAIRCASE OUTSIDE DIL'S FLAT

Fergus and Dil climb slowly upstairs.

                     DIL
          You want me to ask you in, right?

                     FERGUS
          No, I didn't --

                     DIL
          But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud,
          but never cheap.

There is a movement lower down the staircase. We see Dave,
holding his neck.

                     DAVE
          Fucking dumb dyke carrot cunt.

Dil leans close to Fergus.

                     DIL
          If you kissed me, it would really get his
          goat.

She tilts up her face. Fergus kisses her, tenderly.

                     DIL
          Now, if you asked me to meet you
          tomorrow, it would really drive him
          insane.

                     FERGUS
          Where?

                     DIL
          Half-five. At Millie's.

She goes in and closes the door. Fergus stands and looks down
at Dave, who turns to leave.

EXT. HAIR SALON - DAY

Dil walks out of the salon, smiling, and walks toward Fergus.



                                                             48.



                        DIL
          Give me that look again.

                        FERGUS
          What look?

                        DIL
          The one you gave me in the Metro.

Fergus takes a bunch of flowers from behind his back. She
holds them, with theatrical feeling.

                        DIL
          Darling, you shouldn't have.

She laughs and leans toward him and kisses him in a
classically old-fashioned way. The girls inside the salon
pull back a curtain, and they all clap.

                        FERGUS
          What's that about?

                        DIL
          They're jealous.

                        FERGUS
          Why?

                        DIL
          I wonder.

She takes his arm and walks off with him.

INT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT.

Fergus and Dil looking at their menus. A waiter places drinks
on their table, then leaves.

                        DIL
          Now's the time you're meant to do
          something, isn't it?

                        FERGUS
          Like what?

                        DIL
          Make a pass or something. Isn't that the
          way it goes?

                        FERGUS
          Must be.



                                                              49.



EXT. STREET - NIGHT.

They are walking in an alleyway toward her house.

                        DIL
          You got a special friend, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          How special?

                        DIL
          You want one?

And suddenly a car drives very fast toward them, headlights
on. Fergus pulls her into a doorway to avoid it.

                        FERGUS
          Jesus Christ!

                        DIL
          Jesus.

The car continues down the road, stops, and then screeches
off.

                        FERGUS
          That Dave?

                        DIL
          The things a girl has to put up with.

She looks down toward where the car has pulled away.

                        DIL
          I'm frightened, Jimmy. That's not like
          him.

EXT. DIL'S FLAT.

A car pulls up behind Dil and Fergus.

                        DIL
          Piss off, Dave!

                        FERGUS
          Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all
          right on your own?

                        DIL
          I'm not on my own, am I?

She touches his cheek.



                                                             50.



                        DIL
          Come on up, would you?

INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.

Dil comes in in the darkness. Fergus stands like a shadow in
the doorway. The light comes on; she takes off her raincoat.

                        DIL
          Won't hurt you to come in.

Fergus enters slowly. He looks around the room; there is an
exaggerated femininity about everything in it.

                        DIL
          Would you like a drink?

                        FERGUS
          Yes, please.

                        DIL
          What'll it be?

                        FERGUS
          Whiskey.

She goes into a small kitchen. Fergus looks at the
mantelpiece and sees a picture of Jody. The camera tracks
into the soldier's smiling face. Then into Fergus's face. His
reverie is broken by the sound of a voice outside -- Dave's.

She comes through with two drinks.

                        FERGUS
          Someone out there.

                        DIL
          Jesus fucking Christ.

She opens the window door, and we see Dave on the street, in
a neck brace.

                        DIL
          Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --

                        DAVE
          It's Dave.

She goes back into the room and begins taking things up.

                        DAVE
          Talk to me, Dil --



                                                              51.



                        DIL
           Sure, Dave --

                        DAVE
           Please, Dil --

She flings things down: men's clothes, leather trousers, a
suitcase, a teddy bear.

                        DIL
           Take your clothes.

                        DAVE
           Don't throw my clothes out the window!

                        DIL
           Fuck off back to Essex!

                        DAVE
           Fucking mad!

Fergus looks to the man down in the street, a parody of
rejection with his things in his arms.

                        DAVE
           Don't chuck my clothes out!

                        DIL
           Take your fucking goldfish, too!

Dil grabs a large goldfish bowl and flings it down. The bowl
breaks to bits on the pavement. Goldfish thrash around in the
street.

                        DAVE
           You fucking bitch!

He tries to pick up the flapping fish in his hands.

                        DAVE
           Murderer!

Upstairs, Dil closes the window shut.

                        DIL
           Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a
           brace?

                        FERGUS
           Must be in love to manage that.

                        DIL
           Doesn't know the meaning of the word.



                                                              52.



Fergus stands as Dil hands him a glass.

                       FERGUS
          He lived here with you?

                       DIL
          Tried to. Sit down, will you?

Fergus walks past the photograph and sits down. He looks from
her to the picture.

                       FERGUS
          What about him?

He nods toward the picture. She looks down into her drink.

                       DIL
          He was different.

                       FERGUS
          How different?

                       DIL
          As different as it's possible to be.

                       FERGUS
          Tell me about him.

                       DIL
          No.

                       FERGUS
          Shouldn't I go?

                       DIL
          Yes.

And they fall into one another's arms. She stretches up with
her whole body over him. They grow suddenly and violently
passionate.

They fall into the cushions of the couch onto the floor. The
photograph above them seems to smile. He draws up her dress
with his hands. She suddenly pulls away.

                       DIL
          No --

                       FERGUS
          Did you do that to him?

She comes up toward him once more. She puts her mouth close
to his ear.



                                                              53.



                        DIL
          You want to know how I kissed him?

                        FERGUS
          Yes...

                        DIL
          Are you jealous of him?

                        FERGUS
          Maybe.

                        DIL
          That's good...

She opens the buttons on his shirt and her mouth travels down
his chest. Fergus tries to draw her up toward him, but her
hand reaches up to his mouth and presses his head back while
her other hand undoes his pants. She kisses his stomach; her
mouth moves down his body. Fergus stares at the picture of
Jody. Jody's eyes seem to burn through him. Dil raises her
head and kisses his mouth. There are tears in his eyes.

                        FERGUS
          What would he think?

                        DIL
          Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He
          was a soldier. Went there like a fool.

She sits in front of the mirror.

                        FERGUS
          Do you miss him?

                        DIL
          What do you think?

                        FERGUS
          I think you do.

                        DIL
                  (dreamily)
          You say that like a gentleman.

                        FERGUS
          Do I?

                        DIL
          Like you're concerned.

Fergus gets up and stands behind her, gently pushes the hair
from her face.



                                                             54.



                        DIL
          But you can t stay, you know that?

                        FERGUS
          Didn't think I could.

                        DIL
          A real gentleman...

She embraces him.

                        FERGUS
          Shouldn't you be in mourning?

                        DIL
          I am.

She sits back down in front of the mirror. Fergus leaves. She
reapplies her lipstick.

INT. METRO - NIGHT.

Singer in a blue dress. Dil and Fergus by the bar. Both
drinking drinks with umbrellas. Dave comes up behind them
with his neck brace.

                        DAVE
          Look, I'm sorry.

                        DIL
          Fuck off, Dave.

                        DAVE
          No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm
          sorry, didn't I?

                        DIL
          Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?

Fergus nods. He stands. Dave steps two feet back.

                        FERGUS
          I was only going to ask her for a dance.

Fergus takes Dil's arm.

                        FERGUS
          Shall we?

The woman is singing.

As they circle, people begin to look at them admiringly. Dil
holds her cheek close to his.



                                                             55.



                      FERGUS
          Did he come here too?

                      DIL
          Is this an obsession of yours?

                      FERGUS
          Maybe.

                      DIL
          He did sometimes.

                      FERGUS
          Did he dance with you?

Dil doesn't answer. Looks at him out of the corner of her
eye.

                      DIL
          So what do you want with me, Jimmy?

                      FERGUS
          Want to look after you.

                      DIL
          What does that mean?

                      FERGUS
          Something I heard someone say once.

She draws back and looks at him.

                      DIL
          You mean that?

                      FERGUS
          Yeah.

She dances closer.

                      DIL
          Why?

                      FERGUS
          If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.

In the bar, people singing along with the music. Col sings.
Dave sitting at the bar, sulking.

                      DIL
          You're not having me on, are you? 'Cause
          Dil can't stand that.



                                                             56.



                     FERGUS
          No.

She puts her cheek against his. Dave, at the bar, slams his
drink down.

                     DIL
          And she does get very upset...

Dave stands up to leave. On the stage the act finishes. Dil
draws Fergus back to the bar.

AT THE BAR.

Col, the barman, pours her drink.

                     DIL
          One for him, too.

Col pours and smiles.

                     DIL
          Drink.

                     FERGUS
          What is this?

                     DIL
          I'm superstitious. Drink.

He drinks. He grimaces. She throws it back in one.

                     DIL
          Can't leave me now.

                     FERGUS
          Aha.

                     DIL
          The thing is, can you go the distance?

                     FERGUS
          Depends what it is.

                     DIL
          No, depends on nothing.

She takes the bottle herself and fills their glasses. She
slams it back. He sips.

                     DIL
          In one.



                                                              57.



She tilts his glass back. He swallows it in one.

INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.

She enters; Fergus walks in slowly. He looks from the cricket
whites that are hanging up behind a curtain to the
photographs.

                           DIL
              What you thinking of, hon?

                           FERGUS
              I'm thinking of your man.

                           DIL
              Why?

                           FERGUS
              I'm wondering why you keep his things.

                           DIL
              Told you, I'm superstitious.

She turns toward him and undoes her hair. It falls around her
shoulders.

                           FERGUS
              Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?

                           DIL
              All the time.

Fergus runs his hand down her throat.

                           DIL
              Even now.

                           FERGUS
              No...

                           DIL
              He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.

She draws him behind a curtain toward the bed, pulls him
down. They kiss passionately.

                           DIL
              Give me one minute.

She walks into the bathroom. Fergus lies there, looking at
the picture, listening to the sound of running water. She
comes out then, dressed in a silk kimono. She looks
extraordinarily beautiful.



                                                              58.


He reaches out his hand and grasps hers. He draws her toward
him. He begins to kiss her face and neck.

                            FERGUS
              Would he have minded?

She murmurs no. His hands slip the wrap down from her
shoulders.

CLOSE ON HIS HANDS, traveling down her neck, in the darkness.
Then the hands stop. The kimono falls to the floor gently,
with a whisper. The camera travels with it, and we see, in a
close-up, that she is a man.

Fergus sits there, frozen, staring at her.

                            DIL
              You did know, didn't you?

Fergus says nothing.

                            DIL
              Oh my God.

She gives a strange little laugh, then reaches out to touch
him. Fergus smacks the hand away.

                            FERGUS
              Jesus. I feel sick --

He gets up and runs to the bathroom. She grabs his feet.

                            DIL
              Don't go, Jimmy --

He kicks her away. He runs into the bathroom and vomits into
the tub.

She crouches on the floor.

                            DIL
              I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

He retches again.

                            DIL
              What were you doing in the bar if you
              didn't know -- I'm bleeding...

She lights a cigarette.

Fergus runs the taps. He washes his face, rinses his mouth.



                                                              59.



                        DIL
          It's all right, Jimmy. I can take it.
          Just not on the face.

Fergus slams the door shut. She is sitting on the couch, the
kimono round her once more, looking very much like a woman. A
trace of blood on her mouth.

                        DIL
          Y'see, I'm not a young thing any
          longer.... Funny the way things go. Don't
          you find that, Jimmy? Never the way you
          expected.

Fergus comes out of the bathroom.

                        FERGUS
          I'm sorry.

She looks up. Some hope in her face.

                        DIL
          You mean that?

And he makes to go. She grabs him to stop him.

                        DIL
          Don't go like that. Say something...

He pulls away from her. She falls to the floor.

                        DIL
          Jesus.

He drags himself away and runs down the stairs.

INT. FERGUS'S FLAT

Fergus in bed. Flash to shot of blackness, Jody grinning in
cricket whites, throwing the ball up and down in his hand.

INT. METRO - NIGHT.

The place is hopping. Fergus enters. He now sees it as he
should have seen it the first night -- as a transvestite bar.
He makes his way through the crowds. All the women too-
heavily made-up. Some beautifully sleek young things he looks
at he realizes are young men. He makes his way to the bar
where Dil is sitting, nursing a drink with an umbrella in it.
Her face is bruised. She is wearing dark glasses.

As he walks toward her she sees him in the mirror. She talks
to Col the barman.



                                                          60.



                          DIL
            He's back, Col

                          COL
            Hi.

                          DIL
            Don't want any of those looks, Col. They
            don't mean much.

                          COL
            Stop it, Dil --

                          DIL
            No. Tell him to go fuck himself.

Fergus sits. Col turns to him.

                          COL
            She wants me to tell you go fuck
            yourself.

                          FERGUS
            I'm sorry.

There is a tear running down her cheek, under the dark
glasses.

                          DIL
            Tell him to stop messing Dil around --

                          FERGUS
            Dil --

                          DIL
            Tell him it hurt --

                          FERGUS
            I have to talk to her, Col --

                          COL
            Says he's got to talk to you --

Fergus touches her arm.

                          FERGUS
            Come on, Dil --

                          DIL
            Where?

She whips her arm away.



                                                              61.



                        DIL
          Tell him again, Col. Go fuck himself --

She walks into the crowd, toward the door.

Fergus leaves.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT.

Fergus, walking outside Dil's place. The blinds in her room
are down and the light is on inside. We see her outline,
pacing up and down behind the blinds, smoking a cigarette. We
hear the song "The Crying Game."

Fergus stands beneath her doorway, scribbles a note, and
sticks it in the letter box.

EXT. CRICKET PITCH - DAY

A man removes a large number six from a huge scoreboard with
a pole and replaces it with a number nine.

Below the scoreboard we can see Dil walking across a lawn
toward the building where Fergus is working.

INT. SITE - DAY

Fergus, fitting a new window into the finished wall. On the
pitch we see the cricketers, distorted through the moving
glass of the window. Across the pitch Dil walks, with a lunch
basket in her hand, dressed in a very short skirt with high
heels. As she approaches the site a chorus of whistles breaks
out.

Fergus, hearing the whistling, stares out. He sees Dil moving
toward the site. He drops the window and the glass shatters.
As the whistles continue, we see Dil in the site's lift,
which rises up. We see Deveroux and Franknum climbing up a
ladder toward Fergus .

                        DEVEROUX
          How much did that frame cost, Mr.
          Franknum?

                        FRANKNUM
          Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.

                        DEVEROUX
          Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid.

                        FERGUS
          Sorry.



                                                              62.



                        DEVEROUX
          Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back,
          will it, Mr. Franknum?

                        FRANKNUM
          Not in my experience.

                        DEVEROUX
          Off his wages.

                        FERGUS
          Do you mean that?

                        DEVEROUX
          He wants to know do I mean that.

                        FRANKNUM
          I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.

                        DEVEROUX
          Bloody right I do...

Through this conversation Fergus can hear the chorus of wolf
whistles increasing. He looks out the gap where the window
should be and sees Dil in the lift. The laborers whistle at
her, looking up her skirt, etc.

She passes by a gap in the wall and blows a kiss at him.

                        DEVEROUX
          Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?

                        FERGUS
          She's not a tart.

                        DEVEROUX
          No, of course not, she's a lady.

                        FERGUS
          She's not that either.

Fergus walks out of the room.

Fergus walks round the scaffolding. Dil sees him and waves,
sits on some bricks and opens the hamper.

                        DIL
          Darling --

She is acting bright and businesslike, like any wife. She is
wearing dark glasses to cover the bruise on her face. She
pecks him on the cheek.



                                                       63.



                      DIL
          Never let the sun go down on an argument,
          Jody used to say.

                      FERGUS
          What you doing here?

                      DIL
          Got your note. So let's kiss and make up,
          hon.

                      FERGUS
          Don't call me that.

                      DIL
          Sorry, darling.

                      FERGUS
          Give it over, Dil --

                      DIL
          Apologies, my sweet.

Fergus smiles in spite of himself.

                      DIL
          That's more like it, dear. Have a cuppa.

She takes out a thermos and pours him some tea.

                      FERGUS
          You're something else, Dil, you know
          that?

                      DIL
          Never said a truer word.

She hands him a neatly cut sandwich.

                      DIL
          See, I was always best looking after
          someone. Must be something in the genes.

                      FERGUS
          Must be.

                      DIL
          And the fact that you didn't know is
          basically the fault of yours truly. And
          even when you were throwing up, I could
          tell you cared.



                                                       64.



                        FERGUS
          You could?

                        DIL
          Do you care, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Sure I do.

                        DIL
          You mean that?

                        FERGUS
          Yeah. I care, Dil.

She lowers her head.

                        FERGUS
          You crying, Dil?

He removes her glasses and looks at her moist eyes.

                        DIL
          I'm tired and emotional.

Then he hears a voice behind him.

                        DEVEROUX
          Do it on your own time, Paddy.

                        FERGUS
          What?

                        DEVEROUX
          Whatever it is she does for you.

Fergus looks from Dil to Deveroux.

                        FERGUS
          If I was her I'd consider that an insult.

                        DEVEROUX
          Consider it how you like. Just get that
          bloody tart out of here.

Fergus stands up suddenly. He speaks quietly.

                        FERGUS
          Did you ever pick your teeth up with
          broken fingers?

Deveroux stares, suddenly chilled.



                                                          65.



                      DEVEROUX
          What's that supposed to mean?

                      FERGUS
          It's a simple question.

Deveroux says nothing. Fergus looks down to Dil.

                      FERGUS
          Come on, dear.

He holds out his arm. Dil gathers up her things and takes it.
Her face is wreathed in a smile.

                      DIL
          He didn't answer, honey --

Fergus walks her down the scaffolding ramp.

                      FRANKNUM
          Sorry about that, Mr. Deveroux.

Dil and Fergus descend from the site in the lift.

                      DIL
          My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.

                      FERGUS
          Shut up.

                      DIL
          Made me feel all funny inside.

                      FERGUS
          I said stop it.

                      DIL
          Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.

                      FERGUS
          You think that's wise?

                      DIL
          Nothing's wise.

The lift stops with a thud.

                      FERGUS
          I didn't mean to hit you.

                      DIL
          I know that.



                                                            66.



                        FERGUS
          Kind of liked you as a girl.

                        DIL
          That's a start.

                        FERGUS
          So I'm sorry.

                        DIL
          Make it up to me, then.

                        FERGUS
          How?

                        DIL
          Ask to meet me again.

                        FERGUS
          Will you meet me again?

                        DIL
          When?

                        FERGUS
          Whenever. Tonight.

She leans forward and kisses him. Fergus hears a wail of
catcalls behind him. He watches Dil go as the lift takes him
back up to the site.

EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.

Fergus, outside the hair salon. Dil, inside, is throwing off
her smock and walking toward him. All the girls are smiling.
Fergus looks from Dil to the girls as they approach.

                        FERGUS
          Do they know?

                        DIL
          Know what, honey?

                        FERGUS
          Know what I didn't know. And don't call
          me that.

                        DIL
          Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her
          feelings.

                        FERGUS
          Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.



                                                          67.



                       DIL
          Details, baby, details.

                       FERGUS
          So they do know.

                       DIL
          All right, they do.

She takes his arm as they walk off.

                       FERGUS
          Don't.

                       DIL
          Sorry.

                       FERGUS
          I should have known, shouldn't I?

                       DIL
          Probably.

                       FERGUS
          Kind of wish I didn't.

                       DIL
          You can always pretend.

                       FERGUS
          That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't
          he?

                       DIL
          Absolutely.

                       FERGUS
          Won't be quite the same though, will it?

                       DIL
          Are you pretending yet?

                       FERGUS
          I'm working on it.

Fergus hears a car following them, and turns around to look.

                       FERGUS
          There's Dave. He knew too.

                       DIL
          Stop it, Jimmy.



                                                          68.



                        FERGUS
          Am I becoming repetitious?

                        DIL
          A little.

                        FERGUS
          Sorry.

They reach her door. The car stops.

                        FERGUS
          Don't ask me in.

                        DIL
          Please, Jimmy.

                        FERGUS
          No. Can't pretend that much.

                        DIL
          I miss you, Jimmy.

                        FERGUS
          Should have stayed a girl.

                        DIL
          Don't be cruel.

                        FERGUS
          Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.

                        DIL
          Only if you kiss me.

Fergus kisses her. He looks at her open lips as if in
disbelief at himself.

                        FERGUS
          Happy now?

                        DIL
          Delirious.

She goes inside.

INT. HOSTEL - NIGHT.

Fergus walks into the room and turns on a small desk-light.
Then he hears a voice.

                        JUDE
          Hello, stranger.



                                                            69.



He sees Jude sitting in the corner. Her hair is now dark
brown.

                        JUDE
          You vanished.

He stares at her, says nothing.

                        JUDE
          What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the
          gaff on us or did you just fuck up?

                        FERGUS
          Leave me alone, Jude.

                        JUDE
          No. That's the last thing I'll do. You
          never asked what happened.

                        FERGUS
          I heard.

                        JUDE
          Eddie and Tinker died.

                        FERGUS
          I know.

                        JUDE
          Maguire and me got out by the skin of our
          teeth. No thanks to you.... What you
          think of the hair?

                        FERGUS
          Suits you.

She walks round the room.

                        JUDE
          Aye, I was sick of being blond. Needed a
          tougher look, if you know what I mean.

She lies down on the bed beside him, takes off a black
leather glove, and puts her hand on his crotch.

                        JUDE
          Fuck me, Fergus.

He takes her hand away.

                        JUDE
          Am I to take it that's a no?



                                                       70.



He says nothing.

                     JUDE
          We had a court-martial in your absence.
          They wanted to put a bullet in your head.
          I pleaded for clemency. Said we should
          find out what happened first. So what did
          happen?

                     FERGUS
          He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back.
          I tried to catch him. He made it to the
          road and got hit by a Saracen.

                     JUDE
          So you did fuck up.

                     FERGUS
          Yes.

                     JUDE
          But you know what the thing is, Fergus?

                     FERGUS
          No, what is the thing?

                     JUDE
          You vanished quite effectively. Became
          Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how
          useful that could be.

                     FERGUS
          What do you mean?

                     JUDE
          We've got some plans here. And we'll need
          a Mister Nobody to execute them.

                     FERGUS
          No way, Jude. I'm out.

                     JUDE
          You're never out, Fergus.

She looks at him hard. He looks away.

                     JUDE
          Maybe you don't care whether you die or
          not. But consider the girl, Fergus. The
          wee black chick.

He leaps up from the bed.



                                                          71.



                    FERGUS
          Leave her out of this.

                    JUDE
          Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche.
          You know we won't leave her out of this.
          But I'm glad to see you care.

She brings her lips close to his so they touch.

                    JUDE
          And I must admit I'm curious.

He grabs her hair and pulls her head back.

                    FERGUS
          What the fuck do you know, Jude?

She pulls a gun and sticks it between his teeth.

                    JUDE
          You fucking tell me, boy --

Fergus stares at her. Then says quietly:

                    FERGUS
          She's nobody. She likes me.

                    JUDE
          So I suppose a fuck is out of the
          question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No
          sudden moves. And not a whisper to her.
          You'll be hearing from us.

She kisses him briefly, with the gun at his temple.

                    JUDE
          Keep the faith.

She goes. Fergus stands in the darkness.

EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.

Fergus, walking toward the hair salon, flowers in his hand.

He stands outside watching, the flowers behind his back. Then
the chair turns and we see it is Jude.

Fergus freezes. He sees Jude looking at him, smiling
brightly, then talking back to Dil



                                                          72.



INT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.

                        JUDE
          He your boyfriend?

Jude, turning in the chair.

                        JUDE
          Lucky you.

INT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT.

                        DIL
          Carnations.

                        FERGUS
          What?

                        DIL
          He'd bring me carnations.

                        FERGUS
          So I got it wrong, then.

                        DIL
          Not at all, honey.

                        FERGUS
          Don't.

                        DIL
          Okay.

She smiles brightly at something behind Fergus. He turns and
sees Jude is there. Fergus stands, suddenly.

He throws some money on the table, grabs her arm, and frog-
marches her out.

                        FERGUS
          Come on.

                        DIL
          Why, honey --

                        FERGUS
          Come on.

                        DIL
          You gonna tell me why?

                        FERGUS
          No.



                                                              73.



As they pass Jude, she smiles.

EXT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT.

Outside the restaurant. Fergus marches Dil away.

                       DIL
          What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong
          --

                       FERGUS
          Not here.

They pass out of shot. In the background we see Jude rising.

INT. METRO - NIGHT.

Dil and Fergus making their way to their seats at the bar.

                       DIL
          You gonna tell me what it is?

A figure sitting down at the bar. It is Jude.

                       JUDE
          What was it?

                       DIL
          You know her, Jimmy?

                       JUDE
          Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?

                       FERGUS
          Dil, this is Jude.

                       DIL
          You following me?

                       JUDE
          Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to
          you, Dil?

                       DIL
          Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?

                       JUDE
          That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as
          they say.

                       DIL
          Absolutely. The younger the better.
          Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.



                                                    74.



                      JUDE
          Don't go looking for it, Dil.

                      DIL
          Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.

                      JUDE
          A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she,
          Jimmy?

                      DIL
          A girl has to have a bit of glamour.

                      JUDE
          Absolutely. Long as she can keep it.
          Isn't that right, James...

She leaves. Dil watches her go.

                      DIL
          It's her, isn't it?

                      FERGUS
          What's her?

                      DIL
          She's the thing you had to tell me.

                      FERGUS
          Kind of.

                      DIL
          I'm sorry, you know that? I'm really
          sorry.

She looks at Col

                      DIL
          You see that, Col?

                      COL
          Saw it, Dil.

                      DIL
          Fuck it, is what I say.

                      COL
          Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.

                      DIL
          Fucking men, Col --



                                                              75.



                       COL
          Fuck 'em.

There are tears in her eyes. She stands.

                       DIL
          And fuck you, Jimmy --

She staggers out of the pub. Fergus sits there. There is an
expression in Col's eyes that makes Fergus feel very, very
small.

                       COL
          You could always make it up to her.

                       FERGUS
          How?

                       COL
          When a girl runs out like that, she
          generally wants to be followed.

                       FERGUS
          She's not a girl, Col --

                       COL
          Whatever you say.

But Fergus rises and walks out.

EXT. METRO - NIGHT.

A figure standing down the alleyway, smoking. Fergus looks
toward it, but Jude is standing there, waiting.

                       JUDE
          She went that way --

Jude grabs his arm.

                       JUDE
          But you come with me.

She draws him down an alley where the same car is waiting.
They get inside.

ANOTHER CAR - BY THE PUB.

Dil, sitting inside a taxi watching Fergus and Jude getting
in the car.



                                                            76.



INT. CAR - NIGHT.

In the moving car. Jude is driving, Maguire next to her.
Fergus sits in the back.

                     FERGUS
          So it was you all the time.

                     MAGUIRE
          Who'd you think it was?

                     FERGUS
          I thought it was Dave.

                     MAGUIRE
          And who's Dave when he's at home?

                     FERGUS
          He's at home.

                     MAGUIRE
          Should blow you away, you know that?

                     FERGUS
          I know that.

Maguire stubs his cigarette out on Fergus's hand, then whacks
him on the teeth with his closed fist.

                     MAGUIRE
          I'm getting emotional. And I don't want
          to get fucking emotional -- you
          understand, Hennessy?

                     FERGUS
          I understand.

                     MAGUIRE
          Fuck you, too --

Jude drives. Fergus looks through the back window at the
street outside.

                     JUDE
          Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.

                     MAGUIRE
          That true, Fergus? You in love?

                     FERGUS
          Absolutely.



                                                             77.



                           MAGUIRE
             And what's she like between the sheets?

                           FERGUS
             Definitely unusual.

                           MAGUIRE
             And who is she?

                           FERGUS
             Just a girl.

                           MAGUIRE
             And you know what'll happen if you fuck
             up again, don't you?

                           FERGUS
             Aye, I do, Peter.

                           MAGUIRE
             Good.

EXT. REGENCY SQUARE - NIGHT.

The car draws to a halt in a sedate square. Several doors
down is the entrance to what looks like a sedate conservative
club.

In the car, Maguire turns off the engine. He nods toward the
building.

                           MAGUIRE
             So what do you think that is, Hennessy?

                           FERGUS
             A hotel?

                           MAGUIRE
             It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh?
             He visits his ladies on Tuesday and
             Thursday nights and Saturday mornings.
             His security's in the car beyond.

He nods toward a car, a Daimler, parked some distance away.
Fergus looks from the window to the car.

                           FERGUS
             Who is he?

                           MAGUIRE
             Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we
             would call a legitimate target.



                                                          78.



                       FERGUS
          Thank God for that.

                       MAGUIRE
          You being cynical, Hennessy?

                       FERGUS
          Hope not.

                       MAGUIRE
          Good. So what do you think?

                       FERGUS
          Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men
          are any good. And I presume you can't get
          in.

                       MAGUIRE
          Right.

                       FERGUS
          So it's on the street.

                       MAGUIRE
          Right.

                       FERGUS
          Kind of suicide, isn't it?

Jude turns around to look at him.

                       FERGUS
          But, then, I don't have a choice.

                       JUDE
          Och, you do, Fergie.

                       FERGUS
          Of course. I forgot.

                       JUDE
          Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.

Jude and Fergus get out of the car. They walk down the
street, down from the brothel-cum-club, where there is a cafe-
bar with some tables outside.

EXT. REGENCY SQUARE - NIGHT.

Fergus and Jude, crossing the street.

                       JUDE
          You keep your mind on the job, boy --



                                                              79.



                    FERGUS
          And then you'll leave her out of it?

                    JUDE
          Aye. Then we'll leave her be.

They take their seats by the tables. We can see the brothel
down the way.

                    JUDE
          He's arthritic. Takes him two minutes to
          get to the door.

She checks her watch. Fergus is sweating.

                    FERGUS
          And what if I say no?

                    JUDE
          You know what. Go.

Down by the brothel, the door swings open.

Fergus walks like any pedestrian down toward the brothel.
There is an old, portly gent in a City suit emerging from it.
The car by the pavement kicks into action and the door opens.

Fergus quickens his pace.

Jude, by the cafe, watches. Fergus, walking.

The gent makes his way, with gout-ridden slowness, across the
pavement, through the passersby, toward the car.

A burly security man emerging from the car, walking toward
the old gent.

Fergus reaches the car just before he does, and passes
between him and the open door. The old gent's stomach brushes
Fergus's elbow.

                    GENT
          Pardon me, young man --

Fergus walks on.

Jude, from the cafe, watches -- Fergus walking on, the old
man being eased with painstaking care inside the Daimler.
Then the door closing and the Daimler pulling off.

When the Daimler has passed Fergus, he turns around and walks
back.



                                                           80.



Jude smiles and leaps up as he approaches.

                       JUDE
          You were made for this.

                       FERGUS
          Was I?

                       JUDE
          Perfect.

                       FERGUS
          And what happens then?

                       JUDE
          We'll be on the other side. We'll move
          when you do.

                       FERGUS
          And what if you don't?

                       JUDE
          Fergus, I think you don't trust me.

                       FERGUS
          You may be right.

                       JUDE
          Stay late at your work tomorrow night and
          I'll bring you the gear.

Jude begins to walk away.

                       FERGUS
          Jude?

                       JUDE
          Yes?

                       FERGUS
          Who's the old geezer?

                       JUDE
          Some judge...

She walks off, crosses the road to Maguire, in the car.
Fergus turns around to see Dil in front of the cafe. She goes
inside; he follows.

                       FERGUS
          Why'd you follow me, Dil?



                                                              81.



                      DIL
          Was jealous, Jimmy.

She downs a drink and motions for another. She seems high.

                      FERGUS
          Shouldn't be, Dil

                      DIL
          Why shouldn't I be jealous?

There are tears streaming down her face. He takes his hand
and begins to wipe her face.

                      DIL
          Don't. My makeup.

She sits down; he joins her.

                      DIL
          She own you, Jimmy?

                      FERGUS
          Yes.

                      DIL
          She from Scotland too?

                      FERGUS
          You could say that.

                      DIL
          And you're not going to tell me more?

                      FERGUS
          I can't.

He wipes the tears from her face with a tissue then dabs the
tissue in her drink and wipes some more.

                      DIL
          What you doing, Jimmy?

                      FERGUS
          I'm not sure.

                      DIL
          Do you like me even a little bit?

                      FERGUS
          More than that.

Dil's face, staring at him.



                                                            82.



                           FERGUS
             Come on, let's go for a walk.

She allows herself to be led out.

EXT. HAIR SALON - NIGHT.

Dil and Fergus walking. Fergus stops her by the window.

                           FERGUS
             You do something for me, Dil?

                           DIL
             Anything.

                           FERGUS
             You'd do anything for me?

                           DIL
             Afraid so.

                           FERGUS
             You got the keys to the shop?

They walk inside.

INT. HAIR SALON - NIGHT.

Dil and Fergus standing in the darkness.

                           DIL
             You want another haircut, baby?

                           FERGUS
             No. Sit down.

He sits her down in one of the chairs.

                           FERGUS
             You'd do anything for me?

Dil nods.

                           DIL
             Anything.

Fergus takes up a scissors to snip at her hair. Her head
leaps back.

                           DIL
             No way --



                                                             83.



                        FERGUS
          You said anything, Dil

                        DIL
          A girl has to draw the line somewhere --

                        FERGUS
          Want to change you to a man, Dil...

She stares at him.

                        DIL
          Why?

                        FERGUS
          It's a secret.

                        DIL
          You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Yes.

                        DIL
          And you wouldn't leave me?

                        FERGUS
          No.

                        DIL
          You promise?

                        FERGUS
          I promise.

She takes a breath.

                        DIL
          Go on, then.

Fergus begins to cut.

CLOSE-UP ON DlL'S FACE as her hair is shorn. Tears stream
down her cheeks.

                        DIL
          You're no good at this, Jimmy.

                        FERGUS
          I'm sorry.

But he keeps cutting. He gives Dil a short, cropped military
cut like Jody's.



                                                              84.



                    DIL
          You want to make me look like him...

                    FERGUS
          No. Want to make you into something new.
          That nobody recognizes...

She looks in the mirror at it in the dark.

                    DIL
          Don't recognize myself, Jimmy.

INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.

Dil enters, with her new haircut. She goes to turn on the
light. He stops her hand.

                    FERGUS
          No.

She looks at her hand on his.

                    FERGUS
          Better in the dark.

Her fingers close around his.

                    DIL
          So it's true, then?

                    FERGUS
          What?

                    DIL
          You like me better like this.

                    FERGUS
          Yes.

She brings her lips to his neck. He lets them stay there. His
hands travel up to her blouse. He begins to undo the buttons.

                    DIL
          Oh, Jimmy --

Slowly the blouse slips down, exposing her male torso. She
falls down to her knees and tugs at his belt.

                    FERGUS
          No. No. Dil... get up...

He raises her to her feet and leads her toward the bed. She
stretches languorously down on it.



                                                              85.


He unzips her skirt slowly, and draws it off. She turns on
the bed sexily, her face to the mattress. She is wearing
suspender-belts underneath her skirt.

                        DIL
          Baby...

But Fergus stands and walks quietly over to the wardrobe
where the soldier's things are. Dil on the bed, slowly turns.

                        DIL
          What are you doing, honey...

We see Fergus from her point of view, coming toward her with
Jody's white cricket shirt, glowing eerily in the dark.

                        FERGUS
          Don't call me that --

                        DIL
          Sorry. What you doing?

Fergus draws her slowly up to a standing position.

                        FERGUS
          Try this on, Dil

He wraps the shirt around her.

                        DIL
          Why?

                        FERGUS
          For me.

                        DIL
          For you...

She kisses him.

EXT. SMALL HOTEL - NIGHT.

Fergus leading Dil, dressed in Jody's cricket clothes, down
the street and inside.

                        DIL
          Why are we going here, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Look on it like a honeymoon.



                                                              86.



INT. SMALL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT.

From above, we see the figures of Fergus and Dil, sleeping on
a double bed, both fully clothed. Fergus smokes, then puts
out the cigarette.

Time lapse. The light gradually fills the room. Fergus wakes.
Looks at the bedside clock, and very gingerly rises, puts on
his coat, and walks out.

EXT. SITE - EVENING.

A car pulls up at the site. Jude gets out. She has a satchel
in her hand.

INT. SITE - EVENING.

Fergus looking down a ladder-staircase at Jude.

                        JUDE
          You a handyman, Fergie?

                        FERGUS
          I take pride in my work.

                        JUDE
          I sincerely hope so.

Fergus climbs down a ladder to Jude; she hands him something
from the bag.

                        JUDE
          Tools of the trade.

She kisses him. Fergus looks at her expressionlessly.

                        JUDE
          And forget about the girl.

Fergus opens what Jude has given him -- looking inside. There
is a gun wrapped in an oilcloth.

INT. SMALL HOTEL - NIGHT.

Fergus enters. The room is empty. He calls.

                        FERGUS
          Dil?

No reply. He runs outside.



                                                              87.



EXT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.

Fergus looks up at her building, but the lights are off in
her flat. The sound of feet behind him. He turns and sees Dil
walking toward him, a bottle in her hand. He runs toward her.

                        FERGUS
          Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing
          here?

                        DIL
          I'm going home!

                        FERGUS
          Told you to stay in the hotel!

                        DIL
          Thought you was fooling me. Thought you
          was leaving me.

They are tussling in the darkness of the park. She is very
drunk.

                        FERGUS
          I had to go to work!

                        DIL
          Stayed all day in that room thinking
          every noise was you. There's something
          you're not telling me, Jimmy.

He takes her arm.

                        FERGUS
          Come on...

                        DIL
          No! I'm going home...

Fergus and Dil, on the stairs up to Dil's flat.

                        DIL
          So tell me.

                        FERGUS
          I was trying to get out of something.

                        DIL
          No! Tell me everything, Jimmy.

Fergus looks at her.



                                                             88.



                       FERGUS
             You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.

                       DIL
             You mean that?

                       FERGUS
             Yes.

And she suddenly faints into his arms. As if on cue.

                       FERGUS
             Stop it, would you?

There is no response. He shakes her.

                       FERGUS
             Give it over, Dil, for fuck's sake --

Still no response. He grows alarmed. He slaps her cheek. She
opens her eyes slowly.

                       DIL
             Sorry. I get nervous. I got this blood
             condition. Just help me inside, Jimmy,
             then I'll be all right.

INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.

He walks in holding her. Leans her against the wall, then
goes to the window to check the street outside.

She takes a large slug from a bottle of whiskey.

                       FERGUS
             You heard what I said, Dil?

                       DIL
             My pills...

She points weakly to a cabinet through the open door of the
bathroom.

                       FERGUS
             What pills?

                       DIL
             Prescription. For my condition.

                       FERGUS
             What condition?



                                                             89.



                         DIL
           My condition. Ennui.

He goes and gets the pills.

She takes a handful of pills. She drinks from the whiskey
bottle.

                         FERGUS
           Are you supposed to take that many?

                         DIL
           Only in times of extreme stress.

She walks around the room, drinking, then sits down.

                         DIL
           See, they all say good-bye sometime.
           'Cept for him.

She looks at the picture of Jody. Then she looks at Fergus.

                         FERGUS
           Are you all right, Dil?

                         DIL
           I will be.

She stares straight ahead, the bottle clutched in her hands
between her knees.

                         DIL
           Go on, then.

Fergus walks slowly toward the door.

                         FERGUS
           Good-bye, Dil

                         DIL
           Jimmy?

                         FERGUS
           What?

                         DIL
           Don't go like that.

She looks at him, standing up. Something incredibly
attractive about her.

                         DIL
           Can't help what I am.



                                                              90.



He walks slowly toward her. He kisses her, on the lips.

We see the photograph with the soldier's smiling face. Fergus
looks from it to her. She seems to be in a sweet narcotic
haze. She reaches out her hand and strokes his.

                       DIL
          Knew you had a heart...

Fergus sits down on the bed. Dil is lying back on it.

                       FERGUS
          Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your
          man.

                       DIL
          You knew which man?

                       FERGUS
          Your soldier.

                       DIL
          You knew my Jody?

She still strokes his hand. Her voice is dreamily slurred,
her eyes far away.

                       FERGUS
          Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast.
          Held him hostage for three days.

                       DIL
          You knew my Jody?

                       FERGUS
          Are you listening?

Dil smiles woozily.

                       DIL
          Yes.

                       FERGUS
          I got the order to shoot him. Before I
          could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and
          died.

                       DIL
          Died...

                       FERGUS
          Did you hear me?



                                                             91.



                        DIL
          You killed my Jody?

                        FERGUS
          In a manner of speaking.

                        DIL
          It was you...

She is not rational. She is smiling, far away somewhere.

                        FERGUS
          You should scream. You should beat my
          head off.

She woozily tries to hit him round the face.

                        DIL
          You killed my Jody

                        FERGUS
          No.

                        DIL
          You didn't.

                        FERGUS
          I suppose I tried.

                        DIL
          You tried.

                        FERGUS
          Don't you want to kill me?

Dil raises an unsteady hand and points it at him.

                        DIL
          Bang...

He strokes her cheek. She says very slowly and sleepily

                        DIL
          Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me,
          too.

                        FERGUS
          Okay.

Her eyes close. She falls into a deep sleep. Fergus looks
down at her, almost fondly.



                                                             92.



INT. DIL'S FLAT - MORNING.

They are lying on the bed together, fully clothed. Dil wakes.
She rises very quietly and goes to his coat, thrown across a
chair. She searches through the pockets and takes out the
gun.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING.

Jude in bed. An alarm sounds; she reaches to turn it off.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Dil takes several silk stockings out of a drawer and ties
them very securely to each corner of the brass bed. She ties
them round both of Fergus's feet, very gently, so as not to
wake him.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING.

Jude, in front of a mirror, getting ready.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

She draws one of Fergus's hands up, very gingerly, and ties
that securely to the upright. She ties the other and is
drawing it upward when he wakes. She jerks the silk stocking
so it is secure.

                       FERGUS
             What the fuck --

Dil speaks unnaturally quietly.

                       DIL
             So tell me what you're doing, Jimmy.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING.

Jude, fully dressed. She takes a gun from under the bed and
slips it in her handbag.

INT. DIL'S FLAT - MORNING.

Dil crouching beside Fergus, his gun in her hand.

                       DIL
             Didn't really listen last night. I heard
             but I didn't listen.

Fergus, staring at her. He tries to pull on the bindings.



                                                              93.



                     DIL
          That won't do you no good. Dil knows how
          to tie a body.

She stands up, still pointing the gun at Fergus.

                     DIL
          Wondered why you came on to me like that
          when you gave me the look.

                     FERGUS
          He asked me to see were you all right.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Jude on the street. Maguire's car pulls up rapidly and she
gets inside.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

                     DIL
          See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me.
          Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.

                     FERGUS
          Stop it, Dil --

                     DIL
          Just don't kick Dil and she'll be
          touched. Be nice to her and she'll be
          yours forever.

She looks at him, tears in her eyes.

                     DIL
          See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I
          can't do that. Yet.

                     FERGUS
          Let me go, Dil

He drags at his bindings.

                     DIL
          Why?

                     FERGUS
          Got to be somewhere.

                     DIL
          Try and go, then.



                                                              94.



EXT. STREET BY BROTHEL - DAY

The figure of the judge in the window. Outline of a woman.
Jude and Maguire are in the car, parked across the street.
They look toward a paper seller.

                       MAGUIRE
          Where the fuck is he? Christ --

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Fergus pulls furiously at his bindings.

                       FERGUS
          Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or
          they'll be here

                       DIL
          Let them come then.

IN THE CAR. OUTSIDE BROTHEL.

                       JUDE
          Can't stay here, Peter -- drive around
          once more --

He drives off.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Fergus collapsed back on the bed, exhausted.

                       DIL
          Just want your company for a little while
          longer...

EXT. STREET BY BROTHEL - DAY

Maguire's car driving round once more. No sign of Fergus.

                       MAGUIRE
          That fucker's dead --

                       JUDE
          No, we are.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Fergus strains and roars from the bed.

                       FERGUS
          You don't know what you're doing, Dil --



                                                              95.



                        DIL
          Never did...

MAGUIRE'S POINT OF VIEW -- the brothel door opening. The
elderly judge comes out. The car with his security men guns
up.

                        MAGUIRE
          Give me the shooter, Jude --

                        JUDE
          You're crazy --

                        MAGUIRE
          Give me the fucking shooter!

He grabs it from her pocket. Throws open the door and runs
across the street. Jude dives into the driver's seat.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Fergus, pulling at his bindings.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE BROTHEL.

The judge walking toward the open door of the car, held open
by his goon. Maguire, running toward him, gun in hand. The
goon sees him. Maguire shoots as he runs. Once, twice, three
times, four. The judge falls. The goon, hit in the arm, pulls
an Uzi and returns fire. Maguire hit, still shooting. Other
goons tear from the car. Mayhem, screaming. Jude hits the
pedal on her car and screeches off. Maguire, dead.

INT. DIL'S FLAT - DAY

Dil dressed in the soldier's cricket clothes. She looks like
a sweet little boy. She places a cassette in the tape deck --
"The Crying Game" song. She comes to the bed, and points the
gun at Fergus's head.

                        DIL
          You like me now, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          I like you, Dil --

                        DIL
          Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.

                        FERGUS
          More what?



                                                           96.



                       DIL
          More endearments.

                       FERGUS
          I like you, DIl

                       DIL
          Love me.

                       FERGUS
          Yes.

                       DIL
          Tell me you love me.

                       FERGUS
          Whatever you say, Dil.

                       DIL
          Then say it.

                       FERGUS
          Love you, Dil.

                       DIL
          You do?

                       FERGUS
          Yeah.

                       DIL
          What would you do for me?

                       FERGUS
          Anything.

She begins to cry and lays the gun gently on his chest.

                       DIL
          Say it again.

                       FERGUS
          I'd do anything for you, Dil.

She pulls on his bindings to release him.

EXT. STREET.

Two police cars, sirens wailing.



                                                              97.



INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Dil's face, close to Fergus's, as the stockings that bound
his hands are nearly undone.

                        DIL
          And you'll never leave me?

                        FERGUS
          Never.

                        DIL
          I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice
          to hear it.

His arm is free. He strokes her hair.

                        FERGUS
          I'm sorry, Dil.

She shudders with weeping. The music of the song plays in the
background.

Jude walking through the open door, arms extended, holding a
gun.

                        JUDE
          You stupid shit -- Once was bad enough.
          But twice.

Dil rises from the bed and points her gun at Jude.

                        DIL
          You didn't knock, honey --

Dil fires, hits Jude. Jude falls and is writhing on the
floor.

                        FERGUS
          Dil!

                        JUDE
          Get that thing off me, Fergus --

Dil walks closer, holding the gun and pointing it at Jude.

                        DIL
          What was that she called you, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Fergus.



                                                             98.



                    DIL
          What's Fergus?

                    FERGUS
          It's my name, Dil --

                    DIL
          What happened to Jimmy?

                    JUDE
          I said get it off me, Fergus --

Jude, on the floor, reaches for her gun. Manages to grab it.

                    DIL
          What's she going to do, Jimmy? She going
          to blow you away?

Dil shoots again, like a child, playing with a toy. She hits
Jude in her gun shoulder. Jude spins one way, the gun the
other.

                    DIL
          Was she there too? When you got my Jody?

Fergus screams


                    FERGUS
          Dil!!!

                    DIL
          I asked you a question, honey -- were you
          there too --

                    JUDE
          You sick bitch --

As she raises the gun, Dil shoots her repeatedly, saying:

                    DIL
          You was there, wasn't you? You used those
          tits and that ass to get him, didn't you?

Fergus screams from the bed. He rips free his other arm. Dil
shoots Jude in the throat, and she falls dead, covered in
blood. Dil turns the gun on Fergus.

                    DIL
          She was there, wasn't she?



                                                          99.



                        FERGUS
          She was --

                        DIL
          And she used her tits and that cute
          little ass to get him, didn't she?

                        FERGUS
          Yes.

                        DIL
          Tell me what she wore.

                        FERGUS
          Can't remember...

Dil points the gun at him, squeezing on the trigger. Then she
stops.

                        DIL
          Can't do it, Jimmy. He won't let me.

She looks at the picture; walks over and sits down in front
of it.

                        DIL
          You won't let me, Jody --

She raises the gun and places it in her mouth. Fergus takes
it gently from her mouth and places it on the table. He lifts
her up by the shoulders.

                        FERGUS
          You've got to go now, Dil --

                        DIL
          Do I?

                        FERGUS
          Yes. Now.

                        DIL
          Am I in trouble, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Not if you go.

                        DIL
          Will I see you again?

                        FERGUS
          You will, Dil



                                                             100.



                        DIL
          Promise?

                        FERGUS
          I promise.

                        DIL
          Where am I to go, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          The Metro.

                        DIL
          Meet Col --

                        FERGUS
          Yes. Say hello to Col --

He leads her out the door. Fergus goes back into the room,
past Jude's body. Looks out the window to where he can see
Dil staggering down the street, through the crowds that have
gathered. The wail of police sirens coming closer. He watches
Dil run off, with her funny walk. Then looks down and sees
the cop cars pushing through the knot of people around the
house. He picks up the gun, wipes it with a rag to remove
Dil's fingerprints. He turns to the picture of the soldier;
talks to it.

                        FERGUS
          You should have stayed at home.

He sits in the chair by the window, waiting.

                                                FADE TO BLACK.

INT. PRISON VISITING ROOM - DAY

FADE UP to reveal a large interior, with light streaming in
the windows. Large barred doors open and a group of women
come through, with parcels, children in tow, etc. Among them
is Dil, looking resplendent. She walks past the rows of
convicts with their families, up to a glass cage, where
Fergus sits, waiting.

                        DIL
          Got you the multivitamins and the iron
          tablets, hon --

                        FERGUS
          Don't call me that --



                                                        101.



                        DIL
          Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are
          magnesium supplement --

                        FERGUS
          Stop it, Dil --

                        DIL
          I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm
          counting the days. Two thousand three
          hundred and thirty-four left.

                        FERGUS
          Thirty-five.

                        DIL
          I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the
          leap year. What am I supposed to call you
          then, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Fergus.

                        DIL
          Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life -
          -

                        FERGUS
          Please, Dil --

                        DIL
          Can't help it. You're doing time for me.
          No greater love, as the man says. Wish
          you'd tell me why.

                        FERGUS
          As the man said, it's in my nature.

                        DIL
          What's that supposed to mean?

She shakes her head.

                        FERGUS
          Well, there was this scorpion, you see.
          And he wants to go across the river. But
          he can't swim. So he goes to this frog,
          who can swim, and he says to him, "Excuse
          me, Mr. Froggy..."



                                                           102.



CAMERA PULLS BACK, and as Fergus tells the story of the
scorpion and the frog, the music comes up -- "Stand By Your
Man."

                                                    FADE OUT.

           GORDON (V.O)
           Harvey Dent was needed. He was
           everything Gotham has been crying
           out for. He was...a hero. Not the
           hero we deserved - the hero we
           needed. Nothing less than a knight,
           shining...

                         
          The sound of cracking. Splintering. A shape appears, in ice.
          The shape of a BAT. The ice disintegrates...

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREET - DAY


                         
          Gordon stands before a massive picture of Harvey Dent.

                          GORDON
           But I knew Harvey Dent. I was...his
           friend. And it will be a very long
           time before someone inspires us the
           way he did.
          Gordon, choked with emotion, gathers the papers of his
          eulogy.
           I believed in Harvey Dent.
          And we FADE TO BLACK.

          INT. LAND CRUISER JOSTLING OVER UNEVEN TERRAIN - DAY

          Three Hooded Men guarded by East European Militia. A third
          Militia drives. Next to him is a nervous, bespectacled man.

                         

          EXT. AIRSTRIP, EASTERN EUROPE - DAY

          An airstrip overlooking a grey city rocked by artillery
          fire. A bland CIA Operative, flanked by Special Forces Men,
          stands in front of a commuter plane. CIA Man watches the
          Land Cruiser pull up, hard. The Militia Men jump out of the
          vehicle.
          The Driver shoves the bespectacled man in front of the CIA
          Man.

           2.

                         

                         

                          CIA MAN
           Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA.
          Dr. Pavel nods, nervous. CIA Man hands the Driver a
          briefcase.

                         

                          DRIVER
           He wasn't alone.
          CIA Man, confused, spots the Hooded Men. He turns to Dr.
          Pavel.

                         

                          CIA MAN
           You don't get to bring friends.

           DR. PAVEL

                          (SHAKEN)
           They are not my friends.

                          DRIVER
           Don't worry, no charge for them.

                          CIA MAN
           Why would I want them?

                          DRIVER
           They were trying to grab your
           prize. (Smiles.) They work for the
           mercenary. The masked man.

                         

                          CIA MAN

                          (EXCITED)
           Bane?
          The Driver nods. CIA Man turns to his Special Forces Men.

                         

                          CIA MAN
           Get 'em on board - I'll call it in.

                         

                         

          EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - DAY

          The commuter plane struggles over snow-capped mountains.

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The three Hooded Men kneel by the cargo door, handcuffed.
          CIA Man grabs Hooded Man 1.

                          CIA MAN
           What are you doing in the middle of
           my operation?

           3.

                         
          Hooded Man 1 says nothing. CIA Man pulls out a handgun.
           The flight plan I just filed with
           the Agency lists me, my men, and
           Dr. Pavel here. But only one of
           you.
          CIA Man opens the cargo door. Special Forces hang Hooded Man
          1 out into the howling wind - CIA Man shouts above the wind.

                         

                          CIA MAN

           FIRST ONE TO TALK GETS TO STAY ON
           MY AIRCRAFT! (Cocks weapon.)

           SO...WHO PAID YOU TO GRAB DR.

           PAVEL?!

                         
          Nothing. CIA Man fires out the open door and the Special
          Forces yank Hooded Man 1 back in, clubbing him quiet.

                          CIA MAN

           HE DIDN'T FLY SO GOOD! WHO WANTS TO

           TRY NEXT?!

                         
          The Soldiers grab Hooded Man 2, hang him out the door.

                          CIA MAN

           TELL ME ABOUT BANE! WHY DOES HE

           WEAR THE MASK?!

                         
          The prisoner says nothing. CIA Man presses the gun to the
          man's hood - he cocks the gun...nothing.

                          CIA MAN

           LOT OF LOYALTY FOR A HIRED GUN!

                         

           THIRD PRISONER (O.S.)
           Or he's wondering why someone would
           shoot a man before throwing him out
           of an aeroplane.

                         
          CIA Man turns to the Third Prisoner. Shuts the cargo door.

                          CIA MAN
           Wiseguy, huh? At least you can
           talk. Who are you?

                         

                          THIRD PRISONER
           We are nothing. We are the dirt
           beneath your feet. And no one cared
           who I was until I put on the
           mask...

                         
          CIA Man, wary, approaches the Third Prisoner - pulls off his
          hood, revealing a dark mask with a breathing apparatus. The
          eyes behind it are cold. Still. This is Bane.

           4.

                         

                         

                          BANE
           Who we are does not matter. What
           matters is our plan.

                          CIA MAN

                          (FASCINATED)
           If I pull this off, will you die?

                          BANE
           It would be extremely painful.

                         

                          CIA MAN
           You're a big guy -

                          BANE
           For you.

                         

                          CIA MAN

                          (UNNERVED)
           Was being caught part of your plan?

                          BANE
           Of course. Dr. Pavel refused our
           offer in favor of yours. We had to
           know what he told you about us.

           DR. PAVEL
           Nothing! I said nothing!

                         

                          CIA MAN
           Why not just ask him?

                          BANE
           He would not have told us.

                         

                          CIA MAN
           You have methods.

                          BANE
           Him, I need healthy. You present no
           such problem.
          CIA Man laughs for the Special Forces' benefit. A heavy bass
          tone is rising. The Sergeant looks out the window.

                         

                         

          EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUOUS

          The commuter plane is dwarfed by a massive transport plane
          looming over it, dangerously close...

           5.

                         

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          The plane lurches. The noise is building.

                          SERGEANT
           Sir?

                         

                          CIA MAN
           Well congratulations, you got
           yourselves caught. What's the next
           step of your master plan?

                         

                          BANE
           Crashing this plane...

                         

          EXT. MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The ramp of the transport opens... Four men leap out on
          tethers - dropping towards the commuter plane, two each
          side...

                         

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          The Spacial Forces react to the turbulence from the plane
          above. CIA Man looks at Bane.

                          BANE

                          (RISING)
           With no survivors.
          A Special Forces soldier spins around - an Armed Man is
          outside the window. Bang -

                         

                         

          EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUOUS

          Two men shoot through the windows, the other two attach
          grapples to the fuselage - give the thumbs up - hoists start
          to pull and the tail of the commuter plane is lifted,
          unnaturally.

                         

          INT. COCKPIT, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          The Pilots battle the controls as the plane tilts forward.

           6.

                         

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          Like lightning, Bane has the CIA Man is his handcuffed arms,
          legs wrapped around a seat back, The entire cabin upends.
          Tumbling chaos - Soldiers falling - Bane cracks CIA Man's
          neck and drops him onto the Sergeant - they tumble down the
          plane, smashing into the cockpit door with a terminal thud.
          Dr. Pavel, strapped in, pushes against the seat in front of
          him - the plane vibrates, trying to tear itself apart.

                         

                         

          EXT. ATLAS MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

          The men climb the tail of the smaller plane as it dangles
          helplessly above the mountains. Its wings shear off.

                         

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          Bane breaks his handcuffs as if they were plastic, then
          opens his legs and drops down the cabin, somersaulting
          gracefully and using his arms to stop himself halfway down,
          by Dr. Pavel.

                         

          EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUOUS

          The men attach explosives to the tail, then jump away,
          swinging out as the tail explodes.

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          An explosion takes off the rear door of the cabin - the
          Armed Men drop through the smoke on cables.
          A body bag is lowered into the cabin. Bane lies it on the
          seat backs next to Dr. Pavel and unzips it to reveal a body
          the same age and build as Dr. Pavel.

                         
          Bane rips Dr. Pavel's sleeve - pulls out a length of
          surgical tubing - pushes a needle into Dr. Pavel's arm -
          runs the tube to the body's arm... Dr. Pavel watches,
          horrified, as Bane starts compressions on the body's chest,
          drawing Dr. Pavel's blood across the tube and into the
          body...

                         
          An Armed Man pulls Hooded Man 1 up through the cabin and
          out. Bane stops Hooded Man 2.

           7.

                         

                         

                          BANE
           Friend. They expect one of us in
           the wreckage.
          The man nods, unhooks himself, takes Bane's arm.

                         

                          HOODED MAN 2
           Have we started the fire?

                          BANE

                          (NODS)
           The fire rises.
          Hooded Man 2 hands Bane his line. Bane clips it around Dr.
          Pavel, takes out a knife and cuts Dr. Pavel's seat belt. Dr.
          Pavel panics, flails. Bane takes his arms. Gentle.

                         

                          BANE
           Calm, Doctor. Now is not time for
           fear...
          Bane slides Dr. Pavel out of his seat. They hang in the
          vertical, windblown cabin. Bane takes out a detonator.

                         

                          BANE
           That comes later.
          Bane presses the detonator - the cabin drops from around
          them, revealing the terrifying drop to the peaks below. Dr.
          Pavel screams as they are hoisted up towards the transport,
          and we -

          EXT. GOTHAM - EVENING

          Drifting over the vast city...

           MAYOR (V.O.)
           Harvey Dent Day may not be our
           oldest public holiday...
          ...moving past the enormous Gotham Bridge...

           MAYOR (V.O.)
           But we're here tonight because it's
           one of the most important...
          ...over the Gotham river to the Palisades on the far side...

           8.

                         

                         

           MAYOR (V.O.)
           Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand
           against organized crime and, yes,
           ultimately, his sacrifice, have
           made Gotham a safer place than it
           was at the time of his death, eight
           years ago...
          ...finding a party in the grounds of Wayne Manor. The Mayor
          addresses the wealthy and powerful of Gotham.

                         

                          MAYOR
           This city has seen a historic
           turnaround. No city is without
           crime. But this city is without
           organized crime because the Dent
           Act gave law enforcement teeth in
           its fight against the mob. Now
           people are talking about repealing
           the Dent Act. And to them I
           say...not on my watch.
          Enthusiastic applause as the Mayor wraps up.
           I want to thank the Wayne
           Foundation for hosting this event.
           I'm told Mr. Wayne couldn't be here
           tonight, but I'm sure he's with us
           in spirit...

                         
          High above, on a darkened balcony, a lone figure. Watching.

           MAYOR (O.S)
           Now I'm going to give way to an
           important voice...

                         
          Down below at the bar, Commissioner Gordon examines some
          sheets of densely written paper. A Congressman muscles in.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Commissioner.

                         

                          GORDON
           Congressman.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of
           these things?
          Gordon shakes his head. Gordon's Deputy Commissioner, Foley,
          cuts in.

           9.

                         

                         

                          FOLEY
           No one has. Not in years.

           MAYOR (O.S)
           He can tell you about the bad old
           days, when the criminals and
           corrupt ran this town with such a
           tight grasp that people put their
           faith in a murderous thug in a mask
           and a cape. A thug who showed his
           true nature when he betrayed the
           trust of this great man - (Turns to
           picture of Dent.) And murdered him
           in cold blood.
          The Congressman watches a tray of canapés breeze past, then
          grabs the ass of the maid carrying them. She freezes.

                         

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Sweetheart, not so fast with the
           chow.

                          MAID
           (turns, tight smile)
           Shrimp balls?
          The Congressman grabs two. The Maid moves off. The
          Congressman glances down at Gordon's papers.

                         

           MAYOR (O.S)
           Jim Gordon can tell you the truth
           about Harvey Dent...

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Jesus, Gordon, is that your speech?
           We're gonna be here all night.

                          GORDON
           Maybe the truth about Harvey isn't
           so simple, Congressman.

                         

           MAYOR (O.S)
           But I'll let him tell you himself -
           Commissioner Gordon?
          Applause. Gordon approaches the mike. Looks down at his long
          speech. Thinks.

                          GORDON
           The truth...?
          INSERT CUT: Harvey Dent, face half destroyed, threatens
          Gordon's son with a handgun.

           10.

                         

                         
          Gordon surveys the audience. Deciding.
           I have written a speech telling the
           truth about Harvey Dent...
          Gordon folds up his speech.
           Maybe the time isn't right...
          Gordon stuffs the papers inside his jacket. The Congressman
          mutters under his breath.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Thank Christ for that...

                          GORDON
           Maybe right now all you need to
           know is that there are a thousand
           inmates in Blackgate Prison as a
           direct result of the Dent Act.
           These are violent criminals,
           essential cogs in the organized
           crime machine that terrorized
           Gotham for so long. Maybe, for now,
           all I should say about Harvey
           Dent's death is this...it has not
           been for nothing.
          The figure on the balcony turns back into the mansion.
          People clap as Gordon leaves the mike. Gordon approaches
          Foley.

                         

                          GORDON
           The second shift reports in?

                          FOLEY
           On your desk. But you should put in
           some more time with the Mayor -

                          GORDON
           That's your department.

                         
          Gordon heads for the line of town cars in the gravel drive.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Anyone shown him the crime stats?

                          FOLEY
           He goes by his gut, and it
           continues to bother him, whatever
           the numbers.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Must be popular with the wife.

           11.

                         

                         

                          FOLEY
           Not really. She took the kids and
           moved to Cleveland.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           He'll have plenty of time for
           visits. Mayor's dumping him in the
           spring.

                          FOLEY
           Really? He's a hero.

                         

                          CONGRESSMAN
           War hero. This is peacetime. Stay
           smart, the job's yours.

                         

                         

          INT. KITCHENS, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Our Maid dives into the bustle of Wayne Manor below stairs -
          Caterers and Maids, Wait Staff. She overhears another Maid.

                          MAID 2
           They say he never leaves the East
           Wing.

                          MAID 3
           I heard he had an accident - that
           he's disfigured.

                         
          The other Maids signal her to be quiet. All the chatter has
          died. Alfred has entered the kitchen.

                          ALFRED
           Mr. Till, why are your people using
           the main stairs?
          Alfred places a glass of water on a tray next to a covered
          plate. Picks up the tray, looks around the chaotic kitchen.

                         

                          ALFRED
           Where's Mrs. Bolton?

                          MAID
           She's up at the bar, sir. Can I
           help?

                         
          Alfred looks at the Maid. Hands her a key and the tray.

                          ALFRED
           The East drawing room. Unlock the
           door, place the tray on the table,
           lock the door again. Nothing more.

           12.

                         

                         
          The Maid nods. Takes the tray.

                         

          INT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Following the Maid through the empty house. She comes to the
          large oak door to the East Wing. Unlocks it...

                         

          INT. DRAWING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

          The room is dark, quiet. The Maid places the tray on the
          table. She looks at the inner door opposite. It is ajar...

                         

          INT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Alfred talks to an elegant woman, thirties, Miranda Tate.

                          ALFRED
           I'm sorry, Miss Tate, but I've
           tried. He won't see you.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           It's important, Mr. Pennyworth.
          Her accent is European. Hard to place.

                          ALFRED
           Mr. Wayne is as determined to
           ignore important things as trivial
           ones.

           MALE VOICE (O.S.)
           Don't take it personally, Miranda.

                         
          They turn to see a man in his fifties. Daggett.

                          DAGGETT
           Everyone knows Wayne's holed up in
           there with eight-inch nails, peeing
           into Mason jars. (To Alfred.) Good
           of you to let me on the grounds.

                          ALFRED
           The Dent Act is about all Gotham.
           Even you, Mr. Daggett. Miss Tate,
           always a pleasure.
          Alfred turns and walks off. Daggett smiles, glib.

           13.

                         

                         

                          DAGGETT
           Why waste your time talking to the
           man who threw away your investment
           on some save-the-world vanity
           project? He can't help you get your
           money back. But I can.

                          MIRANDA
           I could try explaining that a
           save-the-world project, vain or
           not, is worth investing in,
           whatever the return. I could try,
           Mr. Daggett, but you understand
           only money and the power you think
           it buys, so why waste my time,
           indeed?

                         
          She walks away. Daggett watches her go.

                         

          INT. DRAWING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

          Close on the dinner tray. We hear a labored step approach.
          Bruce Wayne appears, leaning on a cane. Gaunt. Grey temples.
          He lifts the lid of his dinner, then freezes, hearing
          something. He slowly limps into the next room...

                         

          INT. SITTING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR, CONTINUOUS


                         
          The Maid looks at framed photographs of Rachel, Thomas and
          Martha Wayne. Some are half-burned. She notices an archery
          target, arrows stuck in it. She reaches out. WHAM! An arrow
          sticks into the target - the Maid spins around, flustered.
          Wayne, at the other end of the long room, lowers a composite
          bow. Picks up his cane.

                          MAID
           I'm, I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.
           It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

                         
          Wayne nods, gently. Limps towards her.

                          MAID
           Although you don't have the long
           nails... (Nervous laugh.) Or facial
           scars...
          She trails off, embarrassed. Coy. She seems very young.

                          WAYNE
           Is that what they say about me?

           14.

                         

                          MAID
           It's just that...nobody sees you...

                         
          Wayne approaches slowly. He nods at her pearl necklace.

                          WAYNE
           That's a beautiful necklace.
           Reminds me of the one that belonged
           to my mother. It can't be the same
           one - her pearls are in this safe -
          He reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the
          bureau, revealing a safe door...
           - which the manufacturer clearly
           explained is uncrackable.

                         
          ...which swings open with an awkward creak.

                          MAID
           Oops. No one told me it was
           uncrackable.

                         
          The Maid suddenly seems more confident. Older.

                          WAYNE
           I'm afraid I can't let you take
           those.

                         
          She smiles at him. Moves towards him.

                          MAID
           Look, you wouldn't hit a woman any
           more than I would beat up a
           cripple.
          She kicks his cane from under him, smashes him down.
           Of course, sometimes exceptions
           have to be made.

                         
          The Maid vaults onto the bureau and up to a high window.
           Goodnight, Mr. Wayne.
          She flips backwards through the window. Wayne smiles, then
          rocks forward on his good leg and rises with athletic grace.
          He looks at the safe, notices something. Powder...

          Moving toward the line of town cars, the Maid pulls off her
          white apron, cuffs and collar, leaving a black dress and
          pearls. A Valet hurries to open a car door for her - she
          slips into a town car...beside the Congressman.

           15.

                         

                         

                          MAID
           Can I have a ride?
          The Congressman, a little tipsy, looks at her hungrily.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           You read my mind.

                         

          INT. EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - LATER


                         
          Alfred enters, to find Wayne kneeling at the safe.

                          ALFRED
           Miss Tate was asking to see you
           again.

                         

                          WAYNE
           She's very persistent.

                          ALFRED
           And quite lovely, in case you were
           wondering.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I wasn't.

                          ALFRED
           What are you doing?

                         

                          WAYNE
           Examining print dust. We've been
           robbed.

                          ALFRED
           And this is your idea of raising
           the alarm?

                          WAYNE

                          (SHRUGS)
           She took the pearls. Tracking
           device and all.

                          ALFRED
           She?

                         

                          WAYNE
           One of the maids, perhaps you
           should stop letting them in this
           side of the house.

           16.

                         

                         

                          ALFRED
           Perhaps you should learn to make
           your own bed, then. Why are you
           dusting for prints?

                         

                          WAYNE
           I'm not. She was.

                         

          EXT. ROOFTOP, MAJOR CRIMES UNIT - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Gordon brings a stack of files against the air duct, settles
          to read. Next to him is a rusty, broken searchlight.

           YOUNG VOICE (O.S.)
           Sir?

                         
          A young Cop is standing there. This is Blake.

                          BLAKE
           I didn't want to bother you up
           here, but they're looking for you.

                         

                          GORDON
           What's the problem, son?

                          BLAKE
           Congressman Gilly's wife's been
           calling. He hasn't made it home
           from the Wayne Foundation event.

                          GORDON
           That's a job for the police?

                          BLAKE
           Sir, I've been a cop for a year and
           I've only logged half a dozen
           arrests. When you and Dent cleaned
           the streets you cleaned 'em good.
           Pretty soon we'll be chasing
           overdue library books.
          Gordon smiles at this. Blake looks at his stack of files.

                          BLAKE
           But here you are. Like we're still
           at war...

                          GORDON
           Old habits.

           17.

                         

                         

                          BLAKE
           Or instinct.

                          GORDON
           What's your name, son?

                         

                          BLAKE
           Blake, sir.

                          GORDON
           You have something you want to ask
           me, Officer Blake?

                          BLAKE
           It's that night. This night, eight
           years ago. The night Dent died.

                         

                          GORDON
           What about it?

                          BLAKE
           The last confirmed sighting of the
           Batman. He murders those people,
           takes out two SWAT teams, breaks
           Dent's neck...then just vanishes?

                          GORDON
           I'm not hearing a question, son.

                         
          Blake shifts uneasily. Then looks at Gordon.

                          BLAKE
           Don't you want to know who we was?
          Gordon turns to look at the broken searchlight. He brushes
          his fingers across its rusted shell.

                          GORDON
           I know exactly who he was. (Turns
           to Blake.) He was Batman.

                         
          Gordon walks past Blake, heading for the stairs.

           GORDON (O.S.)
           Let's go see about the
           Congressman's wife...

           18.

                         

          INT. EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - MORNING

          Alfred takes his tray into the bedroom. The bed is empty.

                         

                          ALFRED
           Master Wayne?
          Alfred's voice echoes through the vast mansion. No reply.

                         

                         

          INT. STUDY, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Alfred hits three notes on the piano. The bookcase opens.

                         

                         

          INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS

          Alfred descends into the caverns beneath Wayne Manor.

                         

          INT. BATCAVE - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Alfred walks through the arches as the stone floor starts to
          lower, becoming a ramp. At the bottom, Alfred is level with
          a series of dark slate obelisks - a bridge over the water to
          where Wayne sits at a computer atop a massive slate cube.

                         

                          ALFRED
           You haven't been down here in a
           long time...

                          WAYNE
           Just trying to find out more about
           our jewel thief. I ran her prints
           from the photos she handled -
          Wayne pulls up a mug shot - a fat, male armed-robbery
          suspect.
           - but she was wearing someone
           else's fingerprints. She's good.

                          ALFRED
           She may be. But we have the trace
           on the necklace.

                         

                          WAYNE
           We do, so I cross-referenced the
           address she went back to with
           police data on high-end
           B-and-E's...

                         
          Wayne hits a key. A photograph of the Maid appears.
           Selina Kyle. The databases are full
           of close calls, tips from fences...

           19.

                         
          Newspaper headlines appear -

          THE CAT STRIKES AGAIN, POLICE SUSPECT 'CAT' BURGLAR IN JEWEL

          HEIST.

                         

                          WAYNE
           She's good, but the ground is
           shrinking beneath her feet.

                         

                          ALFRED
           We should send the police before
           she fences the pearls.

                          WAYNE
           She won't. She likes them too much.
           And they weren't what she was
           after.

                          ALFRED
           What was she after?

                         

                          WAYNE
           My fingerprints. There was printer
           toner mixed with graphite on the
           safe. Gives you a good pull, and
           it's untraceable.

                         

                          ALFRED
           Fascinating. Maybe you should
           exchange notes over coffee.

                          WAYNE
           Now you're trying to set me up with
           a jewel thief?

                          ALFRED
           At this point, sir, I would set you
           up with a chimpanzee if I thought
           it would bring you back into the
           world.

                          WAYNE
           There's nothing out there for me.

                         

                          ALFRED
           And that's the problem. You hung up
           the cape and cowl, but never moved
           on. You won't get out there and
           find a life. Find someone -

                         

                          WAYNE

                          (BITTER)
           I did find someone, Alfred.

           20.

                         

                         

                          ALFRED
           I know. And then you lost them.
           That's part of living, sir. But
           you're not living - you're waiting.
           Hoping for things to go bad again.

                         
          Wayne says nothing.
           Remember when you left Gotham?
           Before all this. Before Batman.
           Seven years you were gone. Seven
           years I waited. Hoping that you
           wouldn't come back.
          Wayne looks at Alfred. Not understanding.
           Every year I took my holiday. I'd
           go to Florence. There's a café by
           the Arno... Any fine evening I
           would sit there and order a Fernet
           Branca...
          INSERT CUT: Alfred seated in a café sipping his drink...
           I had a fantasy. I liked to imagine
           that one day I'd look across the
           tables, and see you. Sitting there
           with your wife. Perhaps some kids.
           You wouldn't say anything to me, or
           me to you, but we'd both
           know...that you'd made it. That you
           were happy.

                         
          INSERT CUT: Alfred spots a couple at another table and looks
          closer, hopeful. But they are strangers.
           I never wanted you to come back to
           Gotham. I knew there was nothing
           there for you but pain and tragedy,
           and I wanted more for you than
           that. I still do.
          Alfred leaves Wayne to his cave. His bats.

                         

                         

          EXT. WATER TREATMENT FACILITY - DAY

          Blake and his partner, Ross, get out of their patrol car. A
          DWP Man leads them down a long concrete trough.

                         

                          DWP MAN
           They wash up a couple times a
           month. More when in gets colder -
           homeless sheltering in the tunnels.
           We had to pull him to clear the
           basin, but other than that we
           didn't touch him...

           21.

                         

                         
          They come out by the catchment basin. Above the grille lies
          a body - a teenage boy. Blake looks down at him. Freezes.

                          ROSS
           What?

                         

                          BLAKE
           Name's Jimmy. He's at St.
           Swithin's. (Off look.) The boys
           home where I...I coach some ball.

                         

                         

          EXT. ST. SWITHIN'S HOME FOR BOYS - DAY

          Blake looks up at the shabby building.

                         

                         

          INT. ST. SWITHIN'S HOME FOR BOYS - MOMENTS LATER

          Blake is talking to Father Reilly.

                          FATHER REILLY
           Jimmy hadn't been here for months.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Why?

                          FATHER REILLY
           You know why, Blake - he aged out.
           We don't have the resources to keep
           boys on after sixteen -

                          BLAKE
           The Wayne Foundation gives money
           for that -

                         

                          FATHER REILLY
           Not for two years now.

                          BLAKE
           He has a brother here, right?

                         

                          FATHER REILLY
           Mark. I'll tell him.

                          BLAKE
           I'd like to, if that's okay.

           22.

                         

                         

          EXT. PLAYGROUND, ST. SWITHIN'S - MOMENTS LATER

          Father Reilly watches as Blake sits with Mark - ten.

                          BLAKE
           I'm sorry.

                         
          Mark nods slowly. Staring straight ahead.

                          BLAKE
           What was he doing in the tunnels?

                         

                          MARK
           Lot of guys been going down the
           tunnels when they age out. Say you
           can live down there. Say there's
           work down there.

                         

                          BLAKE
           What kind of work are you gonna
           find in the sewers?

                          MARK
           More than you can find up here, I
           guess.
          Blake considers this. Troubled.

                         

                         

          INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

          Selina Kyle, in a little black dress, walks in with a drunk
          in a Hawaiian shirt. She sits him on a bar stool - walks
          over to a table where a neatly dressed man, Stryver, sits.

                         

                          STRYVER
           You brought a date?

                          SELINA
           I like having someone around to
           open doors for me.

                         
          Selina glances around. Things scattered throughout the bar.
          Jumpy. Selina hands an envelope to Stryver.

                          SELINA
           Right hand. No partials.
          Stryver slides a transparency out of the envelope. Holds it
          up to the light. Four perfect fingerprint transfers.

           23.

                         

                         

                          STRYVER
           Very nice.
          He pockets the envelope.

                          SELINA
           Not so fast, handsome. You got
           something for me?

                          STRYVER
           Oh, yes.

                         
          Stryver signals a Thug who locks the door. Another Thug
          joins them at the table. Selina smiles.

                          SELINA
           I don't know what you're going to
           do with Mr. Wayne's prints...but
           I'm guessing you'll need his thumb.
          As Stryver checks the envelope again -

                          SELINA
           You don't count so good, huh?

                          STRYVER
           I count fine.
          The Second Thug puts a gun to Selina's head.

                         

                          STRYVER
           In fact, I'm counting to ten right
           now...
          Selina looks in his eyes. The Thug cocks his gun. She
          blinks.

                          SELINA
           Okay, okay -

                         
          She reaches for her purse. The Thug stops her, reaches in
          himself - pulls out a cellphone. Slides it across the table.

                          SELINA
           My friend is waiting outside. Just
           hit 'send'...

                         
          Stryver looks at the phone. Hits 'send'. Selina sizes up her
          options. A knock on the door. Second Thug hides his gun. The
          door opens - a young woman, Jen. She enters, cheerful, spots
          Selina. Pulls out an envelope, looks around.

           24.

                         

                         

                          JEN
           Place is a little dead.

                          SELINA
           (takes envelope, tense)
           It'll liven up in a minute, trust
           me.

                          JEN
           Everything okay?

                         

                          SELINA
           Great. Catch you later.
          Jen leaves. Stryver checks the envelope. Satisfied.

                          SELINA
           It would've been a lot easier to
           just give me what we agreed.

                          STRYVER
           We can't have loose ends. And even
           in that dress, no one's going to
           miss you.

                          SELINA
           No. But my friend over there...?
          Stryver looks at Selina's 'date' drooling into a bowl of
          nuts at the bar - he looks familiar...

                          SELINA
           Every cop in the city's missing
           him.

                         
          Across the bar, the TV on mute -

          MANHUNT FOR MISSING CONGRESSMAN.
          Stryver looks at Selina.

                         

                          STRYVER
           Cute. But they're not gonna be
           looking in a place like this.

                          SELINA
           I don't know... You did just use
           his cell phone.
          Stryver glances down at the cell phone as - SCREECH - the
          Thugs look out the window at cop cars and SWAT units
          descending on the bar. Stryver glances at the window and -
          SMASH - Selina CRACKS his head against the table, grabs

           25.

                         

                         
          Second Thug's gun hand, flips over the table, firing at the
          other Thugs, who drop. The SWATs batter down the door.
          Selina crouches, cowering, screaming.

                          SWAT
           It's alright, Miss. Just stay down

                          -
          The SWATs barrel past, chasing the remaining Thugs back
          through the bar and out into the back alley. Selina smiles.

                         

                         

          EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS

          The Thugs turn and open up on the SWATs with automatic
          weapons.

                         

                         

          INT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS

          Selina moves to the door. Spots the Congressman under the
          bar, clutching his bleeding leg.

                         

                          SELINA
           Keep some pressure on that,
           sweetheart.
          She adjusts her dress in the broken mirror behind the bar.
          Moves for the door.

                         

                          CONGRESSMAN

                          (WEAK)
           Call me?

                         

                         

          EXT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS

          Selina waltzes out - right into Blake. She feigns panic.

                          SELINA
           There's a man in there - he's
           bleeding!

                          BLAKE
           It's okay, Miss. It's okay.

                         
          Blake helps Selina down onto the tailgate of a SWAT truck.
          He heads into the bar, weapon drawn. Selina slips behind the
          truck and into the night.

           26.

                         

                         

          INT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS

          Blake enters, gun drawn. Spots the Congressman.

                          BLAKE

                          (INTO RADIO)
           I've got the Congressman - bullet
           to the leg, but he's okay.

                         

          EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The SWATs return fire. The Thugs lay down cover fire, then
          race around a corner into a smaller passage.
          A cop car pulls up, blocking the mouth of the alley - Gordon
          jumps out, gun drawn.

                         
          The SWATs approach the passage, massing on both corners
          tactically. The two corner SWATs exchange hand signals,
          counting down... They round the corner, aiming low and high.
          The passage is empty.

                         
          The SWATs cover a fire escape, but Gordon spots at once -

                          GORDON
           Manhole!

                         
          He races to the manhole cover - SWATs wrench off the cover,
          Gordon grabs a flashlight from the nearest SWAT.

                          GORDON
           You three, down with me. You two,
           head down to cover the next exit -

                         

                          SWAT
           Where -?

                          GORDON
           Get the DWP down here, now!

                         
          Gordon starts climbing down the ladder...

                         

          INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Gordon moves down the tunnel, flashlight low. Three SWATs
          fall in behind...

           27.

          Blake comes into the alley. Cops surround the manhole.

                          COP
           Where's the DWP guy?

                         

                          BLAKE
           They went down there?

                          FOLEY
           (shaking his head)
           And Gordon took SWAT in after them.

                         

          INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Gordon hears a noise up ahead - pushes forward, rounds the
          corner. BANG! GUNFIRE. SWATs return fire, shots sparking off
          the concrete walls, then - BOOM - behind him the tunnel
          ERUPTS IN FIRE, blasting the SWATs. Gordon races forward,
          tearing through the tunnels.

          INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

          Gordon races around a corner, gun drawn. A noise makes him
          turn - WHACK, he is clobbered from behind by a Thug.

                         

                         

          EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS

          Blake pushes forward.

                          BLAKE
           Come on, we gotta get down there -

                         

                          COP
           That was a gas explosion, kid -

           Gas? This is a sewer!

                          FOLEY
           No one goes in there till we know

           Somebody get the hothead out of
           here. And get me a DWP guy!
          Blake backs off. Gets an idea - goes for his patrol car.

          Thug 1 flips Gordon onto his back.

                          THUG 1
           This one's alive. (Looks closer.)
           Jesus. It's the Police
           Commissioner.

                          THUG 2
           What do we do?

                         

                          THUG 1
           Take him to Bane.
          The two Thugs drag Gordon down through the maze of tunnels.
          As they descend deeper they encounter work crews of muscular
          men wielding large drills and jackhammers, working the walls
          and ceiling of the larger tunnels. Some of the men are armed
          Mercenaries, overseeing gangs of homeless street kids. They
          stare as Gordon is dragged past. The Thugs drag Gordon
          between two waterfalls, into -

                         

                         

          INT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)

          They approach a figure, turned away, crouched in the
          firelight. Bare-chested, muscular, masked. Bane. A crooked
          line of scar tissue runs the length of his spine...

                         

                          BANE
           Why are you here?
          The Thugs drop Gordon at Bane's feet.

                         

                          THUG 1
           Answer him!
          Bane slowly turns to the Thugs.

           29.

                         

                         

                          BANE
           I'm asking you.

                          THUG 1
           It's the Police Commissioner.

                         

                          BANE
           And you brought him down here?

                          THUG 2
           We didn't know what to do. We -

                         

                          BANE
           You panicked. And your weakness
           costs three lives.

                          THUG 1
           No, he's alone -
          Bane flips the Thug's chin up and to the side with a crack.
          Thug 1 drops. Bane turns to Thug 2.

                          BANE
           Search him. Then I will kill you.
          The Thug, terrified, pulls out Gordon's badge, wallet,
          gun...and the folded papers of the speech he did not read.
          Bane takes these one by one with quick glances. He stops at
          the papers. Unfolds them...

                         
          As he reads, Gordon rolls off the steps, dropping into the
          rushing flow of water - gunshots ring out...

                          THUG 2
           He's dead.

                         
          Thug 2 trails off as Bane looks up from the papers...

                          BANE
           Then show me his body.

                         

                          THUG 2
           That water runs to any one of the
           outflows - we'd never find him.

                          BANE
           Give me your GPS.
          Lead Mercenary hands him a GPS - Bane tucks it into Thug 2's
          jacket, zips it up like a mother sending her kid to school.

           30.

                         

                         

                          BANE
           Follow him.

                          THUG 2
           Follow him?

                         
          Bane shoots Thug 2, kicks him into the water. Turns to Lead
          Mercenary.

                          BANE
           Track him. Make sure both bodies
           will not be found. Then brick up
           the south tunnel.

          Blake comes out to the catchment basin. He spots something
          stuck up against the grille, thrusts his hand into the
          raging waters - Gordon is there, alive. Just. Blake pulls
          him up onto the concrete, hoists him up, hurrying...

           I need to see Bruce Wayne.

                         

                          ALFRED
           I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take
           unscheduled calls. Even from police
           officers.

                         

                          BLAKE
           And if I go get a warrant, in the
           investigation of Harvey Dent's
           murder? Would that still count as
           unscheduled?

          Blake is sitting, drumming his leg, nervous. Wayne enters.

                         

                          WAYNE
           What can I do for you, officer?

                          BLAKE
           Commissioner Gordon's been shot.

           31.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           I'm sorry to hear that -

                          BLAKE
           He chased a gunman down into the
           sewers. When I pulled him out he
           was babbling about an underground
           army. A masked man called 'Bane'.

                          WAYNE
           Shouldn't you be telling this to
           your superior officers?

                          BLAKE
           I did. One of them asked if he saw
           any giant alligators down there. He
           needs you. He needs the Batman.

                         

                          WAYNE
           If Commissioner Gordon thinks I'm
           the Batman he must be in a bad way

                          -

                         

                          BLAKE
           He doesn't know or care who you
           are. (Off look.) But we've met
           before. When I was a kid. At the
           orphanage. See, my mom died when I
           was small. Car accident, I don't
           really remember it. But a couple of
           years later my dad was shot over a
           gambling debt. I remember that just
           fine. (Looks at Wayne.) Not a lot
           of people who know what it feels
           like, do they? To be angry. In your
           bones. People understand, foster
           parents understand. For a while.
           Then they expect the angry kid to
           do what he knows he can never do.
           To move on. To forget.

                         
          Wayne stares at Blake.

                          BLAKE
           So they stopped understanding and
           sent the angry kid to a boys' home
           - St. Swithin's. Used to be funded
           by the Wayne Foundation. See, I
           figured it out too late. You have
           to hide the anger. Practice smiling
           in the mirror. Like putting on a
           mask. You showed up one day in a
           cool car, pretty girl on your arm.

           We were so excited - Bruce Wayne,
           billionaire orphan. We made up
           stories about you. Legends. The
           other boys' stories were just that.
           But when I saw you I knew who you
           really were... (Beat.) I'd seen
           that look on your face. Same one I
           taught myself.
          Blake gets up to leave. Wayne is lost in thought.

                         

                          BLAKE
           I don't know why you took the fall
           for Dent's murder, but I'm still a
           believer in the Batman. Even if
           you're not.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Why did you say your boys' home
           used to be funded by the Wayne
           Foundation?

                         

                          BLAKE
           Because the money stopped. Might be
           time to get some fresh air and
           start paying attention to the
           details. Some of those details

           You checked that name? 'Bane' -

                          ALFRED
           Ran it through some databases. He's
           a mercenary. No other known name.
           Never been seen or photographed
           without a mask. He and his men were
           behind a coup in West Africa that
           secured mining operations for our
           friend John Daggett.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Now Daggett's brought them here?

                          ALFRED
           It would seem so. I'll keep
           digging.

                          WAYNE
           Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.

                          ALFRED
           I'll get him on the phone -

                         

                          WAYNE
           No. Do we still have any cars
           around the place?

           One or two.

                          WAYNE
           And I need an appointment at the
           hospital. About my leg.

                         

                          ALFRED
           Which hospital, sir?

                          WAYNE
           Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.

           I'll pass along your request. Next

           He doesn't talk to you either?

           Let's just say that Bruce Wayne has

           Mr. Fox, are you aware that John

           I was not. But it wouldn't do him

           a clear majority.
          Miranda leaves. Fox moves into his office - stops.

           most of my money.

                          FOX
           Actually, you did that yourself.
           See, if you funnel the entire R and
           D budget for five years into a
           fusion project that you then
           mothball, your company is unlikely

                          WAYNE
           What's it called?

                          FOX
           It has a long and uninteresting
           Wayne Enterprises designation. So I
           took to calling it the Bat. And
           yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in
           black.
          Wayne touches its sleek side. Marveling.

                         

                          FOX
           Works great except for the
           autopilot.

                          WAYNE
           What's wrong with that?

                          FOX
           Software-based instability. Take a
           better mind than mine to fix it.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Better mind?

                          FOX
           I was trying to be modest. A less
           busy mind. Yours, perhaps.
          Wayne looks wistfully at the machine. Turns away.

                          WAYNE
           I told you. I retired, Lucius.

                         

                         

          INT. EXAMINATION ROOM, GOTHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

          Wayne listens, distracted, while a Doctor examines an X-ray.

                         

                          DOCTOR
           I've seen worse cartilage in knees

                          -

           38.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           That's good -

                          DOCTOR
           No, that's because there is no
           cartilage in your knee. And not
           much of any use in your elbows and
           shoulders. Between that and the
           scar tissue on your kidneys,
           residual concussive damage to your
           brain tissue and general
           scarred-over quality of your
           body... (Takes a deep breath.) I
           cannot recommend that you go
           heli-skiing. About the only part of
           your body that looks healthy is
           your liver, so if you're bored I
           recommend you take up drinking, Mr.
           Wayne.
          Wayne smiles. The Doctor leaves. Wayne pulls on a ski mask,
          steps to the window, hops up, pulls a wire from his cane,
          which he clips to his belt. He props his cane behind the
          frame - jumps out. The wire unspools from the cane as -

                         

          EXT. TENTH FLOOR, GOTHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

          Wayne drops three floors...

                         

                         

          INT. PRIVATE ROOM, GOTHAM GENERAL - CONTINUOUS

          Gordon lies in his bed, hooked up to machines. Wayne, in ski
          mask, stands over him. Gordon's eyes flutter open. He tries
          to speak with a weak, hoarse voice...

                          GORDON
           We were in this together. Then you
           were gone...

                         

                          WAYNE
           The Batman wasn't needed anymore.
           We won.

                          GORDON
           Built on a lie. Our lie. Now
           there's evil rising from where we
           tried to bury it. Nobody will
           listen... The Batman has to come
           back.

           39.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           What if he doesn't exist anymore?

                          GORDON
           He must. He must.

                         

                         

          INT./EXT. LAMBORGHINI ON GOTHAM STREETS - NIGHT

          Wayne pulls up in front of a row of shabby subdivided town
          houses. Checks a tracking device. Jon, provocatively
          dressed, leads a Yuppie Banker-type in through a front door.

                         

          INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          Selina sits in a small room getting ready to go out. She
          picks up the pearls - hears a disturbance in the hall.

           JEN (O.S.)
           I told you - money first -

           YUPPIE (O.S.)
           Goddammit, you took my wallet!

                         

          INT. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          The Yuppie has Jen against the wall - he reaches back to hit
          her with an expensive wristwatch-clad arm. But Selina has
          grabbed his wrist with a powerful grip.

                          SELINA
           Get out.

                         

                          YUPPIE
           She took my wallet!
          Selina twists his arm behind him in a blinding move.

                          SELINA
           Now.
          She releases the Yuppie, who moves off down the stairs.
          Selina turns to Jen. Who is examining a wallet.

                          SELINA
           I told you not to try it with the
           assholes, Jen.

                          JEN
           They're all assholes.

           40.

                         

                         

                          SELINA
           Okay, the assholes who hit.

                          JEN
           I don't know what he's so upset
           about, he only had sixty bucks in
           here.

                          SELINA
           Probably the watch.

                         

                          YOUNG WOMAN
           Watch?
          Selina opens her hand and gives Jen the Yuppie's Rolex.

                         

                         

          EXT. SELINA'S BUILDING, OLD TOWN, GOTHAM - LATER

          Selina exits and hails a cab. Wayne watches her go. Then
          pulls out. Checking his tracker.

                         

                         

          EXT. MUSEUM, GOTHAM - LATER

          Town cars dispense Gotham society in tasteful masquerade.
          Wayne pulls up to the Valet. Paparazzi line the entrance.
          Wayne uses his cane to get out of his Lamborghini...

                         

                          PAPARAZZI
           Another stiff too old to climb out
           of his sports car.

                          PAPARAZZI 2
           No, that's Bruce Wayne! Hey, Wayne,
           where you been hiding?
          Lenses swing onto Wayne, who pushes a button on his key fob
          - a pulse. The cameras die. Wayne heads to the door.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I'm not sure if my assistant put me
           on the guest list -

                          GREETER
           Right through here, Mr. Wayne...

           41.

                         

                         

          INT. MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS

          A lavish ball - the expressively attired dance under falling
          confetti... Even Bruce Wayne is struck by the ostentation.
          He spots Selina dancing with a deeply smitten Rich Twit. She
          wears a small, velvet pair of cat ears. And the pearls.

                         

           MIRANDA (O.S)
           Bruce Wayne at a charity ball?
          Wayne turns to find Miranda Tate, amazed, a small mask her
          only concession to fancy dress.

                          WAYNE
           Miss Tate, isn't it?

                          MIRANDA
           Even before you became a recluse,
           you never came to these things...

                          WAYNE
           True. Proceeds go to the big fat
           spread, not the cause. It's not
           about charity, it's about feeding
           the ego of whichever society hag
           laid it on.

                          MIRANDA
           Actually, this is my party, Mr.
           Wayne.

                          WAYNE
           Oh.

                          MIRANDA
           And the proceeds will go where they
           should, because I paid for the big
           fat spread myself.

                          WAYNE
           That's very generous of you.

                          MIRANDA
           You have to invest to restore
           balance to the world. Take our
           clean-energy project...

                         

                          WAYNE
           Sometimes the investment doesn't
           pay off. Sorry.

           42.

                         

                         

                          MIRANDA
           You have a practiced apathy, Mr.
           Wayne. But a man who doesn't care
           about the world doesn't spend half
           his fortune on a plan to save it...
           (Gentle.) And isn't so wounded when
           it fails that he goes into
           hiding...
          Wayne looks at Miranda. Intrigued.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.
          Wayne watches Miranda glide away. Then turns to Selina.

                          WAYNE
           Mind if I cut in?
          Rich Twit turns, annoyed - Wayne hands him his cane. Takes
          Selina by the waist. She glares at him.

                          WAYNE
           You don't seem very happy to see
           me.

                          SELINA
           You were supposed to be a shut-in.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Felt like some fresh air.

                          SELINA
           Why didn't you call the police?

                         

                          WAYNE
           I have a powerful friend who deals
           with this kind of thing. (Admires
           her cat ears.) Brazen costume for a
           cat burglar.

                         

                          SELINA
           Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?

                          WAYNE
           Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.
           Who's your date?

                          SELINA
           His wife's in Ibiza. She left her
           diamonds behind, though. Worried
           they'd get stolen.

           43.

                         

                          WAYNE
          It's pronounced 'Ibeetha'. You
          wouldn't want these folks realizing
          you're a crook not a social
          climber.

                         

                          SELINA
           (flash of anger)
          You think I care what anyone in
          this room thinks about me?

                         

                          WAYNE
          I doubt you care what anyone in
          this room thinks about you.

                          SELINA
          Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne. You
          don't know a thing about me.

                          WAYNE
          Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came
          here from your walk-up in Old Town
          - modest place for a master jewel
          thief. Which means either you're
          saving for your retirement - or
          you're in deep with the wrong
          people.

                         

                          SELINA
          You don't get to judge me because
          you were born in the master bedroom
          of Wayne Manor.

                          WAYNE
          Actually, I was born in the Regency
          Room.

                          SELINA
          I started off doing what I had to.
          Once you've done what you had to
          they'll never let you do what you
          want to.

                          WAYNE
          Start fresh.

                         

                          SELINA
          There's no fresh start in today's
          world. Any twelve-year-old with a
          cell phone could find out what you
          did. Everything we do is collated
          and quantified. Everything sticks.
          We are the sum of our mistakes.

           44.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Or our achievements.

                          SELINA
           The mistakes stick better. Trust
           me.

                         

                          WAYNE
           You think that justifies stealing?

                          SELINA
           I take what I need to from those
           who have more than enough. I don't
           stand on the shoulders of people
           with less.

                          WAYNE
           Robin Hood?

                          SELINA
           I'd do more to help someone than
           most of the people in this room.
           Than you.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Maybe you're assuming too much.

                          SELINA
           Or maybe you're being unrealistic
           about what's really in your pants
           other than your wallet.

                          WAYNE
           Ouch.

                         

                          SELINA
           You think all this can last?
          Wayne glances around at the sumptuous party.

                         

                          SELINA
           There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.
           You and your friends better batten
           down the hatches, because when it
           hits you're all gonna wonder how
           you ever thought you could live so
           large and leave so little to the
           rest of us.

                          WAYNE
           Sounds like you're looking forward
           to it.

                          WAYNE
           These pearls do look better on you
           then they did in my safe...

                         
          Wayne rolls her into his shoulder - reaches up to the back
          of her neck, unclasps the necklace.
           But I still can't let you keep
           them.

                         
          The pearls slide off her neck into his other hand. Selina
          looks at him. Angry. Then kisses him, hard, and disappears
          into the crowd. Wayne's cane reappears.

           I must have lost my ticket -

           Just you, sir?

                         
          Wayne gives him a withering glare.

           Don't worry, Master Wayne. Takes a
           little time to get back into the
           swing of things.
          Wayne dials his phone.

           This is Fox.

           Remember those 'unusual requests' I
           used to make?

           I knew it!
          Up front, Alfred listens. Concerned.

                         

          INT. BATCAVE - DAY


                         
          Wayne pushes a button on a hi-tech carbon fiber brace
          strapped to his good knee - the brace tones. As Wayne starts
          moving his knee, bending, stretching, Alfred puts down a
          Thermos.

                         

                          ALFRED
           You've got the wrong leg, sir.

                          WAYNE
           You start with the good limb so it
           learns your optimum muscle
           patterns.
          Wayne swaps the brace to his bad knee. Puts his weight on it
          - the knee bends, kicks. He sits again. Cautious.
           Now we tighten it up.

                         
          Wayne gingerly pushes a button - the brace starts to shrink
          tight to his leg, digging in. Wayne grits his teeth.

                          ALFRED
           It is terribly painful?

                         

                          WAYNE

           You're welcome to try it, Alfred.

                          ALFRED
           Happy watching, thank you, sir.
          Wayne shouts as the brace clicks home. He gets to his feet.

           Not bad -
          Wayne executes a perfect roundhouse, knocking out a brick.
           Not bad at all.

                         
          Alfred picks up the brick. Considers it. Uneasy. He follows
          Wayne across the bridge to the cube.

                          ALFRED
           Master Wayne, if you're considering
           going back out there you need to
           hear some rumors surrounding Bane.

                          WAYNE
           I'm all ears.

                         

                          ALFRED
           There is a prison. In a more
           ancient part of the world. A pit.
           Where men are thrown to suffer and
           die. But sometimes, a man rises
           from the darkness. Sometimes...the
           pit sends something back.

                          WAYNE
           Bane.

                          ALFRED
           Born and raised in a hell on earth.

                          WAYNE
           Born in a prison?

                          ALFRED
           No one knows why. Or how he
           escaped. But they know who trained
           him one he did...R¯'s al Gh¯l. Your

                          A U
           mentor.

                         
          Wayne takes this in. Shocked.

                          ALFRED
           He plucked Bane from a dark corner
           of the earth and trained him in the
           blackest disciplines of combat,
           deception and endurance. Just like
           you.

                          WAYNE
           Bane was a member of the League of
           Shadows.

           48.

                         

                         

                          ALFRED
           Until he was excommunicated. And a
           man considered too extreme for R¯'s

                          A
           al Gh¯l is not to be trifled with.

           I didn't realize I was known for
           trifling with criminals.

                          ALFRED
           That was then. And you can strap up
           your leg and put the mask back on.
           But it won't make you what you
           were.

                          WAYNE
           Which was?

                         

                          ALFRED
           Someone whose anger at death made
           him value all life. Even his own.

                          WAYNE
           If this man is all the things you
           say he is, then this city needs me.
          The Batsuit emerges from the cube.

                          ALFRED
           Yes, this city needs Bruce Wayne.
           Your resources, your
           knowledge...not your body. Not your
           life. That time has passed.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I tried helping as Bruce Wayne,
           Alfred. And I failed.

                          ALFRED
           You can fail as Bruce Wayne. As
           Batman, you can't afford to.

                          WAYNE
           That's what you're afraid of - that
           if I go back out there I'll fail.

                         

                          ALFRED
           No. I'm afraid that you want to.
          Wayne looks at Alfred. Then turns to examine the Batsuit.

          INT. STOCK EXCHANGE - EVENING

          A frenzy of trading on the packed floor...
          Two Traders sit on a shoeshine stand in the lobby.

                         

                          TRADER 2
           You can't short the stock because
           Bruce Wayne goes to a party -

                          TRADER 1
           Wayne coming back is change. Change
           is either good or bad.

                          TRADER 2
           On what basis?

                         

                          TRADER 1
           I flipped a coin.
          Near the front entrance: a Food Delivery Guy is standing
          there negotiating with a Trader.

                         

                          TRADER 3
           No. Rye. I told 'em rye.
          Trader 3 spots bad news on a screen.
           Alright, I'll take it.

                         
          He thrusts Food Guy a tip and grabs the bag, distracted...
          At the rear secure entrance: a Motorcycle Courier enters,
          wearing his helmet - a Female Security Guard gets in his
          face.

                         

           FEMALE SECURITY GUARD
           Rookie! Lose the helmet! (Points at
           a camera.) We need faces for
           cameras.

                         
          In the rest room: a Janitor mops the floor, shifting out of
          the way of two Traders who rush in to pee.
          At the shoeshine stand, Trader 1 waves a bill down at the
          man shining his shoes without a glance. Shoeshine Man takes
          the bill, then, as the Traders step off, he reaches into a
          gym bag and checks an automatic weapon. He clicks the slide
          home, then hoists the gym bag and heads for the trading
          floor.
          At the secure entrance: the Courier pulls off his helmet.
          The Female Security Guard's eyes go wide.

           50.

                         
          In the rest room: the Janitor reaches into his bucket and
          pulls out a machine pistol in a Ziploc bag.

                         
          Near the front entrance: Food Guy pulls an automatic pistol
          - clubs Trader 3 with it, pastrami flying. Shoeshine Man
          moves onto the floor, pulls out his weapon.
          Under the Courier's helmet - a mask. Bane. He grabs the
          Female Security Guard and throws her into her colleagues,
          lashing out in four directions with rapidfire lethality.
          Shoeshine Man fires into the large trading screens. The
          floor erupts into a different frenzy - traders hit the deck,
          screaming. Bane moves onto the floor...

                         

                          TRADER 1
           This is a stock exchange, there's
           no money you can steal -
          He dries up as Bane stops. Turns to him...

                         

                          BANE
           Why else would you people be here?
          Bane grabs Trader 1 by the throat and drags him across the
          floor to an online automated trades terminal... He puts the
          man's thumb onto the print reader - the screen lights up.

                         

                          BANE
           Enter your password. Or I send
           these men to your home.

                         
          Trader 1, terrified, types in his password. Outside, sirens.
          Shoeshine man pulls out a USB drive with an antenna - plugs
          it into the computer - figures race across the screen...

          Police vehicles screech into the narrow street -
          construction vehicles are blocking. Blake argues with a
          burly Construction Worker.

                          BLAKE
           Move it, now! We've got a

           It's a robbery! They've got direct

           If you don't shut these guys down,
           the stuffing in that mattress might
           be worth a whole lot less, pal.

          the high heel of her boot. He whimpers as she leans in.

                          CATWOMAN
           Cat got your tongue?
          She plucks the gun from his trembling hand.

                          DAGGETT
           You dumb bitch.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           Nobody ever accused me of being
           dumb.

           60.

                         

                         

                          DAGGETT
           Dumb to show up here tonight.

                          CATWOMAN
           I want what you owe me -

                         
          Click - Stryver has a gun to her head.

                          DAGGETT
           'I want' never gets...

                         
          Stryver looks appreciatively at Catwoman as she lowers her
          leg...

                          STRYVER
           Nice outfit...those heels make it
           tough to walk?

                         
          Catwoman digs her stiletto into his calf, hard. He screams.

                          CATWOMAN
           I don't know, do they?

                         
          Catwoman spins, disarms Stryver, grabs Daggett.

                          CATWOMAN
           So where is it?

                          DAGGETT
           Where's what?

                          CATWOMAN
           The program. The 'Clean Slate'.

                          DAGGETT
           Oh, yeah - the ultimate tool for a
           master thief with a record. I don't
           have it.
          The Bodyguard bursts in, gun drawn. Catwoman, holding
          Daggett, spins, kicking the window with the point of her
          heel. The glass shatters. She pulls Daggett through the
          window. He screams - they drop...

                         

          EXT. WINDOW-CLEANING PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS


                         
          ...ten feet onto the window-cleaning platform. Catwoman uses
          her bladed heel to cut a rope - the platform plunges down
          the side of the building.

           61.

                         

                         

          EXT. FLAT ROOF - MOMENTS LATER

          Catwoman dumps Daggett onto the roof, towering over him.

                          CATWOMAN
           Where is it?

                         

                          DAGGETT
           The 'Clean Slate'? Type in a name
           and date of birth and within a
           couple hours that person ceases to
           exist in any database? Little too
           good to be true.

                          CATWOMAN
           You're lying. Rykin Data took it to
           prototype stage -

                         

                          DAGGETT
           That's why I bought them. But they
           had nothing. It was a gangland
           myth.

                         
          Catwoman leans back from Daggett, taking this in... Shapes
          drop onto the rooftop. Emerge from fire exits. They're not
          Daggett's bodyguards, these are Bane's men... Catwoman holds
          Daggett by the throat, threatening him.

                          CATWOMAN
           Stay back!
          They continue to approach. One of them screws a silencer
          onto his gun.

                          CATWOMAN
           I'm not bluffing!

           VOICE (O.S.)
           They know...

                         
          All eyes search for the source of the voice. Catwoman spots
          it - a dark shape, crouched on the roof above: Batman.

                          BATMAN
           They just don't care.

                         
          As the Mercenary with the silencer looks up, Catwoman leaps
          forward, grabs his gun. Batman drops into the middle of the
          fray, fighting back Mercenaries at Catwoman's back - she
          fires at one, clipping him, he drops. She spins aiming at
          another's head - Batman yanks her arm down, forcing her to
          miss the Mercenary. Batman takes him out with a kick.

           62.

                         

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           You've got to be kidding.

                          BATMAN
           No guns. No killing.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           Where's the fun in that?
          As more mercenaries come out onto the roof, Batman runs for
          the far edge.

                         

                          BATMAN
           Come on!
          Catwoman follows, confused, as Batman leaps off the roof.
          She gets to the edge, pauses to look down into the alley -
          sees the black angular roof of the Bat, cockpit open.
          Shots impact around her - she leaps, landing hard, but
          gracefully on the back of the vehicle, slides into the
          cockpit. As the engines thunder into life, and the canopy
          hisses shut, taking bullets from above.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           My mother warned me about getting
           into cars with strange men -

                          BATMAN
           This isn't a car.
          Catwoman flinches as the Bat thunders into the sky,
          downdraft forcing the Mercenaries down onto the roof, all
          but one, who walks slowly across the roof, strong against
          the wind...Bane. He watches the Bat roar off into the night.

                         

                         

          EXT. ROOFTOP, SKYSCRAPER, GOTHAM - MOMENTS LATER

          The Bat lands - the canopy opens. Catwoman jumps out.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           See you around -
          Batman steps down after her.

                         

                          BATMAN
           You're welcome.

                          CATWOMAN
           I had it under control.

           63.

                         

                          BATMAN
           Those weren't street thugs - they
           were trained killers. I saved your
           life. In return I need to know what
           you did with Bruce Wayne's
           fingerprints.
          Catwoman looks at him. Considering.

                          CATWOMAN
           Wayne wasn't kidding about a
           'powerful friend'. I sold his
           prints to Daggett. For something
           that doesn't even exist.

                          BATMAN
           I doubt many people get the better
           of you.

                          CATWOMAN
           Hey, when a girl's desperate...

                         

                          BATMAN
           What were they going to do with
           them?

                          CATWOMAN
           I don't know. But Daggett seemed
           pretty interested in that mess at
           the stock market.
          Batman considers this. A police chopper sweeps past,
          searching. Batman turns to it. Then turns back.

                         

                          BATMAN
           Miss Kyle -?
          But she is gone.
           So that's what that feels like.

                         

                         

          INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

          Alfred is studying security camera footage of Bane killing
          at the stock exchange. A roar builds - the waterfall glows
          brighter until...SMASH! The Bat breaches, downdraft spraying
          water. Two cubes rise - the Bat lands, Batman jumps out.
          Alfred brushes water off his suit.

                          ALFRED
           Very inconspicuous. Shall I tell
           the neighbors you got yourself a
           new leaf-blower?

           64.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           We bought all the neighbors.
          Alfred takes the cowl from him, then the cape, as they walk.

                          ALFRED
           From the look of the television
           coverage, you seem to have your
           taste for wanton destruction back.

                          WAYNE
           (pulls out USB drive)
           I retrieved this.

                          ALFRED
           Shouldn't the police be gathering
           the evidence?

                         

                          WAYNE
           They don't have the tools to
           analyze it.

                          ALFRED
           They would if you gave them to them

                          -

                          WAYNE
           One man's tool is another man's
           weapon.

                         

                          ALFRED
           In your mind, perhaps. But there
           aren't many things you couldn't
           turn into a weapon.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Alfred. Enough. The police weren't
           getting it done -

                          ALFRED
           Perhaps they would've if you
           haven't made a sideshow of
           yourself.

                          WAYNE
           Perhaps you're upset you were
           wrong.

                          ALFRED
           Wrong?

           65.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           You thought I didn't have it in me.
          Alfred looks at him. Puts down the cape and cowl.

                          ALFRED
           You don't. You lead a bloated
           police force on a merry chase with
           some fancy new toys from Fox. What
           about when you come up against him.
           What then?

                         
          Alfred points to the monitor - Wayne sees Bane killing...

                          WAYNE
           I'll fight harder, I always have.

                         

                          ALFRED
           When you had something to fight
           for. What are you fighting for now?
           Not your life.
          Wayne moves to switch off the monitor. Alfred grabs his
          hand.

                          ALFRED
           Take a good look. At his speed, his
           ferocity, His training. I see the
           power of belief. Of the fanatic. I
           see the League of Shadows
           resurgent.

                          WAYNE
           You said he was excommunicated.

                         

                          ALFRED

           just a mercenary, and we have to
           find out what he's up to.
          Wayne plugs the USB in, hits keys. Text scrolls.

                         

                          WAYNE

          The screen blanks, a thumb print appears.

          Wayne pulls out the USB, rises.
           Get this to Fox - he can crack the
           code and tell us what trades they
           were executing.

                         
          Alfred looks at Wayne. Takes the USB.

                         

          INT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)

          As Wayne hits the bottom of the stairs, Alfred calls.

                         

                          ALFRED
           I'll get this to Fox. But no more.
          Wayne hears his tone of voice. Turns to him.

                         

                          ALFRED
           I've sewn you up and set your

           You see only one end to your story.
           Leaving is all I have to make you
           understand: you aren't Batman
           anymore - you have to find another
           way. You used to talk about

           written a letter? Explaining that
           she'd chosen Harvey Dent over you?
          Wayne watches, confused, as the old man prepares to say -

                          ALFRED
           And what if, to spare you
           pain...I'd burned that letter?
          Wayne stares at Alfred, shocked.

                          WAYNE
           Why would you say such a thing?

                          ALFRED
           Because I have to make you
           understand.

                         

                          WAYNE
           You're lying.

                          ALFRED
           Because you are as precious to me
           as you were to your own mother and
           father and I swore to them that I
           would protect you and I haven't.

                          WAYNE
           You're lying!

                         

                          ALFRED
           I've never lied to you. Except when
           I burned Rachel's letter.
          Wayne turns on the old man, furious.

                         

                          WAYNE
           How dare you use Rachel to stop me!

                          ALFRED
           I'm using the truth, Master Wayne.
           Maybe it's time we all stopped
           trying to outsmart the truth and
           just let it have its day. I'm
           sorry.

           68.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Sorry?! You expect to destroy my
           world, then shake hands?!

                          ALFRED
           No. I know what this means -

                          WAYNE
           What does it mean, Alfred?!

                          ALFRED
           It means your hatred. It means
           losing the person I've cared for
           ever since I heard his first cries
           echo through this house. But it
           might also mean saving your life.
           And that is more important.

                         
          Wayne looks at Alfred. Furious. Summons the worst thing to
          say and says it quietly and calmly.

                          WAYNE
           Goodbye, Alfred.

                         

                          ALFRED

                          (QUIET)
           Goodbye, Bruce.
          Wayne mounts the stairs...Alfred watches him go. Turns.

                         

                         

          INT. MASTER BEDROOM, WAYNE MANOR - MORNING

          Wayne is woken by the doorbell.

                         

                         

          INT. STAIRCASE, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

          As Wayne moves through the empty house, tying his dressing
          gown, he can't resist one tentative.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Alfred?
          But Alfred is gone.

                         

                         

          INT. FRONT HALL, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

          Wayne opens the front door the find Fox. Fox is surprised.

           69.

                         

                         

                          FOX
           Answering your own door?

                          WAYNE
           Yes. Could you decode the trades on
           that drive?

                         
          Fox hands Wayne a newspaper - the main headline:

          BATMAN BACK TO FOIL OR MASTERMIND STOCK RAID...

                         

                          FOX
           I didn't need to. Page three.
          Wayne turns the page:

          WAYNE DOUBLES DOWN - AND LOSES...

                         

                          FOX
           It seems you made a series of large
           put options on the futures
           exchange. Verified by thumb print.
           The options expired at midnight
           last night.
          Wayne looks up from the newspaper, reeling.

                          FOX
           Long term we may be able to prove
           fraud, but for now...you're
           completely broke. And Wayne
           Enterprises is about to fall into
           the hands of John Daggett.

                          WAYNE
           The weapons - we can't let Daggett
           get his hands on Applied Sciences -

                          FOX
           Applied Sciences is shut up tight,
           and off the books. The energy
           project is a different story.

                          WAYNE
           Miranda Tate. We need to convince
           the board to get behind her. Let's
           show her the reactor -

                          FOX
           We're meeting her there in
           thirty-five minutes. You better get
           dressed.

           70.

                         

          EXT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES RECYCLING PLANT - DAY

          A scrapyard on the Gotham river. Across the water, the
          towers of Gotham. Lucius leads Miranda from her car.

                          MIRANDA
           You brought me out here to show me
           a rubbish dump, Mr. Fox?

                         

                          FOX
           Bear with me, Miss Tate.
          They arrive at a Portakabin and enter.

                         

                         

          INT. PORTAKABIN - CONTINUOUS

          Miranda looks around the derelict office. Fox smiles at her.

                          FOX
           Keep your hands and feet inside the
           car at all times.
          He hits a button and the floor descends, Miranda is shocked
          as the office becomes an elevator into -

                         

                         

          INT. ELEVATOR, FUSION REACTOR - CONTINUOUS

          They descend diagonally into a massive concrete tunnel...

                          MIRANDA
           This is it, isn't it?

                         

                          FOX
           The reactor is beneath the river so
           that it could be instantly flooded
           in an event of a security breach.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Is Bruce Wayne really that
           paranoid?

                          FOX
           I'm gonna plead the fifth on that
           one.
          Miranda marvels as they step off the elevator. She spots a
          figure deep within: Bruce Wayne.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I thought you might like to see
           what your investment built.

           71.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           No radiation, no fossil fuels.
           Free, clean energy for an entire
           city.

                          WAYNE
           If it worked. It doesn't.
          Wayne leads Miranda to the core. Two perpendicular rings of
          electromagnets suspend a bowling-ball-sized mass of metal.
          Wayne hits buttons - the ball glows, then dies to cold.

                          WAYNE
           Ignition, yes. But no chain
           reaction.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           You've built a lot of security
           around a damp squib.
          Nothing.
           About three years ago a Russian
           scientist published a paper on
           weaponized fusion reactions. One
           week later your reactor started
           developing problems... (Looks at
           Wayne.) I think this machine works.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Miranda, if it were operational,
           the danger to Gotham would be too
           great.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Would it make you feel better to
           know that the Russian scientist
           died in a plane crash six months
           ago?

                         

                          WAYNE
           Someone else will work out what Dr.
           Pavel did. Someone else will figure
           out how to turn this power source
           into a nuclear weapon. I need you
           to take control of Wayne
           Enterprises and this reactor.

                          MIRANDA
           And to do what with it?

                         

                          WAYNE
           Nothing. Until we can find a way to
           guarantee its safety.

           72.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           And if we can't?

                         

                          WAYNE
           Decommission it. Flood it.

                          MIRANDA
           Destroy the world's best chance for
           a sustainable future?

                         

                          WAYNE
           If the world's not ready. Yes.

                          MIRANDA
           Bruce, if you want to save the
           world you have to start trusting
           it.

                          WAYNE
           I'm trusting you.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Doesn't count. You have no choice.

                          WAYNE
           I could've flooded this chamber any
           time in the last three years. I'm
           choosing to trust you, Miranda, and
           that's not the easiest thing for
           me. Please.
          His eyes are genuine. Pleading. Miranda nods.

                         

                          FOX
           We have a board meeting to get to.

          The Board Members, including Daggett and Miranda, take their
          seats. Fox at one end of the table, Wayne at the other.

                          DAGGETT
           I'd like to point out that we have
           a non-board member here. Highly
           irregular, even if it is his family
           name above the door...
          All eyes go to Wayne. An older member of the board pipes up.

                          FOX
           I'm afraid he has a point, Mr.

                          WAYNE
           I understand. Ladies and gentlemen.

                         
          Wayne glances at Miranda who nods at him. Wayne leaves.

                          DAGGETT
           Let's get down to business.

          Wayne exits the building. There is an angry mob of
          Shareholders and a pack of hungry Reporters.

                          REPORTER
           Wayne, how's it feel to be one of

          Wayne looks over to see his Lamborghini being towed.

           BLAKE (O.S.)
           Looks like you need a lift.
          Wayne turns to see Blake standing by his patrol car. Nods.

          INT. DAGGETT'S PENTHOUSE - DAY

          Daggett bursts in, furious. Stryver tries to placate him.

                          DAGGETT
           How the hell did Miranda Tate get
           the inside track on the Wayne
           board?! Was she meeting with Wayne?
           Was she sleeping with Wayne?

                          STRYVER
           Not that we know of -

                          DAGGETT
           Clearly you don't 'know of'
           anything, do you?! Where's Bane?!

                         

                          STRYVER
           We told him it was urgent -

                          DAGGETT
           Then where is the masked -

                         

           BANE (O.S.)
           Speak of the devil...
          Daggett turns. Bane is already there.

                          BANE
           ...and he shall appear.

                          DAGGETT
           What the hell's going on?

                          BANE
           The plan is proceeding as expected.

                          DAGGETT
           You see me running Wayne
           Enterprises?! (Moves towards Bane.)
           Your stock exchange hit didn't
           work, friend. And now you've got my
           construction crews working all
           hours around the city? How's that
           supposed to help my company absorb
           Wayne's?

                         

                          BANE

                          (TO STRYVER)
           Leave us.

           75.

                         

                         

                          DAGGETT
           You stay right there! I'm in
           charge!
          Bane places a gentle hand on Daggett's shoulder.

                         

                          BANE
           Do you feel in charge?
          Daggett is taken aback. Stryver leaves.

                         

                          DAGGETT
           I've paid you a small fortune -

                          BANE
           And that gives you power over me?

                         
          Daggett considers the heavy hand on his shoulder. Nervous.

                          DAGGETT
           What is this?

                          BANE
           Your money and infrastructure have
           been important. Till now.

                          DAGGETT
           What are you?

                         

                          BANE
           Gotham's reckoning. Come to end the
           borrowed time you've all been
           living on...

                         
          Bane gently takes the terrified Daggett's head in his
          hands...

                          DAGGETT
           You are true evil...

                         

                          BANE
           I am necessary evil.
          Stryver, on the steps outside the living room, flinches.

                         

                         

                         SCENE OMITTED

           76.

                         

                         

          INT./EXT. CRUISER ON GOTHAM STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

          Wayne stares out the window. Blake glances across.

                          BLAKE
           When you began...why the mask?

                         

                          WAYNE
           To protect the people closest to
           me.

                         

                          BLAKE
           You're a loner with no family.

                          WAYNE
           There are always people you care
           about. You just don't realize how
           much until they're gone. (Collects
           himself.) The idea was to be a
           symbol. Batman could be anybody,
           that was the point.

                          BLAKE
           It was damn good to see him back.

                          WAYNE
           Not everybody agrees.

                          BLAKE
           They'll figure it out in the end.

                          WAYNE
           Got anything on Bane's whereabouts?

                          BLAKE
           Yeah, I've got five hundred pages
           of tunnel records and a flashlight.
           I could use some help.

                          WAYNE

                          (THINKS)
           You know what? Drop me in Old
           Town...

                         

          EXT. SELINA'S BUILDING, OLD TOWN, GOTHAM - DAY


                         
          Blake drops Wayne off.

                          WAYNE
           Don't wait. I'll get a cab.

           77.

                         

                          BLAKE
           You got money?

                         

                          WAYNE
           (smiles, sheepish)
           Actually, no.
          Blake hands him some bills, watches him cross the street.
          The radio squawks. Blake reacts - drives off.

                         

                         

          INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          Selina is packing a bag. She hears voices in the stairwell.

                         

           JEN (O.S.)
           I told you, money first.

           WAYNE (O.S.)
           I don't think so.

                         

                         

          INT. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          Selina finds Wayne standing there with Jen.

                          SELINA
           He's not a mark.
          Jen looks at Selina. At Wayne.

                          SELINA
           And he doesn't have a cent to his
           name, anyway.

                         

          INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          Wayne looks at the cramped space. Selina shifts,
          embarrassed.

                          SELINA
           Yeah, it's not much. (Smiles.) But
           it's more that you've got right
           now.

                          WAYNE
           Actually, they're letting me keep
           the house.

                         

                          SELINA

                          (SHAKES HEAD)
           The rich don't even go broke same
           as the rest of us, huh?

           78.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           (spots her bag)
           Vacation?

                          SELINA
           Let's just say that I've incurred
           the wrath of some people less
           susceptible to my charms than you.

                          WAYNE
           My powerful friend hopes to change
           your mind about leaving.

                          SELINA
           And how would he do that?

                          WAYNE
           By giving you what you want.

                          SELINA
           It doesn't exist.

                          WAYNE
           He says it does. He wants to meet.
           Tonight.

                          SELINA
           Why?

                         

                          WAYNE
           He needs to find Bane. He thinks
           you'd know how.

                          SELINA
           Tell him I'll think about it.
          Wayne nods, starts to leave.

                          SELINA
           Mr. Wayne? I'm sorry they took all
           your money.

                          WAYNE
           No, you're not.

                         

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

          Blake moves through the hospital corridor, looking for -

           79.

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Blake enters. Gordon is sitting up in bed, talking to Foley.

                          FOLEY
           Can we help you, officer?

                          BLAKE
           John Daggett's body was found in a
           dumpster an hour ago. I thought you
           might like to know.

                         

                          GORDON
           Why?

                          BLAKE
           Because Daggett's name is all over
           the permits I pulled to map the
           tunnels under Gotham.
          Blake hands Gordon a stack of files. Foley glares at Blake.

                         

                          BLAKE
           MTA maintenance, sewer
           construction...

                          GORDON

                          (TO FOLEY)
           Where did you get to with the
           tunnel searches?

                          FOLEY

                          (TO BLAKE)
           Remind me to tell the detail to
           keep hotheads out. (To Gordon.)
           We've had teams down there, but
           it's a huge network -

                          GORDON
           Get more men, work a grid. I want
           him found.

                          FOLEY
           Yeah, yeah - the masked man. We're
           on it.

                         
          Gordon eyes the files hungrily - glances up at Blake.

                          GORDON
           This is good work. Lose the uniform
           - you're working for me now. We
           could use some hotter heads around
           here.

           80.

                         

                         

                          BLAKE
           This could just be a coincidence.

                          GORDON
           You're a detective now, son, you're
           not allowed to believe in
           coincidence anymore.
          Blake tries to conceal his excitement from Foley.

                         

                         

          EXT. WAYNE MANOR - EVENING (END OF DAY)

          Wayne, covering his head with a newspaper, hurries up the
          driveway in the rain. Steps into the alcove. Hits the bell.

           MIRANDA (O.S)
           Nobody's answering.
          Wayne turns to find Miranda there.

                          WAYNE
           No. I'm on my own now.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Do you have keys?
          Wayne looks a little helpless all of a sudden.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Never needed them...
          She takes his hand.

                          MIRANDA
           Let's find a window.

                         

          INT. GREAT ROOM, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS (END OF DAY)

          They force the French windows - enter, brushing off the
          rain.

                          MIRANDA
           Fox worked the board like you've
           never seen - I'm in, Daggett's out
           and he's not happy.
          Wayne sets down the newspaper:

          FROM BILLIONAIRE TO BUM

           81.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Hope you don't like me for your
           money.
          Miranda kicks off her shoes. Glances at the paper.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Suffering builds character.
          Then at a photo of Wayne's parents.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           I'll take care of your parents'
           legacy, Bruce.
          Miranda picks up a photo of Rachel.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Who's this?
          Wayne looks at her. Can't find words...

                          MIRANDA
           Where's Alfred?

                          WAYNE
           He left. Taking everything.
          Miranda puts the photo down. Kisses him. Passionately. Then
          again. He kisses back. Suddenly the lights go out.

                          MIRANDA
           What's that?

                         

                          WAYNE

                          (SHEEPISH)
           I think my power's been shut off.

                         

          INT. SAME - LATER (NIGHT)


                         
          Wayne watches as Miranda tends to a roaring fire.

                          WAYNE
           You're pretty good at that.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           When I was a child we had almost
           nothing. But on the nights we had a
           fire, we felt very rich indeed.
          She returns to him, pulling a blanket around both of them.

           82.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I assumed your family was wealthy.

                          MIRANDA
           Not always. Not when I was young.

                         
          He traces a scar on her shoulder.

                          MIRANDA
           An old mistake.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I've made a few myself.
          She turns to him, tracing the scars across his chest.

                          MIRANDA
           More than a few... (Smiles.) We
           could leave. Tonight. Take my
           plane. Go anywhere we wanted.

                          WAYNE
           Someday perhaps. Not tonight.
          She pulls him close. He kisses her. They fold into each
          other, the warm heart at the center of a vast, cold room.

                         

                         

          INT. GREAT ROOM, WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

          Miranda is sleeping, wrapped in the blanket. Wayne studies
          her for a moment, then slips out...

                         

                         

          INT. BATCAVE - MOMENTS LATER

          Wayne moves to the Batsuit. Picks up the cowl.

                         

          EXT. SKIES ABOVE GOTHAM - NIGHT


                         
          The Bat roars towards downtown. Batman kills the lights and
          main engines - the Bat quietly autorotates into the canyons.

                         

          INT. MIA TUNNEL - LATER


                         
          Catwoman on a wall, watching trains go by. She senses...

                          CATWOMAN
           Don't be shy.

                         
          ...Batman is there.

           83.

                         

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           Wayne says you can get me the
           'Clean Slate'.

                          BATMAN
           That depends.

                          CATWOMAN
           On what?

                          BATMAN
           On what you want it for. I acquired
           it to keep it out of the wrong
           hands.

                          CATWOMAN
           Still don't trust me, huh? How can
           we change that?

                          BATMAN
           Start by taking me to Bane.

                          CATWOMAN

                          (SHRUGS)
           You asked.
          Catwoman jumps down. Batman follows. Catwoman leads him down
          into a service tunnel...

                         

                         

          INT. SERVICE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

          Catwoman speaks over her shoulder as she walks.

                          CATWOMAN
           From here, Bane's men patrol the
           tunnels...and they are not your
           average brawlers.

                          BATMAN
           Neither am I.
          Catwoman swings into a -

                         

          INT. SEWER TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS


                         
          A Mercenary patrols. Catwoman comes up behind.

                          CATWOMAN
           He's behind you.

           84.

                         

                         

                          MERCENARY

                          (SPINS)
           Who?
          Batman hangs upside down behind him.

                         

           BATMAN (O.S.)
           Me.
          Darkness smashes onto the Mercenary. Gunfire in the tunnel.
          Catwoman races along, pursued by a Mercenary. He is yanked
          off his feet by darkness - he screams...
          Batman picks off more and more Mercenaries. Screams echo...
          Batman follows Catwoman through the dark tunnel.

                          CATWOMAN
           Just a little further.
          A grate slams down, separating them - the lights come on. He
          is deep inside.

                         

                         

          INT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

          Mercenaries look down on him from above. Catwoman turns.

                          CATWOMAN
           I had to find a way to stop them
           trying to kill me.

                          BATMAN
           You've made a serious mistake.

           BANE (O.S.)
           Not as serious as yours, I fear.
          Batman turns. Bane emerges from behind the waterfalls.

                          BATMAN
           Bane.

                          BANE
           Let's not stand on ceremony here,
           Mr. Wayne.

                         
          Catwoman hears the name. Less sure of what she's done.
          Batman moves at Bane - strikes powerful blows - Bane catches
          his fist.

                          BANE
           Peace has cost you strength.
           Victory has defeated you.

           85.

                         

                         
          Bane SMASHES Batman back - kicks him off the catwalk -
          Batman drops, uses his cape to land. Bane climbs down on a
          chain - his men watch in disciplined silence - Batman hurls
          flashbangs at Bane, who doesn't flinch.

                         

                          BANE
           Theatricality and deception are
           powerful agents...to the
           uninitiated.
          Batman lashes out at Bane - Bane counters - they separate.

                         

                          BANE
           But we are initiated, aren't we,
           Bruce? The League of Shadows. And
           you betrayed us...

                         

                          BATMAN
           Us? You were excommunicated. From a
           gang of psychopaths.

                          BANE
           Now I am the League of Shadows,
           here to fulfill R¯'s al Gh¯l's

                          A U
           destiny...
          Batman hurls himself at Bane, throwing him into the
          waterfall, where he smashes his fists and gauntlets into
          Bane's mask again and again, water cascading over them.

                         
          Bane is not moving. Just taking the blows. Batman pauses.
          Bane's arms SHOOT OUT, SMASHING Batman aside - Bane RISES...

                          BANE
           You fight like a younger man.
           Nothing held back. No reserves.
           Admirable. But mistaken.
          Batman hits a switch on his belt - the lights go out - Bane
          turns slowly addressing all the shadows at once.

                         

                          BANE
           You think darkness is your ally.
           But you merely adopted the dark. I
           was born in it. Formed by it...

                         
          In the shadows, Batman circles, looking to strike...

                          BANE
           I didn't see the light until I was
           already a man. And by then it was
           nothing to me but blinding...

           86.

                         

                         
          Bane lunges backwards into the darkness - Batman's throat in
          his grasp.

                          BANE
           The shadows betray you, because
           they belong to me...

                         
          Bane SMASHES him into the ground, POUNDING, pounding,
          pounding the hard cowl with his bare fists until it CRACKS.
          Bane RISES from Batman, gestures to the ceiling of the
          chamber - explosive charges have been drilled into holes...

                          BANE
           I will show you where I've made my
           home while preparing to bring
           justice. Then...I will break you.

                         
          A Mercenary tosses Bane a detonator - Batman watches through
          cracked cowl - Bane hits the detonator - explosions BURST
          over his head as the ceiling CRUMBLES revealing:
          Applied Sciences - Bane has dropped the bottom out of Fox's
          weapons store...a camouflage Tumbler rests in the rubble.

                          BATMAN
           No...

                          BANE
           Your precious armory. Gratefully
           accepted. We will need it.

                         

          INT. APPLIED SCIENCES - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Mercenaries race through the stacks of equipment...

                         

          INT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

          Batman climbs to his feet, swaying. Bane approaches.

                         

                          BANE
           I wondered which would break first
           - your spirit...

                         
          Batman SWINGS at him - misses - Bane GRABS him, lifts him

          HIGH.
           ...or your body.
          Bane brings Batman down onto his knee, BREAKING his back
          with a horrific CRACK.

           87.

                         

                         
          In the shadows, Catwoman looks on. Shocked. Bane crouches to
          pull the broken cowl off the broken Wayne. Mercenaries lift
          Wayne's body and carry him off... Bane stares into the
          hollow eyes of his trophy...

                         
          Catwoman slinks back into the shadows, and we -

           FADE TO BLACK.

                          FADE IN:

                         

                         

          EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

          Blake's cruiser pulls up. He noses up to the windows.
          Nothing.

                         

                         

          EXT. SELINA'S BUILDING, OLD TOWN, GOTHAM - DAY

          Blake sits in his cruiser. Selina exits, wide-brimmed hat,
          bags. Blake recognizes her. She hails a cab.

                         

                          BLAKE

                          (INTO RADIO)
           Get Commissioner Gordon. Tell him
           I've got a line on the
           Congressman's kidnapping.

                         
          Blake pulls out to follow.

                         

          INT. TERMINAL, GOTHAM INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

          Selina moves through the terminal. She clocks a Uniform Cop
          staring at her - ducks down a service hallway.

                         

          INT. SERVICE HALLWAY, AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

          The Uniform rounds the corner to find Selina applying
          make-up.

                          UNIFORM
           Excuse me, Miss. I need to see your
           ticket and identification, please.

                         
          Selina, surprised, fumbles with her purse.

                          SELINA
           Would you mind?

           88.

                         

                         
          She hands the Uniform her hat - punches him through the
          brim, stuffs him in a closet - plants her mangled hat on his
          head.

                         

                         

          INT. JETWAY, AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

          Selina makes her way down the jetway - spots Security at the
          far end - turns - Blake smiles at her. Badge in hand.

                         

                         

          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, AIRPORT - DAY

          Selina, now in cuffs, looks up as Blake walks in.

                          BLAKE
           I showed your picture to the
           Congressman and guess what?

                          SELINA
           Don't tell me, still in love?

                          BLAKE
           Head over heels. Pressing charges,
           though.
          Blake lays a police file down with a thump.
           You've made some mistakes, Ms.
           Kyle.

                         

                          SELINA
           Girl's gonna eat.

                          BLAKE
           You have an appetite. Why run? You
           can't hide from us with this
           record.

                          SELINA
           Maybe it's not you I'm running
           from.

                          BLAKE
           Who then? Bane? What do you know
           about him?

                         

                          SELINA

                          (QUIET)
           That you should be as afraid of him
           as I am.

           89.

                         

                         

                          BLAKE
           We can offer you protection...
          Selina looks at him with contempt. Blake shrugs, switches
          off the tape, moves to the door.

                         

                          BLAKE
           When I spotted you, I was looking
           for a friend...Bruce Wayne.
          Selina turns to look at Blake. His eyes plead with her.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Did they kill him?

                          SELINA
           I'm not sure.

                         
          And we -

                          CUT TO:
          BLACK SCREEN. Sounds: screaming, laughing, CRYING. Sights:
          LIGHT, bodies FALLING, a DARK SKULL... And we are -

                         

          INT. STONE CELL - DAWN

          Wayne opens his eyes. Unshaven. Filthy. Someone else is in
          the cell - Wayne cannot move to look - even the attempt is
          painful...the skull drifts into his sight. Bane. Squatting
          at Wayne's bedside, muscled shoulders curving into his mask.

                          WAYNE
           Why didn't you just kill me?

                         

                          BANE
           You don't fear death. You welcome
           it. Your punishment is to be more
           severe.

                         

                          WAYNE

                          (SCATHING)
           You're a torturer...

                          BANE
           Yes. But not of your body. Of your
           soul.
          Wayne exhales. Eyes losing focus from sheer pain.

           90.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Where am I?

                          BANE
           Home.

                         
          Wayne's eyes dart about: filthy stone walls, distant
          sunlight from above, iron bars: an underground prison.
           Where I learned the truth about
           despair. As will you. (Rises.)
           There is a reason that this prison
           is the worst hell on earth...
          Bane steps to the bars - looks up at a bright opening five
          hundred feet above. Like being at the bottom of a gigantic
          well...
           Hope. Every man who has rotted here
           over the centuries has looked up to
           the light and imagined climbing to
           freedom. So simple. So easy. And,
           like shipwrecked men turning to sea
           water from uncontrollable thirst,
           many have died trying. I learned
           that there can be no true despair
           without hope. (Turns to Wayne.) So
           as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed
           its people hope to poison their
           souls. I will let them believe they
           can survive so that you can watch
           them clamber over each other to
           stay in the sun...
          Bane points to an old TV, just outside the bars.
           You will watch as I torture an
           entire city to cause you pain you
           thought you could never feel again.
           Then, when you have truly
           understood the depths of your
           failure, we will fulfill R¯'s al

                          A
           Gh¯l's destiny. We will destroy

                          U
           Gotham. And when it is done...when
           Gotham is ashes...then you have my
           permission to die.
          Bane rises. Leaves. Wayne drifts back to unconsciousness.

                         

                         

          EXT. BLACKGATE PRISON - DAY

          A van pulls through the gate. Selina, inside the van, looks
          up at the formidable grey building.

           91.

                         

          INT. BLACKGATE PRISON - CONTINUOUS

          Guards lead Selina down the cells. Whistles and catcalls.

                         

                          GUARD
           We're locking her up in here?

                          WARDEN
           The Dent Act allows non-segregation
           based on extraordinary need. First
           time she broke out of women's
           correctional she was sixteen.
          Selina passes a Huge Inmate who strains through the bars...

                         

                          HUGE INMATE
           Little closer, baby...

                          SELINA
           Why, honey, you wanna hold my hand?

                         
          Without breaking step, she slips his outstretched hands
          between her handcuffed ones and cartwheels, snapping his
          arms - he screams in agony - she keeps walking...

                          WARDEN
           She'll be just fine.

                         

                         

          INT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES - DAY

          Fox comes out of the elevator with Miranda.

                         

                          FOX
           I don't see the need for a board
           meeting on the energy project -

                          MIRANDA
           Bruce got a lot of things right.
           Keeping the board in the dark
           wasn't one of them...
          Fox swings the doors to the boardroom open...

                         

                         

          INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES - CONTINUOUS

          The board is there. Scared. At the head of the table - Bane.

                          BANE
           This meeting is called to order.
          Fox and Miranda freeze. Staring at the mask.

           92.

                         

                         

                          BANE
           Chair and President. I also need
           one ordinary member - Mr. Fox,
           would you care to nominate?

                         

                          FREDERICKS
           No. I volunteer.
          The dignified older board member gets to his feet.
          Mercernaries round the three up.

                         

                          FOX
           Where are you taking us?

                          BANE
           Where you buried your resources.
           The bowels of Gotham.

                         

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

          Gordon, with a Nurse's help, pulls himself to a seated
          position as Blake watches.

                         

                          GORDON
           So you think our friend is gone
           again?

                          BLAKE

                          (GRAVE)
           This time...he might not be coming
           back.
          Gordon takes this in...Foley bursts in, agitated.

                         

                          FOLEY
           Okay, Commissioner, you were right.

                          GORDON
           What's happened?

                         

                          FOLEY
           Your masked man kidnapped the Wayne
           Enterprises board. He let most of
           them go, but took three down into
           the sewers.

                         

                          GORDON
           No more patrols, no more hide and
           seek. Send every available cop
           down there to smoke him out.

           93.

                         

                         

                          FOLEY
           The Mayor won't want panic -

                          BLAKE
           So it's a training exercise.

                         
          Foley looks at Gordon.

                          FOLEY
           I'm sorry for not taking you

                          SERIOUSLY -

                         

                          GORDON
           Don't apologize for believing the
           world's in better shape then it
           is...just fight to make it true.

                         
          Foley nods. Leaves. Blake gets up.

                          GORDON
           Not you. You're telling me the
           Batman's gone. So you chase up the
           Daggett leads, any way you can.

                         
          Blake nods.

                         

          INT. STONE CELL, UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY


                         
          Wayne lies, weak, feverish. A Prisoner drips water onto his
          parched lips. An elderly Blind Prisoner squatting by the
          wall in the next cell rasps something in an ancient tongue.

                          PRISONER
           He asks if you would pay us to let
           you die. I told him you have
           nothing.

                          WAYNE
           Do it for the pleasure.

                         
          The Prisoner puts bread to Wayne's lips.

                          PRISONER
           They pay me more than that to keep
           you alive.

                         
          A chant gets Wayne's attention. He rolls his head painfully
          to watch a Tattooed Prisoner hand a thick rope to a Strong
          Man, who ties it around his chest, watched by other
          Prisoners.

           94.

                         

                         

                          PRISONER
           He will try the climb.
          Strong Man starts scaling the wall. The Prisoners' chant
          grows stronger as he climbs towards the light.

                         
          Above: Strong Man stops, perched on a ledge, a twelve-foot
          leap from the rest of the climb... The chanting peaks as
          Strong Man leaps...misses...falls. The rope catches - he
          swings into the rock face. Prisoners fall silent as Strong
          Man is lowered, broken, bloody, to the prison floor.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Has anyone made it?

                          PRISONER
           Of course not.

                         
          The Blind Prisoner barks at him.

                          WAYNE
           What does he say?

                         

                          PRISONER
           He says there is one who did. A
           child...
          INSERT CUT: a child of about ten looks up towards the light.

                         

                          PRISONER
           A child who had been born in this
           hell...

                          WAYNE
           Bane.

                         

                          PRISONER
           An old legend. Nothing more.
          The Prisoner leaves Wayne's cell - switches on the TV.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Don't.

                          PRISONER
           Whatever they want you to
           see...it's happening soon.

           95.

                         

                         

          INT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - DAY

          Bane's men lead Fox, Miranda and Fredericks through the
          debris. Fox stares at Mercenaries working on his old
          inventions...

                         

                         

          EXT. LOCATIONS AROUND GOTHAM - EVENING

          SWATs and Cops mass around entrances to sewers, tunnels...

                         

                         

          INT. MASSIVE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

          Bane leads Fox and the others to where Mercenaries plant
          charges on a hewn wall. Dr. Pavel is here. Waiting. Bane
          nods at his men. The wall blows.

                         

                         

          EXT. LOCATIONS AROUND GOTHAM - CONTINUOUS

          A SWAT team about to enter a sewer pipe hear a low echoing
          boom. They look at each other, then head in. Thousands of
          Police head into manholes, tunnel entrances, checking
          weapons, using flashlights...

                         

          INT. MASSIVE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Bane leads the way over rubble into the REACTOR. Dr. Pavel
          follows. Bane approaches the machine. Turns to Fox.

                          BANE
           Turn it on.

                         
          Fox shakes his head. Bane holds his gun to Fredericks' head.

                          BANE
           I only need one other board member.
           There are eight more waiting
           upstairs.

                         

                          FOX
           I won't do it.
          Fredericks trembles. Bane cocks the weapon.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Alright, stop.
          She walks up to the scanner. Places her hand on it. It
          beeps. She turns to Fox. Quietly pleading.

           96.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Lucius, you'll kill this man and
           yourself, and barely slow them
           down.
          Fox reluctantly puts his hand on the scanner. Then
          Fredericks. The core glows brighter and brighter. Dr. Pavel
          is transfixed.

                         

                          BANE
           Do your work.
          Bane turns to his men. Gestures at the hostages.
           Take them to the surface. People of
           their status deserve to see the
           next era of western civilization.
          Fox, Miranda and Fredericks are led back into the rubble.

                          REPORTER
           We're seeing literally thousands of
           police heading into the sewers -

                          MAYOR
           A training exercise, that's all. If
           you'll excuse me, I've got tickets
           to watch our boys thrash Rapid

          The Mayor heads into the stadium with the crowds...

           Anything strange about the

          Blake glances at a large map - dots mark pouring locations.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Honestly, Commissioner, I don't
           know anything about civil
           engineering.

          Blake is led through a fence by a Worker.

                         

                          WORKER
           Boss is about to leave.
          Blake walks past cement mixers. Spots someone. A Driver.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Hey.
          The Driver turns.

                          BLAKE
           That was you outside the stock
           exchange, right?

                          DRIVER
           When?

                         

                          BLAKE
           When? When half the city's cops
           were trying to pull onto Castle
           Street and your truck shut them
           out.

           Detective, now.

                         
          Behind Blake the Worker puts his hand is his pocket...

                          BLAKE
           And as a detective...I'm not
           allowed to believe in coincidences

                          ANYMORE -
          Blake spins, drawing his weapon. The Worker lunges with a
          knife, Blake smashes his hand to one side and shoots him.
          The Driver grabs him from behind. Blake wrestles, but the
          Driver is strong, trained. Blake can't aim his gun, he fires
          behind, into a steel mixer - the bullets ricochet, one
          catches the Driver in the back and he goes down... Blake,
          gasping, kneels beside the Driver.

                          BLAKE
           What were you doing?! What?!

                         
          The man dies. Blake looks down at his gun. Disgusted. Tosses
          is down. Pulls out his phone. Dials.

          Blake freezes, stooped to pick up his gun. Looking at some
          empty barrels...
           Commissioner, they've got
           Polyisobutylene here... (Looks

           As the situation develops, one

                          BLAKE
           What does that mean?

           These men, locked up in Blackgate

          Wayne rolls off his cot. Grunts. The Prisoner realizes Wayne
          is trying to do a push-up. From the next cell, the Blind
          Prisoner says something...

                         

                          PRISONER
           He says you must first straighten
           your back.
          The Prisoner helps Wayne roll over, painfully.

           How would he know?

                          PRISONER
           He was the prison doctor. A
           morphine addict who incurred the
           displeasure of powerful people.
           Including your masked friend.

                          WAYNE

                          PRISONER
           Many years ago, during a time of
           plague, Bane was attacked by other
           prisoners. The doctor's fumbling
           attempts to repair the damage left
           him in perpetual agony. The mask
           holds his pain at bay.

                          WAYNE
           Is Bane the child you spoke of? Was
           he born here?

                         

                          PRISONER
           The legend is that there was a
           mercenary working for the local
           warlord who fell in love with his
           daughter. They married in secret.

                         
          The Prisoner takes a rope - ties it under Wayne's arms.

                          PRISONER
           When the warlord found out, he
           condemned the mercenary to this
           pit. But then exiled him instead.

           The mercenary understood that the
           warlord's daughter had secured his
           release, but he couldn't know the
           true price of his freedom. She had
           taken his place in the pit.

           innocence was their redemption. The
           mother was not so lucky.
          The Blind Prisoner shouts at the Prisoner. He nods.

                         

                          PRISONER
           This is Bane's prison now. Bane
           would not want this story told.
          The Prisoner pulls - Wayne screams in pain as he is pulled
          upright. The Prisoner ties him off. Checks his spine.
           You have a protruding
           vertebra...I'm going to force it
           back...

           How -?

                         
          The Prisoner punches Wayne in the back, hard. Wayne screams.

                          PRISONER
           You stay like this. Until you
           stand.

           Captain, glad to have you here.

           120.

                         

                         

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           How many of you are there?

                          GORDON
           Dozens. I'd rather not say exactly.
           But the men trapped underground
           number almost three thousand.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           What kind of shape they're in?

                         

                          GORDON
           They've been getting water, food.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           Could we break them out?

                         

                          BLAKE
           Yes, sir - take out the mercenaries
           guarding the outflow south of
           Ackerman Park, blow the rubble,
           you've got a hole big enough for
           ten at a time. I'm in contact with
           my partner - they're waiting for
           the day.

                          SPECIAL FORCES 2
           Men who haven't seen daylight for
           three months?

                         

                          BLAKE
           Men with automatic weapons who
           haven't seen daylight in three
           months.

                         

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           What about the bomb? The satellites
           can't see any radiation hot
           spots...

                         

                         

          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY

          Blake scouts with Jones. A rumble makes them turn.

           GORDON (V.O.)
           They keep it on a truck - it must
           have a lead-lined roof. They move
           it constantly.

           CAPTAIN JONES (V.O.)
           But you know the truck?

           121.

                         

                         

           GORDON (V.O.)
           They've got three of them. The
           routes don't vary much.
          Two Tumblers lead a massive black truck down the street.
          Captain Jones reaches into his jacket and triggers a Geiger
          counter. Shows Blake the display. Nods. One of the Tumblers
          stops, turns back. Blake leads them down a side street.

                         

          INT. LOWER STOREROOM - CONTINUOUS


                         

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           What about the triggerman?

                          GORDON
           No leads. It's a bluff - Bane
           wouldn't give control of that bomb
           to someone else.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           We can't take that chance. Until we
           have the triggerman, we just track
           the device, smuggle men over -

                          BLAKE
           While Gotham lives under a warlord,
           like in some failed state?

                         

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           Dial it back, officer. This
           situation is unprecedented. We
           can't do anything to risk millions
           of lives.

                         

                          BLAKE

                          (TO GORDON)
           Aren't you gonna tell him?!

                          GORDON
           Captain, things are more
           complicated than you think. There's
           somebody you need to meet. Blake?
          Blake nods, leads Jones and his men up the stairs.

                         

                         

          EXT. SIDE STREET, DOWNTOWN - CONTINUOUS

          Blake leads them to the door of an empty bank.

           122.

                         

                         

          INT. TELLSONS BANK - CONTINUOUS

          They head across the empty lobby to an elevator.

                         

          INT. OFFICES ABOVE TELLSONS - MOMENTS LATER


                         
          Blake leads them into empty offices. Cots and makeshift
          furnishings line the offices and corridors.

                          BLAKE
           I was up here looking for a vantage
           point. Found the people who run the
           corporation who owns it living
           here.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           Which corporation?

           FOX (O.S.)
           Wayne Enterprises.
          Lucius Fox is there, with Miranda Tate.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Captain, meet Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox, I'd
           like you to brief the Captain.
          Captain Jones indicates Miranda.

                         

                          FOX
           Miss Tate is fully aware of the
           situation.

                          MIRANDA
           And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises, I
           have to take responsibility for it.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           Why?

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Because, Captain, we built it.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           You built the bomb?

                         

                          FOX
           It was built as a fusion reactor.
           The first of its kind. Bane turned
           the core into a bomb, then
           disconnected it from the reactor.

           123.

                         

                         

                          BLAKE
           And here's the important part.

                          FOX
           As the device's fuel cells decay,
           it's becoming increasingly
           unstable...until the point of
           detonation.

                          BLAKE
           The bomb's a time bomb.

                         

                          FOX
           And it will go off. In twenty-three
           days.
          Captain Jones reels at this news.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Bane's revolution is a sham. He's
           watching Gotham rearrange its
           deckchairs while the whole ship's
           going down. Your appeasement plan
           might not be as practical as you
           thought.
          Captain Jones throws Blake a look. Addresses Fox.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           Could you disarm it?

                          FOX
           I don't know, But I could reconnect
           it to the reactor. Stabilize it.

                         

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           We'd have to let the Pentagon know.

                          SPECIAL FORCES 2
           They'll be monitoring our

                          FREQUENCIES -

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           We have no choice. Let's move away
           from this location, then call it
           in.

           124.

                         

                         

          INT. TELLSONS BANK - MOMENTS LATER

          Captain Jones exits the elevator, followed by his men and
          Blake. Halfway across the floor, hell breaks loose.
          Mercenaries blast them with machine guns - the lobby becomes
          a devastating ambush. Blake dives back into the elevator.

           Fox, somebody sold us out!
          Fox and Miranda burst into the corridor.

                         

                          FOX
           Take Miranda -
          Blake grabs Miranda, heads for the back stairs. Mercenaries
          jump out of the elevator, firing high.

                         

                          MERCERNARY

           DOWN ON THE FLOOR!
          Fox freezes. Lowers himself to the ground.

                         

                         

          INT. TELLSONS BANK - CONTINUOUS

          Captain Jones goes down in a hail of bullets. The other
          Special Forces Men are down. Bane enters, midges Jones with
          his toe. He is alive. Barely. Bane leans in close. Jones
          looks up at him, defiant.

                         

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           I'll die before I talk...

                          BANE
           I'm on your schedule, Captain.

                         
          Bane places his hand over Jones's nose and mouth.

                          MERCERNARY
           There were people living upstairs.

                         
          Bane looks up, disinterested. Jones is dead.

                          BANE
           Give them over for judgement.
           (Indicates bodies.) Hang them where
           the world will see.

          INT. STONE CELL, UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY

          Wayne stares at the TV: the Special Forces bodies hang in
          the cables of Gotham Bridge. Wayne throws a stone into the
          screen.

                         

          INT. SAME - LATER


                         
          Wayne does endless push-ups, squats, stretches. The Blind
          Prisoner listens. He speaks in an ancient tongue.

                          PRISONER
           He says the leap to freedom is not
           about strength.

                         

                          WAYNE
           My body makes the jump.

                          (CRACKED ENGLISH)
           Survival is the spirit. The soul.

                          WAYNE
           My soul's as ready to escape as my
           body.

                         

                          BLIND PRISONER
           Fear is why you fail.

                          WAYNE
           I'm not afraid. I'm angry.

                         
          Wayne throws punches...focused.

                         

          INT. UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY


                         
          Wayne takes the rope at the foot of the climb. Prisoners
          look up, but none bother to gather round. Wayne starts
          climbing, determined.
          He FIGHTS the rock face...breathing hard. Grabs at a rock -
          it comes away in his hand. He DROPS - SMASHES into the rock
          face. The Blind Prisoner shakes his head.
          A Skinny Prisoner playing cards with the Prisoner looks up
          at Wayne, hanging upside down.

                          SKINNY PRISONER
           Shouldn't you get him down?
          The Prisoner glances up at Wayne, disdainful.

           126.

                         

                         

                          PRISONER
           He'll keep.
          As Wayne drifts into unconsciousness we -

          looking up at his father, lowering down to rescue him.

           THOMAS WAYNE (V.O.)
           And why do we fall?

                         

                         

          INT. CAVE PRISON - NIGHT

          Wayne wakes with a start - the Blind Prisoner is there.

                          BLIND PRISONER

                          (CRACKED ENGLISH)
           You do not fear death. You think
           this makes you strong. This makes
           you weak.

                          WAYNE
           Why?

                          BLIND PRISONER
           How can you move faster then
           possible? Fight longer than
           possible? If not from the most
           powerful impulse of the spirit. The
           fear of death. The will to survive.
          Wayne gets up onto his elbow. Looks at the Blind Prisoner.

                          WAYNE
           I do fear death. I fear dying in
           here while my city burns with no
           one there to save it.

                          BLIND PRISONER
           Then make the climb.

                          WAYNE
           How?

                          BLIND PRISONER
           As the child did. Without the rope.
           (Dry laugh.) Then fear will find
           you again.
          Wayne considers this.

           127.

                         

                         

          INT. CAVE PRISON - MORNING

          Wayne puts some scraps of bread into a rough coat which he
          folds into a makeshift shoulder pack.

                          PRISONER
           Supplies for your journey?
          Prisoners nearby laugh. Wayne moves to the cliff face. The
          Prisoner follows, intrigued by Wayne's new demeanor. The
          Tattooed Prisoner offers him the rope. Wayne refuses. Starts
          to climb. Prisoners gather around as word spreads. Wayne
          makes his way cautiously up the treacherous rock face. Down
          below the Prisoners start a low chant.
          As Wayne hoists himself up onto the precipice something
          EXPLODES from the cliff face. Wayne flinches - BATS... They
          circle up to the opening above...
          Wayne closes his eyes. The chant RISES. Wayne takes a
          breath...opens his eyes...looks down at the drop...up
          again...then he jumps.

                         
          Time skips a beat as the Prisoners stop breathing.
          And Wayne GRABS the ledge above.
          The Prisoners go WILD as Wayne hoists himself up onto the
          ledge. The Blind Prisoner nods. Wayne climbs to FREEDOM.

                         

                         

          EXT. CAVE PRISON, NEAR A FORTRESS - CONTINUOUS

          Wayne climbs out of the hole and into formidable desolation.
          He shoulders his pack - spots a large coil of rope attached
          to the wall. He pushes it into the hole then walks away...

                         

          INT. BASEMENT, ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY

          A mass of huddled Gothamites. Professionals (traders,
          industrialists). In a corner, Fox. Mercenaries come down
          into the chamber, pull out a man, who starts yelling. It is
          Stryver, Daggett's functionary.

                          STRYVER
           I want to see Bane! There's been a
           mistake! Take me to Bane!
          Fox watches him dragged upstairs...

           128.

                         

                         

          INT. ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - MOMENTS LATER

          A kangaroo court. Stryver is dragged before a jeering crowd.

                          STRYVER
           There's been a mistake! Where's
           Bane?!

           VOICE (O.S.)
           There's been no mistake, Mr.
           Stryver.

                         
          Stryver turns to look at the 'judge': Dr. Jonathan Crane.

                          CRANE
           You are Philip Stryver, executive
           vice-president of Daggett
           Industries? (Off nod from Stryver.)
           The same Philip Stryver who for
           years lived like a prince off the
           blood and sweat of people less
           powerful?

                         

                          STRYVER
           Call Bane! I'm one of you!
          Jeers. Pull back to reveal a silent figure, watching. Bane.

                          CRANE
           Bane has no authority here. This is
           merely a sentencing hearing. The
           choice is yours, death or exile.
          Stryver looks around, terrified, as the crowd shouts
          'Death'.

                         

                          STRYVER
           Exile.

                          CRANE

                          (SMASHES GAVEL)
           Sold...to the man in the cold
           sweat!
          Mercenaries pull Stryver from the dock...

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM RIVER - DAY

          Stryver, with other wealthy Gothamites, is led down to the
          ice. A Blackgate Inmate undoes his handcuffs, whispering.

           129.

                         

                         

                          BLACKGATE INMATE
           Follow the tick ice. Try to swim -
           you're dead in minutes.

                          STRYVER
           Has anyone made it?
          The Blackgate Inmate turns away. Stryver is forced onto the
          ice. He shuffles forward, listening to the creaking...
          Stryver is a hundred yards out when the river swallows him.

                         

                         

          INT. EMPTY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

          Gordon stands over a map of the city. A handful of Cops sit
          around the room. Waiting. Gordon looks at his watch.

                         

                          GORDON
           Where the hell are they? It's not
           like we have a lot of time, here.

                          COP
           How long?

                          GORDON
           The bomb goes off tomorrow. We've
           got about eighteen hours to do
           something.

                         

                          COP
           To do what?

                          GORDON
           We mark that truck. Get a GPS on
           it, then we can start thinking
           about how to take it down.
          The door opens and Blake enters, followed by ten cops.
          Gordon is counting them in. He moves to Blake.

                         

                          GORDON

                          (LOW)
           That's it?
          Blake just looks at him. Gordon checks the faces. Realizes.

                         

                          GORDON
           Foley. Where's Foley, dammit?!
          Gordon heads for the door.

           130.

                         

                         

                          BLAKE
           You shouldn't be out on the streets

                          -

                         

                         

          EXT. FOLEY'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

          Gordon hurries up the steps to a brownstone. Stabs the bell.

                          FOLEY'S WIFE
           Jim. He's not here -

                         
          Gordon, furious, addresses the hallway behind her.

                          GORDON
           You're sending your wife to the
           door when the city's under
           occupation?!
          Foley appears at the end of the corridor. Ashamed.

                          FOLEY
           Wait in the kitchen, honey.

                         

                          GORDON
           What did you do, bury your uniform
           in the backyard?

                          FOLEY
           Jim, you saw what they did to those
           Special Forces.

                          GORDON
           You forgotten all the years we went
           out on patrol with every gangbanger
           wanting to plant one as soon as our
           backs were turned?

                          FOLEY
           This is different and you know it.
           These guys run the city - the
           government's done a deal with them

                          -

                          GORDON
           Deal?! Bane's got their balls in a
           vice. That's not a deal -

                          FOLEY
           You move against Bane, the
           triggerman's gonna hit the button -

           131.

                         

                         

                          GORDON
           You think he's given control of
           that bomb to one of 'the people'?!
           You think this is part of some
           revolution? There's one man with
           his finger on the button - Bane.

                          FOLEY
           We have to keep our heads down
           until they can fix this. If you
           still had family here maybe you'd -

                         

                          GORDON
           This only gets fixed from inside
           the city, Foley. (Calmer.) Look,
           I'm not asking you to walk down
           Grand in your dress blues. But
           we've got to do something before
           this maniac blows us all to hell.

                          FOLEY
           I'm sorry Jim. I gotta -

                         

                          GORDON
           Keep your head down? What's that
           gonna do tomorrow, when that thing
           blows?

                          FOLEY
           You don't know that's going to
           happen.
          Foley closes the door on Gordon. Gordon stands there.

                         

           MIRANDA (O.S)
           I hear you're looking for men,
           Commissioner.
          Gordon turns to see Miranda, Blake behind her. Blake shrugs.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           How about me, instead?

                          GORDON
           Miss Tate, I can't ask you -

                         

                          MIRANDA
           My company built it.

                          GORDON
           Bruce Wayne built it.

           132.

                         

                         

                          MIRANDA
           And he wanted to destroy it. It was
           me who didn't listen. Please.
          Gordon looks at Blake. Then Miranda. Nods.

                         

                          GORDON
           Let's go.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREET - DAY


                         
          A Kid sprints down the deserted street, chased by two
          Gangbangers. The Kid slips in the snow - the men are on him.

                          GANGBANGER
           You steal from us, you little
           bastard?
          They grab the Kid's backpack, the Gangbanger pulls out an
          apple, moves to hit the Kid when - SMACK! - his hand is
          grabbed, and the apple flies into the air as his arm cracks.
          Selina catches the apple.

                         

                          SELINA
           You boys know you can't come into
           my neighborhood without asking
           politely.

                         
          Gangbanger 2 lunges with a knife - she spins him, making him
          stab himself in the backside. The Gangbangers run off,
          howling. The Kid eyes her, wary.

                          SELINA
           Never steal anything from someone
           you can't outrun, kid.

                          KID
           Now you're gonna take it.

                         
          Selina looks at the red apple. Takes one perfect bite.

                          SELINA
           Just tax.
          She tosses him the apple. He takes it and runs.

                         

           WAYNE (O.S.)
           Pretty generous, for a thief.
          Selina recognizes the voice. Turns to find Wayne - strong,
          but weathered. Beard, work clothes.

           133.

                         

                         

                          SELINA
           You came back. I thought they'd
           killed you.

                          WAYNE
           Not yet.

                          SELINA
           If you're expecting an apology -

                          WAYNE
           It wouldn't suit you. I need your
           help.

                          SELINA
           And why would I help you?

                         
          Wayne pulls a USB drive out of his pocket.

                          WAYNE
           For this. The 'Clean Slate'.

                          SELINA
           You're gonna trust me with that?
           After what I did to you?

                          WAYNE
           I admit I felt a little let down.
           But I still think there's more to
           you. In fact, I think for you -
           (indicates USB) this isn't a tool,
           it's an escape route. You want to
           disappear. Start fresh.

                         
          She looks at him. Takes the drive, staring at it.

                          SELINA
           Start fresh? I can't even get off
           this island.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I can give you a way off. Once
           you've gotten me to Lucius Fox. I
           need you to find out where they're
           holding him. Then take me in.

                         

                          SELINA
           Why do you need Fox?

                          WAYNE
           To save this city.

           134.

                         

                         

                          SELINA
           Who says it needs saving? Maybe I
           like it this way.

                          WAYNE
           Maybe you do. But tomorrow that
           bomb's going off.

                          SELINA
           Get your powerful friend on the
           case.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I'm trying. But I need Fox.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - DAY


                         
          Gordon and his Men are in two-man teams. Gordon is walking
          down the street with Miranda. He hands her a Geiger counter.

                          GORDON
           Stay further up the block. (Points
           at Men.) They're gonna cross the
           street and try and slow the truck
           down. As it approaches, hit this
           button. If the needle hits two
           hundred - give me the signal and I
           mark the truck. Okay?

                         

                          BLAKE

                          (OVER RADIO)
           Heads up.

                         
          Blake is up on a rooftop. Gordon moves down to the other end
          of the block. As the truck rumbles into view, Gordon's Men
          walk out into the street in front of it as if crossing the
          road. The convoy barely slows. Miranda gives Gordon the
          signal. As the truck comes past, he tosses a magnetic GPS
          locator at the lower part of the truck...

                         
          Gordon regroups with his Men on the corner. Checks his GPS.

                          GORDON
           Got it.

                         
          They keep moving, turning down the next street...into an
          ambush. Dozens of Mercenaries, weapons trained.

                          MERCENARY
           Commissioner Gordon, you're under
           arrest.

           135.

                         

                          GORDON
           On whose authority?

                          MERCERNARY
           The people of Gotham.

                         
          Blake, from his vantage point, watches Gordon, Miranda and
          the other Cops being rounded up and led away...

                         

          INT. BASEMENT, ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY


                         
          Miranda comforts a crying Woman in the corner. Thugs come
          down the stairs, laughing, leading a Hooded Prisoner. They
          kick him down the last step and he stumbles. Fox moves to
          his aid.

                         

                          BASEMENT THUG 1
           Find this one a spot, he's got a
           big day tomorrow.
          They dump the Hooded Man with Fox.

                         

                          BASEMENT THUG 2
           We all do. It's not every day you
           bag Bruce Wayne...
          Fox hears this. Pulls the bag from Wayne's head. Wayne nods
          at him, silent. Fox nods back. The Thugs leave. Miranda
          comes over.

                          MIRANDA
           Bruce?

                         

                          FOX
           You picked a hell of a time to go
           on vacation, Mr. Wayne.

                          WAYNE
           How long until the core ignites?

                         

                          FOX
           That bomb goes off in twelve hours.

                          WAYNE
           Unless we can connect it to the
           reactor.

                          FOX
           If you can get it there. I'll find
           a way to plug it back in.
           (Indicates Miranda.) Can you get
           Miranda out?

           136.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Not tonight. I'm sorry.

                          MIRANDA
           Do what's necessary.

                         

                          WAYNE

                          (TO FOX)
           Tonight I need you.

                          FOX
           What for?

                          WAYNE
           To get me back in the game.
          Catwoman comes down the stairs with the Thugs.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           Sorry to spoil things, boys, but
           Bane wants these guys himself...
          The thugs pull Wayne and Fox to their feet - Miranda looks
          up.

                          WAYNE
           I won't forget about you.

                          MIRANDA
           I know.

                         

          EXT. COLONNADE, HOLDING AREA - CONTINUOUS

          The Thugs lead Wayne and Fox along the colonnade. Catwoman
          spins, takes out one Thug with a heel, one with a punch to
          the throat. Fox smiles as she unlocks his wrists.

                          FOX
           I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           He should be so lucky.
          And she's gone. Fox turns to Wayne. Who shrugs.

                         

                         

          INT. DARK SPACE - NIGHT

          Lights flicker on... Wayne and Fox are in the Bat-Bunker.

           137.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Any move I make against Bane or the
           bomb - the triggerman sets it off.

                          FOX
           They can't be using radio or cell -
           too much interference. Infrared
           doesn't have the range. It could
           only be micro-burst long wave...
          Wayne opens a panel in the wall, takes out equipment:
          mini-mines, Batarangs, utility belt...

                          WAYNE
           Could you block it?

                          FOX
           Yes. I need the EMP cannon-guidance
           mount from the Bat. You remember
           where you parked?
          Wayne nods. Smiles. The Batsuit rises from the floor...

                         

                         

          INT. ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - EVENING (LATE DAY)

          Gordon and his men on trial. Crane presides.

                          CRANE
           The charges are espionage and
           attempted sabotage... Do you have
           anything to say in your defense?

                          GORDON
           No lawyer, no witnesses. What sort
           of due process is this?

                          CRANE
           More than you give Harvey's
           prisoners, Commissioner. Your guilt
           is determined, this is merely a
           sentencing hearing. What's it to
           be, death or exile?

                          GORDON
           Crane, if you think we are going
           willingly out onto that ice, you've
           got another think coming.

                          CRANE
           Death, then?

           138.

                         

                         

                          GORDON
           Looks that way.

                          CRANE
           Very well... Death... (Smiles.) By
           exile.

                         
          He smashes his gavel. Bane leans in to one of his men,
          indicates Miranda.

                          BANE
           Bring her to me.

          Wayne bounds up the stairs. Fox follows, out of breath

                         

                          LUCIUS
           I think it's time to talk about my
           year-end bonus...

                         

                         

          EXT. ROOFTOP, SKYSCRAPER, GOTHAM - MOMENTS LATER

          Fox emerges to see Wayne uncovering the Bat... As the sun
          sets, Fox starts pulling apart the gun mount.

                          FOX
           She fly pretty well?

                          WAYNE
           Even without the autopilot...

                          FOX
           Autopilot? That's what you're there
           for.

          Gordon and the rest of the men stand at the edge of the ice.
          A Mercenary fires his gun in the air. Gordon takes a breath,
          then leads his men onto the ice...which creaks and groans...
          Further out, Gordon stops - sniffs - looks down: a pool of
          liquid, beside it: a flare. Gordon picks it up, puzzled.

           BATMAN (O.S.)
           Light it up.

           139.

                         

                         
          Gordon, energized by the familiar voice, lights the flare -
          jams it into the liquid, sending a trail of FIRE across the
          ice - up into a building where it forms the shape of a

          BAT...

                          FOLEY'S WIFE
           Honey, take a look!
          Foley moves to a back window. Sees the flaming sign.

          A Mercenary nervously approaches Bane's back.

                          MERCENARY
           Sir?

                         
          Bane turns. The Mercenary points at the sign.

                          MERCENARY
           You think it's really him?

          Foley yanks up the floorboards. Pull his dress blues from

          Mercenaries guarding the entrance see the sign. One of them
          moves out to get a better look. WHAM! He is taken out by a
          dark figure. The figure steps into the light - it is
          Blake...

          Batman hands Gordon a metal box.

           140.

                         

                          BATMAN
           This blocks the remote detonator
           signal to the bomb. Get it onto the
           truck by sunrise. They might hit
           the button when it starts.

                         

                          GORDON

          EXT. OUTFLOW PIPE, ACKERMAN PARK - CONTINUOUS

          Blake takes out a second Mercenary - moves over to the open
          manhole. Ross emerges - nots at Blake, who helps him climb
          out. BANG - Ross goes down as Blake dives for cover. Blake
          is grabbed by Mercenaries. They detonate the manhole,
          sealing it, prepare to execute Blake. A dark shape drops
          onto the Mercenaries... Blake watches, in awe, as Batman
          takes them out in a fury of punches and kicks - then it is
          finished. Quiet. One of the Mercenaries moves slightly.

                          BLAKE
           You missed a spot.
          Batman boots him in the head as he moves towards Blake.

                         

                          BATMAN
           If you're working alone, wear a
           mask.

                          BLAKE
           No one cares who I am.

                          BATMAN
           The mask is not for you. It's to
           protect the people you care about.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Huh. And you always seem to know
           where those people are. How is
           that?

                          BATMAN
           I lost someone once. Since then I
           break into their homes when they're
           sleeping and implant a tracking
           device on the back of their neck.

                         
          Blake laughs. Then feels the back of his neck. Batman tosses
          Blake a mini-mine.

           141.

                         

                         

                          BATMAN
           On three - one, two, three -
          They throw the mini-mines at the rubble of the entrance -
          the blasts barely move any rubble.

                         

                          BLAKE
           No offense, but you got anything
           bigger in that belt?

                          BATMAN
           That's to warn the men on the other
           side.
          Batman disappears into the shadows.

                          BLAKE
           But how do we -?
          KAABOOOM! The Bat's cannons light up the night.

                          BLAKE
           Okay.

                         
          Cops climb out into the cold night - skinny, ragged, but
          glad to be alive and carrying guns...

                          BLAKE
           What now?

                         

                          BATMAN
           All-out assault on Bane...but you
           need to get the people you care
           about across the bridge.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Why?

                          BATMAN
           In case we fail. Lead an exodus
           across the bridge. Save as many
           lives as you can.

                          BLAKE
           Don't you need me here?

                         

                          BATMAN
           You've given me an army. Now go.
          Blake nods. Turns to leave. Stops.

           142.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Thank you.

                         

                          BATMAN
           Don't thank me yet.

                          BLAKE
           I might not get a chance later.

                         
          Batman nods. Blake disappears into the night.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Gordon checks the metal box. Puts it under his coat. Nods at
          his men, hiding in the doorways. Checks his GPS...

                         

          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

          Batman leads Catwoman to a rusty old container. He opens it,
          revealing the Bat-Pod. Catwoman's eyes light up.

                          CATWOMAN
           Oh, you shouldn't have...
          She hops on, feeling the controls.

                         

                          BATMAN
           The mid-town tunnel's blocked by
           debris, but the cannons give you
           enough firepower to make a path for

          Catwoman marvels at the controls...

                          BATMAN
           To start it, you -

                         

          VARROOOM!

                          CATWOMAN
           I got it.

                         

                          BATMAN
           We've got forty-five minutes to
           save this city -

                          CATWOMAN
           No, I've got forty-five minutes to
           get clear of the blast radius,
           because you don't stand a chance
           against these guys.

           143.

                         

                          BATMAN
           With your help I might.

                         
          She shakes her head.

                          CATWOMAN
           I'll open that tunnel, then I'm
           gone.

                         
          He looks at her.

                          BATMAN
           There's more to you than that.
          She stares back at him. Facade slipping a touch.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           Sorry to keep letting you down.
          He says nothing. She looks at him, imploring.
           Come with me. Save yourself. You
           don't owe these people anymore -
           you've given them everything...

                          BATMAN
           Not everything. Not yet.

                         
          Batman turns. Catwoman watches him go. Then fires up the
          bike and takes off.

          Catwoman tears along on the Bat-Pod. She pulls up at the
          tunnel entrance blocked by stacked vehicles.

                         

          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAWN


                         
          The army of Cops stands at the low end of the street. At the
          op is Bane's stronghold - City Hall. Men pour out of the
          building, forming up into an opposing line.
          A Cop wearing full dress blues steps forward. It is Foley.
          The silence is eerie... The numbers look evenly matched -
          until two Tumblers arrive.

                          VOICE

                          (OVER LOUDSPEAKER)

           DISPERSE. DISPERSE OR BE FIRED

           UPON.
          The Cops look shaky, pale, but determined.

           144.

                         

                         

                          FOLEY
           There's only one police in this
           city.
          He steps forward. The line follows.

                         

                         

          EXT. CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Bane stands in the colonnade. Watching.

                         

                          BANE
           Open fire.

          The Tumblers FIRE into the line of Cops, THROWING men into
          the air, SCREAMING. The line of Cops is about to scatter -
          WHOOOSHHH. The Bat DROPS down in front of the Cops and
          BLASTS both Tumblers, FLIPPING them sideways. The Bat RISES
          and the cops run towards the Mercenaries, firing - until
          they are close enough to fight hand-to-hand. The street is
          filled with thousands of men in pitched battle.

                         

          EXT. STREETS LEADING TO SOUTH TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

          Catwoman, hearing the distant battle, blasts the tunnel
          blockage...the dust settles. Her path is clear.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Gordon heard the fighting. Checks the box. Nervous.

                         

                          GORDON

          Bane strides through the battle, taking out Cops left and
          right. A space clears - he is face the face with the
          Batman...

                         

                          BANE
           You came back. To die with your
           city.

                          BATMAN
           No. I came back to stop you.

           145.

                         

                         
          Bane leaps at Batman, smashing powerful blows into his head.
          Batman ducks, weaves and smashes his fists into Bane's side.
          Someone is watching from the window of City Hall - Miranda.

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS

          The black truck rounds the corner. Gordon signals his man in
          a Greyhound bus - who pulls across the street. The truck
          smashes into the bus and stops. Gordon and his men swarm in,
          blasting at the Guards. Gordon opens the back - empty. No
          bomb. Wrong truck.

                          GORDON
           That's impossible... Come on! Cut
           over to Fifth!

                         
          They sprint for the next parallel avenue...

          Blake leads the boys out of the home - points down the
          street.

                          BLAKE
           Knock on doors, spread the word -
           the bomb's going to blow! Get out
           by the South Street tunnel, or over
           the bridge! Do two blocks, then get
           back to the bus!
          The boys race down the street. Father Reilly climbs into the
          bus.

                         

                         

          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS - CONTINUOUS

          Batman and Bane fight, Batman pushing Bane back - a Tumbler
          roars between them, separating them. Batman chases after.

           146.

                         

                         

          INT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Bane SMASHES backwards through the door, Batman on him.
          Batman POUNDS Bane against the marble floor. Mercenaries
          guarding Miranda move towards them -

                         

                          BANE
           Stay back. He is mine -
          Bane SMASHES Batman's head - moves in for the kill, but
          Batman SMASHES Bane to the ground, RIPS sideways across the
          tubes of Bane's mask with the blades of his forearm. Bane
          bellows, thrashing in AGONY. Batman holds him down with a
          hand on his throat - searches him with his free hand.

                          BATMAN
           Give me the trigger! You'd never
           give it to an ordinary citizen -
          Bane's thrashing calms as he stares at Batman through
          pain-soaked eyes...gasping through his broken mask for
          relief.

                         

                          BANE
           I broke you. How have you come
           back?

                          BATMAN
           You thought you were the only one
           who could learn the strength to
           escape?
          Bane looks at Batman, curiosity behind his pain.

                         

                          BANE

           rescued me. That is why I must

          Miranda has a knife through Batman's suit, into his ribs...
           And though I am not 'ordinary', I
           am a citizen...

          His men pull in front, slowing it. Gordon jumps into the

          Batman cannot move to defend himself. He has Bane by the

           Goodbye.
          Then is overrun.

                          TALIA
           He saw only a monster who could
           never be tamed. Whose very
           existence was a reminder of the
           hell he'd left his wife to die in.
           He excommunicated Bane from the
           League of Shadows. His only crime
           was that he loved me. I could not
           truly forgive my father...
          Talia looks at Batman, cold.
           Until you murdered him.

                         

                          BATMAN
           He was trying to kill millions of
           innocent people -

                          TALIA
           'Innocent' is a strong word to
           throw around Gotham, Bruce. I honor
           my father by finishing his work.
           Vengeance against the man who
           killed him is simply a reward for
           my patience...

                         
          Talia twists the knife in Batman's side.
           You see, it's the slow knife...the

           knife that waits years without
           forgetting, then slips quietly
           between bones...that's the knife -

           - that cuts deepest.
          She hits the button - nothing.

           Your knife may have been too
           slow...
          A Mercenary steps forward -

           The truck's under attack -
          Talia looks around, mind racing.

           Gordon. (To Batman.) You gave him a
           way to block my signal. No matter -

           Gotham eleven minutes. (Shouts at
           Mercenary.) Prepare a convoy. We
           must secure the bomb until it
           detonates.
          Talia jumps to her feet. Bane grabs a shotgun from a
          Mercenary - points it at Batman.

                          TALIA
           Not yet... I want him to feel the
           heat. (To Batman.) Feel the fire of
           twelve million souls you failed.
          Talia reaches up to Bane's mask, reconnects his tubes,
          tenderly.
           Goodbye, my friend.
          Bane nods at her, slowly. Talia moves out with the
          Mercenaries.

          Talia gets into a Tumbler with a Mercenary. Three Tumblers
          pull out in convoy, blowing anything out of the way - cars,
          cops.

                         
          Foley stands in the road, firing his sidearm. Talia's
          Tumbler SMASHES him out of the way.

          Bane grabs Batman, throws him into the floor - checks the
          rounds in the barrels.

                          BANE
           You'll have to imagine the fire -

                         
          He shuts the gun - jams it into Batman's face.
           We both know I need to kill you
           now.
          He squeezes the trigger. BLAMMM! Bane is blasted across the
          lobby by cannon fire.
          Catwoman is there, on the Bat-Pod.

                          CATWOMAN
           The whole no-guns thing? I don't
           feel as strongly about it as you
           do.

          Blake pulls up to the barricade, leads the kids off,
          marching them up the bridge, Father Reilly at the rear. A
          Uniform shouts through the loudhailer -

                          UNIFORM
           Stay there! What are you doing?!

           It's gonna blow anyway. We need
           this bridge open right now.

           No one leaves the island. Orders -

           Well, Detective, you take one more
           step, we have to shoot you. Two
           more steps, we have to blow the
           bridge.

           Wait for me back at the bus.
          The Boys walk back down the bridge...

          Talia's convoy surrounds the black truck. Tumblers off each
          flank, protecting the bomb as it counts down...

          Batman looks at Catwoman.

          Gordon climbs into the back of the truck - the bomb is
          there, heating up. He looks at the countdown - nine
          minutes...

          Blake turns back to the Uniform.

                          BLAKE
           Your orders are out of date! The
           situation's changed! Listen, I'm a
           cop like you. And I'm walking out
           there. Please don't shoot me.
          Blake walks. Shots ring out at his feet. He keeps walking...

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS

          The Bat descends on the convoy, Catwoman approaches on the
          ground. A rolling battle ensues. Catwoman targets the rear
          of the Tumblers, Batman swings the Bat in low at the
          junctions, trying to force the convoy east...
          The Tumbler's gun turrets swing around onto Catwoman. She
          swerves to avoid heavy fire.

          Blake continues to walk, ignoring the warning shots.

           Son-of-a-bitch! (To his partner.)
           Blow it! Before he reaches the line

                          -
          His partner arms the detonator. Uniform shouts at Blake -

                         

                          UNIFORM
           Get down! We're blowing the bridge!
          As Blake looks, disbelieving, the bridge in front of him
          blasts upwards in a massive fireball. Blake dives backwards.

           153.

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS

          The Bat blasts away in front of the convoy, making a huge
          crater in front of a Tumbler and trapping it, rear in the
          air. Catwoman dodges around it, uses the Bat-Pod cannons to
          take out another Tumbler... The countdown ticks away...seven
          minutes.

          The smoke clears, Blake sees the impossible gap.

                          BLAKE
           You idiots! You sons of bitches!
           You're killing us!!

                         

                         

          INT. BLACK TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

          Gordon climbs out the back of the truck but is immediately
          strafed by gunfire from the Tumblers. He dives back inside,
          moves to the front of the trailer - looks at the bulkhead,
          gauging the driver's position. Starts firing blind through
          the bulkhead -

                         

          INT. CAB, BLACK TRUCK - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Bullets fly through the cab. The driver takes one, falls
          forward, dead. Talia takes the wheel - bullets keep coming.

          Blake races back. Father Reilly has the boys in a huddle,

                          BLAKE

          The Bat spins down in front of the black truck, forcing it

                          TALIA
           Pushing us to the entrance of the

                          (OVER RADIO)

          Fox runs to a ladder. Alarms sound. As he hits the ladder he
          turns. A massive rumble builds - water SMASHES into the
          reactor, flooding in from both directions.

          Catwoman comes up behind the lead Tumbler. She blasts it
          again and again - it flips diagonally into the path of the
          black truck, causing the truck to lurch onto its side. Both
          vehicles careen into the mouth of the tunnel.

          Fox loops his arm around a rung of the ladder and braces as
          a wave smashes into him, painfully...

          Gordon jumps out of the truck, opening the rear doors to
          expose the glowing core. Catwoman pulls up on the Bat-Pod.

                          GORDON
           Give me a hand!
          The Bat lands at the tunnel mouth. Gordon moves in to try
          and grab the core but it is too hot.
           Let's get a cable on it and drag it
           out! Come on, we're almost there -
          Laughter. Gordon turns. Talia, lying half out the truck.
          Dying.

                          TALIA
           Fox showed me how to operate the

          Gordon looks down at Talia. Batman is at his side.

                          TALIA
           There is no way to stop this bomb.
           Prepare yourselves... (Looks up at
           Batman.) My father's work is done.

                         
          Talia smiles as her eyes flutter closed. Gordon turns -
          Batman is at the core, plunging his hands into the heat to
          attach a hoist from the Bat.

                          GORDON
           What're you doing?

                          BATMAN
           Two minutes. I can fly it out over
           the bay...

                         
          Catwoman is at his side as he works.

                          CATWOMAN
           Rig it out to fly over the water,
           then bail -

           No autopilot.
          She takes this in. He stands to face her.

                          CATWOMAN
           You could've gone anywhere. Been
           anything. But you came back here.

                          BATMAN
           So did you.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           I guess we're both suckers.
          She puts her arms around his neck. Kisses him. Batman moves
          to the Bat, Gordon alongside.

                         

                          GORDON
           So this is the part where you
           vanish, only this time you don't
           come back?

                         
          Batman opens the canopy.

           You think they need to hear that in

           I never cared who you were -

                         

                          BATMAN
           And you were right.

                          GORDON
           But shouldn't the people know the
           hero who saved them?

                          BATMAN
           A hero can be anyone. That was
           always the point.

                         
          Batman sits into the cockpit, then looks again at Gordon.
           Anyone. A man doing something as
           simple and reassuring as putting a

           shoulders to let him know that the

          The canopy closes - and as the Bat fires up Gordon remembers

                         -
          INSERT CUT: Gordon, in his uniform, wraps the overcoat
          around the Young Bruce's shoulders, his eyes reassuring,
          loving.
          Gordon looks up to the cockpit -

                          GORDON
           Bruce Wayne?
          - but is dusted by downdraft as the Bat RISES. Gordon LEAPS
          out of the way as the core is dragged along and out of the
          tunnel mouth.

                         
          The Bat struggles with the weight of the smoking core... A
          building is in the way - Batman fights the controls but
          there's no power to get over it.

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

          Blake shouts into the bus -

                          BLAKE
           Heads down! Heads down, now!

           158.

                         

                         

                          FATHER REILLY
           Blake, they need to make their
           peace.
          Blake turns to him, furious.

                         

                          BLAKE
           They're children! They have no
           peace to make -
          An EXPLOSION from downtown Gotham. Blake looks across,
          startled, turns to the children on the bus.
           Get down! This is it!
          The smallest of the boys stares through the window past
          Blake.

                         

                          LITTLE BOY
           No. That's Batman!
          Blake turns to see the Bat thundering out of the heart of
          Gotham, trailing smoke, the core hanging from it. It curves
          dangerously close to the bridge before heading for the mouth
          of the river...the bay...the ocean...
          Until a point of light fires into an enormous nuclear BLAST
          - wind and light and dust blowing VIOLENTLY but harmlessly
          over the bridge, the tunnel mouth, all of Gotham...

                         
          As the nuclear dawn fades over Gotham, and we see its
          inhabitants start to raise their heads, and helicopters and
          boats converge on the island, we hear a voice. Jim Gordon.

           GORDON (V.O.)
           'I see a beautiful city and a
           brilliant people rising from this
           abyss...'
          Blake pulls out his badge. Throws it into the river.

                         

           GORDON (V.O.)
           'I see the lives for which I lay
           down my life, peaceful, useful,
           prosperous and happy...'

                         

                         

          EXT. GARDENS, WAYNE MANOR - DAY

          Gordon is reading from A Tale of Two Cities. Opposite is
          Fox, arm in a sling, and Blake, grim. Another figure is
          there, whose face we do not yet see...

           159.

                         

                         

                          GORDON
           'I see that I hold a sanctuary in
           their hearts, and in the hearts of
           their descendants, generations
           hence. It is a far, far better
           thing that I do, than I have ever
           done...'
          Gordon closes the book, looking down at Bruce Wayne's grave.
           'It is a far, far better rest that
           I go to than I have ever known.'

                         
          Gordon looks up at the figure standing across from him...
          Alfred. Tears streaming.
          Fox places a gentle hand on Alfred's shoulder, then leaves.
          Gordon and Blake follow. Alfred, alone with the Wayne
          family, turns to the grave beside Bruce's - the grave of
          Thomas and Martha Wayne.

                          ALFRED
           I'm so sorry. I failed you. You
           trusted me, and I failed you.
          And the old man's shoulders begin to shake with sobs.

                         

          EXT. FRONT ENTRANCE, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Gordon nods at Lucius. Blake is at Gordon's side.

                          GORDON
           Can I change your mind about
           quitting the force?

                         

                          BLAKE
           No. What you said about structures.
           About shackles. I can't take it.
           The injustice. (Gestures at
           gardens.) I mean...no one's ever
           going to know who saved an entire
           city.

                          GORDON
           They know. (Off look.) It was
           Batman.

           160.

                         

                         

          EXT. PLAZA, DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - DAY

          Gordon, on a platform with dignitaries, watches a statue
          being unveiled. The curtain parts: Batman, immortalized in
          granite. We move in on the stone face...

                         

           VOICE (V.O.)
           Mr. Wayne's will was not amended to
           reflect his more modest estate...

                         

                         

          INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - DAY

          The voice belongs to Wayne's lawyer, addressing a small
          group.

                          LAWYER
           Nonetheless, there are considerable
           assets to dispose of... The
           contents of the house are to be

                          SOLD -
          He glances up to see someone slip into the room - Blake.

                         

                         

          EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

          Movers carefully bring artworks and furniture out of the
          house, watched by a solitary figure. Alfred.

                         

           LAWYER (V.O.)
           - to settle the estate's accounts.
           The remainder is left in its
           entirety to Alfred J. Pennyworth...

                         

                         

          INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - DAY

          Blake shifts. Out of place. The Lawyer continues.

                          LAWYER
           The house and grounds are left to
           the city of Gotham, on condition
           that they never be demolished,
           altered, or otherwise interfered

                          WITH -

          EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

          Different movers carry bunk beds into the huge house.

           LAWYER (V.O.)
           And that they shall be used for one
           purpose, and one purpose only...
          A schoolbus pulls up. Father Reilly shepherds children
          towards the house. The children look up at the house,
          wide-eyed.
           The housing and care of the city's
           at-risk and orphaned children.
          A sign reads:

          THE MARTHA AND THOMAS WAYNE HOME FOR CHILDREN

                         

                         

          INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - DAY

          People file out as the Lawyer stands.

                         

                          LAWYER
           My clerk will help anyone with the
           smaller correspondences and
           instructions...
          Blake approaches the Clerk. She smiles.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Blake, John.

                          CLERK

                          (CHECKS LIST)
           Nothing here.
          Blake realizes, offers her his driving license.

                          BLAKE
           Try my legal name.

                         
          The Clerk glances at the license. Checks.

                          CLERK
           Yup, here it is.

                         
          She reaches down behind the desk, sorting through various
          items, and hands him a sports bag. Blake takes it, curious.

                          CLERK
           You should use your full name. I
           like that name... Robin.

           162.

                         
          Blake smiles, embarrassed. Leaves.

                          LAWYER
           Any word on the missing item?

                          CLERK
           No, not yet.

                          LAWYER
           Well, they'd better leave no stone
           unturned... We can't just put a
           string of pearls on the manifest as
           'lost'.

                         

                         

          INT. APPLIED SCIENCES - DAY

          Fox stands in front of the second camouflage rotor. Two
          Techs are examining the controls in the cockpit.

                          TECH 1
           Why worry about the stabilization
           software? This whole autopilot
           system's obsolete -

                          FOX
           Please, I just need to know what I
           could've done to fix it.

                          TECH 2
           But Mr. Fox, it's already been
           fixed. (Typed on panel.) Software
           patch...six months ago.

                          FOX

                          (CONFUSED)
           Check the user ident on the
           patch...

                         
          Tech 2 types some more keys. Looks surprised.

                          TECH 2
           Huh. Bruce Wayne.

                         
          Fox turns away from the rotor, an idea starting to form...

                         

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          Blake sits in his car looking at a GPS device, puzzled.
          Beside him, the sports bag, open. In it is a piece of paper
          with coordinates, on top of some climbing rope and shackles.
          Blake gets out of the car with the bag. Follows the GPS into
          the trees.

           163.

                         

                         

          EXT. CAFÉ, FLORENCE - DAY

          Alfred, paper under his arm, heads to his usual table. Sits.

                          WAITER
           Lei e solo?

                         

                          ALFRED
           Si, Fernet Branca, per cortesia.

                         

                         

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          Blake finds a large waterfall... He checks his GPS,
          confused. Stares at the waterfall. Reaches for the climbing
          gear...

                         

                         

          EXT. MCU - NIGHT

          Gordon steps onto the roof with his pile of arrest
          reports...

                         

                         

          EXT. CAFÉ, FLORENCE - DAY

          As Alfred sips his drink, he glances up at a couple at the
          next table. Strangers. Alfred looks back down...

                         

                         

          INT. CAVE - DAY

          Moving in on the waterfall from inside... Blake bursts
          through, landing painfully on the shale inside. he gets to
          his feet, moving cautiously into the cave...

                         

                         

          EXT. MCU - NIGHT

          Gordon bangs his files against the air duct, straightening
          them. He stops. Sees something. The searchlight...fixed.
          Gordon runs his fingers across a brand new, steel Bat
          symbol... He looks up into the night...

                         

          INT. CAVE - DAY


                         
          Blake lights his torch...then ducks, crouching, as THOUSANDS
          of SCREECHING creatures descend. BATS...

           164.

                         

                         

          EXT. CAFÉ, FLORENCE - DAY

          Alfred folds his paper. Pulls out his money, then stops,
          seeing...across the tables, a familiar couple... Bruce
          smiles at Alfred, who nods. Bruce turns back to the pretty
          brunette in pearls. Selina. Alfred pays his bill, content.

                         

                         

          INT. CAVE - DAY

          Blake lifts his head, FEELING the bats all around him...
          Blake RISES, and is SWALLOWED by the darkness of their wings
          and we -

          FADE OUT.

          CREDITS.

                         

          THE END.
DAWN OF
THE DEAD
(The working draft 1977)
by George A. Romero


1	We see the face of a young woman. She is asleep. It is very
	quiet at first, as credits appear. The woman's face begins to
	twitch, as though she is having a bad dream. She moans slightly
	and her expression grows more desperate.

	A mix of subtle sounds begin to fade in. As they get louder, we
	can discern what sounds like a busy office area. It is actually
	a frantic television studio with the hum of panic in a national
	emergency.

	The woman's moans get louder and more desperate as the
	background sounds reach full volume and the credits stop. The
	woman sits up, snapping awake.

2	She lurches forwards into the arms of a strong young man. She is
	Francine, twenty three years old and very attractive, although
	she is gritty with dirt. Her hair is hanging, dishevelled and
	sweaty. Her jeans and blouse have been worn for several days.

	She is sitting on the floor, where she has slept the last
	several hours, covered by an old overcoat.

	Tony:	YOU OK?

	Fran stares at the young man. She is shaking. She doesn't speak.

	Tony:	THE SHIT'S REALLY HITTING THE FAN.

	The girl tries to clear her head as the young man moves on to
	where others sleep on the floor. He wakes them up one at a time.
	We begin to hear voices over the busy hum of the studio. They
	have an electronic tinniness, as broadcast over a monitor. Fran
	looks about. She is still shaken from her dream.

3	We see the television studio. Reporters buzz about madly.
	Everybody looks dishevelled and exhausted. Technicians man
	monitors, and we see people on the little screens, arguing
	emotionally.

4	Voice:	WHAT'S MAKING IT HAPPEN? WHAT THE HELL
			DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE, WHAT'S MAKING IT
			HAPPEN.

	Voice:	YES, BUT THAT'S...

	Voice:	THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER STUDY. THEY'RE TRYING...

	Voice:	BUT IF WE KNEW THAT, WE COULD...

	Voice:	WE DON'T KNOW THAT! WE DON'T KNOW THAT!
			WE'VE GOTTA OPERATE ON WHAT WE DO KNOW!

5	The room is pandemonium. People run in with wire copy; others
	organise the stacks of bulletins as they arrive. Others trip
	over cables and generally get in each other's way.

6	Francine stares at the madness, still trying to clear her head.

	Man's voice: I'M STILL DREAMING.

	Fran turns her head. Another young man sits next to her on the
	floor. He is one of the ones Tony awakened.

	Fran:	NO YOU'RE NOT.

	Woman:	MY TURN WITH THE COAT.

	Fran looks up. A young woman is offering her coffee in a paper
	cup. She is next in line for the overcoat and a few hours sleep.
	Fran takes the coffee and struggles to her feet.

	Woman:	THE GUYS ON THE CREW ARE GETTING CRAZY.
			A BUNCH OF 'EM FLEW THE COOP ALREADY.
			I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER WE'LL BE ABLE
			TO STAY ON AIR.

7	Fran staggers over to the control consoles. The technicians are
	at the end of their ropes.

	Technicians: (all at once)
			WATCH CAMERA TWO...WHO THE HELL'S ON CAMERA
			TWO, A BLIND MAN...
			WATCH THE FRAME...WATCH THE FRAME...
			ROLL THE RESCUE STATIONS AGAIN.

	Technicians: WE GOT A REPORT THAT HALF THOSE RESCUE
			STATIONS HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT.
			SO GET ME A NEW LIST.
			SURE, I'LL PULL IT OUTA MY ASS.

	Fran focuses on the monitors. She is incredulous... stunned by
	the madness which surrounds her. She realises the hopelessness
	of the situation as she zeroes in on the televised conversation.

8	We begin to listen over the din of the news room.

	TV Man 1:    I DON'T BELIEVE THAT, DOCTOR, AND I DON'T
			BELIEVE...

	TV Man 2:    DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEAD ARE RETURNING TO
			LIFE?

	TV Man 1:    I'M NOT SO...

	TV Man 2:    DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEAD ARE RETURNING TO
			LIFE AND ATTACKING THE LIVING?

	TV Man 1:    I'M NOT SO SURE WHAT TO BELIEVE DOCTOR!

9	Suddenly we cut into the studio, and we see the argument as it
	is being shot.

	TV Man 1:    (con't)
			ALL WE GET IS WHAT YOU PEOPLE TELL US.
			AND IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO BELIEVE...

	TV Man 2:    IT'S FACT... IT'S FACT...

	TV Man 1:    IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO BELIEVE WITHOUT YOU
			COMING IN HERE AND TELLING US WE HAVE TO
			FORGET ALL HUMAN DIGNITY AND...

	TV Man 2:    HUMAN DIG... YOU CAN'T...

	TV Man 1:    ...FORGET ALL HUMAN DIGNITY...

	TV Man 2:    YOU'RE NOT RUNNING A TALK SHOW HERE, MR.
			BERMAN...YOU CAN FORGET PITCHING AN AUDIENCE
			THE MORAL BULL SHIT THEY WANT TO HEAR!

	TV Man 1:    YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ABANDONING EVERY HUMAN
			CODE OF BEHAVIOUR, AND THERE'S A LOT OF US
			WHO AREN'T READY FOR THAT DOCTOR FOSTER...

10	 A great cry of assent goes up from the studio floor. Doctor
	Foster is flustered and frustrated. The stage hands and
	cameramen are all screaming at him, swearing and ridiculing. We
	notice Police guards, armed, at the studio doors. They control
	the traffic in and out of the big room.

11	 Back at the control panel. Fran stares at the screens. Confusion
	still reigns.

	Man:	 FRANNIE, GET ON THE NEW LIST OF RESCUE STATIONS.
			CHARLIE'S RECEIVING ON THE EMERGENCIES...

	Fran pulls herself away from the monitors as the argument rages
	on screen.

12	 She fights through the heavy traffic and reaches Charlie, a
	harassed typist who holds the receiver of an emergency radio
	unit under his chin...

	Charlie:	(into receiver)
			SAY AGAIN...CAN'T HEAR YOU... 

	Fran:	RESCUE STATIONS?

	Fran leafs through sheets of paper on Charlie's desk. He writes
	notes as he listens on the receiver, and he speaks to the woman.

	Charlie:	HALF THOSE ARE INOPERATIVE ANY MORE.
			I'M TRYIN' TO FIND OUT AT LEAST ABOUT THE
			IMMEDIATE AREA. WE'VE HAD OLD INFORMATION
			ON THE AIR FOR THE LAST TWELVE HOURS.

	Fran:	THESE ARE RESCUE STATIONS. WE CAN'T SEND
			PEOPLE TO INOPERATIVE...

	Charlie:	(into receiver)
			SAY AGAIN, NEW HOPE...

	Charlie makes more notes and hands them to Fran. Still listening
	on the receiver, he speaks to the woman again.

	Charlie:	I'M DOIN' WHAT I CAN. THESE ARE DEFINITE
			AS OF NOW. SKIP AND DUSTY ARE ON THE RADIO,
			TOO. GOOD LUCK.

	Fran snatches up the sheets and moves across the room.

13	 She stops at the consoles...

	Fran:	I'M GONNA KNOCK OFF THE OLD RESCUE STATIONS.
			I'LL HAVE THE NEW ONES READY AS SOON AS I CAN.

	Technician:  WE'RE SENDING PEOPLE TO PLACES THAT HAVE
			CLOSED DOWN. I'M GONNA KILL THE OLD LIST.

14	 Fran moves toward another control room. An armed officer stops
	her. A young man rushing through with copy intercedes.

	Man:	 HEY, SHE'S ALRIGHT.

	Officer:	WHERE'S YOUR BADGE?

	Fran reaches instinctively for the lapel of her blouse. Her
	badge is missing.

	Fran:	JESUS!

	Man:	 SHE'S ALRIGHT.

	Fran:	I HAD IT...I WAS ASLEEP OVER THERE...

	She makes a move toward the corner where she was asleep.

	Man:	 SOMEBODY STOLE IT. THERE'S A LOT OF 'EM
			MISSING.
			(to officer)
			SHE'S ALRIGHT. LET HER THROUGH.

	The officer reluctantly steps aside.

15	 The young man and Fan move down a crowded hall and into a small
	camera room. The foot traffic is solid. They talk as they walk.

	Fran:	I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

	Man:	 ONE OF THOSE LITTLE BADGES CAN OPEN A LOT
			OF DOORS...YOU AVOID A LOT OF HASSLES IF
			YOU GOT A BADGE...ANY KIND OF BADGE...

	Fran:	IT'S REALLY GOING CRAZY.

16	 They reach a small camera installation. The camera is aimed at a
	machine which rolls out a list of rescue stations. The list is
	superimposed over the live broadcast as it goes out.

	Cameraman:   YOU GOT NEW ONES?

	Fran:	I GOTTA TYPE 'EM UP. KILL THE OLD ONES.

	Cameraman:   GIVENS WANT 'EM...

	Fran:	KILL 'EM, DICK. TELL GIVENS TO SEE ME!

	The man clicks off his camera. Fran moves toward the studio.

17	 On the monitors, we see the rescue stations blink off over shots
	of the two men who still argue on the air.

	TV Man 1:    WELL I DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS, DOCTOR.

	TV Man 2:    THESE ARE NOT GHOSTS. NOR ARE THESE HUMANS!
			THESE ARE DEAD CORPSES. ANY UN-BURIED HUMAN
			CORPSE WITH ITS BRAIN INTACT WILL IN FACT
			RE-ACTIVATE. AND IT'S PRECISELY BECAUSE OF
			INCITEMENT BY IRRESPONSIBLE PUBLIC FIGURES
			LIKE YOURSELF THAT THIS SITUATION IS BEING
			DEALT WITH IRRESPONSIBLY BY THE PUBLIC AT
			LARGE!

18	 Another outraged cry goes up from the stagehands and observers.
	Doctor Foster tries to out-scream the cries...

	TV Man 2:    YOU HAVE NOT LISTENED...YOU HAVE NOT LISTENED...
			FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS...WHAT DOES IT TAKE...
			WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE PEOPLE SEE?

19	 Fran moves into the large studio area where the broadcasters
	argue. The commotion is maddening. Fran stares for a moment.

20	 TV Man 2:    (now distraught...almost pleading)
			THIS SITUATION IS CONTROLLABLE. PEOPLE
			MUST COME TO GRIPS WITH THIS CONCEPT.
			IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT...WITH FRIENDS...
			WITH FAMILY...BUT A DEAD BODY MUST BE DE-
			ACTIVATED BY EITHER DESTROYING THE BRAIN
			OR SEVERING THE BRAIN FROM THE REST OF THE
			BODY.

	Another outburst in the studio.

	TV Man 2:    THE SITUATION MUST BE CONTROLLED...BEFORE IT'S
			TOO LATE...THEY ARE MULTIPLYING TOO RAPIDLY...

21	 Fran moves through the crowded room of emotional people and
	finally reaches another emergency radio installation. Skip and
	Dusty are trying to listen to their receivers. They jot notes.

	Fran:	OPERATIVE RESCUE STATIONS?

	Dusty:	THEY'RE DROPPIN' LIKE FLIES. HERE'S A FEW.
			YOU KNOW, I THINK FOSTER'S RIGHT. I THINK
			WE'RE LOSIN' THIS WAR.

	Fran:	YEAH, BUT NOT TO THE ENEMY.
			WE'RE BLOWIN' IT OURSELVES.

	She gives the rest of her coffee to the two men.

	Fran:	NOT MUCH LEFT, BUT HAVE A BALL.

	The two men each slug eagerly from the paper cup. Fran rushes
	off toward a large teleprompter typing machine.

22	 The broadcasters still argue emotionally.

	TV Man 1:    PEOPLE AREN'T WILLING TO ACCEPT YOUR SOLUTIONS,
			DOCTOR, AND I, FOR ONE, DON'T BLAME THEM.

	TV Man 2:    EVERY DEAD BODY THAT IS NOT EXTERMINATED
			BECOMES ONE OF THEM! IT GETS UP AND KILLS!
			THE PEOPLE IT KILLS GET UP AND KILL!

23	 Handing the list of active rescue stations to the teleprompter
	typist, Fran rushes back toward the control room.

24	 Around the monitor consoles, the commotion has been made even
	more frantic by an angered Dan Givens, obviously one of the
	station managers.

	Givens:	 NOBODY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT, I WANT...

	Givens spots Fran as she moves into the room.

	Givens:	 GARRET, WHO TOLD YOU TO KILL THE SUPERS?

	Fran:	NOBODY. I KILLED 'EM. THEY'RE OUT OF DATE.

	Givens:	 I WANT THOSE SUPERS ON THE AIR ALL THE TIME.

	Fran:	ARE YOU WILLING TO MURDER PEOPLE BY SENDING THEM
			OUT TO STATIONS THAT HAVE CLOSED DOWN?

	Givens:	 WITHOUT THOSE RESCUE STATIONS ON SCREEN EVERY
			MINUTE PEOPLE WON'T WATCH US. THEY'LL TUNE OUT.

	Fran stares at the red faced man in disbelief.

	Givens:	 I WANT THAT LIST UP ON THE SCREEN EVERY MINUTE THAT
			WE'RE ON THE AIR.

	Fran is about to say something in anger, but before she can, one
	of the technicians, having overheard Givens, gets up from the
	control panel and starts to walk away.

	Givens:	 LUCAS...LUCAS, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING...
			GET ON THAT CONSOLE...LUCAS...WE'RE ON THE AIR!

	Lucas:	ANYBODY NEED A RIDE!

25	 Two other men from various positions in the room snatch up
	personal effects and follow the technician toward the door. The
	door is guarded by a nervous Officer.

26	 Givens:	 OFFICER...OFFICER...YOU STOP THEM...STOP THOSE
			MEN...LUCAS...GET BACK ON THIS CONSOLE...

	A frantic hubbub begins over the lack of console control. People
	rush in and out, the floor director's voice can be heard over a
	talk back system...

	Voices:	 WHAT THE HELL'S GOIN' ON IN THERE.
			SWITCH...SWITCH...THERE'S NO SWITCHER...
			WE'RE LOSING PICTURE...

	Givens:	 OFFICER...STOP THOSE MEN...
	 
27	 The young officer faces the men as they reach his post. He takes
	a grip on his rifles, opens the door and lets the group through.
	Then he runs out himself, deserting the losing cause.

28	 Givens jumps toward the console. He frantically tries to work
	the complex dials and pots...

	Givens:	 GET SOMEBODY IN HERE THAT KNOWS HOW TO RUN
			THIS THING...COME ON...I'LL TRIPLE THE MONEY
			FOR THE MAN THAT CAN RUN THIS THING...TRIPLE
			THE MONEY...WE'RE STAYING ON THE AIR...

	Fran moves slowly off toward the studio.

29	 In the big room, the tension is thicker than ever. A few of the
	newsmen still earnestly try to perform their various functions,
	but most of the crew are reduced to emotional polarisation over
	the broadcast which still rages.

30	 TV Man 2:    THEY KILL FOR ONE REASON.
			THEY KILL FOR FOOD.
			THEY EAT THEIR VICTIMS, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,
			MR. BERMAN. THAT'S WHAT KEEPS THEM GOING.

31	 Fran stops to listen to the argument. She falls back into the
	shadows of the studio. People rush past her, some leaving the
	studio in disgust.

32	 TV Man 2:    IF WE'D LISTENED...IF WE'D DEALT WITH THE
			PHENOMENON PROPERLY...WITHOUT EMOTION...
			WITHOUT...EMOTION...
			IT WOULDN'T HAVE COME TO THIS!

	Foster wipes his sweat with a dirty hanker chief. He pulls his
	tie away from his tight collar, and pops the shirt button open.
	He is desperate now, shivering with anger and frustration.

	TV Man 2:    THERE IS A MARTIAL LAW STATE IN EFFECT IN
			PHILADELPHIA...AS IN ALL OTHER MAJOR CITIES IN
			THE COUNTRY...
			CITIZENS MUST UNDERSTAND THE...DIRE...DIRE
			CONSEQUENCES OF THIS PHENOMENON...SHOULD WE
			BE UNABLE TO CHECK THE SPREAD...
			BECAUSE OF THE EMOTIONAL ATTITUDES..OF THE
			CITIZENRY...TOWARD...THESE ISSUES OF...
			MORALITY...
			IT IS THE ORDER OF THE O.E.P. BY COMMAND OF THE
			FEDERAL GOVERNMENT...THE PRESIDENT OF THE
			UNITED STATES...
			CITIZENS MAY NO LONGER OCCUPY PRIVATE RESIDENCES,
			NO MATTER HOW SAFELY PROTECTED OR WELL STOCKED...

	A murmur in the studio begins to build to an emotional
	crescendo. Foster tries to talk over the noise...

	TV Man 2:    CITIZENS WILL BE MOVED INTO CENTRAL AREAS OF
			THE CITY...

33	 Technicians abandon their posts. A few others jump in to take
	their places, but pandemonium reigns. A cameraman whips off his
	headset and breaks for the door. His camera spins on its liquid
	head, and on the monitors, we see a whirling blur as Foster
	continues to speak.

	Fran moves quickly for the spinning camera. She aims it back at
	the sweating Foster, and she stares through the viewfinder not
	believing what she is seeing.

34	 TV Man 2:    THE BODIES OF THE DEAD WILL BE DELIVERED OVER
			TO SPECIALLY EQUIPPED SQUADS OF THE NATIONAL
			GUARD FOR ORGANISED DISPOSITION...

35	 Suddenly a man darts out of the bustling crowd and comes up
	quickly behind Fran.

	Steve:	FRANNIE...AT NINE O'CLOCK MEET ME ON THE ROOF.
			WE'RE GETTING OUT.

	Fran:	(letting the camera slip slightly)
			STEPHEN...I DON'T BELIEVE THIS...WHAT...

	Steve:	WE'RE GETTING OUT. IN THE CHOPPER.

	Another technician steps over to take the camera from Fran.
	Stephen talks more quietly in the other man's presence.

	Steve:	NINE P.M. ALRIGHT?

	Fran:	STEVE...WE CAN'T...WE'VE GOT TO...

	Steve:	WE'VE GOT TO NOTHING, FRAN. WE'VE GOT TO
			SURVIVE. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO SURVIVE. NOW YOU
			COULD BE UP THERE AT NINE. DON'T MAKE ME COME
			LOOKIN' FOR YA.

	Stephen is gone in a flash. Fran nervously looks back at the
	cameraman. The argument still rages between Foster and Berman.
	The cameraman, without taking his eye from the viewfinder,
	speaks to Francine quietly and slowly.

	Cameraman:   GO AHEAD. WE'LL BE OFF THE AIR BY MIDNIGHT
			ANYWAY. EMERGENCY NETWORKS ARE TAKING OVER.
			OUR RESPONSIBILITY... IS FINISHED, I'M AFRAID.

36	 It is dusk, and the city of Philadelphia is surprisingly quiet.
	We see several large buildings. They are part of a low-income
	housing project, and their lack of grace is evident. They stand
	like tombstones as the first stars appear in the navy blue sky.

37	 Under cover of the growing darkness, activities of the S.W.A.T.
	Unit go unnoticed. Grappling hooks grab against the lip around
	the roof and silent figures climb to the top of the building.
	Men in armour vests, clutching the latest in special weapons,
	take position here and there about the development.

	Other men strategically place their cars and trucks in the court
	below.

38	 On the roof, at an entrance to one of the building's fire
	stairs, Roger squats silently alongside three other team
	members. The men check their weapons. Roger looks at his watch.
	The sweep hand reaches the 12...

	Roger:	(to himself) LIGHTS.

39	 In an instant, large searchlights bathe the side of the
	building. The troop commander, shielded with other Officers
	behind a large truck, shouts through an electric bullhorn.

	Commander:   MARTINEZ...YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING...YOU KNOW WE
			HAVE THE BUILDING SURROUNDED...

	The electronically amplified voice echoes through the concrete
	caverns between the buildings of the project. There are only a
	few windows which glow with lights from inside. At the sound of
	the bullhorn, the lights all blink out one at a time.

	Commander:   (not over the bullhorn)
			LITTLE BASTARD'S GOT 'EM ALL MOVED INTO ONE
			BUILDING...DUMB LITTLE BASTARD!

	Sergeant:    LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GONNA TRY TO FIGHT US.

	Commander:   (on the bullhorn again)
			MARTINEZ...THE PEOPLE IN THIS PROJECT ARE YOUR
			RESPONSIBILITY...WE DON'T WANT ANY OF THEM HURT
			AND NEITHER DO YOU!

42	 There is no sign of life in the building. The great concrete
	slab is silhouetted silently against the darkening sky.

43	 Roger, and his team mates, crouch in readiness. The sound of the
	bullhorn rises to them easily and clearly.

	Roger:	I'M GIVIN' YOU THREE MINUTES, MARTINEZ...

	Commander:   (Bullhorn)
			I'M GIVIN' YOU THREE MINUTES, MARTINEZ...
			TURN OVER YOUR WEAPONS AND SURRENDER...

	Roger:	THERE ARE NO CHARGES AGAINST YOU...

	Commander:   THERE ARE NO CHARGES AGAINST YOU OR ANY OF YOUR
			PEOPLE...

	Roger:	YET.

	Commander:   THREE MINUTES, MARTINEZ.

	Roger:	AND COUNTING.
			(he looks at his watch)

	There is a long silence.

	Roger:	COME ON, MARTINEZ!

	One of the other S.W.A.T. team members is a big man, with a
	rough and vicious looking face. He is WOOLEY, a hardened
	veteran, and a red neck of the first order.

	Wooley:	 YEAH, COME ON, MARTINEZ...SHOW YOUR GREASY
			LITTLE PUERTO RICAN ASS...SO I CAN BLOW IT OFF...

	Roger looks over at the big man. He is distressed at the pent up
	violence in Wooley.

	Wooley:	 I'LL BLOW ALL THEIR ASSES OFF...LOW LIFE BASTARDS..
			BLOW ALL THEIR LITTLE LOW LIFE PUERTO RICAN AND
			NIGGER ASSES RIGHT OFF...

	Roger is greatly concerned. He looks at one of the other men, a
	young, smoothed faced rookie. The boy doesn't know now to react.
	He is obviously nervous.

	Roger:	KEEP COOL. JUST DON'T POP OFF IN THERE WHEN WE
			GO IN.

	The boy nods, grateful for a more human contact.

	Wooley:	 HOW THE HELL COME WE STICK THESE LOW LIFES
			IN THESE BIG ASS FANCY HOTELS ANYWAY? SHIT
			MAN. THIS' BETTER THAN I GOT. YOU AIN'T
			GONNA TALK 'EM OUTA HERE. YOU GOTTA BLOW
			'EM OUT. BLOW THEIR ASSES!

	Roger:	(to the boy)
			YOU GONNA BE ALRIGHT?

	The boy nods in the affirmative.

	Wooley:	 LET'S GET ON WITH IT. THIS IS A WASTE OF
			MY TIME!

44	 CRASH! Without warning, the metal door to the fire stair bursts
	open and several figures rush out of the darkness. Shots are
	fired from hand guns. A bullet smashes through the skull of the
	young boy next to Roger. He falls against Roger with a pleading
	expression on his face.

	Figures charge this way and that. More gunfire. The other
	S.W.A.T. men dodge and dive for cover. Wooley opens fire with
	his automatic weapon.

45	 On the street, the Commander, hearing the gunfire, barks into
	the bullhorn:

	Commander:   MOVE IN...MOVE IN...
			GODDAMMIT!

	Sergeant:    (into walkie talkie)
			ALL UNITS... FULL OPERATION!

46	 On the roof, Roger struggles under the dead weight of the young
	man. He tries to free himself and his weapons. Shots ring out.

	A handful of Black and Puerto Rican youngsters charge about the
	rooftop. Another S.W.A.T. patrol appears from behind a large
	elevator housing. The young civilians retreat. Several are mowed
	down.

	Another bullet smashes against the dead S.W.A.T. man's back.
	Just as Roger frees himself, a bullet catches him squarely in
	the chest, but his armour takes the impact. He is thrown back
	off balance, and he struggles to catch his wind as he scrambles
	over to recover his weapon which skitters away across the roof
	top.

	Before he reaches the gun, he is cut off by the looming figure
	of one of the Black youths, pistol in hand. Roger freezes. The
	young man aims his hand gun, but hesitates. A sudden barrage of
	bullets rips through the young Black and he falls in a pool of
	blood. It was Wooley's gun that killed him.

	Wooley:	 COME ON YOU DUMB BASTARDS...
			COME AND GET 'EM...

	He fires again and again, even though the skirmish is winding
	down.

	Roger charges for his weapon, snatches it up, and runs for the
	cover of an incinerator housing. He startles a young civilian
	who was hiding there, trying to load his gun. The boy makes a
	break...

	Roger:	HOLD IT...

	The boy freezes for a moment, then, thinking, breaks into a run
	across the roof.

	Roger:	HOLD IT, KID...DON'T RUN OUT THERE!

	The boy is mowed down in a crossfire.

47	 Inside the building, other S.W.A.T. teams along with units of
	the National Guard are crashing through hallways and breaking
	into apartment units. People are herded into the halls where
	they are held at gun point.

	Some men, although armed, surrender willingly. Others retaliate
	against the invading force, and little skirmishes develop on
	every floor of the complex structure.

48	 On the ground, the Commander barks into the bullhorn:

	Commander:   MASKS...

	Sergeant:    (into walkie talkie)
			MASKS FOR GAS...MASKS FOR GAS.

49	 Tear gas canisters crash through windows and the halls are
	filled with clouds of gas. Civilians trying to escape, are
	choked as they attempt to shoot their way out.

50	 The teams on the roof charge down the fire stairs into the
	building.

	S.W.A.T. 1:  WORK YOUR WAY DOWN. A FLOOR AT A TIME.
			HOLD 'EM IN THE HALLS 'TIL WE CAN WORK 'EM
			DOWN THE STAIRS.

	Roger and Wooley and the men in their unit, snap on their
	bizarre looking gas masks.

51	 The troopers break into an apartment on the floor. An old couple
	kneels in prayer at a small alter, while their children and
	their children's children huddle in a corner. The young husband
	surrenders his gun to a trooper, and Roger watches as the group
	is led into the hallway.

	Suddenly, a young Black man charges out of one of the
	apartments. A woman appears at the door, screaming for him to
	stop. He breaks through a cloud of gas and Wooley fires his
	automatic. The black man crashes to the floor. Wooley is crazed.
	He kicks in the door of another apartment and fires randomly
	into the room.

	The flurry of action causes panic among the civilians in the
	hall. The younger ones try to escape while the older people
	kneel or fall against the walls praying.

	S.W.A.T. 2:  WOOLEY'S GONE APE SHIT, MAN...

	Roger:	WOOLEY! (shouting)

	Wooley kicks in the door of another apartment. Roger charges at
	him and grabs him around the shoulders. The big man resists. His
	gun fires and bullets fly wildly. He struggles against Roger,
	but Roger manages to hold on.

	Roger:	GIMME A HAND...SOMEBODY...

	Another S.W.A.T. Trooper steps up out of the cloud of gas. He is
	very tall and he looks mysterious in the fog as he speaks in a
	deep voice.

	Trooper:	STEP AWAY FROM HIM.

	Roger:	GIMME A HAND.

	Wooley throws his body around and slams Roger against the wall,
	but Roger grabs him again just as the crazed man is levelling
	off his gun at the open apartment door.

	Roger:	GODDAMMIT...HELP ME...HE'S CRAZY!

	Trooper:	STEP AWAY FROM HIM!

	Just then, Wooley wrenches free and pushes Roger across the
	hallway. The Trooper carefully aims his weapon and fires one
	shot through Wooley's head. The big man falls back violently.

	The mysterious Trooper turns and hurries away down the hall.
	Other S.W.A.T. Officers face him threateningly. He stares at
	them through his mask. They let him pass. He disappears through
	the smoke as other officers begin to restore order among the
	civilians.

	Women scream and cry over their dead-loved ones. Roger is helped
	to his feet by another Officer. Roger's eyes are wide and
	staring through the insect-like lenses of his mask. They are
	locked on the sight he sees through the door of the apartment
	which Wooley kicked open. The other Trooper looks and his eyes
	widen as well.

53	 In the apartment, lying in a pool of blood, are the partial
	remains of what was a human body. It has been ripped to shreds.

	Roger staggers against the door frame. The other trooper moves
	inside. Another corpse, also mutilated, one leg missing, one arm
	badly mangled. It is trying to move. To reach the Troopers.

54	 A sudden loud scream. Roger startles and spins around. A woman
	in the hall has seen the grisly sight, and she runs screaming
	down the corridor. More confusion, as civilians push through the
	Troopers who try to hold them back.

55	 The Trooper in the apartment is revulsed...

	Trooper:	JESUS...HOLY JESUS...

	A third officer enters the apartment. He speaks to the Trooper
	which is closest to the writhing corpse on the floor.

	Trooper 2:   SHOOT IT...SHOOT IT THROUGH THE HEAD.

	The young officer is too dumb struck to respond so the third
	Officer pulls out his pistol. Then suddenly, from out of the
	shadows, a spectre-like figure lunges at the third Officer,
	flailing and biting at his arms. It is a wild-haired woman.
	There are several bleeding wounds over her body. She is one of
	the walking dead.

	The Trooper struggles to free himself, and Roger darts into the
	room. Although the Zombie is weak, she manages to hold on to the
	Trooper.

	Another creature suddenly appears in the bedroom doorway. A
	male, it staggers out into the room. The young Trooper struggles
	with his holster trying to free his hand gun. Suddenly, he feels
	something on his leg. The dismembered corpse is clutching his
	ankle, pulling itself closer, it's mouth open. The boy tries to
	pull away, but falls onto the floor, crashing over a table and
	lamp. He tries to crawl away, but the frail corpse keeps its
	hold and drags along behind the young Trooper, who still cannot
	free his pistol.

	Roger and the third Officer fling all their weight against the
	woman Zombie. She flies against a wall, but bounces back
	immediately, and attacks again. The third Trooper's rifle fires.
	A slug tears through the woman's chest but it doesn't stop her
	onslaught. Another shot rips through her neck. Still she comes.

	The boy on the floor manages to level off his pistol. He fires
	at the ghoulish head which draws closer to his leg. The thing's
	skull blows open and its grasp relaxes. The boy is shaking
	violently. His arm and gun stay in the air, still poised. He
	fires again...and again...and again.

56	 In the hall, the male Zombie appears, and the crowd panics. The
	Troopers try to keep things calm.

	S.W.A.T. 3:  IT'S ONE OF THEM...MY GOD...IT'S ONE OF THEM.

	S.W.A.T. 4:  SHOOT FOR THE HEAD.

	Woman:	NO! NO! MIGUEL...DIOS MIO...MIGUELITO...

	The woman pushes through the crowd. The Zombies advances. Before
	the Trooper can stop her, the woman throws her arms around the
	creature.

	Woman:	MIGUEL...MI VIDA...MIGUELITO...

	S.W.A.T. 3:  GRAB HER...GET HER OUT OF THERE...
			(his gun is levelled off, but he can't get a shot)

	The Zombie clutches at the woman. It bites at her neck...her
	arm. She screams with terror. She tries to pull away, but the
	creature holds her. It bites again. A Trooper comes up from
	behind and tries to wrestle the creature away. Another Trooper
	grabs the woman and tries to free her. She is screaming
	insanely. The Zombie pulls another piece of flesh off her arm.

	S.W.A.T. 3:  STAND CLEAR...FOR CHRISSAKE...STAND CLEAR!

57	 In the apartment, the female Zombie lunges at the third Trooper
	and the two tumble to the floor. Roger wrestles her free and,
	with all his might, throws her against the wall. She advances
	again. Roger raises his gun, She is just about to reach him. He
	fires. The bullet drops her.

58	 In the hall, a Trooper brings his gun butt slamming against the
	male ghoul's head. The creature loses his grip on the screaming
	woman. The Trooper who is holding her, pulls her free across the
	floor. S.W.A.T. 3 fires. The bullet tears through the Zombie's
	shoulder...another shot...through his neck...another...through
	the skull. It falls.

59	 There is finally a calm. A few of the citizens murmur prayers.
	Troopers and befuddled old people seem to drift through the
	clouds of gas in a totally dazed state.

60	 Roger and the third Trooper from the apartment drift to the
	hallway. The third Trooper moves into the crowd, but Roger
	stands against the open door jamb for a moment.

	A sudden, loud gunshot makes Roger duck and spin around. He
	looks into the apartment. The young Trooper has shot himself
	through the head.

61	 In the dark firestair, it is very quiet. Roger bursts through a
	metal door from one of the halls and falls against the stair
	railing. He is retching. He breathes heavily to contain himself.
	He removes his mask and coughs slightly from the gas mist which
	still clings in the air.

	Voice:	YOU'RE NOT ALONE BROTHER.

	Roger tightens, grabbing for his gun. The voice is present; very
	nearby. Roger looks up. Sitting on the stairs above is the
	Trooper who shot Wooley. His rifle is aimed at Roger.

	Voice:	YOU WAS IN WOOLEY'S UNIT.

	Roger:	I DIDN'T SEE NOTHIN.
			I DIDN'T SEE HOW HE DIED.

	Roger slings his rifle, so the Trooper relaxes and lowers his
	gun. He removes his gas mask. He is Black.

	Roger:	YOU RUNNIN?

	The Black man shrugs. He hasn't decided.

	Roger:	I DON'T JUST MEAN 'CAUSE OF WOOLEY.
			I JUST MEAN 'CAUSE OF...

	Voice:	YEAH. I KNOW.

	Roger:	THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE RUNNIN'.
			I COULD RUN.

	Roger stares up at the grim faced Black.

	Roger:	I COULD RUN RIGHT TONIGHT.

	The black man just stares levelly into Roger's eyes.

	Roger:	FRIEND OF MINE GOT A HELICOPTER. HE DOES
			TRAFFIC FOR J.A.S. GOT A HELICOPTER AND HE'S
			RUNNIN' OUT WITH IT. AS'T ME T'COME.

	The Black man smiles.

	Roger:	YOU THINK IT'S RIGHT TO RUN?

	The Black man shrugs again, then he stands and walks down the
	stairs. HE turns past Roger on the landing and continues down
	into the lingering gas mist. Roger follows.

62	 A few landings down...a noise. The two Troopers freeze. The
	stairwell is dark. The noise grows louder. The Troopers ready
	their weapons.

	The sounds are little scraping thumps, like the weary foot falls
	of someone...something...trying to negotiate the stairs...There
	is the low, wheezing sound of laboured breath.

	The men stare at the landing below. The Black man steps forward
	slightly, trying not to make a sound.

	Suddenly, a figure pops out of the darkness. It falls against
	the wall below. Both Troopers raise their guns. The figure pulls
	away from the wall. In the mist, it's shape is ghostly...
	robed...in black...is sees the Troopers...

	Figure:	 SENORES...
			PLEASE TO LET ME PASS...

	The voice weakens into a low wheezing cough. The figure slumps
	and sits on the steps, clinging to the railing. It is an old
	Priest, obviously from a local Puerto Rican Parish.

	Roger stoops next to the old man, who is struggling to keep his
	breath. He is weary. He seems to be near death. He clutches at
	his chest.

	Roger tries to support him.

	Roger:	LET'S GET HIM TO THE MEDICS...

	Priest:	 NO...NO...NO...PLEASE. JUST...LET
			ME PASS...MY SISTER...I GO UP TO SEVEN
			FLOOR...TO FIND MY SISTER...

	Roger:	THEY'RE TAKIN' EVERYONE DOWN...THEY PROBABLY
			BROUGHT HER DOWN...COME ONE...

	Priest:	 MY SISTER...SHE IS DEAD...THEY TELL ME...
			THE DEAD THEY DO NOT BRING DOWN.

	Roger and the Black Trooper shoot glances at one another.

	Priest:	 JUST LET ME PASS. MARTINEZ IS DEAD.
			THE PEOPLE OF 107 WILL DO WHAT YOU
			WISH NOW. THESE SIMPLE PEOPLE...
			BUT STRONG...THEY HAVE LITTLE...BUT THEY
			DO NOT GIVE IT UP EASILY. AND THEY GIVE
			UP THEIR DEAD...TO NO ONE!

	The Priest goes into a coughing fit. The Troopers look on. Roger
	wants to help in some way.

	Priest:	 MANY HAVE DIED ON THESE STREETS IN THE LAST
			WEEKS...IN THE BASEMENT OF THIS BUILDING
			YOU FIND THEM...

	The Troopers are shocked. The Priest struggles to his feet.

	Priest:	 I HAVE GIVEN THEM THE LAST RITES.
			NOW...YOU DO WHAT YOU WILL...

	The old man starts up the stairs. Roger moves to help him, but
	the big Black man stops him. The Priest weaves up through the
	gas mist, coughing.

	Priest:	 YOU ARE STRONGER THAN US...BUT SOON, I
			THINK...THEY BE STRONGER THAN YOU...

	The old man's voice trails off up the stairwell as he disappears
	in the cloud...

	Priest:	 WHEN THE DEAD WALK, SENORES...WE MUST
			STOP THE KILLING...OR WE LOSE THE WAR...

63	 In the basement of the large building, S.W.A.T. troopers pry at
	the boards which are nailed over the entrance to the storage
	area.

	The rest of the riot troops stand at the ready, weapons
	raised...high powered rifles...flame throwers...

	The nails creak loudly as they are pulled free. The men are
	silent, not knowing what to expect.

	There are three boards left...then two...

	With a great, tearing sound, the door flies open before the men
	remove the last boards. The boards fly and the door almost rips
	off its hinges. Like flood waters, a small army of Zombies
	pushes into the hall.

	They are wide eyed and terrifying. In life, they were mostly
	Blacks and Puerto Ricans from the neighbouring buildings. They
	are all ages, from the very old to the very young.

	The riot troops are stunned. They cannot react quickly enough,
	and the squeeze is so tight in the little hall that it is
	impossible to shoot accurately, or without the bullets injuring
	other troopers.

	The men fight back, wrestling and trying to back away. In the
	front line, Zombies bite at the flesh of the humans. Teeth tear
	into arms and hands. Some men are trampled in the crush.

	Commander:   BACK OFF...BACK OFF...SPREAD OUT...

	The rear lines retreat into the wider vestibule, and as the mass
	of struggling bodies spreads out, shots begin to fire. Some
	Troopers, at close quarters, are able to fire off accurate
	rounds with their hand guns. Others fall and are lunged at by
	clutching ghouls.

	Roger and the Black Trooper are in the middle of the battle.
	They fight off several of the creatures. The battle spreads into
	little skirmishes through the dark hallways. The highly
	organised Troopers are scattered and confused by the mindless
	onslaught.

64	 As the main action moves away from the entrance to the storage
	area, several Troopers move into the room.

	The walls are dank and grey. There is a dripping sound. All
	around lie remnants of human civilisation. Baby buggies and
	bicycles chained to pipes which ring the area. Large trunks and
	cartons of every size and shape; old beds and other furniture.

	And here and there throughout the large area lie the remains of
	corpses. They have been eaten away. Most of them are still
	moving, their heads uninjured.

	Two of the Troopers retreat, revulsed. The sound of the gunfire
	and screaming can be heard from the hall.

	The big Black man walks calmly into the room. Roger watches him.
	He walks up to the writhing creatures one at a time, and fires
	carefully aimed shots into their heads with his hand gun. Tears
	roll down his cheeks.

	Some of the creatures are without arms and legs. Some have been
	eaten away about the neck and shoulder. They moan with a
	gurgling, gutteral sound as they try to move.

	A young Black Zombie, pulling itself along the floor with one
	arm, draws close to the Black Trooper. The big man aims his
	pistol. It clicks...empty. He quickly and efficiently reaches
	for more ammunition and begins to reload. The Zombie pulls
	closer, its mouth wide.

	Roger steps up behind the other Trooper and fires into the
	creatures head with his automatic rifle.

	The Black man brushes tears from his eyes and continues to load
	the pistol.

	Roger disposes of several other creatures. he comes to a place
	where several are piled together. Some lie still, others writhe
	about. Two on the heap, although they cannot move about, are
	eating at parts of other bodies. Roger shoots them. They never
	look up. They don't seem to notice him at all.

	A loud creaking sound breaks the mood suddenly. Roger looks up.

65	 In the ceiling, a double set of loading doors has been opened.
	Several other Troopers look down into the storage area.

	Trooper:	JESUS CHRIST.

	He shines a light beam down towards Roger.

	Trooper:	YOU OK DOWN THERE?

64	 Roger nods.

65	 Trooper:	THIS MUST BE WHERE THEY DUMPED 'EM IN.

64	 Roger looks down at the pile of corpses beneath the opening.

65	 Trooper:	YOU NEED MORE MEN?

64	 Roger shakes his head "no".

65	 Trooper:	JESUS CHRIST.

	The trooper leaves the opening. He is replaced by two others who
	just stare down into the storage room through the weird, round
	lenses of their masks.

66	 The distant sounds of the battle in the hall flare up again. The
	big Black man snaps his loaded clip into his pistol and takes a
	few steps forwards. He sees a corpse wrapped in a bed sheet and
	tied securely with clothes line. It looks like a mummy. It is
	writhing, trying to free itself. he shoots it through the head.

	Nearby, a small corpse, that of a very young child, is also
	writhing, but the end of the shroud, where the child's feet
	should be, has been torn open and is bloody. A stump kicks
	around the blood where a foot has been eaten off. The Black man
	fires into the thing's head.

	Roger:	THEY...ATTACK...EACH OTHER...

	Black:	JUST THE FRESH CORPSES...BEFORE THEY REVIVE...

	Roger:	WHY DID THESE PEOPLE KEEP THEM HERE? WHY
			DON'T THEY TURN THEM OVER...OR...OR DESTROY
			THEM THEMSELVES...IT'S INSANE...WHY DO THEY
			DO IT?

	Black:	'CAUSE THEY STILL BELIEVE THERE'S
			RESPECT IN DYING.

	The big man fires into the head of another squirming Zombie.

67	 In the halls of the building, Troopers fall and are pounced on
	by ghouls. Other Troopers fire their automatics through the
	heads of attacking Zombies. The riot troops try to stay
	organised, but the onslaught is so mindless and random that it
	is turning into a riot.

68A	The buildings of Philadelphia loom in the moonlight. What few
	lights remain lit reflect in the waters of the Delaware.

68B	It is quiet except for the slight sounds of lapping water and an
	occasional wooden creak as the floating docks strain against one
	another.

	There are a few big Police launches still docked in the marina.
	They bob about silently. The chain, which normally restricted
	the area, is broken and dangling. The sign, which reads: CITY OF
	PHILADELPHIA - POLICE - NO ADMITTANCE clangs against the broken
	chain in the wind.

	Halfway down the long dock is a little guard house. Inside,
	sitting at a radio transmitter, is the corpse of a uniformed
	guard.

	Nearby is a separate floating dock on which is painted a large
	square pattern. It is a landing bay for Police helicopters.
	Alongside, afloat separately but securely chained fast, is a
	small fuel barge, with pumps and hoses for refueling the chopper
	and launches.

	The other bodies lie bleeding on the bobbing docks, another
	officer and a civilian. A bell buoy rings in the distance and we
	begin to hear the sound of an approaching helicopter.

	The blades of the J.A.S. Traffic Copter whine as they gear down
	for a landing. The whirlybird settles like a hummingbird on the
	gently bobbing heliport.

69	 With the blades still spinning loudly, Stephen hops out of the
	cockpit.

	Steve:	COME ON...I NEED YOU.

	Francine unbuckles her safety belt and jumps out of her side of
	the machine. Steve runs, ducking under the blades, around to the
	woman's side of the cockpit, grabs her hand, and they make for
	the fuel pumps.

	Steve:	I DON'T SEE ROGER. WE'LL GIVE HIM TEN MINUTES.

	Fran:	OH MY GOD!

70	 The woman freezes in mid stride, and her action brings Stephen's
	eyes around to see what she is staring at. The two bodies which
	lie near the fuel pumps.

	Steve:	YOU HAVEN'T BEEN OUT IN IT AT ALL.
			IT'S TOUGH TO GET USED TO IT.

	He pulls her quickly along. They have to actually step over the
	civilian corpse. Fran freezes again. She can't bring herself to
	walk over the body. Steve lets go of her hand and checking the
	tank gauge, he pulls the hose with him as he moves quickly back
	to Fran. The long hose is heavy, and it bobbles the civilian
	corpse, almost rolling it over. The back of the bodies head has
	been blown out by the exit wound of a powerful bullet. Blood
	still runs. The wound is fresh. Steve does not see this as he
	tugs the hose over the corpse and moves to the helicopter with
	Fran following.

71	 At the side of the machine, the blades still spinning overhead,
	Steve jams the hose nozzle into the fuel tank receptacle. He
	pulls one of Fran's hands into the nozzle mechanism.

	Steve:	JUST LIKE THIS...LIKE A CAR...

	Fran responds, getting the feel of the nozzle trigger.

	Steve:	THAT'S IT...JUST HOLD HER THERE 'TIL SHE
			SPITS OUT AT YA.

	The woman takes over and Stephen trots away toward the guard
	shed. The propeller blades still spin. They make an eerie,
	whispering sound as they pass over Fran's head. She can hear the
	lapping water now, and the creaking moans of the shifting docks.
	She looks this way and that, fear in her eyes.

72	 At the guard house, Stephen rushes in to find the dead radio
	operator. A signal is coming over the receiver in Morse Code.
	The corpse is slumped over the desk and it is covering the send
	key. A small entry wound is barely visible in the back of the
	dead man's head. As Stephen pulls the body up to an erect
	posture in its chair, he sees that the exit of the bullet all
	but obliterated the corpse's face. Again the wound is still
	running and bits of flesh and blood are splattered about the
	desk and the radio unit.

	Stephen clicks on the send switch and he quickly begins to send
	a message in Morse:

			OPERATOR DEAD...POST ABANDONED...

73	 Back on the fuel dock, the long hose brushes over the civilian
	corpse. A shadow moves nearby, making is aware of a presence
	other than Fran's.

74	 The woman switches hands on the pump nozzle. The blades still
	whoosh overhead. Then she hears the sound of another engine. She
	looks towards the mainland. The headlights of an approaching
	vehicle can be seen.

75	 At the guard house, Stephen, hearing the approaching engine,
	steps into the doorway and looks up the dock. He calls to Fran.

	Steve:	I HOPE IT'S ROGER.

76	 Fran:	WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

	Steve:	I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

77	 He ducks back into the shed. He snatches up a First Aid Kit and
	throws it into a khaki knapsack. He rummages in the darkness. He
	finds a toolbox.

	As he stands up, he backs into a tall figure which stands in the
	shadows. Feeling something sharp and hard against his back.
	Steve recoils and spins to face the figure. It is a uniformed
	officer. His rifle is levelled off at Steve's chest. From out of
	the shadows, a second Policeman appears with a hand gun cocked
	and aimed.

78	 Fran's eyes strain to discern the approaching vehicle, but
	suddenly she catches a movement in the corner of her vision.
	Through the open sides of the helicopter bubble, she notices a
	Police van. It has been there all along, it's doors flung wide
	open, as though abandoned hurriedly. Now one of the rear doors
	move. A figure appears carrying a large packing carton. The
	figure is uniformed, with two rifles strapped to its back. It
	rushes toward the launch docks.

	Voice:	JUST STAY COOL.

	Fran, already startled by the running figure, is now doubly
	shocked by the calm voice behind her. She spins and the fuel
	nozzle clatters out of it's receptacle to the wooden dock
	boards. She is facing another "Policeman", to aims a rifle
	directly at her head.

	Officer 1:   IF YOU DIE...IT'LL BE YOUR OWN FAULT.

	The Officer who is running with the carton shouts toward the
	Guard House.

	Officer 2:   COME ON SKIPPER...THEY GOT FRIENDS COMIN'.

79	 In the Guard House, Steve is held at bay by one of the Officers
	while the other uniformed man moves to the door to check the
	progress of the approaching vehicles.

	Officer 3:   WHO ARE YOU?

	Steve:	WE'RE WITH J.A.S...WE...

	Officer 4:   (at the door)
			ABOUT A MINUTE AND A HALF.
			(referring to the arrival time of the vehicle)

	Officer 3, the Skipper, pushes Steve with his gun barrel. Steve
	spins out through the open doorway. He looks up the dock and
	sees the vehicle which is just turning onto the pier which is
	almost a mile long.

80	 Officer 1 has moved around Fran and he reaches into the
	helicopter bubble pulling out Steve's rifle.

81	 Steve:	NOW WAIT A MINUTE...WE'RE JUST HERE TO REFUEL...
			THESE MEN WERE ALREADY DEAD...YOU WERE HERE...
			YOU KNOW THAT...IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY WAS
			AFTER THE LAUNCHES...WE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH...

	Officer 3:   (looking at the insignia on the helicopter)
			HEY...J.A.S. TRAFFIC WATCH...
			STEVE ANDREWS.

	Steve:	(trying to capitalise on his minor celebrity power)
			RIGHT...THAT'S ME...I'M STEVE ANDREW...

	Officer 3:   NO SHIT.

82	 Officer 1:   (shouting from the helicopter)
			WE'D GET A LOT FURTHER IN THIS BIRD, SKIPPER.

83	 Steve freezes again, sensing that these are not law enforcers.

84	 The man who was carrying the carton is now rushing back up the
	dock having deposited his load in one of the motor launches.

	Officer 2:   CAN'T ALL FIT.

85	 Officer 3:   (directly to Stephen)
			HOW MANY WILL THAT THING HOLD?

	Officer 4:   HEY, MAN, I AIN'T GOIN' NOWHERE IN NOTHIN' I
			CAN'T DRIVER MYSELF!

86	 Officer 2 has returned to the van and is carrying out another
	carton rushing back to the launch.

	Officer 2:   THAT'S TRUE...SOMETHIN' HAPPENS TO HIM AND
			WE'RE STUCK. STAY WITH THE LAUNCH!

	Officer 1:   GET A LOT FURTHER IN THIS BIRD!

87	 Suddenly, above the two white headlights of the approaching
	vehicle, we see a third light in red. It is the spinning
	"bubble-gum-machine" of a Squad Car. It is heralded by one
	blast of the car's siren.

88	 Officer 4:   HEY, THAT'S A BLACK AND WHITE!

89	 Officer 1 still holds his rifle aimed at Fran.

	Officer 1:   THEY SEEN US!

90	 Officer 3:   IT'S ALRIGHT...WE'RE POLICE...

91	 Officer 2 dumps his carton at the edge of the dock and pulls one
	rifle from his back.

	Officer 2:   BULL SHIT...LET'S GET TO THE BOAT!

92	 Officer 3 stares hard at Stephen. Then at the Squad Car. Then
	back at the nervous young pilot.

	Officer 3:   YOU'RE RUNNIN', AIN'T YOU, FLY BOY?

	Steve does not respond. He is terrified, not knowing what answer
	to be the safest.

	Officer 3:   YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS IS RUNNIN' OFF IN THE
			J.A.S. TRAFFIC BIRD...

	The man starts to grin with knowing. He suddenly feels in more
	control.

	Officer 3: SIT TIGHT, BOYS...THEY'RE RUNIN', TOO.

93	 It seems to take forever for the Police Car to pull down the
	dock. Stephen takes a few steps forward, squinting to see, but
	he is threatened by the "Policeman's" gun barrels.

94	 The car screeches to a stop and two armed S.W.A.T. Troopers
	immediately pop out of the front seat on either side. They are
	Roger and the Black Trooper.

	Roger:	WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, OFFICER?

95	 Officer 3:   CAUGHT YOUR FRIENDS HERE STEALIN' COMPANY
			GASOLINE.

96	 Roger:	WHAT DO YOU MEAN FRIENDS?

	Roger is trying to play dumb, assuming that the other Policemen
	are on official business...

97	 Steve:	THEY KNOW, ROG...
			THEY'RE TRYIN' TO GET OUT, TOO.

	Officer 3:   IT'D BE CRAZY TO START SHOOTIN' AT ONE
			ANOTHER, NOW WOULDN'T IT?

98	 Roger:	SURE WOULD.

99	 Officer 1:   ALRIGHT, LET'S LOAD UP...

	He slings his rifle and tosses the other gun back to Fran. She
	bobbles it and it falls, skittering across the dock.

	Officer 1:   YOU BETTER LEARN HOW TO USE THAT THING, WOMAN.
			TIMES IS TENSE.

100	The policemen start to unload crates and cartons from their Van.
	The big Black Trooper pulls a few supplies from out of the squad
	car and carries them toward the helicopter.

101	Fran trots over toward Stephen. He is just coming back out of
	the guardhouse where he picked up the toolbox and the knapsack
	full of supplies. The woman falls into his arms. Roger trots up.

	Roger:	YOU OK?

	Stephen:	(nods)
			WHO'S HE?
			(referring to the big Black)

	Roger:	HIS NAME'S PETER. HE'S ALRIGHT.

	The three are already moving toward the helicopter.

	Roger:	LET'S HUSTLE.

102	Peter has stowed the supplies in the rear of the cockpit, and he
	has noticed the fuel hose lying on the dock. He tries the nozzle
	in the receptacle on the chopper and holds it in until the tank
	fills.

103	The other "Policemen" are still moving cartons of supplies from
	their van down the dock.

	Roger:	(to the other Policemen)
			YOU GUYS BETTER MOVE IT. THERE'S A RADIO
			REPORT ABOUT THE DOCK BEIN' KNOCKED OUT.

104	They reach the cockpit. Fran climbs in and crouches on the floor
	in the rear of the bubble.

	Fran:	YOU SURE THIS'LL CARRY US ALL.

	Steve:	LITTLE HARDER ON THE FUEL, BUT WE'LL BE OK.

105	As Peter climbs aboard, one of the other policemen, carrying a
	final carton, speaks to Roger.

	Officer 2:   HEY...YOU GOT ANY CIGARETTES.

	Roger looks at the others one at a time. Fran shakes her head
	"no".

	Roger:	SORRY. (he trots around to the passenger seat)

	Steve:	WHERE YA HEADED?

	Officer 2:   DOWN RIVER...GOT AN IDEA MAYBE WE CAN MAKE IT TO
			THE ISLANDS.

	Steve:	WHAT ISLANDS? (he starts the engine)

	Officer 2:   ANY ISLANDS...WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHERE YOU HEADED?

	Steve:	STRAIGHT UP.

106	The Policeman rushes off with his two cohorts. As they untie one
	of the launches from the dock, the J.A.S. helicopter whines
	loudly. Then it lifts off the dock with a smooth motion.

	The Police launch starts without a problem, and it pulls out
	onto the dark river.

107	The lights on the helicopter blink as the metal bird swoops low
	over the Philadelphia skyline. We see an empty city.
	Independence Hall...Betsy Ross' House, which flies the original
	American flag...the oldest American heritages stand coldly in
	the night. The whirring engine fades overhead.

108	In the cockpit, Fran lights a cigarette. So does Roger. No one
	comments, but Peter smiles slightly.

	The big Black looks down at the city.

	Peter:	ANY OF YOU LEAVIN' PEOPLE BEHIND?

	Fran:	AN EX-HUSBAND.

	Roger:	AN EX-WIFE.

	Steve:	YOU PETER?

	Peter:	(still looking down)
			SOME BROTHERS.

109	The whirlybird cuts through the dark night sky. It flies over
	open country now, moving West. Some time has passed.

110	Roger is asleep in the passenger seat. Twisted in the cramped
	rear of the cockpit, Fran and Peter sit very close to each
	other. Peter still stares off into the night.

	Fran:	REAL BROTHERS?

	Peter looks at her. He has a strong face.

	Fran:	REAL BROTHERS OR...STREET BROTHERS?

	Peter:	BOTH.

	Fran:	HOW MANY REAL ONES?

	Peter:	TWO.

	Fran:	TWO.

	Peter:	ONE'S IN JAIL. THE OTHER'S A PRO BALL PLAYER.
			BUT WE CATCH UP TO EACH OTHER ONCE IN A WHILE.

	Fran doesn't quite know how to respond.

	Peter:	(nodding at Steve...the engine roars too loudly
			for the pilot to hear the conversation)
			HE YOUR MAN NOW?

	Fran is taken off guard. She smiles slightly.

	Fran:	MOST OF THE TIME, YEAH.

	Peter:	JUST LIKE TO KNOW WHO EVERYONE IS.

	Fran:	YEAH. ME TOO.

111	Light downs on the horizon. The little helicopter chugs through
	the shades of blue.

112	Now Fran is asleep and Roger still snores. Peter stares at the
	back of the pilot's head. Steve nods slightly, then shakes
	himself. Soon, he nods again...falling asleep. Peter kicks him
	in the shoulder.

	Steve looks back, surprised that the big man is awake. Peter
	just stares at him.

	Steve rubs his face violently with his free hand. He pulls at
	his lower eyelids.

	Steve:	ANY MORE WATER?

	Peter reaches into the supplies and produces a plastic container
	with water. Steve slugs some of it and pours a little onto his
	face. Then he passes it back to Peter, who also drinks.

	Suddenly, Fran stiffens and wakes up with a start. Peter looks
	over at her with a gentle expression. She takes a moment to
	orient herself.

	Peter:	(to Stephen)
			YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?

	Steve:	I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE.

	Peter:	HARRISBURG?

	Steve:	PASSED IT ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

	Roger finally wakes up from the loud talking.

	Steve:	WE'RE PRETTY LOW ON FUEL. I'M JUST WAITIN'
			FOR FULL LIGHT SO WE CAN SEE WHAT WE'RE
			LANDIN' IN.

113	In the morning light, several fires can be seen on the ground,
	where buildings are burning.

114	The chopper flies over a National Guard convoy as it chugs up a
	winding country road.

115	Here and there on the ground, human activity can be seen. Search
	and Destroy units, made up of Police, Guardsmen and civilian
	volunteers move across the country side. Occasionally, a Zombie
	is seen staggering through the trees or over a field. Gunfire
	cuts the creature down.

116	Roger:	JESUS. IT'S EVERYWHERE.

	Steve:	WE'RE STILL PRETTY CLOSE TO JOHNSTOWN. WE'RE
			BETTER OFF AWAY FROM THE BIG CITIES.

117	A little country airfield lies quiet in the morning sun. There
	is no sign of life. A few private planes dot the area, but the
	tower is empty. The J.A.S. chopper buzzes very low just outside
	the tower windows.

118	As the whirlybird slowly sets down near the fuel pumps, its
	blades create a wind blast which raises great clouds of dust
	from the dry earth. Sheets of old newspaper and other light
	debris are sent flying through the air in all directions.

119	One piece of torn newsprint blows flat against a window in one
	of the little sheds.  It sticks against the glass for a moment,
	as though glued there, then it flutters to the ground. As the
	paper clears the glass, we see the face of a badly scarred
	Zombie peering out through the window.

120	As the group scrambles out of the helicopter, Stephen
	immediately checks the fuel pumps.

	Steve:	SHIT, MAN, DAMN NEAR EMPTY.

	Roger:	LOTTA PRIVATE PLANES IN FARM COUNTRY LIKE THIS.
			GUESS THEY ALL HIT THE PUMPS AND TOOK OFF.

	Steve:	TO WHERE? WHERE THE HELL CAN THEY GO?

	Peter:	WHERE WE GOIN?

	By now, Steve has drained the dregs from the first pump into the
	chopper's tank, and moved to the second pump. It spurts with
	more force.

	Steve:	THERE'S A GOOD BIT LEFT IN THIS PUMP.

	He stretches the hose toward the chopper but it doesn't quite
	reach.

	Steve:	DAMN. I GOTTA GET IT CLOSER.

121	Steve jumps back into the cockpit and the machine lifts off the
	ground.

122	Fran is watching the action, walking slowly backwards to a small
	rickety hangar area. She turns and looks down to the private
	hangars. Most of them are open wide, the planes they housed long
	gone. One or two of the old wooden double-doors are still closed
	and locked with chains and padlocks. The wind from the chopper
	blades blows her hair and sends more debris flying.

123	Peter kicks open the door to the chart house. The room is dusty
	and dilapidated. A few small chairs surround an old wooden
	table. Several half finished cups of coffee sit on top of
	wrinkled flight charts leaving brown rings on the paper. Flies
	buzz loudly. An old window shade clicks against its window from
	the gusting of the wind and it makes Peter flinch.

	He readies his weapon. When he sees the shade, he steps over to
	it easily, pulls it and lets it roll up on itself. It makes a
	loud, flapping noise.	

124	Outside, the chopper sets down. Roger is ready with the hose
	nozzle. Ducking under the blades he inserts the device into the
	tank receptacle even before Stephen has idled the engine.

	Stephen hops out of the cockpit and shouts over the engine
	noise.

	Steve:	I'M GONNA SEE WHAT'S LEFT IN THE HANGARS.

	He trots off after Fran.

125	In the chart house, Peter idly drops a coin into an old coffee
	machine at one end of the room.  The machine clicks loudly and
	spits out a cup. To Peter's surprise, the cup starts to fill
	with hot brown liquid.

	While he waits. Peter notices a series of notes taped to the
	machine and the surrounding walls. They are all written
	hurriedly in various hands and with all sorts of inks and 
	colours.

			LUCY - GONE TO JOHNSTOWN.
			CHARLES - I HAVE THE KIDS. LEFT WITH BEN.
			COULDN'T WAIT. GONE TO ERIE - JACK FOSTER.

	There are dozens of such messages. Peter takes the full coffee
	cup from the machine. As he sips it, his eyes fall on a closet
	door just across the room. It is moving slightly. It is locked,
	but it bangs against the lock...once...twice...more regularly
	than if caused by the wind drafts.

	Peter steps closer. Now the door bangs violently with a loud
	crash, but it holds. Peter sets his coffee on the chart table
	and takes his rifle in both hands.

	Again the door bangs hard, and a skeleton key is knocked out of
	the keyhole. It falls to the floor with a metallic clang, and
	Peter notices a caked blood stain where blood recently ran out
	of the closet, under the door and onto the linoleum.

	Another bang and a gurgling moan. One of the living dead is
	trying to break out of the closet.

	Quite calmly. Peter raises his rifle and aims it at the door
	about head high. The rifle roars in the little room, and a
	splintery hole appears in the old wooden door.

126	Outside, Fran and Stephen snap to attention at the sound of the
	rifle. Fran stands at the entrance to one of the little wooden
	hangars. Stephen is checking out the cockpit of an old Cessna
	inside. Immediately, Stephen runs out and grabs Fran's hand. As
	they turn the corner to run up the grade to the helicopter, they
	are confronted with two Zombies, staggering slowly towards them
	through the dust cloud from the chopper.

	Fran screams. They have no weapons with them.

	Steve:	ROGER...ROGER...

127	Under the whirling chopper blades, Roger continues to fill the
	fuel tank. In the roar of the engine, he cannot hear anything
	else.

	A third Zombie lumbers toward the helicopter. Roger's back is
	to the creature and he is unaware of the impending danger.

128	Inside the chart house. Peter stares at the closet door. It is
	still for a moment...then another moan and the door bangs again.

	Peter fires two shots, lower right and lower left of the first
	forming a triangle.

129	The two creatures advance slowly on Fran and Steve.

	Steve:	JUST RUN.

	Fran is petrified. She turns and looks behind them. They are
	boxed in by the hangars.

	Steve:	RUN RIGHT PAST 'EM...RIGHT AROUND 'EM.
			THEY CAN'T CATCH YOU.

	She hesitates. The Zombies draw closer.

	Steve:	RUN, FRANNIE. GODDAMMIT, I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
			WE CAN HANDLE THEM!

	Fran charges up the little grade. She runs to the right of the
	creatures and they move in her direction, arms outstretched. As
	she draws near to the dead things, she hesitates again in
	fright. The creatures claw at the air. The one in front is
	within a few feet of the woman.

	Steve:	RUN, FRANNIE. MOVE!

	Fran stares into the dead, staring eyes of the lead Zombie. She
	is almost hypnotised. At the last instant, she runs and just
	gets past the creatures. A little up the grade, she turns and
	looks back, stopping again.

	One Zombie turns slowly and starts up the grade after Fran. The
	other continues to advance on Stephen.

130	Stephen ducks back into the open hangar. It is very dark but for
	thin beams of sunlight which cut through between the wooden
	boards of the structure. Stephen roots around among the greasy
	tools which clutter the area. He finds an enormous sledge
	hammer. He runs out of the shed.

131	He dodges around the lead Zombie, who staggers on with inertia.
	Steve sees that Fran is still facing the second creature. The
	man takes a firm grip on the giant hammer as he charges up the
	grade toward the Zombie's back. As he reaches the creature, he
	brings the twenty pound steel head of the sledge slamming
	against the ghoul's skull with all his might.

	The creature staggers on for a few more steps, its head a bloody
	pulp, then it falls to its knees and finally flops face down in
	the dust.

	Without breaking stride, Stephen grabs Fran's hand and the two
	run toward the helicopter. The other Zombie at the hangar has
	turned around and is walking up the grade.

132	Roger is pumping the last drops out of the fuel hose when he
	sees the frightened couple making for the chopper.

133	As Steve charges up the grade he sees the Zombie approaching
	Roger from behind.  Steve shouts and Roger spins around. The
	stumbling creature is very close. It raises its arms and its
	hands clutch at the air. Roger lets the fuel nozzle drop to the
	ground. He is trapped at the side of the machine. He doesn't
	have his rifle. He fumbles with the snap on his hand-gun
	holster.

	Suddenly, the blank face of the Zombie turns red as the top of
	its head seems to disintegrate into a bloody pulp. The creature
	has walked into the spinning chopper blade. Its body staggers
	forward another step or two, then the thing collapses in a heap.

134	Stephen and Fran have reached the chopper. Steve let's go of the
	woman's hand and he drops his bloody sledge to the ground. He
	lunges into the cockpit and snatches up his rifle, ducking in
	the propeller draft.

135	The Zombie which is stumbling up the grade from the hangars
	almost loses its footing, but it regains its balance and
	advances steadily toward the helicopter.

136	The shot misses clean. He fires again. The bullet grazes the
	creature's face. It staggers from the impact, but does not fall.

137	Roger moves quickly for his high powered weapon. Steve fires
	two more rounds.

138	Another miss and another graze, this time on the arm.

139	He is about to shoot once more when Roger stops him, stepping up
	alongside.

	Roger calmly aims and fires one shot cleanly through the
	creatures' brain.

140	The Zombie falls and papers blow over its body.

141	In the chart house. Peter fires several more shots into the
	closet door. Bullet holes appear just where the creature's head
	should be. There seems to be no way that the volley could have
	missed.

	Silence for a moment. Peter still holds his gun high.

	Then, with a great crash, the closet door flies open into the
	room. Two small children burst out. One has no left arm; the
	other has been bleeding from a great wound in his side. They are
	dead. They move directly toward Peter. Their heads are at least
	a foot shorter than the bullet holes in the closet door.

	Peter stares down at the creatures, revulsed.  He is so startled
	that he cannot react quickly enough, and they are on him. The
	moment he feels their clammy grasp, he regains his survival
	instincts. He cannot effectively aim his rifle. He kicks and
	thrashes around. One creature flies against a wall. The other is
	about to bite the man's arm. The big Black grabs the small
	Zombie and flings it physically back. The other creature pounces
	on his back. He throws it over his shoulders and it crashes
	against its brother.

	Now Peter raises his gun. As the children try to scramble to
	their feet the man fires several shots in rapid succession.
	First one creature falls; then the other.

	Peter continues to fire, his eyes wide with desperation and
	disgust. Finally his weapon clicks. It is out of ammunition.

	Peter breathes heavily. He stares at the small corpses.
	Instinctively, he begins loading his weapon, without even
	looking at the action, as he backs wearily out toward the door
	of the chart house.


142	Behind him, in the brightly sunlit doorway, we see the Zombie
	who first appeared at the window. The creature staggers forward.
	Peter turns and startles. He reaches for more shells and backs
	away a few steps as he tries to load the bullets into his gun.
	The creature reaches out and takes another step into the room.

	Peter stares into the creatures eyes. Then suddenly, out in the
	sunlight, a few hundred feet behind the Zombie, Stephen appears
	with his rifle. Peter sees the man over the creature's shoulder.

143	Steve raises his gun and aims at the Zombie, but the barrel
	seems to be on a straight line with Peter.

144	Peter ducks quickly. Steve's gun fires. The bullet misses the
	creature cleanly and crashes into the room. It ricochets off
	the coffee machine. Another shot crashes through the glass in
	the front room.

	Peter crouches, still stuffing shells into his weapon. A third
	of Stephen's bullets tears through the Zombie's shoulder, but
	the creature still stands. It turns toward Peter slowly. Peter
	crawls under the table as another shot splatters into the coffee
	cups.

145	Once again, Roger steps up beside Stephen.  He fires one
	carefully aimed shot, looking through his telescopic range-
	finder.

146	Just as Peter finishes loading his weapon, the Zombie crashes
	into the room, falling over the table and onto the floor.

147	Fran is still kneeling in the dust, trying to keep herself from
	vomiting. Stephen rushes to her side. Roger, keeping his rifle
	poised, shouts toward the chart house.

	Roger:	PETER.

148	The big Black man appears in the doorway, snapping the safety on
	his rifle.

151	Fran's retching causes her to choke and cough. Steve tries to
	comfort her, not knowing what to say and shaking himself.

152	Peter advances with long strides.

153	Stephen looks up when the Black man is a dozen steps away.
	Immediately, he sees the anger in Peter's eyes. The big Trooper
	then raises his rifle and aims it a Stephen. Steve tries to
	stand, but trips and falls on his back in the dust. In an
	instant, Peter is looming over him with the barrel of his rifle
	aimed at point blank range for the shivering man's forehead.

	Fran screams through her choking...

	Fran:	NO...MY GOD...DON'T... WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

	Peter speaks calmly to Stephen, in low tones.

	Peter:	YOU NEVER AIM A GUN AT ANYONE, MISTER.
			IT'S SCARY.
			ISN'T IT?
			ISN'T IT?

	Stephen looks up at the tall man, shivering. Then Peter lowers
	his weapon and extends his hand, helping Stephen up onto his
	feet.

154	Roger clears the fuel hose from around the runners of the
	chopper. Peter climbs into the cockpit and sits in the rear
	without saying another word.

	Roger helps Fran climb aboard. Steve wanders around the front of
	the cockpit bubble and climbs into the Pilot's seat. Roger
	climbs in behind Fran as she squeezes into the uncomfortable
	space beside Peter. The big black offers the woman a sip of
	water, which she accepts. Then she lets her head flop wearily
	against the rear bulkhead.

155	Steve is urgently surveying his flight charts, shuffling the
	papers and trying to seem very busy after the embarrassment of
	the incident.

	Steve:	WE GOTTA FIND FUEL. MAYBE CLOSER TO PITTSBURGH.

	Roger:	NO, WE'VE GOTTA STAY OUT OF THE BIG CITIES.
			IT IT'S ANYTHING LIKE PHILLY WE MIGHT NEVER
			GET OUT ALIVE.

	Peter:	WE MIGHT NOT GET OUT OF ANY PLACE ALIVE.
			WE ALMOST DIDN'T GET OUT OF HERE.

	Roger:	WE'RE GETTIN' OUTA HERE FINE.
			AS LONG AS THERE'S NOT TOO MANY OF THOSE
			THINGS WE CAN HANDLE 'EM EASY.

	Peter:	YEAH, WELL IT WASN'T "THOSE THINGS" THAT
			NEARLY BLEW ME AWAY!

	Stephen turns around and is about to say something angrily.
	Roger stops him by speaking urgently.

	Roger:	WE GOTTA STAY IN THE STICKS. THERE'S BOUND TO
			BE MORE LITTLE PRIVATE AIRPORTS UPSTATE.

	Steve:	(reluctantly going back to his charts)
			THERE'S THE LOCKS ALONG THE ALLGHENY.
			FUEL STATIONS THERE, PRIVATE AND STATE.

	Roger:	PROB'LY STILL MANNED. WE DON'T NEED THOSE
			HASSLES EITHER.

	Steve:	THEY'RE JUST OUT AFTER SCAVENGERS...LOOTERS...

	Peter:	OH, YOU GOT THE PAPERS FOR THIS LIMOUSINE?

	Steve:	(angrily)
			I GOT J.A.S. ID. SO DOES FRAN.

	Peter	RIGHT. AND WE'RE OUT HERE DOIN' TRAFFIC REPORTS?
			WAKE UP, SUCKER. WE'RE THIEVES AND BAD GUYS IS
			WHAT WE ARE. AND WE GOTTA FIND OUR OWN WAY!

	There is a long silence. The engine drones, but the helicopter
	still sits on the ground. The men look at each other. Peter
	takes a long slug of water.

	Fran:	JESUS CHRIST. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE WE'RE
			GOING.  WE DON'T HAVE A RADIO.  WE'RE RUNNING
			OUT OF WATER. WE NEED FOOD....STEPHEN,
			YOU NEED TO SLEEP.

156	We see a wide shot of the little airfield. The J.A.S. chopper
	sits on the ground for a moment, it's props spinning. The, with
	a surge of power, it lifts off and flies away. The dry earth
	swirls up into clouds and blows more bits of paper over the
	wide-eyed corpses which lie in the morning sunlight.

157	We see the facade of an enormous structure. It is a huge,
	suburban shopping mall. The outer walls are all concrete, and
	their clean lines stretch upward for more than two storeys. The
	building looks like a giant domino lying flat on the ground.
	There are only four entrances, and the shops which are housed
	within have no windows opening onto the surrounding lot.

158	In the immense area around the building, lanes and stalls are
	painted for automobile parking. What few cars now dot the area
	are parked randomly, some with their doors open wide.

159	We hear the sound of the helicopter engine fading in, then we
	see the little machine as it approaches and eases down onto the
	roof of the building.

160	In the parking lot, walking among the abandoned vehicles, we see
	several of the living dead.  They look almost like normal
	shoppers at the mall for morning chores, but their lumbering	walk is unmistakably stiff.
161	At one of the mall entrances, we see a revolving door flanked
	by several regularly hinged doors, all made of glass and
	surrounded by large windows. A few of the Zombies manage to	negotiate the hinged doors and enter the building. Others bounce
	off windows and claw the transparent glass in confusion. One
	creature walks around in the revolving door endlessly.

	There are a good many of the creatures, but they are spread out
	and far between. They move with no seeming purpose.
	We do not yet see the mall interior.  The Zombies pay no	attention to the sound of the chopper engine stopping overhead.

162	On the roof, even as the blades of the helicopter still spin,
	the humans are out and moving to the edge of the building. They
	look down at the creatures which dot the parking lot.

	Fran:	OH MY GOD!

	Stephen:	NO CHANCE. FORGET IT, LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.
	Roger:	WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE...THEY CAN'T			GET UP HERE.
	Steve:	YEAH, AND WE CAN'T GO DOWN THERE!

	Roger:	LET'S CHECK IT OUT.
	Roger trots away.
163	Peter has moved directly to an area where a giant grid of
	transparent Plexiglas bubbles face down into the building. He
	stares through one of them and can see into the mall below.
	Roger trots up and peers through another of the bubbles.
	Peter:	MOST OF THE GATES ARE DOWN. I DON'T THINK			THEY CAN GET INTO THE STORES.164	The vantage point only reveals a small aspect of the interior,
	a square plaza with a garden beneath the sunroof of transparent
	bubbles. The space is open all the way down to the garden, which
	is two storeys below. Around the garden on the bottom floor can
	be seen the entrances to several shops. All but one have heavy
	metal cage gates down and locked into position.
	One or two Zombies are seen wandering about. They cannot enter
	the stores, except for the one which is un-gated.

	Halfway up the walls can be seen a balcony railing which rings
	the entire plaza, it is a second storey of shops. The same cage-
	gates seal off the visible store entrances, but none of the dead
	creatures are evident on the balcony.

165	Fran and Stephen come trotting up to the bubbles.

	Roger:	I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM UP ON THE SECOND
			FLOOR.

	Peter:	THE BIG DEPARTMENT STORES USUALLY USE BOTH
			FLOORS.

	Roger:	IF WE CAN GET IN UP TOP...

166	Peter is looking across the rest of the expansive rooftop. He
	takes off toward a series of other housings which jut up out of
	the otherwise flat surface. Roger follows.

167	Fran:	(still staring down through a bubble)
			WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
			WHY DO THEY COME HERE?

	Steve:	(also looking down)
			SOME KIND OF INSTINCT. MEMORY...OF WHAT THEY
			USED TO DO. THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT PLACE IN
			THEIR LIVES.

168	Below, the Zombies which are in sight wander aimlessly over the
	plaza. Some try the gates but cannot budge them. One wanders out
	of the single open shop, it is a female. The shop is an
	appliance store. As the creature leaves she drags a toaster idly
	behind her, pulling it by its power cable. It scrapes on the
	floor loudly.

169	We see an installation of large reflectors mounted in an
	intricate metal skeleton which stretches across a large area of
	the roof surface.  Behind the structures can be seen a large
	power generator.

170	Peter:	SOLAR SCREENS.

	Roger:	CAN'T BE ENOUGH TO POWER THIS PLACE.

	Peter:	EMERGENCY SYSTEM, MAYBE.

	Roger:	IT'S PRETTY LIT UP IN THERE.

	Peter:	GUESS THE POWER'S NOT OFF IN THIS AREA.
			A LOT OF PHILLY'S STILL LIT. COULD BE NUCLEAR.

171	Roger:	HEY LOOK AT THIS!

	Roger is peering down through a wire-hatched skylight. There are
	several laid out over this particular area of the roof. He moves
	to another while Peter looks down into the first. Fran and
	Stephen jog up.

	Roger:	THESE DON'T GO DOWN INTO THE MALL.
			WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

	Fran and Stephen peer down into the darkness. Peter pulls a
	flashlight from his utility belt.  He has stayed in full uniform
	all the while, where Roger has stripped off all but his
	ammunition belt and pistol holster.

172	The big man shines a light beam down into the space. The floor
	is only seven feet or so below the window. There is absolutely
	nothing in sight; clear floor, clear walls, all light grey.

	Peter:	DAMN.

173	Roger has moved to another window.

	Roger:	HEY, OVER HERE. THERE'S SOMETHIN' HERE.

174	Peter trots over and shines his beam down. They see a vast
	array of cardboard cartons...hundreds of them.

	Roger:	STORAGE?

175	Peter moves the light beam. Now it illuminates a collection of
	large drums, stacked floor to ceiling and running deep past the
	line of vision. On the face of each drum is the familiar symbol
	of a triangle within a circle, and the letters C.D.

176	Peter:	CIVIL DEFENCE. CIVIL DEFENCE WATER SUPPLY.

	Roger:	AND BOXES OF CANNED FOOD!

	Steve:	HOW DO WE GET DOWN THERE?

	Peter looks at Stephen as a street-wise-tough would look at a
	hopeless city-slick-sissy. Then the big man brings his rifle
	butt down against the glass and the shattered pane crashes to
	the floor below.

177	Inside - the vast space is impressive. It is quite dark but for
	rays of sunlight which drift through the occasional skylights.
	We see an enormous quantity of food cartons and water drums, it
	is very quiet. The space is barren except for the stacks of
	Civil Defence supplies.

178	Suddenly, a figure drops out of one of the skylights, landing on
	its feet in the sunray. It is Peter.	Instantly he readies his rifle, looking this way and that across
	the large room. Silence.

	Peter:	OK.

	He steps aside and Roger climbs in. He too drops cat-like to the
	floor.179	The two men instantly sling their rifles and move to the food
	cartons as by pre-arranged plan. They carry the big boxes
	quickly, one at a time, to the spot under the open skylight.	In a moment, they have built a pyramid out of the cartons. It
	creates a kind of stairway for a quick escape through the window
	above.

180	Now Fran lowers herself into the room and is able to climb down
	the cartons holding onto Roger's hand. She is followed by an
	anxious Stephen.181	Peter has already wandered off. There are only two doors in the
	enormous room, one at either end. The big Trooper moves up to
	one of them as Roger comes up behind him, gun ready.	Peter's hand turns the doorknob. It is unlocked, and the big man
	gives Roger a familiar nod. Roger stands several feet back, his
	rifle aimed directly at the door and ready to fire. Then, with a
	sudden, commando-like motion. Peter throws the door open and
	ducks away flat against the wall. Roger stiffens, his finger all
	but pulling his trigger, but there is no apparent danger.

182	The door opens onto another vast room, equivalent to the one the
	people are in. It also has stacks of C.D. supplies.

	The Troopers cautiously move into the area through the door. The
	room is empty. The same sunrays pierce the darkness through
	skylights. All is dead quiet. This room has no doors at all, but
	for the one Peter opened.
	Roger:	DOUBLE DAMN! LOOKS LIKE A FREE LUNCH, BUDDY.183	In the first room Stephen has started to rip open one of the
	cartons.

	Fran:	SPAM!

	Roger walks back into the room.
	Roger:	YOU BRING A CAN OPENER?

	Fran:	OH.

	Roger:	THEN DON'T KNOCK SPAM. IT'S GOT IT'S OWN KEY.

	The woman flips over the can in her hand and finds the little
	key.

	Peter has walked right past the group.  He is moving quickly
	toward the still-unknown door at the other end of the room.
	Again, Roger follows.

184	At the door, the two Troopers go through the same S.W.A.T.
	procedure. The door swings open, this time onto a very small
	space. Again no immediate danger.

185	As the men enter, they discover that they are on the top landing
	of a concrete and metal firestair. There are no windows, and the
	air is musty. There is one bare light bulb lit in the ceiling,
	but down the stairs at the next landing it is quite dark, and
	there the stairs wind even further down; they recede into
	blackness.

	Roger:	WHATD'YA THINK?

	The Black man just stares, first down into the darkness then
	back into the storage area.

	Roger:	THIS IS THE ONLY WAY UP HERE. WHATD'YA THINK?
			CUT.

186	A great barricade of food cartons has been stacked against the
	stairway door.

187	Near the pyramid under the open skylight, the group of refugees
	sits on the floor.

	Stephen is asleep. Fran sits next to his curled form, her hand
	in his hair. Roger leans against the pyramid and Peter sits in
	the lotus position, his gun across his legs, squarely facing the
	suspicious stairwell. He and Roger still pick at their food.
	Roger swills water from an empty Spam can which he has filled
	from one of the C.D. drums.

	Roger:	YOU BETTER GET SOME SLEEP, TOO, BUDDY.

	Peter:	THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF STUFF DOWN THERE THAT
			WE COULD USE, BROTHER.

	Roger:	I KNOW IT.

	Fran stiffens at the talk.  She doesn't believe what she is	hearing. She knows instantly that the men will try to raid the
	mall.	Peter:	THEY'RE PRETTY SPREAD OUT DOWN THERE.
			IT'S A BIG PLACE. I THINK WE WOULD OUT-RUN 'EM.

	Roger:	HIT AND RUN.

	Peter:	HIT AND RUN... MAYBE GRAB US OFF A RADIO...

	Fran:	YOU'RE CRAZY!	Roger:	THIS PLACE COULD BE A GOLD MINE.
			WE GOTTA AT LEAST CHECK IT OUT.

188	Roger checks his weaponry and quickly moves toward the door
	where he begins to remove the barricade of cartons. Peter still
	sits, checking his own guns.

189	Fran:	THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AWAY
			FROM...LOOK WHAT HAPPENED AT THE AIRPORT...

	Peter:	THE ONLY PROBLEM AT THE AIRPORT WAS STRAY BULLETS!
			WE COULD OUTFIGHT THOSE DUMMIES BLINDFOLDED.

	Fran:	STEPHEN...(the exhausted Pilot is sleeping through
				it all)

	Peter:	(standing)
			LEAVE HIM BE. WE'RE GOIN' OURSELVES.

	The big Trooper bends over snatching up Stephen's rifle. He
	snaps off the safety and slams a shell into the chamber. He
	hands it to the woman.	Peter:	THAT'S READY TO SHOOT. BE CAREFUL.
	Fran holds the gun gingerly.	Peter:	THE TRIGGER SQUEEZES REAL EASY, BUT THE WEAPON'LL
			KICK YOU GOOD WHEN IT FIRES. BE READY FOR THAT.

	Fran	 WAIT A MINUTE, I...

	Peter:	ANYONE BUT US COMES UP THEM STAIRS, YOU GUYS
			TAKE OFF IN THE MACHINE. WE'LL TRY TO MAKE IT
			OUT TO THE PARKIN' LOT. YOU CAN PICK US UP THERE.

	Fran just stares up at the big man, with desperation in her
	eyes. She has stopped arguing seeing that the Troopers'
	decision is made.

	Peter:	IF WE DON'T SHOW UP AFTER A FEW MINUTES...
			WE'LL CATCH UP TO YOU SOME OTHER TIME.			YOU UNDERSTAND?190	In the dimly lit firestair, the door on the top landing pulls
	open suddenly. The stairway is still empty.	The Troopers move slowly out onto the landing. They look down
	into the darkness below. Then they move slowly and silently down
	the steps. Fran appears on the upper landing. She stands in the
	doorway clutching the rifle.	Peter stops for a moment, looking back up at the frightened
	woman.	Peter:	YOU'LL PROB'LY HEAR SOME SHOOTING.			JUST DON'T PANIC, OK.

	Fran sighs exhaustedly.

	Peter:	YOU'LL BE ALRIGHT. IT'S OUR ASSES THAT'S IN
			THE FIRE.

191	Two landings below, there is almost no light. Roger clicks on
	his flashlight and shines the beam around. He is in a very small
	concrete space. The stairs go down no further. There is only one
	door. Peter eases down the steps behind.	Roger:	THIS IS THE ONLY WAY UP THERE.192	We see the other side of the metal door. It stands in another
	cement walled space, which also seems small from our angle, but
	it is fully lit.	The door opens slowly, and the Troopers cautiously step out. As
	the camera swings around, we see that the men are at the end of
	a long narrow hallway. Directly across from them are two open
	supply rooms, one containing a stationery sink and a toilet.
	Both rooms are filled with cleaning supplies.193	Down along the hall can be seen a dozen or so doorways. Some
	doors are open, some are closed. Along the opposite wall there
	is nothing.	The far end of the hall, about a hundred yards away, opens out
	onto the second story of the mall proper.194	The men look at one another and slowly move down the corridor.
	They try the first two doors, which are locked. The third is
	wide open.
195	Roger ducks quickly into the room with his rifle raised. It is
	a large administrative office, with rows of desks which are
	fully equipped for a staff of secretaries and accountants.196	The next room has a closed door, but it is unlocked. Peter	swings the door open and silently jumps into the room. This is
	a much more spartan area, with two metal desks and a few chairs.
	There are several phones. It is a maintenance office. On one
	wall is a large map of the mall, with pin flags and scribbling
	over an acetate which covers the drawing. At the other end of
	the space is a huge electrical panel with circuit breakers and
	an entire series of master controls all keyed by a number code
	to another map of the mall showing electrical installations.	On the wall behind Peter is a large blackboard and two metal
	cabinets. One is open. It contains all sorts of tools, manual
	and electric. There are circuit testers, walkie talkie units and
	there are several enormous rings containing hundreds of keys,
	also colour and number coded. Peter grabs up one of the rings
	and Roger steps up behind him.	Roger:	THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM.197	Back in the hallway, Roger's hand tries another doorknob and	throws the door open. This opens onto beautifully plush offices,
	obviously the executive headquarters.	The rooms interconnect, and while Peter walks from door to door
	in the corridor, Roger moves through the inner doors, meeting
	Peter at each room. One office is more elegant than the next,
	with the latest in designer furniture and expensive decorations.198	The Troopers finally reach a room on which both the interior and
	corridor doors are closed and locked. The brass nameplate on the
	interior door reads C.J. Porter - President.199	Roger moves out to the corridor where he joins Peter. They move
	into the exterior corridor. They are very near the end of the
	hall, and the brightly lit shopping area is close at hand. They
	can only see a small section.200	The balcony on their side is railed off against the open drop
	down to the first floor, and across the great cavity they see
	the opposite balcony. On the far side only two store fronts can
	be seen. They are both gated and shut.
201	The two realise what dangers might face them in the mall proper.
	They look at each other and move forward, each clinging to
	opposite walls in the corridor.202	As they reach the mall proper they slowly and carefully peer
	around their respective corners.

203	The upper balcony totally surrounds the vast interior of the
	building, and at several points bridges across from one side to
	the other. Little shops of all types run along the entire length
	of the balcony, and at each far end, stands the entrance arches
	for a large department store.	Most of the stores are gated, but several seem open. The big
	department stores are gated and locked. Here and there tall
	trees grow up from the ground floor and reach up into view of
	the second storey. There are none of the living dead evident on
	the balcony.204	The two troopers move slowly and quietly to the railing. The
	crouch and peer down through the bars of the rail. Below, the
	sight is even more spectacular.205	Stores of every type offer gaudy displays of consumer items.	Everything from clothing to appliances. Photo equipment; audio
	and video outlets; sporting goods and weaponry; gourmet foods
	and natural organic foods. There is a Book Store, a Record
	Store, a Real Estate Agency and a Bank; A Novelty Shop, a Gift
	Shop; all with the absolute latest in American consumer items.
	And at either end of the concourse like the main Altars at each
	end of a Cathedral, stand the mammoth two storey Department
	Stores; great symbols of a consumer society.
	Down the centre of the ground floor, along with the gardens and
	park benches, are little stalls. One is a Tobacco Specialist
	another Jewellery; another is a small Photo Portrait stall where
	mothers had their children photographed. There are restaurants
	and Snack Bars and numerous coin operated machines selling
	everything from children's toys to Blood Pressure readings.
	There is a large turntable, designed to spin but which is now
	still, holding a late model car on exhibit. Another turntable
	displays futuristic household appliances.	The images are all too familiar, but in their present state they
	appear as an archaeological discovery revealing the Gods and
	Customs of a civilisation now gone.

	The ghosts of a civilisation, however, are not figments in the
	mind. They are quite real. And they walk below in the aisles of
	the great Cathedral. At least twenty Zombies can be seen from
	the Troopers' perspective.

206	Roger:	IT'S CHRISTMASTIME DOWN THERE, BUDDY.
	Peter:	FAT CITY, BROTHER. HOW WE GONNA WORK IT.	Roger:	WE GET INTO THE DEPARTMENT STORES UP HERE.			THEY PROB'LY HAVE THEIR OWN ESCALATORS INSIDE.

	Peter:	LET'S CHECK THOSE KEYS.

207	The Troopers stealthily pull away from the railing and back into
	the administrative corridor. Then they move quickly down the
	hall toward the Maintenance Office.

208	As the men leave the balcony, the camera pans. Several yards
	away a Zombie staggers out of one of the open stores. It is
	followed by a second creature, a female without one arm. They	are moving along the balcony toward the open corridor.

209	In the Maintenance Office, the Troopers are checking the keys
	against the coded map on the wall.

	Roger:	SEVENTY TWO...U. AND D. ...HERE IT IS...

	The men check the keys. Peter finds corresponding numbers.

	Peter:	HERE.
	Roger:	LET'S JUST HOPE IT'S RIGHT.	Peter:	LOOK HERE (on the map) THESE NUMBERS MUST ALL
			BE LOCKS (he points) FRONT...SIDE...BACK OUTSIDE,
			MUST BE LIKE LOADING DOCKS...BUT WHAT ARE THESE?

	The man points to several numbered spots which seem to be within
	the big Department Store they are studying.	Roger:	WASHROOMS...EQUIPMENT...I DUNNO.	Roger moves off toward the electrical control panel. Peter still
	stares at the map.	Peter:	I GUESS THESE GOTTA BE THE GATES.
	Roger:	HOW ABOUT A LITTLE MUSIC?
	Peter:	WHAT?210	The big Black moves up behind his partner. One of the controls
	on the panel is marked: MUSIC TAPE. It indicates a master switch
	which is in the off position. Another is marked FLOOR EXHIBITS
	and a series of others are marked ESCALATORS. There are dozens
	of master switches which are in the off mode.
	Peter:	POWER SWITCHES.
	Roger:	THE MUSIC MIGHT COVER THE NOISE WE MAKE.	Peter:	HIT 'EM ALL. MIGHT AS WELL HAVE POWER IN			EVERYTHING. WE MIGHT NEED IT.

	Roger hits the switches one at a time.

211	Throughout the mall, we hear the drone of the dull, mass
	produced music designed to lull a shopper's brain.212	Upstairs, Francine startles at the sound from below. She snaps
	the rifle into her hands, ready to fire. She has been standing
	just inside the storage area. She steps into the firestair and
	looks down into the darkness. The sounds of the insipid music
	drift up to her. She leans into the storage area again.

	Fran:	STEPHEN...
			STEPHEN!

213	Steve, still lying on the floor against the escape pyramid,
	slowly awakens.214	Down on the first floor of the big mall, things begin to work.
	The automobile turntable starts spinning; the great escalators
	move up and sown. Two of the living dead, caught just starting
	up two stalled escalator, fall and roll down as the mechanical
	steps begin moving.

	Lights blink on the exhibits, and mechanical window displays
	begin their robot-like motions. It is like a Carnival coming
	alive. The Zombies which wander the floor look about in
	confusion. Some of them swat ineffectively at the moving
	exhibits.215	In a very tall cage, which reaches from the first floor all the
	way to the ceiling, the Tropical Birds which are housed within
	begin to flutter and squawk.216	In a pet shop, there are puppies and kittens in a window
	display. They whine and scramble over one another in fright at
	the noise and the motion and the coloured lights.217	On one of the floor exhibits, a rear-projection movie starts. It
	is a dryly produced film about the merits of a Real Estate
	Developer's new tract of suburban houses. A narrator speaks in a
	friendly voice:
			... and for prices which anyone can afford,			you can live in these luxurious new homes
			by Brandon. Fully electric, central air, ..etc.

218	In the Maintenance Office, the Troopers ready themselves for
	their raid. Peter secures the vital key ring to his utility	belt and the move out.

	Peter and Roger move down the Hall and exit through door to
	exterior corridor.

219	Just as Roger moves through the door into the corridor, he is
	confronted by the Zombies from the balcony. He startles and
	ducks back into the room. The closest Zombie is reaching out
	with clutching hands. Peter raises his gun and fires two shots
	cleanly through the creature's head.220	As the shots ring through the area, Fran, standing at the top of
	the firestair, startles. Steve grabs the rifle from the woman.

	Steve:	JESUS CHRIST...
			THEY'RE MANIACS.

221	The Troopers step over the corpse. The second Zombie, the
	arm less female, is walking toward them. This time Roger fires
	his weapon. The creature falls in a heap.	Roger:	WHATD'YA THINK? BAG IT OR TRY FOR IT?
	Peter:	YOU GAME?	Roger nods and the two men run down the hall toward the mall.	Their rifles poised, they are like commandos on an important
	mission.

	The men at the mall mouth see the department store and start for
	it. They run from the corridor onto the balcony.222	The battle to win the mall has begun. The creatures which wander
	the first floor look about, attracted by the sound, but they are
	confused. They walk this way and that, in mis-guided staggering
	strides.223	Several of the Zombies try to move up the down-escalator. They
	fall over themselves and cannot negotiate the moving stairway.224	A few creatures who move onto the up-escalator also fall against
	each other from the movement, but one falls onto the moving
	steps and is carried upward. Then another manages to keep its
	balance holding on to the hand rail.
225	At another point down the length of the mall, there is a
	stationary stairway which runs from the first to the second	floor. Several creatures move up the steps.

226	At the top of the firestair, Stephen begins to move down the
	steps cautiously. His rifle is at the ready. Fran stays on the
	top landing.	Fran:	STEPHEN, DON'T GO DOWN THERE.			(he continues)
			STEPHEN PLEASE!

	Steve:	IT'S ALRIGHT.

227	At the huge gate which locks off the big Department Store,
	the two Troopers come to a crashing stop.

228	There is a side concourse which can be seen from this vantage
	point, and in the hall are four or five Zombies. They are about
	three hundred feet away.

229	Roger keeps his rifle levelled off in the direction of the
	creatures while Peter confronts the lock at the middle of the
	big roll gate.	He fumbles with the keys for a moment until he finally sinks	the proper key into the receptacle which is right at the floor.	The tumblers turn successfully.	Peter:	ALRIGHT!

230	On the escalator, the creatures which fell onto the moving steps
	are being carried up to the balcony. The one supporting himself
	on the hand rail is still standing. The head of the standing
	Zombie suddenly becomes visible from Roger's perspective.

231	The Trooper raises his gun and aims for the creature's forehead.

	Peter tries to life the roll gate. It won't move. It is still
	locked.	Peter:	YOU BASTARD!
	Roger:	WHAT?

	Peter:	STILL LOCKED...(he sees another assembly)
			ON THE SIDE...

	The big man moves to the far side of the gate. The same key
	fits. Roger re-focuses on the creature which is riding the
	escalator. It is quite near the top now. Roger is about to
	shoot when something catches his eye.

232	The fallen Zombies, which up to now could not be seen behind the	escalator rail wall, suddenly come tumbling out onto the balcony
	floor.233	Roger fires, but his aim is inaccurate.234	He hits the standing Zombie in the neck. The creature is thrown	off balance enough to lose its footing. It falls back down the
	escalator, but before it reaches the bottom, it stops rolling.
	The steps carry it back up toward the second floor again. It is
	still very much alive. The two creatures on the balcony struggle
	to stand.235	Roger looks back over his shoulder.236	The Zombies from the side concourse are now about a hundred and
	fifty feet away.

237	Peter turns the key in the lock, but again the gate will not
	lift. It moves slightly, as the middle mechanism and the one on
	the far right are free, but there is a third lock on the far
	left. Peter moves to it quickly.238	On the first floor concourse, other creatures are beginning to	take note of the action upstairs. They start to move.239	The Zombies on the stationary stairway are beginning to reach
	the second floor, but they are far down the main balcony. They
	will have to pass the administrative corridor in order to reach
	the Department Store.

240	Roger fires again.

241	One of the nearby Zombies falls in a heap.

242	At the sound of the rifle, Fran gets desperate.

	Fran:	STEPHEN...FOR GOD'S SAKE...LET'S GET UP ON THE
			ROOF...243	Steve is at the middle landing. He stares down into the darkness
	below. More gunfire can be heard from the mall.

	Steve:	IT'S ALRIGHT, I'M TELLIN 'YA. THOSE THINGS			DON'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH TO CATCH US.	More gunfire can be heard.244	Now the giant gate rolls up with a loud rumble. Peter ducks into
	the store even as the gate is still rising, but the inertia of
	the great metal cage carries the lip up out of Peter's grasp. He
	jumps to try to catch it, but he misses. It jerks up into its
	fully open position and rolls back down slightly, but still
	Peter cannot reach the lip. It slides back to rest about three
	feet above Peter's fingertips.245	The Zombies advance.246	Roger drops another with a clean shot through the head, then he
	backs into the archway of the Department Store entrance. Peter
	is desperately looking around for something to stand on to reach
	the gate.247	The Zombies are very close to the arch now, advancing steadily.

248	Peter grabs a small counter used to display shoes, but it is too
	heavy for him to move himself.

	Peter:	HERE...COME ON...

	Roger has to abandon his post at the arch long enough to help
	drag the little counter. The men drag it to a point just at the
	side of the open arch, and Peter instantly jumps up on the top
	of it. At that instant, a Zombie rounds the corner and grabs at
	Peter's legs. The big man kicks, startled, and the motion causes
	him to fall off the little counter. He lands on his feet, but
	out on the balcony beyond the arch. Roger brings his rifle butt
	around against the creature's head and the Zombie falls back,
	but is not dead.

	Other creatures are only a few feet from Peter, whose gun sits
	on the little counter inside the store. Roger levels off his
	rifle but cannot fire as Peter is in the line. Peter makes a
	move and, like a football player, jukes to the left, then to the
	right. He dives right at one of the creatures carrying it into
	the store.	Now Roger fires, dropping one, then another. Peter jumps back up	on the counter.	Peter:	BEHIND YOU...BEHIND YOU...

	The creature in the store has crashed against a cosmetics
	display and is regaining its footing. Roger turns and fires. The	creature falls. Peter grabs the lip of the roll gate and starts
	to bring it down.

	There are several creatures right in the archway, now they
	clutch with their hands. One blocks the downward progress of the	gate. Roger fires point blank and the Zombie flies back. The
	gate lowers but is stopped by the clutching hands of other
	creatures. Roger grabs the cage now and helps to pull it down.
	Peter, still gripping the lip, jumps off the counter to get more
	leverage.	The bottom of the gate is now four feet from the floor. The two
	men are able to move it steadily downward. The Zombies are very
	weak, but more creatures appear making it more difficult. Then
	one Zombie tries to crawl under the gate. Its torso just gets
	through as the gate slams down against its chest. Its arms grab
	for Peter's legs and its mouth is gasping. Its body is
	preventing the gate from engaging in the floor mechanisms.	Roger lets go the cage as Peter tries to hold it against the
	creatures outside. Grabbing his rifle, Roger brings the butt
	straight down on the clutching Zombie's skull. The Zombie goes
	limp. Then Roger tries to push the creature clear of the gate,
	but the pressure is too great.
	Roger:	LET UP A LITTLE...LET UP A LITTLE...

	The gate rises a few inches. More Zombies appear outside. Their
	hands clutch at the roll gate. The openings in the grid are only
	big enough for their fingers, their hands can't reach through,
	but they are pushing the gate higher and higher...more than
	Peter intended to clear the obstructing corpse.	With his rifle butt, Roger manages to push the dead Zombie clear
	except for one of its arms. From outside, a creature's hand
	suddenly grabs Roger's weapon. For a moment its like a Tug-O-War.
	Peter is having a harder time holding the gate. It is inching
	upward.	Peter:	COME ON...COME ON...	Roger lets go his gun barrel and the weapon is snatched away by
	the creature in the crowd. Roger grabs for the gate.	Peter:	THE ARM...THAT ARM'S IN THE WAY.	Roger squats again and manages to throw the dead Zombie's arm	clear. Then he grabs the gate again. Now it starts to move down
	more steadily.	At the last moment, another clutching arm juts into the store,
	but when the gate hits it, it withdraws, and the big cage clicks
	solidly into place.

	The two Troopers step back from the gate. The creatures still
	moan and gurgle, slamming against the gate, their fingers
	clutching at the grid, but they are unable to budge it.
	There are ten or twelve Zombies trying to get into the
	Department Store and several others are making their way along
	the balcony. At least six lie dead along the floor.	Roger:	WELL...WE'RE IN...NOW, HOW THE HELL WE GONNA			GET BACK?	Peter:	LET'S GO SHOPPIN' FIRST.

	The two men back into the aisles of the store. The creatures
	outside still push and claw at the gate. The one with Roger's
	rifle uses it as a bludgeon, but it has no effect.

249	Stephen opens the door into the Administration corridor.

250	From his perspective, the hall is inactive. He observes the
	washrooms and the long row of doors to the various offices.

251	He starts into the corridor, letting the firestair door close.

252	At the top of the firestair, Fran can see the beam of light from
	the open door below. As the door closes, the beam narrows, then
	it blinks out with a click as the door closes.	Fran:	STEPHEN...JESUS GOD...

	She is very frightened.  She backs into the storage area.253	She moves quickly to the pyramid of cartons which lead to the	roof. She sits on the bottom carton biting her fingers.254	In the Department Store, Roger is riding down an escalator. He
	has found a back pack, and it is obviously already filled with
	goods. As he steps off the moving stairs on the ground floor,
	the surroundings are eerily quiet.255	He moves through a clothing department. We see the dead looking
	faces of store mannequins. Roger runs into one and is greatly
	startled. He snatches up a lined windbreaker and ties it around
	his waist by its arms, then he trots off down another aisle,
	where he finds Peter.

256	The big Trooper has a radio under his arm and he is snatching up
	a small television.

	Roger:	HEY MAN, WE CAN'T CARRY ALL THIS SHIT...

257	Peter turns a corner and dumps the articles into something
	which we cannot yet see. As Roger trots up, he sees that Peter
	has a big gardening cart already heaped with goods.
	Roger:	OH...WE'RE GONNA JUST WHEEL RIGHT BY 'EM, RIGHT?	Peter:	WE GONNA TRY, BROTHER. WE AIN'T DOIN' THIS
			FOR THE EXERCISE. WE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO
			GET WHAT WE CAN.

	Roger:	THERE'S NO WAY THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN...

	Even though he doesn't understand the plan, Roger helps Peter
	toss things into the barrow.

258	They race down the hardware aisle tossing in tools and other
	supplies. Electrical cables, flashlights, batteries. They scoop
	things up like contestants on a game-show who have five minutes
	in a store to grab whatever they can.259	Stephen is in the Maintenance office. He examines the maps and	electrical equipment, then rummages through a desk.260	At the open end of the corridor leading to the second storey
	balcony, Zombies wander past as they head for the Store entrance
	where many creature still claw at the roll gate.261	The Zombies move randomly. Some are leaving the gate as their	prey is now out of sight. They begin to wander here and there.

262	Three of the creatures turn into the administrative corridor and
	start toward the offices.

263	Stephen has found a large binder in the desk. It contains all
	the plans for the mall, duplicating the charts on the walls and
	many others. It is a complete maintenance manual revealing all
	the workings and layout of the huge structure.264	Elevator doors slide open with a loud whoosh. The two Troopers
	appear in the car, wheeling their barrow out onto the second
	storey aisles of the big store.265	Now, they can see the roll gate and the creatures pushing at it
	ineffectively. They roll their barrow very close to the gate.
	When the Zombies catch sight of the humans, their efforts are
	renewed. They moan and push harder at the gate.266	They Troopers leave the barrow, disappearing back to the aisles.	They run onto the interior escalator, bounding down faster than
	the moving steps, then they run across the first floor until
	they see the lower level-roll gate.267	There are creatures wandering the concourse, but none of them	are at the gate.	Peter:	LET'S GO BROTHER...THE OLD OKEY DOKE!

	The men move up to the roll gate. A Zombie lumbers past. Roger
	speaks to the creature.

	Roger:	HEY, UGLY!

	The creature turns instantly. Registers. Then dives for the
	gate with a moaning roar. Its mouth opens and its hands clutch.
	The gate pops forward from the creature's thrust, but it holds
	tightly. The action causes Roger to jump even though there is no
	immediate danger.	Peter:	LET'S RAISE SOME HELL...HEY...HEY...
			(he is shouting)

	Roger:	OVER HERE...LET'S GO OVER HERE...

268	Other creatures along the concourse turn toward the Department
	Store. They lumber along attracted by the sounds.

269	At the gate, several Zombies push at the metal grids. The
	Troopers back away, but stay in sight of the creatures.

	Peter:	JUST GIVE IT TIME ...GIVE IT TIME.

270	Upstairs, the Zombies at the upper gate are attracted by the
	commotion below. They begin to move away from the gate and
	lumber along the balcony to the stairways and escalators.

271	In the maintenance office, Stephen still rummages. He finds a
	loaded hand gun and stuffs it in his belt. He moves to the large
	cabinets containing the walkie talkies and the keys.272	In the corridor, the stray Zombies move in and out of the
	executive offices as they draw nearer to the Maintenance room.273	Several creatures fall over one another as they try to move down
	the up escalator. The down escalator push others onto the first
	floor. They scramble to their feet and move toward the
	Department Store.
274	In the concourse, many creatures are moving toward the gate.
	Already there are a dozen or so clutching and pushing at the
	metal grid. Through the crowd. Peter can see several other
	creatures lumbering down the stationary steps.

275	Peter:	OK...THEY 'RE COMIN'...

	The big man readies his walkie talkie, pulling the antenna out.	Peter:	GO ON UP...STAY OUTTA SIGHT BUT LEMME KNOW			WHEN ITS CLEAR ENOUGH.	Roger, clutching his walkie talkie, disappears among the aisles
	as he runs, crouching, into the store. Peter tries to hold the
	attention of the creatures at the gate.	Peter:	RIGHT HERE, BABIES...THIS IS WHERE IT'S AT...
			YOU DUMB ASS SUCKERS...YOU DUMB...YOU ARE DUMB!

276	Upstairs, the doors to the elevator glide open again and Roger
	moves through the second floor aisles stealthily.277	Stephen takes the maintenance manual and leaves the office. He
	walks down the interior corridor and opens the door to the
	exterior corridor. As the door opens, the Zombies attack. The
	Zombies clutch as Stephen tries to close the door on Zombie 13's
	arm. Stephen then runs back down the interior corridor.

278	Stephen starts up the firestair to the door. Just then he hears
	Fran call out. Realising he will lead the creatures to her, he
	closes the door and moves toward the Maintenance office and runs
	in.

279	Stephen runs into the office and slams the door.

280	A second creature is moving up behind the first, and another
	enters the corridor from the accounting office.

281	The metal door locks only with a key. Stephen fumbles for a
	moment with his rifle, then dives for the key cabinet. There are
	hundreds of keys on rings. He looks at the wall map. He can't
	focus in his panic.

282	In the hall, the first creature slams against the floor. It
	doesn't even have the intelligence to reach for the knob. It
	pounds on the door with its hands.

283	The pounding increases Stephen's panic. He stares at the map
	trying to focus on the maze of numbers.

284	The second creature reaches the door and claws at it. The third
	approaches slowly.

285	Stephen rattles among the keys. His fingers shake and he cannot
	decipher the numbers.

286	Outside, one of the creatures, in its random clutching, takes
	hold of the knob and pushes in and out, not yet turning it.

287	Stephen, clutching one of the rings, throws himself against the
	door, still trying to read the numbers. The knob finally turns.
	The door opens against Stephen's weight. He manages to slam it
	shut despite the pushing creatures. He throws the key ring down
	and grabs his gun.

288	Roger speaks into his walkie talkie:

	Roger:	I THINK WE CAN MOVE THE WAGON.

289	Peter, downstairs, talks into his unit:

	Peter:	CLEAR?

	Roger:	(over talking unit)
			NOT ALTOGETHER, BUT THEY'RE SPREAD OUT PRETTY
			GOOD...ENOUGH TO MOVE THE WAGON.

	The creatures slam against the first floor gate, but it holds
	securely. Peter stares at the beasts as he lowers his talk
	unit. He backs slowly away into the depths of the store.

290	Upstairs, Roger peers from behind a counter.

291	The second floor gate is clear.

292	On the balcony, several creatures wander aimlessly, but most of
	them have already moved down the steps and escalators.

293	Peter is still in sight of the Zombies at the first floor
	entrance. He clips his talk unit onto his belt, then ducks and
	disappears among the aisles.

294	He runs, crouching out of sight, until he rounds a far wall
	and comes up into the elevator.

295	He enters the car and pushes "2". The doors glide shut and the
	car begins to move up.

296	At the door of the Maintenance Office, the knob turns again. The
	door pushes open against Stephen weight. His feet slide on the
	linoleum floor. He cannot get the door closed this time. Biting
	his lip, he makes the sign of the cross, and backs suddenly into
	the room holding his rifle high. The door flies open with a
	slam, and three Zombies advance into the office. Stephen tries
	to aim carefully, and he fires.

297	Just as the elevator doors open. Peter hears the gunfire. He
	hesitates for a moment, then runs toward the entrance arch.

298	Roger is poised at one of the side locks on the gate. The
	gunfire stops him also as he is unlocking the mechanism.

299	Along the balcony, some of the creatures turn around in con-
	fusion. They walk this way and that, attracted  by the sound.

300	Peter thunders up behind Roger.

	Peter:	WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

	Roger:	FUZZ MAYBE?

	Peter:	OR MAYBE FLYBOY. WHERE'S IT COMIN' FROM?

	Roger:	CAN'T TELL.

	Peter:	COME ON. OPEN UP.

	Roger :	 MAYBE WE SHOULD SEE WHAT'S HAPPENIN'...

	Peter:	OPEN UP. I CAN GET THE WAGON OVER. IF IT
			IS FLYBOY, LET'S GET HIM ON OUR SIDE.

	Roger moves to the second lock. More gunfire.

	Peter:	(setting his weapon on the floor)
			YOU JUST COVER ME GOOD, YOU HEAR?

	Roger moves to the third lock as Peter stands and grabs on to
	the handles of the barrow.

301	The body of a dead Zombie hits the floor, its head shot
	through. Nearby lies the corpse of the first creature to break
	into the Maintenance Office.

	The third staggers into the room. Stephen stands fast now. He
	holds his rifle out in front of him. The creature walks toward
	the gun. Steve holds his hands on the trigger. The Zombie lunges
	suddenly, and grabs the gun barrel. Steve fires, but the blast
	tears through the creature's chest. Steve struggles to raise the
	barrel but the motion of the Zombie makes it impossible to aim
	accurately. The gun fires again, this time grazing the Zombie's
	neck. With a sudden burst of energy the creature wrenches the
	gun free. Steve backs against the wall. The creature tosses the
	rifle across the room where it slams the floor near a desk. The
	Zombie advances on Steve. Steve is next to the key cabinet and
	grabs at it, trying to find some weapon. He feels the tools in
	the cabinet and comes up with a hammer. The Zombie is about to
	reach him when Steve pulls the hammer out and upsets the
	cabinet. The Zombie fumbles with the cabinet at its feet, but
	doesn't fall. Steve tries to hit the creature's head with the
	tool, he misses and the Zombie grabs at his arm, trying to bite
	it. Steve wrenches free and the two bodies fall to the floor.
	The creature clutches at the man's legs, it's teeth bared like
	an animal. Steve kicks desperately and manages to land a blow
	squarely in the creatures face. The Zombie comes after him again
	and from his crawling position, Steve brings the hammer as an
	uppercut to the creature's jaw. The creature falls back enough
	for Steve to crawl across the floor. It follows, but Steve
	reaches the desk and grabs his rifle. Rolling on the floor, he
	fires several shots into the creature, finally destroying it.

302	The second floor gate rolls up with a rumble and Peter runs out
	of the Department Store with the barrow full of supplies.

303	The action attracts the attention of several of the creatures
	which are still wandering the balcony. They turn slowly.

304	Just as he rounds the corner. Peter almost collides with one
	creature, and can barely keep from upsetting the barrow. He
	manages to get past, and he runs as fast as he can toward the
	opening of the Administrative corridor.

305	Roger does not let the gate roll up too high. He stabilises the
	metal grid well within reach, then he stands his post with
	Peter's rifle. Several creatures approach from the opposite
	direction. Roger fires at the closest one. It falls. The others
	are still too far away to waste bullets.

306	Stephen steps over the corpses in the office and grabs the
	maintenance manual. He rushes into the corridor and runs out.

307	Three more creatures move toward him up the hallway.

308	At first Stephen freezes, then he starts backing toward the
	firestair, his rifle poised.

309	Just as Peter is reaching the mouth of the corridor, a Zombie	steps out of the hallway into his path. Peter slams the barrow
	squarely into the creature's legs. The Zombie falls in the
	barrow onto the supplies. The big man slams the load against a
	wall at the mouth of the corridor. Before the Zombie can get its
	balance, the big Trooper reaches down and grabs the creature's
	jacket lapels. With all his might he flings the creature out
	against the balcony railing. The creature flips over the rail,
	but does not fall. Its arms and legs flailing as Peter comes up
	quickly behind and flips it over the rail. The creature makes no
	sound as it plummets to the concourse below.310	Roger fires again at a Zombie drawing dangerously near. Other	creatures throughout the area are again converging on the
	Department Store entrance.311	Peter wheels the barrow into the corridor and sees Steve at the	other end, the three Zombies are still closing in.	Peter:	HOLD IT FLYBOY!312	Steve freezes. He can barely see Peter, his vision blocked by
	the Zombies. The creatures are about thirty feet away.313	Peter:	DON'T GO INTO THE STAIRWAY!314	Stephen is confused. The creatures advance.315	Peter:	DON'T OPEN THAT DOOR, BABY. YOU'LL LEAD 'EM
			RIGHT UP WITH YOU.

316	Steve is on the verge of panic.

	Peter:	RUN FOR IT.  RUN THIS WAY.
	The Zombies are drawing closer and closer.317	Peter:	COME ON, MAN. RUN THIS WAY. YOU CAN RUN RIGHT
			THROUGH 'EM. WE GOTTA LEAD 'EM AWAY FROM HERE!

318	Steve sizes up the corridor. It is narrow, but there is room to
	run past the Zombies.

319	Peter:	COME ON, FLYBOY. YOU CAN MAKE IT. COME ON!

320	With a sudden move, Steve breaks into a run. He passes the first	creature easily. The second grabs him as he runs past, but the
	man keeps his footing even though he slams against the wall. He
	keeps moving forward. The third creatures stands in his path.
	Steve lowers his head and slams into the Zombie's chest. The
	creature flies back and falls. Steve falls and tumbles toward
	the mouth of the passageway. He regains his footing as the
	creatures turn to pursue him, he runs to the end of the hall
	where Peter waits.	Peter:	NOW...HEAD FOR THE DEPARTMENT STORE...GO!321	The two men run across the balcony. They slam into two other	Zombies which clutch and grab at them without success.

322	At the entrance arch to the store, Roger fires at another
	creature. It falls. Other Zombies are approaching, but Steve and
	Peter dive into the arch and the three men manage to lower the
	gate without a problem.

	The Zombies converge on the area as they did before, clutching
	and pushing at the metal cage, which holds them out securely.

	The men breathe heavily as they back away from the gate.

	Peter:	DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN ...SAME TRICK.

323	The men move through the aisles of the store and go crashing
	down the escalator.

324	On the first floor they run toward the lower gate where they
	pull up wheezing with exhaustion.

	Steve:	WHAT DO WE DO...

	Roger:	LET 'EM KNOW WE'RE HERE...
			(shouting)
			WHOOOO HOOOOOO...OVER HERE...YEEE HAAAAAAAA.	Steve starts to laugh at the ludicrous situation. Peter smiles
	at the young pilot.

	Peter:	YOU DID ALRIGHT THIS TIME FLYBOY.
			HOW 'BOUT IT?

	Stephen laughs some more, nervously at first, then whole-
	Heartedly. Then he lets out a loud:

	Steve:	WHOOOOOOOOOOOPEEEEEEEEE...

	He has joined the cowboys. He is like a child, almost exultant
	with the joy of their victory...
	The three men shout through the cage at the creatures, which are	already gathering at the gate.

325	Out on the concourse, a few Zombies wander aimlessly, but most
	are heading for the commotion on the first floor arch.

326	On the upstairs balcony, Zombies again move toward the
	stationary steps and the escalators.

327	The three creatures in the Administration corridor move toward
	the open mall. Two walk out on the balcony, but the last one
	turns into an open office. Then it staggers back out and heads
	down the hall toward the firestair.

328	Fran can faintly hear the "whooping" of the men as she moves
	toward the stairway door, which is still open.329	She steps onto the landing and looks down into the darkness. The	shouting stops. Desperate with fear, she moves back to the
	storage room, then back onto the landing. Now her fear turns
	into anger.	Fran:	SHIT...	She takes a few steps down the stairs. Stops. Goes back up.
	Fran:	GOD DAMMIT!
	She starts back down again.

330	In the corridor below, the creature walks into another office.
	Then it moves back into the hall.

331	The Zombies crash against the first floor gate. It holds. The
	men crouch in the shadows of the gate.

	Roger:	WE JUST GOTTA WAIT LONGER BEFORE WE MOVE.

	Peter:	NO. THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE OF SOME OF THEM
			STAYIN' UP ON THE BALCONY.

	Roger:	YEAH, BUT WE CAN HANDLE THAT.  WE CAN BREAK THROUGH.

	Peter:	IF ANY OF THEM SEE OR HEAR US, THEY'LL JUST
			FOLLOW US ON UP.  IT'S NO GOOD.

	Roger:	WE CAN SURE AS HELL OUT RUN 'EM...LOAD UP WHAT
			WE CAN AND GET OUTTA HERE.

	Peter:	I'M THINKIN' MAYBE WE GOT A GOOD THING GOIN' HERE.
			MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO LEAVE.	Roger:	OH, MAN...	Peter:	IF WE COULD GET BACK UP THERE WITHOUT THEM			CATCHIN' ON, WE COULD HOLE UP FOR A WHILE.
			AT LEAST LONG ENOUGH TO CATCH A BREATH.
			CHECK OUT THE RADIO. SEE WHAT'S HAPPENIN'...	Roger:	MAN, I DON'T KNOW...	Steve:	THERE'S SOME KIND OF PASSAGEWAY OVER THE TOP
			OF THE STORES.

	The Troopers look at the young pilot, almost surprised to hear
	him speak.  He has been quiet up until now.

	Steve:	I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S JUST HEATING DUCTS OR
			IF IT'S SOME KIND OF ACCESS. I SAW IT ON A MAP.

	Peter:	UPSTAIRS.  LET'S GO.

	The three move off down the aisles, then duck out of sight
	around a corner. The Zombies clutch at the metal gate, moaning
	and rattling the grid loudly.332	In the Maintenance hallway, we see the thick manual lying on the	floor. A lumbering foot kicks it as the Zombie in the corridor
	wanders into another office. The creature ignores the book, as
	it does the corpses strewn in the hall.333	In the fire stair, Fran is on the middle landing. She is
	suddenly overcome with a wave of nausea. She clutches at her	stomach, retching. She sits on the landing, letting her head
	flop against the wall. She is almost in tears.334	The upstairs doors of the Department Store elevator open and the	men trot out. As they clear a wall, they see the entrance arch.335	There are no Zombies at the gate, but two are seen drifting
	along the balcony outside.

336	Peter:	WATCH IT...DON'T LET 'EM SEE YOU.

	The men move stealthily along the aisles. They look up at the
	ceiling and see a series of large grillwork panels. Peter shines
	his flashlight beam into one.
337	The ceiling is about twelve feet high, but the light beam	penetrates the grille to reveal a fairly large space above.338	Roger:	LOOKS BIG ENOUGH TO CRAWL THROUGH.	Peter:	THEY'RE LOCKED.

	Roger:	DAMN. THAT'S THOSE OTHER LOCK NUMBERS WE
			SAW ON THE CHART.

	Steve:	WHY THE HELL WOULD THEY BE LOCKED?

	Peter:	JACKPOT, FLYBOY. YOU'RE RIGHT.
	Roger:	WHAT?	Peter:	THEY'RE LOCKED BECAUSE YOU CAN GET THROUGH			'EM EASY FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE BUILDING.	Steve:	OVER HERE.339	Steve notices that one of the ceiling grids is very close to the
	elevators. Peter looks at the grids, then down at the double
	doors.	Peter:	THE ELEVATOR SHAFT!
	He moves over and hits the button. The doors open.
	Peter:	HOLD 'EM.	Roger stands against the rubber safety bumper, holding the car
	doors open wide. Peter steps onto the hand railing and reaches
	up for the escape hatch, which is held in place by four knub-
	headed bolts. He removes the bolts quickly and dislodges the
	hatch cover and passes it down to Stephen.	Then the big man sticks his head up through the opening.340	He looks around the elevator shaft, shining his flash this way	and that. He sees another grid in the shaft wall.

	Peter:	IT'S HERE...AND IT AIN'T LOCKED. GET A SCREW-
			DRIVER AND SOMETHIN' TO STAND ON FOR IN HERE.

341	Roger:	I KNOW WHERE THE TOOLS ARE. GET ONE OF THOSE
			TABLES.

	Roger ducks off down an aisle and Steve moves to the nearby
	furniture department and grabs a lightweight lamp table. The
	elevator doors close. When Steve returns with the table he has
	to hit the button again. The doors open. Peter is already
	climbing out of the car into the shaft. Steve uses the table to
	hold the doors open and goes to get another.
	This time he gets a larger coffee table and sets it under the
	opening in the car and puts the smaller table on top. He climbs
	up and sticks his head out into the shaft. The doors close
	again.342	In the greasy black shaft, amid the cables and elevator	mechanisms. Peter examines the wall grid with his flashlight.	Peter:	IT'S ALRIGHT...WE CAN GET IT OFF.
			YOU FOUND IT FLYBOY.

	Even though he speaks softly, Peter's voice has an eerie,
	echoing sound in the narrow shaft.

343	The car doors open. Steve ducks down to see Roger bearing a
	screwdriver and pliers along with some other tools in a shopping
	bag.	Roger:	ONE-STOP SHOPPING ...ANYTHING YOU NEED RIGHT			AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.344	Steve relays the tools up to Peter, who immediately begins to
	work on the screws which mount the grid. He passes the
	flashlight to Steve who holds the beam on the work area.345	Fran sits in the stairwell, her hand over her mouth. It is very
	quiet for a moment, then she hears a slight clicking. Her head
	snaps to attention. She stares down at the bottom landing. There
	is a thump at the door.	Slowly the woman stands to her feet, her eyes transfixed on the
	door below.	Fran:	STEPHEN!

	The door starts to open. Light creeps in. The slow, lumbering
	figure of the Zombie moves into the firestair. Choking back a
	scream, Fran turns and runs up the stairs. The creature below
	follows, unsure of itself in the dim light.

346	At the top, Fran makes it into the storage area and slams the
	door. For a moment, she just backs away in terror. Then she
	gathers her wits and moves to drag the food cartons over as a
	barricade. She struggles with one of the cartons. It is very
	heavy and so large she cannot get a good grip. The smooth
	cardboard slips in her hands.347	The Zombie has almost reached the middle landing.
348	Roger looks down through a ceiling grid. He sees the interior of
	a Sporting Goods Store. Along one wall is an arsenal of the
	latest weaponry for the sportsman.349	Roger:	SWEET JESUS!
	Peter:	I SEEN IT. COME ON!	The men are in a large ductwork which seems to run along the
	entire length of the mall. They move as quietly as they can.
	There are several side tunnels branching off in both directions.

350	Steve passes another ceiling grid and looks down. He sees a
	full equipped radio and electronics shop.

	Roger:	I HOPE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOIN', BUDDY.

	Peter:	(who is leading)
			THIS IS IT. COME ON.

351	Fran struggles with the carton. She gets it against the door
	finally and moves to haul another.

352	The Zombie has reached the top landing and makes for the door.

353	Before the woman can bring another carton over, she sees the
	door move. She throws herself against it, but can't plant her
	feet well because of the carton of the floor. The door moves an
	inch at a time. The creature's hand reaches into the room. It
	clutches at the edge of the door.

354	Fran panics and runs back towards the escape pyramid, where she
	turns and faces the door.

355	The creature is straining against the weight of the carton. Now,
	now both its hands clutch the door edge. The carton moves
	another inch...and another. Now, the creature's head can be seen
	as it strains to get through the widening space.

356	Fran's eyes are wide, almost hypnotised. She looks for something
	to use as a weapon. The room is bare but for the cartons and
	water drums. She is about to opt for the skylight, when she
	glimpses Roger's knap-sack in the shadows. She runs for it as
	the creature finally breaks into the big room.

357	The woman's hands tremble as she rummages through the cloth
	sack. Nothing appropriate. She dumps the contents out:
	ammunition, mace cans, batteries, flares...flares! She
	nervously grabs one of the cylinders and her shaking hands try
	to deal with the paper wrapping.

358	The Zombie moans as it draws closer. It is approaching the
	pyramid of cartons.

359	Fran manages to free the wrapping, and snaps the cylinder in two
	at the mark.

360	Now the Zombie is between her and the pyramid, cutting off her
	immediate route. It is very near. Fran backs away a few steps as
	she tries to strike the flare head on the small striker on the
	cylinder cap. It doesn't fire...she tries again...and again.
	Now, the Zombie has reached the knap-sack. It kicks through the
	items and knocks and rolls the other flares.

	Fran's flare finally catches with a great whoosh, the bright
	flame startling the woman as well as the Zombie. The creature's
	eyes go wide and it brings its arms up to avoid the brightness.
	The intense white flame casts an eerie light over the creature
	and throws the Zombie's enormous shadow against the cartons and
	wall. The creature backs away a few steps almost tripping over
	the articles on the floor.

	Fran manages to advance close enough to snatch two extra
	cylinders and skirt around the Zombie in a wide arc. The
	creature swats the air, keeping distance, but threatening.

	Fran considers the firestair door, but decides on the pyramid.
	She circles around to a point where she can climb up from
	behind the moaning Zombie. She rushes for the cartons and
	climbs, but loses her footing while trying to hold the flares
	and crashes into the topmost carton. It starts to slide off
	the pyramid and tumbles to the floor almost crashing into the
	Zombie. The creature starts to clutch at the pyramid.

	The stack of cartons is now too short and Fran can reach the
	skylight but can't pull herself up. She accidentally drops
	two flares, including the lit one. It tumbles to the floor
	behind the pyramid where it no longer offends the Zombie's
	eye's. Now the creature tries to climb to the woman.

	Fran grabs the last flare in her mouth and reaches with both
	hands for the skylight. She lifts with all her might and her
	feet come off the cartons but she cannot pull herself up. As she
	tries to lower her feet back to the cartons, the pyramid shakes
	and wobbles from the Zombie. The creature is making progress;
	its hands can almost touch Fran's foot.

361	Peter drops out of a ceiling grid into a plush office. Roger's
	legs appear through the grid and he too swings down, holding on
	with his hands to soften his landing.

	Suddenly, we are aware of a third person on the room in the
	large chair at the desk. Roger startles and grabs his gun.
	Peter just stares. They are in the President's office. Some
	days earlier, the President, shot himself in the head.

	Peter:	COME ON...

	Steve struggles overhead.

	Peter:	JUST DROP, I GOT YOU...		 

	Steve:	I CAN'T...I...

	Peter:	(to Roger)
			THE DESK...GIMME A HAND.

	The two Troopers grab the desk and slide it away from the
	President's corpse. The action causes the chair to spin slightly
	and his wide terrified eyes seem to watch the action.

	The desk in place. Steve's toes can reach its surface. He loses
	his balance slightly and pulls back up. He kicks a picture frame
	off the desk onto the floor, shattering the glass over photos of
	the President's wife and children.

	Peter:	COME ON!

	Steve finally gets footing on the desktop and lowers himself
	down. He stares at the corpse as Roger helps him off the desk.

362	Peter is already unlocking the door to the corridor. He opens it
	a crack and peeks out.

363	The corridor is empty. He sees the door at the end which leads
	to the exterior corridor.

364	As the other men come up behind, Peter opens the door quietly
	and slips into the hall. He starts to walk quickly toward the
	door to the exterior corridor. Roger follows as Stephen moves
	backwards toward the fire stairs.

365	Peter's hands grab the barrow and pulls the cart down the
	corridor backwards so as to face the mall opening.

366	In the corridor, Steve clutches the maintenance manual. Peter
	backs slowly up the hall. The wheels squeak and the big man
	bites his lip. Roger kicks the last corpse to the wall. Steve
	notices that the fire stairs door is open wide.

	Steve:	JESUS CHRIST!

	He bounds towards the door. Roger spins to see what happened.
	Peter turns and quickens his pace. Steve trots up the steps.

	Roger:	(to Peter)
			COME ON...YOU GOT IT.

	Peter runs with the cart the last few yards. As he gets to the
	doorway, Roger breaks up the steps.

368	Steve breaks into the storage area...he drops the manual...

	Steve:	FRANNIE!

369	The woman turns in Steve's direction. The Zombie swats the
	flare out of Fran's hand. She startles and the cartons feel as
	though they will topple. She steadies herself with both hands.
	The creature is grabbing at her legs. She kicks.

370	Steve raises his rifle and moves in for a close shot.

	Roger:	DON'T SHOOT...THEY'LL HEAR YA...

	Roger arrives and the two men charge the pyramid.

371	The creature is still clutching at Fran. She kicks violently as
	Roger pulls the back of the Zombie's clothing. The Zombie falls
	and hits the floor. As it kneels up, Steve swings the butt of
	his rifle and smashes it into the thing's head. Then Roger
	delivers a blow with his gun, straight down.

372	Steve rushes to Fran. She falls off the cartons into his arms
	sobbing and choking.

	Steve:	FRANNIE...ARE YOU ALRIGHT?
			YOU OK, FRANNIE? HEY...

	The woman is incoherent. She is clutching at her stomach.

373	Peter appears in the doorway carrying the TV and several other
	items. He dumps them on the floor.

	Peter:	LET'S GET THIS STUFF UP, COME ON.

374	Roger is dragging the dead Zombie to the door. Peter comes to
	help and Fran starts to wretch. Steve tries to calm her. He gets
	some water in a can and brings it over.

	Steve:	FRANNIE...IT'S OK...COME ON, IT'S OK...ARE YOU
			HURT, HUN? DID YA HURT YOURSELF? FRANNIE...

375	Downstairs, at the exterior corridor, Peter peeks out. He can
	see the mall at the far end. The coast is clear. He and Roger
	hurriedly carry the corpse into the hall and roll it onto the
	floor and retreat back into the fire stairs. Peter holds open
	the door slightly and watches the corridor for a moment.
	Convinced they've not been seen, he closes the door.

376	Peter:	I THINK WE'RE OK, BROTHER.

	They grab more supplies from the barrow and start upstairs.

377	Steve still tries to comfort Fran.

	Steve:	WE'RE OK...WE'RE ALL OK...WE GOT A LOT
			OF STUFF...ALL KINDS OF STUFF...

	In the background the two Troopers bring their load of supplies
	into the big room and deposit them near the TV. Then they go
	downstairs for another load.

	Steve:	THIS IS A TERRIFIC PLACE...FRANNIE. THIS PLACE
			IS PERFECT. WE GOT IT MADE IN HERE...FRANNIE.

	The woman still cannot stop sobbing and retching.

378	Now, the enormous barricade of food cartons is stacked against
	the door again. It is quiet except for the little noises of
	eating and occasional rustle of paper. We also head a faint
	electronic whistle, but we do not recognise it.

	As we see more of the room, we find our refugees sitting near
	the reconstructed pyramid on the floor. Peter seems to be asleep
	up against the pyramid. Roger is nibbling at delicacies from the
	Department Store's Gourmet department.

	Their "loot" is laid around them on the floor. Roger, as he
	eats, is leafing through the maintenance manual. There is a
	stack of tools, some still in wrapping; electric razors, still
	boxed; some clothing articles; the radio, which also plays small
	cassettes. There are soaps, toiletries, pens, pencils, and
	notebooks, flashlights, cigarettes and several decks of cards
	with a canister of chips. The items are clearly not all
	functional. Some are representative of the luxuries considered
	necessary by a consumer society.

	They are all bathed in the blue glow from the television which
	Stephen tries to tune in. Its power cable is spliced into the
	leads of a bare light fixture overhead. Fran cannot be seen at
	first.

	Roger:	WHAT THE HELL TIME IS IT, ANYWAY?

	Steve:	ONLY ABOUT NINE.

	Roger:	AND NOTHING? (referring to the TV)

	On the screen we see the Civil Defence logo, and realise that
	the high pitched electronic signal is coming from the TV set.

	Steve:	AS LONG AS WE'RE GETTING THE PATTERN,
			THAT MEANS THEY'RE SENDING.

	Roger snaps on the large, battery powered radio. He rolls the
	dial getting nothing but static. Finally, he hears a signal
	and tunes it in. A badly modulated voice is droning through
	the interference. It sounds like a war correspondent sending
	a signal from very far away.

	Radio:	...REPORTS THAT COMMUNICATIONS WITH DETROIT
			HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT ALONG WITH ATLANTA,
			BOSTON AND CERTAIN SECTIONS OF PHILADELPHIA
			AND NEW YORK CITY...

	Roger:	PHILLY...

	Steve:	I KNOW J.A.S IS OUT BY NOW...IT WAS A MADHOUSE
			BACK THERE...PEOPLE ARE CRAZY...IF THEY'D JUST
			ORGANISE...IT'S TOTAL CONFUSION...I DON'T
			BELIEVE IT'S GOTTEN THIS BAD. I DON'T BELIEVE
			THEY CAN'T HANDLE IT. LOOK AT US. LOOT AT
			WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO TODAY.

379	Peter's eyes suddenly blink open. None of the rest of his body
	moves, the others do not realise he is awake. The big man stares
	at Stephen, who is getting emotionally excited about their
	exploits as a team.

	Steve:	WE KNOCKED THE SHIT OUT OF 'EM AND THEY
			NEVER TOUCHED US...NOT REALLY.

	Peter:	THEY TOUCHED US GOOD, FLYBOY. WE'RE LUCKY
			TO GET OUT WITH OUR ASSES. YOU DON'T FORGET THAT!

380	The other men look at Peter. The radio drones on with more
	disaster reports.

	Peter:	 YOU GET OVERCONFIDENT...UNDERESTIMATE THOSE
		    SUCKERS...AND YOU GET EATEN! HOW YOU LIKE THAT?

	Peter speaks in a low, unemotional tone. Stephen is transfixed.

	Peter:	 THEY GOT A BIG ADVANTAGE OVER US BROTHER.
		    THEY DON'T THINK. THEY JUST BLIND-ASS DO WHAT
		    THEY GOT TO DO. NO EMOTIONS. AND THAT BUNCH
		    OUT THERE? THAT'S JUST A HANDFUL AND EVERY
		    DAY THERE'LL BE MORE.
		    A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE DIE EACH DAY
		    FROM NATURAL CAUSES. THAT PROB'LY TRIPLES OR
		    BETTER WITH FOLK KNOCKIN' EACH OTHER OFF THE
		    WAY IT'S GOIN'.
		    NOW SAY EACH ONE OF THEM COMES BACK AND KILLS
		    TWO, AND EACH ONE OF THEM TWO MORE...
		    YOU KNOW ABOUT THE EMPEROR'S REWARD?	 

381	We see Fran's face. She is listening. There is no answer
	audible. A tear rolls down the woman's cheek. The radio drones.

	After a time, Steve appears. He is surprised to find the woman
	awake. She sits on a new blanket from the store. Another is
	rolled up as a pillow. She wipes away her tears with her
	cigarette still in her hand.

	Steve:	HEY...YOU OK?

	The man kneels next to her, not knowing what to say. Stephen
	sits down next to her and puts his hands on her shoulders.

	Fran:	SO I GUESS WE FORGET ABOUT CANADA, RIGHT?

	Steve:	(taking her in his arms)
			JESUS, FRANNIE, THIS SET UP IS SENSATIONAL.
			WE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED. WE SEAL OFF THAT
			STAIRWAY...NOBODY'LL EVER KNOW WE'RE UP HERE.
			WE'D NEVER FIND ANYTHING LIKE THIS...

	Fran:	I GUESS NOBODY CARES ABOUT MY VOTE, HUH?

	Steve:	COME ON, FRANNIE, YOU WERE SLEEPING.

	Fran:	WHAT HAPPENED TO GROWING VEGETABLES AND FISHING?
			WHAT HAPPENED TO THE IDEA ABOUT THE WILDERNESS...
			HUNDREDS OF MILES FROM ANYTHING AND ANYBODY...
			STEVE, I'M AFRAID. YOU'RE HYPNOTISED BY THIS
			PLACE. ALL OF YOU. IT'S ALL SO BRIGHT AND NEATLY
			WRAPPED THAT YOU DON'T SEE...YOU DON'T SEE THAT IT
			CAN BE A PRISON.

	She leans in to him, making a final plea.

	Fran:	STEPHEN, LET'S JUST TAKE WHAT WE NEED AND KEEP
			GOING.

	Steve:	WE CAN'T HARDLY CARRY ANYTHING IN THAT LITTLE BIRD.

	Fran:	(angry)
			WHAY DO YOU WANT? A NEW SET OF FURNITURE? A
			FREEZER? A CONSOLE TV AND A STEREO? WE CAN TAKE
			WHAT WE NEED. WHAT WE NEED TO SURVIVE.

382	Cut to a close up of Peter's face. His eyes pop open.

	Peter:	SHUT THAT THING OFF!

	Roger clicks off the radio. They listen. They hear slight sounds
	coming from the fire stairs. The end of the room with the
	barricade of cartons looks surreal in the blue glow of the TV
	screen which still shines.

	Roger crawls over and clicks the TV off as well. The electronic
	whistle slowly dies. Silence.

	Steve steps out from behind the wall of cartons. Fran peers
	around the corner to look, but she still sits on the floor.
	Another noise. The faint squeaking of the door to the bottom of
	the steps. Then footsteps on the metal stairs. Slow...
	lumbering.

	The faces of the humans all tighten. Peter and Roger pull their
	rifles. Roger makes his ready.

	Some thumping in the hall. Steve squats down and holds Fran.
	The sounds are closer now. The door behind the cartons clicks
	but does not move. More pounding...then silence.

	After a time, the footsteps recede down the stairs.

	Peter:	SOMEBODY BETTER SIT WATCH ALL THE TIME.

	Roger:	THEY'LL NEVER GET THROUGH THERE.

	Peter:	ENOUGH OF 'EM WILL. AND IT AIN'T JUST THEM THINGS
			WE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT. THAT CHOPPER UP THERE COULD
			GIVE US AWAY IF SOMEBODY COMES MESS' AROUND.

	Roger:	WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO? LAND ANOTHER PILOT TO FLY
			IT OUT. THEY'RE NOT GONNA MESS WITH A LITTLE BIRD
			LIKE THAT. THEY GOT ENOUGH ON THEIR HANDS. YOU
			KNOW BACK IN PHILLY WE FOUND A BOAT IN THE MIDDLE
			OF INDEPENDENCE SQUARE. SOMEBODY TRYIN' TO CARRY
			IT TO THE RIVER, I GUESS. DIDN'T MAKE IT. DAMN
			THING SAT THERE FOR EIGHT DAYS.

	Peter:	SOMEBODY FINALLY GOT IT, THOUGH. IT COMES DOWN TO
			HOW MUCH ITS WORTH.

383	Fran ducks back onto her blanket. She disgustedly lights another
	cigarette. Steve sits next to her again.

	Steve:	FRANNIE...

	She doesn't respond.

	Steve:	DAMMIT, FRAN, YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES WE'D
			HAVE TO LAND FOR FUEL TRYIN' TO MAKE IT UP NORTH?
			THOSE THINGS ARE OUT THERE EVERYWHERE. AND THE
			AUTHORITIES WOULD GIVE US JUST AS HARD A TIME...
			MAYBE WORSE... WE'RE IN GOOD SHAPE HERE, FRANNIE.
			WE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED RIGHT HERE!

	Stephen curls up with his head on the rolled blanket.

	Steve:	COME ON...GET SOME SLEEP.

	The woman doesn't move.

	Steve:	FRANNIE. COME ON.

	She grinds her cigarette out on the concrete floor and stretches
	out next to the man. He puts his arm around her. His hands rub
	up and down her body as he curls next to her. He opens her
	blouse and reaches inside. He closes his eyes and he seems
	perfectly comfortable to rest in her softness. His hand moves
	under her clothing. She doesn't respond, at first, then her body
	relaxes somewhat and she brings one of her arms up around his
	head.

	Steve:	I'M NOT JUST BEING STUBBORN. I REALLY THINK THIS
			IS BETTER. HELL. YOU'RE THE ONE'S BEEN WANTIN' TO
			SET UP HOUSE.

	She stares off across the barren room. His hands continues to
	move under her blouse.

384	In the Administration Corridor, a few stray Zombies wander among
	the corpses on the floor. One large and severely wounded
	creature pounds on the door to the interior corridor. It had
	been the one which was pounding at the door upstairs.

	A female Zombie squats near one of the corpses in the hall. She
	lifts its arm and moves it to her mouth, but she drops it
	quickly, repelled by its coldness. She leans over and picks at
	another corpse, then she stands and drifts towards the mall.

	Slowly the creatures leaves the corridor and move out onto the
	second floor balcony. We begin to hear a voice fading in over
	the scene.

	Voice:	...NOT ACTUALLY CANNIBALISM...CANNIBALISM IN THE
			TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD, IMPLIES AN INTRASPECIE
			ACTIVITY... THESE CREATURES CANNOT BE CONSIDERED
			HUMAN..THEY PREY ON HUMANS...THEY DO NOT PREY ON
			EACH OTHER.

385	We see the mall balcony now. Zombies wander past the stores.
	Some move down the stationary stairs onto the main concourse.
	Below.

	Voice:	THEY ATTACK AND...AND FEED...ONLY ON WARM HUMAN
			FLESH...

386	At the mall entrances, some creatures drift out into the night.
	Others still enter the enormous building. There are not as many
	as there were in the afternoon, but there are certainly enough
	to be threatening.

	Voice:	INTELLIGENCE? SEEMINGLY LITTLE OR NO REASONING
			POWER. WHAT BASIC SKILLS REMAIN ARE MORE
			REMEMBERED BEHAVIOURS FROM...FROM NORMAL LIFE.

387	Several creatures are clawing at the roll gate to the department
	store. It is a strange and eerie sight. The staring, painted
	eyes of the mannequins within the store seem to watch the
	Zombies. The gate rattles but does not budge.

	Voice:	THERE ARE REPORTS OF THE CREATURES USING TOOLS,
			BUT EVEN THESE ACTIONS ARE THE MOST PRIMITIVE...
			THE USE OF EXTERNAL ARTICLES AS BLUDGEONS ETC.,
			EVEN ANIMALS WILL ADOPT THE BASIC USE OF TOOLS IN
			THIS MANNER.

388	Fran's eyes pop open the voice has awakened her. She has been
	asleep on the blanket.

	Voice:	THESE CREATURES ARE NOTHING BUT PURE, MOTORISED
			INSTINCT...

	The woman looks around. Morning sunlight is spilling in through
	the skylights above. She sits up and peers into the next area of
	the room. The men are gone. The television is playing. On the
	tube we see a dishevelled man sitting in an emergency news room
	reading the report.

389	Voice:	THEIR ONLY DRIVE IS FOR THE FOOD WHICH SUSTAINS
			THEM. WE MUST NOT BE LULLED BY THE CONCEPT
			THAT THESE ARE OUR FAMILY MEMBERS OR OUR FRIENDS.
			THEY WILL NOT RESPOND TO SUCH EMOTIONS. THEY
			MUST BE DESTROYED ON SIGHT....

390	Fran sees that the barricade of cartons is still in place at
	the fire stairs door. She looks up. The skylight above the
	pyramid is open. She realises that the men are on the roof.

391	At the edge of the roof, Peter looks through binoculars.

392	About a quarter of a mile away, he sees the large warehouse of
	a food processing chain. IN the yard and in the large open
	garages of the building, he sees a fleet on enormous trailer-
	trucks parked.

393	Steve:	YOU SURE WE CAN START 'EM.

	Roger:	YOU HAVEN'T SPENT ENOUGH TIME ON THE STREET.

	Peter:	WELL LET'S GET IT UP. THERE'S NOT TOO MANY
			OF 'EM AROUND YET THIS MORNIN'.

	The big trooper looks down to the parking lot below.

394	There are not as many Zombies as there were the day before, and
	they wander aimlessly, spread out rather than in clusters.

395	The men move for the skylight.

396	In the storage area below, Fran is examining the maps in the
	manual. The TV still drones in a low volume. The men climb
	down into the room.

	Roger:	HEY, FRAN...

	Fran:	I WOULD HAVE MADE COFFEE AND BREAKFAST, BUT I
			DON'T HAVE MY POTS AND PANS.

	There is a bitterness in her voice. Roger laughs. Steve senses
	the tension. Peter just straps on his equipment.

	Fran:	CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

	Steve:	SURE. WHAT DP YOU MEAN?

	Fran:	I'M SORRY YOU FOUND OUT I'M PREGNANT, BECAUSE I
			DON'T WANT ANY OF YOU TO TREAT ME DIFFERENTLY
			THAN YOU'D TREAT ANOTHER GUY.

	Steve:	HEY, FRANNIE, COME ON...

	Fran:	AND,...I'M NOT GONNA BE DEN MOTHER FOR YOU GUYS.

	They all look at her, attentive now.

	Fran:	AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. AND I
			WANT SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE PLANS. THERE'S
			FOUR OF US, OK?

	Steve:	JESUS, FRAN...

	Peter:	FAIR ENOUGH!

	Fran:	NOW. WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

	Peter:	WE'RE GOIN' OUT.

	Fran starts to say something, but this time Peter cuts her off.

	Peter:	...AND YOU ARE NOT COMING WITH US!

	Again the woman starts to protest, but Peter continues.

	Peter:	AND YOU WILL NOT COME WITH US UNTIL YOU CAN
			HANDLE YOURSELF. THAT MEANS LEARN TO SHOOT AND
			LEARN TO FIGHT.

	The big man starts back up the pyramid. Roger moves to
	follow him.

	Fran:	SOMETHING ELSE.

	The men look at her. She faces Roger and Peter directly without
	looking at Stephen.

	Fran:	I DON'T KNOW ANOUT YOU TWO, BUT I WANNA LEARN
			HOW TO FLY THAT HELICOPTER.

	Stephen is shocked. Fran looks at him and lowers her eyes.

	Fran:	IF ANYTHING HAPPENS...WE'VE GOTTA BE ABLE TO GET
			OUT OF HERE.

	Stephen doesn't know what to say. He looks at the woman,
	then up at the other men.

	Peter:	SHE'S RIGHT, FLYBOY. COME ON, LET'S GO.

	Fran:	AND YOU'RE NOT LEAVING ME WITHOUT A GUN AGAIN.

	Stephen thinks about protesting but he complies by slowly
	setting his rifle down on the cartons. Then he fishes in his
	pocket for a fistful of shells and dumps them next to the gun.
	He stares at the woman angry and hurt.

	Fran picks up the weapon and shoots a glance up at Peter. 
			
	Fran:	I JUST MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE
			IT.

	Peter and Roger disappear through the skylight. Stephen stands
	still. He looks down at the floor. Fran moves close to his side.

	Fran:	I'M SORRY, STEPHEN. (it is not an apology)

	Steve:	I KNOW...I KNOW...IT'S ALRIGHT!

	He starts up to the skylight.

	Fran:	STEPHEN

	Steve:	YEAH.

	He stops and turns to look at her. Her eyes are pleading for
	understanding, but he is incapable of it at the moment. Fran
	just shrugs off whatever she was going to say, and she sighs
	with exasperation.

	Fran:	BE CAREFUL.

	Steve:	YEAH, WE'LL BE ALRIGHT.

	He disappears through the skylight. Fran stares down at the
	weapon in her hands, then she steps over and clicks off the
	television.

397	The sudden, loud noise of the chopper engine as it hovers.
	Only Stephen is on board at the controls.

398	In the cab of one of the big trailer trucks Roger is crouching
	working on the wiring beneath the dashboard.

399	Peter sits on the cab of another truck. He tries the
	complicated shift mechanism and fidgets with the other controls.
	Then he pulls out. He stops the big vehicle with his cab just
	abreast of the cab Roger is working in.

	Peter:	HOW ABOUT IT?

	Roger:	GETTIN' IT.

400	Peter looks around. The mall can be seen in the distance. On the
	ground between, there are a few Zombies scattered about in
	little clusters. None of them present any immanent danger.

401	Roger sits up and is able to start his truck.

	Peter:	I'LL JUST RIDE PICK UP, I'M NOT TOO SURE OF
			THIS THING...

	Roger:	I GREW UP ON ONE OF THESE, LET'S GO.

402	The great trucks lumber away from the warehouse. They pull
	across the little loading lot and out a ramp toward the
	roadway. Stephen hovers overhead in the chopper, following
	the trucks as closely as he can.

403	On the roof of the mall, Fran clutches her rifle. She sees the
	big trucks roar up over the hill, the helicopter just above
	them. It is a strange looking convoy as it speeds toward the
	trucks as closely as it can.

404	Along the road, several Zombies try to stagger after the trucks
	but they are left in the dust of the speeding vehicles. The
	creatures lumber along slowly behind.

405	The vehicles pull into the little grade which loads into the
	mall's parking lot. They roar right toward the building.

406	At one of the building entrances, a cluster of Zombies is
	moving in and lot of the main doors. Others wander nearby in the
	parking lot. Attracted by the sounds of the engines, the
	creatures turn and face the trucks.

	As Peter pulls his vehicle in a wide arc, Roger drives his right
	up to the side of the building and roars toward the entrance
	doors. Then he skips his right wheels up onto the curb, and with
	a great, scraping crunch, the big truck pulls directly abreast
	of the building, flush with the entrance. The huge vehicle
	crushes several of the helpless creatures and knocks other
	flying back.

407	The trailer of the truck has totally blocked off the mall
	entrance. Several Zombies trapped inside try to push the glass
	doors open. The doors move, but cannot be opened wide enough
	for the creatures to get out.

408	The few creatures immediately around the truck begin clambering
	at its sides. Roger shuts off the engine and grabs his gun as
	other Zombies begin clutching at the windows of the cab.

409	Overhead, the whirlybird hovers very close by. Now Peter's big
	truck pulls up alongside so that Peter's passenger door is
	directly abreast of the free door on Roger's cab.

	Peter's truck also crushes one or two of the creatures, but
	there are still several in the immediate vicinity of the cab.

410	As Roger opens his door and scrambles into the other truck, one
	of the Zombies grabs hold. Roger just manages to kick the
	creature off as the big truck pulls out and roars across the
	lot.

411	The helicopter flies straight up and directly over the roof of
	the big shopping centre, where Fran has been watching the
	action. She now runs to the other side of the roof, the wind
	from the chopper whipping her hair.

412	The chopper turns and waits for the big truck to move up under
	it, then the whirlybird escorts the trailer back to the warehouse
	down the road.

413	Roger is whooping and hollering like a cowboy as the big rig
	pulls up beside another of the parked vans.

	Peter:	COME ON, COME ON... THREE MORE BABY.

	Roger:	LIKE A CHARM, HUH? LIKE A FUCKING CHARM!

	Roger grabs his knapsack and climbs into the new cab where he
	immediately goes to work on jumping the engine cables.

414	From the helicopter overhead, Stephen spots something moving
	around the warehouse. He jockeys the chopper slightly for a
	better look and he sees a small group of Zombies wandering out
	of the big garage directly toward Roger's truck.

415	In the meantime, Peter's truck pulls away from the cab Roger is
	in. The big vehicle rolls into the large paved area behind the
	warehouse where Peter can turn it around easily.

416	Stephen swoops down with the big bird. He buzzes as close as he
	can to Roger's truck, trying to signal the man.

417	Roger continues to work on the cables, still whooping like a
	child. The Zombies are very close at hand. They have just
	about reached the cab. Stephen buzzes again. Roger doesn't
	notice.

418	Peter has now backed up into a position which enables him to
	pull out. He looks up to see the helicopter heading straight
	for him.

419	The big chopper buzzes right over Peter's cab then spins around
	heading back for Roger.

420	Peter looks toward the other truck. He can now see the lumbering
	creatures. He tries to slam the truck into gear, but the
	complicated shift mechanism fights him.

421	One Zombie slams its hands against the driver-side window of
	Roger's truck. The man startles and tries to untangle himself
	from his cramped position under the big steering wheel. He is
	stuck for a moment. The other creatures appear at the passenger
	side of the cab, where the door is open. One grabs at Roger's
	legs. Roger kicks violently, but can't get a good position. He
	falls lower onto the floor of the cab, his body almost knotted
	among the controls and the shift sticks.

422	Peter's truck starts to roll, but it accelerates slowly.

423	The helicopter tries to buzz the clutching ghouls, but they do
	not even flinch. The wind from the propeller blades whip at the
	creatures' hair, making them look even more frightening as they
	claw at the desperate Roger.

424	The man kicks and kicks, but he cannot deliver a solid blow from
	his pinned position. His hand gropes on the seat of the truck
	for his rifle, which suddenly fires as the man's fingers
	inadvertently hit the trigger. A shell blasts through the chest
	of the lead creature, but the thing pays little attention.

425	Peter's truck is starting to roll faster. He heads right for
	Roger's cab.

426	The helicopter hovers as Stephen tries to see the action.

427	Now Roger has a good grip on his gun, but he cannot clear the
	long weapon from around the gear sticks. The lead Zombie is
	actually scrambling into the cab and is all but on top of the
	struggling Trooper.

428	The second creature is about to claw its way in when, with a
	great roar, Peter's truck swings up and crushes it.

429	Roger is desperately trying to keep the other Zombie's mouth
	away. They are wrestling now. The Zombie is weak, as usual, but
	Roger is still hampered by the position he is in.

430	Peter has pulled too far past the other truck. He slams his rig
	into reverse and backs up. Now his window is in a direct line
	with the open door on Roger's cab. He raises his rifle and aims,
	but he cannot get a clear shot. He shouts loudly trying to
	overcome the noise of the truck engine and the hovering
	helicopter.

	Peter:	GET ITS HEAD UP...GET ITS HEAD UP...

431	Roger realises that Peter is outside. He struggles with the
	creature, dropping his gun. His hands manage to get a
	stranglehold on the creature's neck. He pushes up with all his
	might. The Zombie's hands are clutching at the man's face. It's
	fingers push at the man's eyes.

432	Peter sees the opportunity and fires. The gun roars loudly.

433	The Zombie's head flies apart. Remnants of blood and brain
	tissue splatter the inside of the cab and the driver's window.
	The gummy stuff flies into Roger's face. The Zombie falls limp,
	but Roger is still desperate. The dead weight of the creature is
	now on top of him, and the bloody wound runs. Roger is frantic.
	He frees himself with great heaves of his body and he pushes the
	creature out of the cab. The man's eyes are wide with revulsion.
	He instantly brings up his sleeve to wipe the stains from his
	face. He is quivering in extremes of emotions.

	A sudden crash. Roger spins. The Zombie at the driver door has
	smashed through the cab window with a brick. Roger, still
	shaking, dives down to the floor for his weapon.

434	Peter tries to level off a shot but he cannot because Roger is
	in the way...

	Peter:	GET DOWN...STAY DOWN...I GOT IT!

435	Roger, in his adrenalised anger, sits up with his gun and levels
	off on the creature himself. He fires. The shell crashes through
	the already shattered glass and squarely into the creatures
	head.

	Roger:	YOU BASTARDS...YOU BASTARDS...	

	It seems as though his mind is snapping. His voice quivers as
	does his body.

	Roger:	WE GOT 'EM, BUDDY...WE GOT 'EM DIDN'T WE!

436	Peter:	COOL IT, MAN...GET YOUR HEAD...

437	Roger:	WE GOT THIS BY THE ASS...GOT THIS BY THE ASS!

	Roger is screaming. He dives down to work on the jumping again.

438	Peter:	HEY, ROG...GET YOUR HEAD MAN...COME ON...
			WE GOT A LOT TO DO...ROGER...

439	There is no response from the other truck. Peter is about to
	open his door and step out when suddenly Roger sits up again.
	The engine of the truck roars. He seems to have calmed down
	some. He looks across at Peter.

	Roger:	LET'S GO BABY...NUMBER TWO...

	Peter:	YOU ALRIGHT?

	Roger:	PERFECT, BABY...PERFECT!

	Roger guns the engine on his truck. The big vehicle lumbers out
	of the area. Peter follows suit.

440	The two Semis rumble out of the warehouse lot and start down the
	grade toward the road. The helicopter escorts them.

441	A few Zombies are walking up the road slowly.

442	Roger's eyes get wider with anger. He steers his big rig right
	for the creatures.

443	The front of the cab smashes into two of them. One is crushed
	under the wheels, the other flies back from the impact.

444	Fran watches with anxiety. She sees the two trucks pull up over
	the rise with the helicopter following. We hear spirited music
	as the convoy approaches the mall building.

445	The two trucks roar around the entrance ramps into the parking
	lot and again, the chopper zooms right over the roof.

446	Fran trots across the roof to see the action in the lot.

447	the trucks rumble toward the second set of doors. The music
	continues through the entire action.

448	Roger steers his giant vehicle directly broadside to the doors.
	The cab knocks over several creatures and scrapes the building
	as the trailer blocks off the entrance. This time there are
	still creatures alive in the immediate area. They clutch at the
	cab of the truck and leap at the doors.

449	Fran, watching from directly above, seems inspired, caught up in
	the bravery of the moment. As she sees the creatures converging
	on the truck, she aims her rifle at them. Before she fires,
	Peter's rig slides next to Roger's, cabs abreast.

450	Peter's truck knocks over several of the clutching creatures.
	One Zombie, caught directly under the front wheels, is still
	alive and clutching at the air. Several creatures jump at
	Peter's driver side window.

451	Roger, grabbing his gun, moves to leave his truck on Peter's
	side, but the trucks are too close. His door won't open
	enough to get out. He rolls down his window. Peter has noticed
	Roger's door won't open, and the Trooper fumbles with the gear
	shift in order to pull away, but he hears Roger shouting:

	Roger:	THE WINDOWS...OPEN YOUR WINDOW...YOUR WINDOW...

	Peter dives across the cab and rolls down the passenger window.
	Roger leans out his open window, trying to get his weapon into
	firing position. One or two Zombies are squeezing through the
	narrow space between the truck. They are just about to reach
	Roger when he fires, killing the lead ghoul. More Zombies move
	around Roger's cab, moments away from him.

452	The helicopter buzzes the area as Stephen watches the Zombies
	converge on the cab.

453	Fran, her hair blowing front he chopper, tries to aim her rifle
	into the pack of creatures. Her hair covers her eyes and she
	brushes it away with irritation.

	Fran:	ROGER...IN FRONT, ROGER...IN FRONT, ROGER...

	She shouts over the engine noises, getting very excited.

454	Roger fires again and again down the narrow space between the
	rigs. Another Zombie falls.

	Peter:	FOR CHRISSAKE COME ON!

	Roger is still emotionally crazed. He leans out of his window in
	a very vulnerable position. He is whooping like a child again as
	he tries to level off another shot.

	Suddenly, he's grabbed from behind by a Zombie and almost falls
	out the window. He struggles to hold himself and keep a grip on
	his gun. Peter leans over, trying to get a shot at the creature,
	but can't get a clean sight. Roger grabs the window frames on
	Peter's door and tries to pull himself up. Another creature
	grabs him from behind.

455	Fran watches with emotion in her eyes.

	Fran:	MONSTERS! MONSTERS!

	She fires her gun.

456	The bullet slams into the pavement kicking up a cloud of smoke.
	It narrowly misses a creature. Fran fires again. Her shot tears
	into the shoulder of the Zombie, but it doesn't stop him.

457	The chopper zooms very close. Peter still cannot aim his rifle,
	but Roger, using both hands, brings his gun butt in an uppercut.
	It slams against a creature which is grabbing him and drives the
	thing staggering back. Then with a desperate driving motion, 
	Roger climbs through the window of Peter's cab.

458	Peter pulls the big rig away even while Roger's legs still kick
	out the window. The Zombies grab at Roger's ankles, and one
	manages to hold on as the truck starts to move.

459	Fran fires again and again.

460	This shot rips into the Zombie holding Roger's leg. It lets go
	and falls, rolling across the pavement. The woman fires again,
	hitting the pavement. The creature struggles to its knees. She
	fires again and hits the creature's neck. Again.
	Shoulder. Again...head. The Zombie sprawls on the pavement. Fran
	is exultant, she aims and fires at another creature.

461	The helicopter passes overhead. The music is still stirring.

462	In Peter's truck, just rolling out the lot, Roger realises:

	Roger:	JESUS!

	Peter:	WHAT?

	Roger:	MY GODDAM BAG...I LEFT MY GODDAM BAG IN THE
			OTHER TRUCK.

	Peter brings his vehicle to a screeching halt.

	Peter:	ALRIGHT, NOW YOU SON OF A BITCH! YOU
			BETTER SCREW YOUR FUCKIN' HEAD ON, BABY!

	Roger:	YEAH, YEAH...I'M O.K. LET'S GO.

	Suddenly, Peter grabs the Trooper by his lapels and slams
	him back against the door of the cab.

	Peter:	I MEAN IT! NOW YOU'RE NOT JUST PLAYIN' WITH
			YOUR LIFE, YOUR PLAYIN' WITH MINE!

	The two men stare at each other for a moment. Roger is startled
	somewhat out of his emotional rush.

	Peter:	(softer)
			ALRIGHT, NOW ARE YOU STRAIGHT?

	Roger:	YEAH.

	Peter lets him go and returns to the wheel. He guns the engine
	and roars into a big arcing turn in the parking lot.

463	When Fran sees the truck returning, she looks up from her gun
	sight. The helicopter has already flown over the roof, and
	Stephen is confused as to why the truck hadn't appeared on the
	road. Fran turns and tries to signal to Stephen.

464	He finally sees her and flies closer. The woman waves a signal
	and the chopper buzzes back over the lot.

465	Her hair blowing wildly, Fran takes up her post again, her rifle
	ready. She thinks a moment, then begins to reload the weapon
	pulling the shells from her blouse pocket.

466	Peter's truck zooms back into position, colliding with some of
	Zombies in the vicinity.

467	Roger immediately climbs through the windows into the original
	cab. He snatches up his knapsack and several tools which are
	strewn over the seat and floor.

	Again, creatures converge on the cab area. Two more come up
	between the trucks, several come around the front of the cab.

468	Fran is still loading.

469	The helicopter buzzes.

470	As Roger climbs back through the window, his pack accidentally
	falls to the ground. With reflex action, he drops between the
	cabs, landing on his feet. He is facing the two creatures
	which are very close. He reaches up and with on hand on each of
	the open window frames, he swings his legs up hard. His kick
	sends the creatures sprawling. Then, he bends to collect his
	pack and is grabbed from behind.

471	Peter tries to level off his gun but he cannot get a shot.

472	Neither can Fran who is shouting from the roof.

473	Roger keeps his head this time. His first thought is for the
	pack of tools. He tosses the sack into the cab of Peter's truck
	as though he were making a hook shot with a basketball.

474	Peter catches the pack as several of the tools clatter out and
	onto the floor of the cab.

475	The creature which has a hold on Roger takes advantage of the
	man's imbalance from throwing the knapsack. It bites at the
	man's arm. Roger tears away, but blood appears at the wound.
	Then Roger squares off a solid punch right to the Zombie's jaw.
	The creature flies back and almost knocks over the Zombies
	behind it. Roger jumps, making a grab for the window of Peter's
	cab. The Zombies between the trucks, which Roger originally
	kicked away, have regrouped. They advance and grab at the
	struggling trooper. Roger's feet try to get hold on the side of
	the door, but they slip.

476	Peter moves to drop his rifle and grab Roger's hands, but Roger
	falls from the high window back to the pavement. Peter draws his
	hand gun.

477	Roger leaps again, his hands catching the window frame. The
	Zombies are clutching at him. Again he swings up his legs and
	kicks the creatures off balance. This time he manages to get his
	feet locked against the door and Peter grabs the Troopers arm
	with his free hand, but another Zombie is pulling at the man's
	shirt and still another makes a grab for his legs.

	Peter reaches out with his pistol and fires a point blank shot
	at one of the clutching ghouls. It flies back and Roger is able
	to pull himself higher. His torso is just about through the
	window when another creature grabs him.

478	Peter can no longer get a shot as Roger fills the window, so the
	big man drops his pistol and pulls Roger's arm with all his
	might.
	
479	Roger is almost all the way in but his legs still dangle,
	kicking. Peter starts the truck. As it begins to roll away, one
	of the clutching Zombies is able to get a solid hold on Roger's
	left leg. The creature opens its mouth and bites at the calf.
	Blood appears. The creature bites again and this time it comes
	away with bits of flesh tangled in a bloodstained strip op
	material from Roger's trousers.

480	Roger screams in pain and kicks violently. The truck
	accelerates and the Zombie finally falls clear.

481	It rolls on the pavement for a little way before it stops.
	Then it sits on the ground, looking like a gorilla. It still
	has a bloody mass of flesh and material in its mouth. With its
	hands it tries to separate the cloth from the more important
	morsels.

	A bullet pings into the cement near the chewing Zombie. Another
	tears through its shoulder. It still is concerned only with its
	prize.

482	Fran is firing, swearing through her teeth as the gun roars.
	She finally hits the seated creature squarely in the head.

483	We see it fall from her point of view on the roof. Others walk
	by the corpse without taking notice.

484	The helicopter escorts the big truck back to the warehouse.

485	As it rumbles along, Roger, in extreme pain, is tying his belt
	tightly around his leg as a tourniquet. He sucks air through his
	teeth in anguish.

	Peter:	THAT'S IT.

	Roger:	BULL SHIT.

	Peter:	WE GOTTA DEAL WITH THAT LEG!

	Roger:	I'M DEALIN' WITH IT...I'M DEALIN' WITH IT FINE!
			I WON'T BE ABLE TO WALK ON THIS AT ALL IF WE WAIT.

	Peter:	CAN YOU WALK ON IT NOW?

	Roger:	YOUR DAMN RIGHT, I CAN...DAMN RIGHT, I CAN!

	The wounded trooper struggles to wrap the bloody part of his leg
	with a torn off piece of trouser. He can hardly keep from
	screaming, and his words come out sharply and with great breaths
	between them.
 
	Roger:	I STOP MOVIN' THIS LEG...MAY NOT EVER GET IT GOIN'
			AGAIN...THERE'S A LOT TO GET DONE BEFORE...BEFORE
			YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE ME...

	The big Black man stares at his friend for a moment. Then he
	drives on to the warehouse escorted by the chopper.

486	There is now a huge trailer truck at each of the four main
	entrances to the mall. They are very close to the doors, if not
	completely flush. Some of the glass portals can be opened not
	slightly, but not enough for the Zombies inside to pass through.

487	In the parking lot, the creatures mob around the trucks,
	frustrated that they cannot pass into the building. They clutch
	and claw at the enormous vehicles but to no avail. Some try to
	climb up onto the cabs. Others try to claw at the doors on the
	trailers.

488	Some creatures are crawling under the rigs: When they reach the
	mall doors they cannot stand, so they have no leverage. The
	creatures inside are pushing the doors out, so the Zombies under
	the trucks cannot push them in. The doors swing both in and out,
	so it is very clear that some access could be had by the
	creatures if they were more organised.

	One creature, having crawled under a trailer, does manage to
	push open a mall door. The thing crawls into the building
	through the legs of other ghouls which are trying to exit. They
	behave as a swarm of insects.

	The revolving door offers the best access for the creatures,
	although its inherent complexity is baffling to their empty
	brains. Two creatures do manage to crawl under the truck which
	blocks the revolving door, and one of them negotiates the
	rotating action and enters the concourse.

489	Peter and Stephen are huddled over the maps of the building.
	They are back in the crawl space. The cartons are still piled
	against the firestair entrance.

	Peter:	IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW MANY OF THEM ARE STILL
			INSIDE. THAT'S A LONG HAUL BETWEEN THOSE ENTRANCES.

	Steve:	WELL IF WE CAN GET SOME MORE FLARES...OR MAYBE
			SOME OF THOSE PROPANE JOBS.

	Peter:	THE GUNS ARE FIRST. GUNS AND AMMUNITION.

490	Roger moans with pain. Nearby, Fran is applying a dressing to
	his leg. The wound is wrapped with several layers of cloth. The
	first aid kit is open on the floor. Peter crouches near his
	friend. He takes over from Fran. He ties more strips tightly
	around the wound and around the upper thigh.

	Peter:	YOU SURE YOU GONNA MAKE IT, BUDDY?

	Roger:	JUST HURRY UP WITH THAT!

491	Again, the military music. A tall figure drops out of a ceiling
	grid and lands on the floor of the Sporting Goods Store. It is
	Peter. His rifle is slung and there is an empty pack on his
	back. Several of the Maintenance Room key rings are strapped
	into his belt.

492	Suddenly a Zombie charges across the room. The gate to the mall
	balcony is open on this store. Another creature, attracted by
	the commotion, starts through the open entrance arch.

493	Stephen is starting down through the ceiling grid. He also has
	equipment strapped onto his body. He sees the charging creature.
	Peter is trying to unsling his rifle. Stephen conquers his fear
	of the height, and lets himself fall to the floor. He crumples
	up when he hits, and rolls into a store exhibit, knocking things
	flying.

	Peter manages to level off his gun and shoots the rushing
	creature. Stephen regains his footing. The second creature is
	moving up the aisle. Stephen grabs a powerful crossbow from a
	nearby exhibit. It is loaded. It fires with a strumming sound
	and the small shaft rips cleanly through the creature's skull
	and imbeds itself in a wall beyond. The Zombie walks forward a
	few steps before it falls.
 
494	The men run toward the entrance arch. Leaping up on an adjacent
	counter top, Peter manages to reach the lip of the roll gate and
	he swings it down fast. Stephen catches the cage below and slams
	it into place just as another ghoul falls against it moaning and
	clawing.

	Stephen unslings his gun and is about to level it off on the
	creature outside. Peter jumps down from the counter.

	Peter:	DON'T TRY TO SHOOT THROUGH THOSE GATES.
			OPENINGS ARE TOO SMALL. BULLET'LL WIND UP
			CHASIN' US AROUND IN HERE.

	The Zombie crashes all its might against the metal cage.
	Stephen startles.

	Peter:	HE CAN'T GET THROUGH...COME ON...

495	The men crash back through the store and Peter moves right to
	the racks of weapons. He pulls down a gorgeous high powered
	rifle which is equipped with a sophisticated scope for sighting.

	Peter:	AIN'T IT A CRIME!

	Steve:	WHAT?

	Peter:	(looking through the telescope)
			THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD EVER MISS WITH THIS
			GUN...IS THE SUCKER WITH THE BREAD TO BUY IT.

496	The cross hairs of the telescope zero in on the enlarged
	forehead of the Zombie, which is thrashing against the roll
	gates. The sight gives up a sense of the super-weapon's lethal
	accuracy.

497	Stephen dives into the ammunition and moves behind the counter
	where he pulls out boxes of shiny new hand guns.

	Peter finds elaborate holsters and ammunition belts. He pulls
	several other rifles from the rack. We recognise the firepower
	in the arsenal that the two men accumulate.

498	Other Zombies appear at the gate, but they cannot break in.

499	Peter:	(at the creatures)
			YOU JUST WAIT OUT THERE, SISSIES...
			WE COMIN'...AND WE READY!

500	With a swell in the music, the band of all four humans charges
	out of the Maintenance corridor and makes a break for the
	Department Store. They all wear new double holsters containing
	hand guns. Each has a rifle strapped over his shoulder and
	another in hand. They wear ammo belts and carry packs with
	other supplies. The wounded Roger is sitting in the big
	gardening cart which Peter earlier used to carry the first
	supply load out of the store. Peter runs, pushing the cart
	before him.

	There are only a few creatures on the balcony. The dead things
	turn in confusion at the sound of the attacking commandos.
	Roger, his hands free to shoot, fires his weapon several times
	at some of the creatures who are closest.

501	The creatures from the main concourse below begin to move up
	the stationary staircase and struggle with the escalators.
	The corpses of creatures slain in the earlier battles still
	clutters in the area.

502	Fran and Steve are the first to reach the entrance to the 
	Department Store. Steve falls immediately on the gate locks.
	Peter pulls up to a screeching halt at the gate. He turns the
	cart in a full 180 so that Roger is facing out toward the mall.

	Steve fumbles with the second lock. Peter faces the few Zombies
	which are converging along the balcony. He lift his new
	Super-gun and stares through the scope. The gun roars
	eloquently. Even its sound pronounces its power. The single
	shot rips cleanly through the centre-forehead of one of the
	creatures.

	The man aims at another head. Blam. Another perfect kill. Then a
	third. Roger fires several times.

	Fran stands ready at the roll gate. As Stephen finishes with the
	final lock, the woman pushes against the cage and it starts up.
	Steve stands, and the two roll the cage into the ceiling, but
	Stephen is careful not to let it get out of his grasp.

	Fran moves into the store and Peter pulls the cart behind him.
	Then Steve, Peter and Fran pull the gate shut long before any of
	the advancing creatures reach the area.

503	Again, the Zombies smash into the cage, but the humans are
	already running through the aisles of the big store.

504	Peter wheels Roger into the elevator and hits the button for the
	first floor. The doors shut and the car starts down.

	Peter:	HOW'S THE RIDE?

	Roger:	KIND BUMPY. WATCH IT.

	The stern Black face stares down at the back of the wounded
	man's head. Despite his attempt at humour, the stiffness in
	Roger's body evidences his pain. Peter puts his hand squarely
	on the Trooper's shoulder.

	Peter:	LOOK HERE...I...

	Roger:	I KNOW, I KNOW...SHUT UP.

	Something very serious is shared between the two men, some
	knowledge which we do not fully understand. We do see the
	kind of bond shared by soldiers in a battle.

505	The elevator doors glide open and Peter pushes the cart out
	into the first floor on the big store.

506	Fran and Stephen charge down the store escalator moving faster
	than the steps themselves.

507	They run through the hardware department where Stephen snatches
	up several propane torches. Fran stuffs extra bottles of gas
	into her back pack.

508	With a great hiss one of the propane nozzles spits a white-hot
	flame as it is lit with a new disposable lighter. Fran holds
	two torches as Stephen lights them.

509	Peter steps up to the first floor entrance gate with Roger in
	front of him. Several creatures outside of the cage fly into
	sudden frenzy at seeing the humans. They slam against the grid
	but it holds as usual.

	Peter:	UNLOCK THE MIDDLE ONE LAST.

510	Steve falls on the right hand lock with his keys. The Zombies
	all converge near the crouching man's side of the gate. They
	push and shove. Fran holds one of the lit torches very close and
	the creatures back away cringing. The lock opens and Steve moves
	to the extreme left.

	Again the Zombies follow and again Fran is ready with the torch.

	Peter:	ALRIGHT...THE TOUGHEST PART'LL BE GETTIN'
			BY THESE RIGHT HERE...

	Steve:	IT'S A LONG HAUL DOWN TO THE ENTRANCE.

511	Peter cranes his neck to see past the Zombies and down the
	concourse. Several other creatures are starting toward the
	Department Store. Behind them, about three hundred feet away, is
	one of the main entrances which is blocked off outside by a
	truck trailer.

512	Peter:	WE'LL BE ALRIGHT!

	Fran:	IT'S TOO FAR!

	Peter:	THERE'S NO BACKIN' OUT NOW. WE GOTTA LOCK
			THOSE DOORS!

	Fran:	WE'LL NEVER MAKE ALL FOUR. IT'S TOO RISKY.

	Steve:	YOU JUST STAY HERE AND BE READY TO UPEN UP FOR US.

	Fran:	THE CAR!

	Peter:	WHAT?

	Fran:	THE CAR!

513	Outside, we see the slowly spinning exhibit which displays the
	new automobile. It is a sleek, sporty model, which looks fast
	and manoeuvrable.

514	Peter looks down at Roger.

	Peter:	YOU OK TO START IT?

	Roger nods and reaches for his supply pack. He is cringing
	with pain, but he moves efficiently.

515	The Zombies clutch at the gate with new vigour. At the unlocked
	ends the grid gives a little, but still holds the creature out.
	Fran waves the torches closer and the creatures back away.
	Steve un-locks the middle lock.

	Steve:	IT'S GOIN' UP!

516	The gate swings up with a thunderous roar. The Zombies attack
	but Fran's torches make them hold back slightly. Steve grabs
	one of the propane canisters with one hand and draws a pistol
	with the other. Fran draws a hand gun also. The two fire into
	the pack of Zombies. One or two fall. The others try to move
	in but are afraid of the bright flames. One gets close to Steve
	but the man blasts his torch directly into its face. Its hair
	catches on fire and the creature throws itself wildly about,
	knocking other Zombies back.

517	Now Peter sees an opening and he makes a break with the cart.
	Roger holds on to the sides. They crash through the scattered
	pack of ghouls successfully and Peter makes for the car exhibit.
	There are a few creatures on the concourse on the cart's path.

	Peter:	(shouting)
			CLOSE THE GATE...CLOSE THE GATE...

518	Steve grabs the lip of the roll cage and it starts down. Fran is
	still inside the store with one of the torches.

	Fran:	THE KEYS, STEPHEN...THE KEYS!

	Steve tries to stop the downward progress of the gate but it
	slams shut with a metallic crash.

	Fran:	JESUS CHRIST!

519	Peter stops in his tracks when he hears the woman's shouts. He
	looks back. Several of the creatures have followed the cart.
	They advance slowly.

520	Several have stayed with Stephen, however, and they approach
	Stephen as he tries to pass the keys back through the gate.
	The big ring doesn't fit through the small openings.

	Steve:	 YOU MOTHER!

	Fran:	KEEP 'EM...JUST KEEP 'EM...LOOK OUT!

	The Zombies at Stephen's back are very close. Steve lunges at
	them with his torch. They back off slightly.

521	Peter:	COME ON, MAN! GET OUTA THERE!

	The creatures on the concourse are approaching the cart. A
	pained Roger levels off several shots, but he is very shaky from
	his extreme pain. He manages to down one of the Zombies.

522	Fran:	STEPHEN...FOR GOD SAKE...

	The woman holds up her torch so that the bright flame faces the
	ghouls. Stephen crouches and puts a key in the right hand lock.
	The Zombies converge on him.

523	Peter, seeing other creatures drawing near, starts to push the
	cart again. he manages to dodges two little clusters of the
	walking dead.

524	The lock clicks just as one bold creature grabs Stephen from
	behind, Fran tries to aim her torch closer. It disarms the
	Zombie for a moment, Stephen thrashes his body back knocking
	the think off balance. Then he quickly slides the keys under
	the gate which he can lift just high enough with the single
	lock undone.

	Another ghoul grabs Steve from behind. This time Steve's torch
	is knocked flying and rolls away. Fran is desperate. She tries
	to aim her pistol but cannot shoot through the grill. She holds
	her torch high.

	Steve kicks and scrambles, rolling on the floor. The Zombies
	are on him. He manages to knock one or two of them to the
	floor. Then he fires with his pistol, killing another, He
	crawls to the torch and grabs it, the creatures clutching and
	tugging at his pants and shirt.

	He brings the flame up and flashes it at the Zombies. They back
	away enough for him to crawl to an open space. Then he scrambles
	to his feet and charges down the concourse toward the car.

525	At the exhibit, Peter stops the cart. There are two of the
	lumbering creatures close at hand. The big trooper raises his
	rifle. Roger, using all his strength, manages to pull himself up
	out of the cart. He lips to the exhibit as Peter fires at the
	oncoming ghouls. The super-gun scores two perfect hits.

526	As Roger tries to step onto the spinning platform, he falls and
	rolls against the car. The turntable carries him around toward
	another creature. He is struggling in pain toward the driver's
	door of the vehicle.

527	Steve, who is approaching at a run, sees the action.

	Steve:	WATCH IS ROGER...ROGER!

528	Roger turns his head and sees the ghoul just before the creature
	grabs him. The things hands clutch at the wrapped wound, which
	is already leaking blood through its dressing. Roger screams
	loudly.

529	Peter jumps up onto the spinning turntable, leans across the
	hood of the car. His super-gun drills a hole through the
	creature's skull. It falls off the exhibit.

530	Peter hurriedly comes around to Roger's side. In extreme pain,
	the Trooper is desperately trying to open the driver door. Peter
	helps him. The door opens and Peter eases his friend into the
	seat. Roger immediately goes to work under the dash.

531	Zombies are advancing now from all over the concourse.

532	Peter:	GET IN!

	He is shouting at Stephen who is just rushing up to the
	platform. He and the Trooper scramble into opposite sides of the
	back seat. They slam the doors and make sure that all buttons
	are locked. Roger works as quickly as he can.

533	Several of the lead creatures reach the turntable. Some fall
	trying to step onto the moving disc, but others manage to
	struggle over to the car. They smash the windows with their
	hands. It is a nightmarish scene as the men huddle in the
	shiny, new car which spins very slowly in circles.

534	Fran has relocked the one open gate mechanism, and she stands
	now trying to see the action, but it is out of her line of
	vision. She can only hear the moaning of the creatures, and
	pounding on the car. She turns the valve on her propane nozzle
	extinguishing the flame.

535	The car's engine roars as Roger is able to jump the wires.

	Steve:	I'LL DRIVE IT...

	Roger:	I GOT IT.

	The Trooper's face contorts in agony as he moves himself into
	position behind the wheel. He is shaking, but he bites his lip
	and slams the car into gear. There are at least eight creatures
	crawling over the car, more approach. The platform spins. Roger
	waits until the car is aimed directly down the concourse. The
	men in the back seats are alert to the Zombies which pound at
	the windows. The ugly and distorted faces press close against
	the safety glass.

536	Now the car pulls out quickly. It rolls of the edge of the
	spinning display, knocking several of the creatures aside. The
	front wheels move off the platform and bounce onto the floor,
	but the frame of the car scrapes the top of the disc and is
	stuck for a moment. The disc spins on carrying the rear of the
	car with it. Then Roger gives it more gas. The rear wheels spin
	and finally catch.

537	The car shoots out onto the mall floor. Some of the Zombies
	cling for a moment, but they fall away quickly, scrambling to
	regain their footing and follow.

538	The car swerves and for an instant seems as though it will
	crash against the columns on the concourse. Roger manages to
	control it, and the shiny vehicle zooms ahead with tremendous
	energy.

539	One of the stray creatures in the concourse tries to intercept
	the speeding auto, but the car knocks him mercilessly aside as
	though he were a bowling pin.

540	Fran sees the car as it rounds the corner, heads directly for
	the main entrance which she can see from her position.

541	The Zombies at the entrance already started back into the mall
	attracted by the commotion. The car zooms down the concourse
	easily breaking their ranks.

542	Roger throws the manoeuvrable vehicle into a screeching
	tailspin, stopping just at the doors.

543	The big trailer blocks the entrance effectively. There are some
	creatures inside the doors. Under the van, several Zombies are
	struggling with the doors. one is just pushing in and seems as
	though it will be able to enter.

544	Peter and Stephen slam against the door. Stephen aims his torch
	directly at the crawling creatures. The one in front withdraws
	its arm. The grotesque things writhe, kick under the truck. The
	door slams and Peter produces another set of master keys. They
	are all coded. he falls on the lock mechanism.

	Peter:	THAT'S NOT 100%, BUT I DON'T THINK THEY'LL GET
			THROUGH.

	Steve:	CAN'T THEY SMASH THE GLASS?

	Peter:	SAFETY STUFF...PRETTY INDESTRUCTIBLE...THEY GOT
			NO LEVERAGE UNDER THE TRUCK.. GIMME THE ALARMS...

545	Steve rummages in his back pack. Produces two portable battery
	operated burglar alarms. Peter activates the units, stands them
	against the base of the now locked doors. As he crouches near
	the glass, creatures outside go into a frenzy clawing at the
	glass doors. They cannot get in.

	Peter:	I'M HOPIN' THEY'LL JUST GO AWAY AFTER THEY FIND
			THEY CAN'T GET IN...

546	The creatures moving slowly down the concourse are now getting
	close to the action.

547	The men hop back into the car, it roars off with Roger still at
	the wheel.

548	Again the sleek auto rips through the ranks of the advancing
	Zombies. They fall and scatter.

549	The car speeds down the concourse, turns the corner near where
	Fran watches at the Department Store game. We hear Steve's voice
	on the woman's walkie talkie.

	Steve:	WE'RE OK...WE GOT IT MADE...IT'GONNA WORK.

	Fran stares out through the roll cage. The Zombies are
	staggering weakly after the car.

550	With another tailspin, the auto pulls up at the second set of
	doors. The men scramble out of the back seat, the Zombies
	outside try to crawl under the second trailer. The men shut them
	out easily, locking the door and planting alarms. They stand to
	look down the concourse.

551	The creatures seem even more spread out now.

	Steve:	HOW MANY YOU FIGURE ARE ALREADY IN...

	Peter:	DUNNO. NOT TOO MANY. WE'LL GET 'EM EASY. WE
			GET IT ALL LOCKED OFF AND WE'RE GOIN' ON A HUNT!
  
	The big Trooper raises his super-gun and sights through the
	telescope.

552	As we see through the scope, cross hairs settle on the forehead
	of one of the creatures which is lumbering down the hall. The
	face is magnified, distorted by the telescope. The gun roars and
	the head in the scope explodes with red.

553	The creature falls against a column, hit squarely through the
	brain. We sense the supreme accuracy of the magnificent weapon.

554	It is night. The Zombies in the parking lot still group around
	the semis. They set up an eerie moaning in the moonlight. A slow
	piece of music starts to build.

555	The creatures crawl under the trucks but cannot enter the mall.
	They pound and scratch at the doors, to no avail.

556	From inside the concourse, the mob is muffled. Even the
	revolving door is locked now. It seems the most vulnerable, but
	the crawling creatures cannot quite get leverage to smash the
	glass panels and they have no tools to pound with.

	The auto is flush against the revolving doors inside, offering
	added protection. Several alarm units sit atop the car. They
	are the early warning devices against penetration.

557	They camera starts to dolly back, the music builds. We see slain
	corpses of many Zombies lying askew in various parts of the
	building. It is like a battlefield after a war.

558	The humans appear on the second storey balcony. Moving to the
	railing, looking down to the expanse of the building. They are
	guerrilla fighters, with their weapons strapped on. They have
	taken the Temple. The music hits a crescendo as the people look
	over their spoils. Even the wounded Roger seems triumphant as he
	limps to the rails, supporting himself on his arms.

559	We see a spectacular shot of the full expanse of the building.
	Zombies lie dead everywhere. The humans have captures the gold of
	the Gods...In this case the Gods of Consumer Heaven.

560	Peter's hand is on the maps of the Maintenance Corridor. He is
	drawing a line past the washrooms at the end of the hall near
	the firestair.

	Peter:	WE PUT UP THE WALL HERE. THERE'S NO DOOR FROM
			THE LAST OFFICE INTO THE WASHROOMS, SO NOBODY'LL
			GET NOSEY...AND THIS WAY WE CAN STILL GET TO THE
			PLUMBING...

	Steve:	WHY CAN'T WE JUST BOARD UP THE STAIRWAY. HELL,
			THEY CAN'T EVEN GET THROUGH A STACK OF CARTONS.

	Peter:	I'M NOT JUST WORRYIN' ABOUT THEM. SOONER OR
			LATER MIGHT BE A PATROL THROUGH HERE...LOOTERS
			MAYBE...I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO EVEN KNOW THAT
			STAIRWAY EXISTS.

	They look back at the map.

	Peter:	THE DUCTWORK RUNS ALL THE WAY INTO THE WASHROOMS.
			WE'LL HAVE TO GET IN AND OUT THAT WAY. WE'LL
			BRING UP ANY BUG STUFF WE WANT BEFORE WE PUT UP
			THE WALL.

561	The men sit huddled. The large storage area is filled with
	mounds of supplies brought up from the mall stores, but the
	stuff all sits around in disarray.

562	Behind the wall of cartons, Roger seems to be sleeping, but he
	is sweating feverishly, and his face twitches. Fran has been
	trying to soothe him with a wet cloth on his forehead. Now she
	stops, leaving the cloth on the shivering head. She moves out
	to Stephen and Peter.

563	Fran:	HE SEEMS TO BE SLEEPING.

	Peter:	GOOD.

564	The woman moves to where she has medical supplies on one of the
	cartons. There are bottles, vials and diabetic hypo syringes as
	well as bandages and dressings from the Pharmacy in the mall.

	Fran:	I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO...

	Steve:	YOU'RE DOIN' FINE.

	Fran:	HIS LEG IS AWFUL...THE INFECTION IS SPREADING FAST.
			CAN'T WE FLY HIM OUT OF HERE...TRY TO FIND A MED.
			UNIT...

565	Steve looks at Peter. The big trooper speaks softly.

	Peter:	I'VE SEEN HALF A DOZEN GUYS GET BITTEN BY THOSE
			THINGS...NONE OF 'EM LASTED MORE THAN THIRTY SIX
			HOURS.

566	Fran is stunned. Suddenly, Roger screams from behind the cartons.

	Roger:	PETER...PETER...WHERE ARE YOU?

567	Peter:	RIGHT HERE, BUDDY.

568	Roger is sitting up. His eyes look very dark and sunken. He is
	sweating even more profusely than before.

	Roger:	YEAH...YEAH...

	He licks his lips. He looks around the vast, barren room, trying
	to clear his eyesight.

569	Outside, Fran sits on a carton. The men are still huddled
	around the spoils. Roger occasional shouts from the other
	room.

	Roger:	WE DID IT, HUH, BUDDY? WE WHIPPED 'EM.

	Peter:	THAT'S RIGHT ROG.

	Roger:	DIDN'T WE? PETER? DIDN'T WE WHIP 'EM?

	Peter:	WE SURE DID, BUDDY.

	Roger:	WE WHIPPED 'EM AND GOT IT ALL! WE GOT IT ALL!

	The man's voice sounds pathetic as it echoes through the big
	storage area bouncing off barren walls.

570	A hammer slams into nails behind the fake wall which the people
	are working on. A great network of two-by-fours are braced at
	the rear of the corridor, more lumber is wedged against walls
	making a frame. Stephen is slamming large nails into the
	framework for reinforcement. On the frame's face a masonite
	panel is nailed into place on one side. Peter works in the
	corridor. He is carefully nailing in a moulding which makes the
	new partition look like a finished wall.

	In the corridor, there are power tools lying about and a vast
	array of other hardware in the gardening cart. Fran appears from
	out of the washrooms. She is carrying an old can of paint which
	has obviously been used.

	Fran:	THIS MUST HAVE BEEN FOR TOUCH UP...IT LOOKS
			PERFECT.

	Peter grabs the can and pries it open quickly with a screw
	driver. He dips his finger into the liquid and smears some onto
	the new wall where it butts against the corridor. It is a
	perfect match.

	Steve:	(to Fran) ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT BEFORE WE CLOSE
			IT OFF?

	Fran:	NO...

	The woman is staring down the corridor toward the mall proper.

571	The corpses from the hall have been carried out of the way.
	They are piled together at the corridor mouth on the balcony.
	It is a grisly sight. Fran turns away.

572	Fran:	NO.

	She steps back through the unfinished partition, leans against
	the framework. Her hand goes to her mouth as she tries to choke
	back a gag. Steve moves up behind her, but she feels another
	wave of nausea and she darts for the washroom. Steve sets down
	his hammer and follows.

573	The woman is kneeling on the floor, propped up by her hands on
	the toilet seat. She is vomiting. Steve approaches quietly. His
	hand falls on her back.

	Fran:	LEAVE ME ALONE...IT'S ALRIGHT...IT'S MY PROBLEM.

	Steve:	FRANNIE...

	Fran:	JUST GET OUTA HERE, STEPHEN...I DON'T WANT YOU
			HERE.

	The man doesn't move. Fran reaches up, taking his hand. She
	clutches it tightly, indicating that she is not angry.

	Fran:	I DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE ME THIS WAY...

	Another wave hits her and she wretches again. She pulls her
	hand back leaning over the toilet bowl.

	Fran:	PLEASE GO...I'M ALRIGHT...PLEASE...

	Stephen stands up reluctantly and drift out of the room. The
	woman wretches but she is dry. She tries to swallow. Then sits
	on the floor next to the toilet holding her stomach. She
	fumbles with the flush handle, depressing it. The rushing water
	makes an ugly sound. Fran looks down at her stomach thinking of
	her pregnancy.

574	Stephen steps out of the unfinished framework. Peter is gazing
	down the corridor at the pile of corpses.

	Peter:	THIS PLACE IS GONNA BE ROTTEN...WE GOTTA
			CLEAN UP, BROTHER.

	Flies buzz about the staring faces of the dead things on the
	balcony.

575	Peter's hands are on the round hatch wheel of an enormous safe.

	Peter:	THEY'RE USUALLY ON A TIMER...OPEN AT
			NINE...LOCKED AT FOUR...KEEPS THE BANKERS HONEST.

	The wheel spins and Peter swings the giant door open.

576	Inside is a huge safety deposit vault of a bank. The men stand
	for a moment in awe. The clean walls are lined with drawers and
	doors where depositors have stored their valuables. At one end
	of the room there are stacks and stacks of paper bills. The men
	approach the piles of money, stooping down.

	They each pick up packets of bills and flip through the edges...

	Peter stuffs several packets into his knapsack. Steve looks at
	him quizzically.

	Peter:	YOU NEVER KNOW, BROTHER.

	Steve takes several stacks and stuffs them into his kit. He
	looks about the enormous vault.

	Steve:	DON'T YA WONDER WHAT THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS ARE GONNA
			THINK...GUYS IN THE FUTURE...DIGGIN' THE PLACE
			UP. IMAGINE ALL THE STUFF IN THESE BOXES...
			JEWELLERY...MAYBE THEY'LL FIGURE IT'S ALL SOME
			KIND OF OFFERING TO THE GODS...LIKE IN THE
			PYRAMIDS...A BURIAL CHAMBER.

	Peter:	THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS, NOW.....

577	We see the men wheeling gardening carts piled with corpses. The
	sombre image is shocking as the figures move in silhouette
	against the bright store fronts with their displays of goods
	designed to attract shoppers to the sweet life the items
	pretend to represent.

578	At the bank, Peter wheels a cart with several dead Zombies
	through the lobby.

579	In the vault, the big Trooper dumps bodies out on top of
	several others, already deposited. The corpses lie askew, their
	arms and legs protruding. The stacks of money are upset by the
	limp action of the bodies as they roll around.

580	A finger flips a switch and we hear the mall music start up
	slowly.

581	We see a montage: Fran, Stephen and Peter walk slowly through
	the conquered building. They drift in and out of stores picking
	up various items. They use shopping carts.

582	Fran rummages idly through the cosmetic department.

583	Peter looks through a book store.

584	Stephen plays the pinball machines in a huge game room.

585	Peter tries on big colourful hats in front if a mirror.

586	Fran trims Stephen's hair as he sits in the mechanical chair of
	the mall Barber Shop.

587	Fran feeds the animals in the Pet Store, then with a bag of seed,
	she feeds the Tropical Birds in the tall cage out on the
	concourse. The birds flutter, flap about, screeching loudly.

588	Now the group walk along the upper balcony. They look down.
	They still have their weapons and kits, Peter is wearing a wide
	brimmed hat and Fran sports a new mink coat.

589	The concourse is empty now of corpses, but the group can hear
	the moaning and thumping at the main entrances. It is dark
	outside, the creatures claw at the doors but cannot be seen in
	the shadows under the big trailer trucks. The sound evidences
	their presence, however.

590	The people stand at the balcony railing overlooking their realm.

	Fran:	THEY'RE STILL HERE.

	Steve:	THEY'RE AFTER US...THEY KNOW WE'RE IN HERE.

	Peter:	THEY'RE AFTER THE PLACE...THEY DON'T KNOW
			WHY...THEY JUST REMEMBER...REMEMBER THAT
			THEY WANNA BE IN HERE!

	The noise at the entrance continues eerily. Fran starts to be
	afraid.

	Fran:	WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY?

	Peter:	THEY'RE US, THAT'S ALL. THERE'S NO MORE
			ROOM IN HELL.

	Steve:	WHAT?

	Peter:	SOMETHIN' MY GRANDADDY USED TO TELL US...YOU
			KNOW MACUMBA? VOODOO... GRANDADDY WAS A PRIEST
			IN TRINIDAD. USED TO TELL US...WHEN THERE'S NO
			MORE ROOM IN HELL...THE DEAD WILL WALK THE EARTH.

591	Roger is screaming wildly. He is sweating and his face looks
	sunken with an ashen colour. He thrashes about as Steve tries to
	hold him. His leg is swollen, almost all black. His arm, which
	was also bitten, is wrapped but oozing.

	Steve:	GET MORE VALIUM IN HIM...

	Fran fumbles with one of the hypodermics, but she drops the vial
	of serum and it shatters on the floor.

	Steve:	GET ANOTHER ONE...COME ON...

	Roger is throwing himself about wildly. Steve barely manages to
	hold on. Fran rushes into the other room.

592	The space is starting to look like living quarters. There is
	furniture. There are sectioned off areas with things still
	packed in cartons, but it is beginning to look like home.

593	The woman rushes to the medical supply area which is now more
	organised with little cabinets and a small refrigerator. She
	takes a new vial of serum from the freezer.

594	Downstairs, Peter is checking the covering at the floor base of
	the fake wall. He hears the violent screaming from above.

595	He climbs up a rope ladder in the ceiling, scrambles through the
	grill in the ceiling, enters the duct. Then he pulls up the
	ladder and closes the grill.

596	He crawls through the tight space for a few feet, and drops out
	of another grill into the washroom.

597	He moves through the internal corridor and into the firestair. 

598	All the while, Roger's screaming can be heard. Peter tramps up
	the stairs several at a time.

599	He rushes through the living space in the direction of the
	screams.

600	Fran is withdrawing a hypodermic from Roger's good arm. The man
	still thrashes wildly. Steve is struggling to hold him. Peter
	rushes in and helps. Fran drifts out of the room.

	After a short time Roger relaxes somewhat.

	Peter:	(to Steve) GO ON...I'LL STAY WITH HIM.

	Steve leaves the area.

601	In the living spaces, Fran is sitting in a chair. It is the
	inflatable kind, which can be collapsed like a balloon. Steve
	comes up to her and puts his arms around her neck from behind.
	She cups his hands with hers and holds them tightly. She stares
	off across the room.

602	Roger catches his breath and looks up at Peter. He licks his
	lips and tries to speak coherently.

	Roger:	YOU...YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ME, RIGHT, PETER?
			YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ME...WHEN I GO...

	Peter:	I WILL.

	Roger:	I DON'T WANNA BE WALKIN' AROUND LIKE THAT PETER...
			NOT AFTER I GO...I DON'T WANNA BE WALKIN' AROUND
			LIKE THAT...

	The man's eyes are terrified. He looks this way and that at the
	walls, the ceiling, at Peter...He can't focus...

	Roger:	PETER? PETER?

	Peter:	I'M HERE, TROOPER.

	Roger:	YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ME...I KNOW YOU WILL...

	Peter:	I WILL.

	Roger:	PETER?

	Peter:	YEAH, BROTHER.

	Roger:	PETER, DON'T DO IT...TIL YOUR SURE...SURE I'M COMIN'
			BACK...DON'T DO IT TIL YOU'RE SURE...I MIGHT NOT
			COME BACK, PETER...I'M GONNA TRY NOT TO...I'M
			GONNA TRY...NOT TO COME BACK...

603	Later, the moon shines down through the skylight in the living
	area. A sturdy ladder has now replaced the pyramid of cartons
	up to the open hatch.

604	Stephen fiddles with the television. There is a faint signal
	coming in. He has the set wired to a makeshift antenna which
	stretches through the skylight. A table lamp sits on a small
	end table and is lit. Its cable is patched into a network of
	wiring which stretches about the room.

605	Fran is unpacking things. She is stacking dishes and silverware.
	It is a very orderly scene. The couple looks like a pair of
	newlyweds who have just moved into a new house.

606	On the television, two men are talking, a commentator and an
	official of the Government. The Scientist is in a suit, but his
	tie is rumpled and his collar open. He has not shaved and he
	seems very tired and nervously upset.

	Scientist:   I'VE GOT TO...BE CAREFUL WITH WORDS HERE...WE
			HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO STUDY THEIR HABITS...WE'VE
			REPEATEDLY ASKED FOR A LIVE CAPTURE SO WE CAN HAVE
			CONTROLLED STUDY...WE NEED SUPPLY AND DEMAND
			RATIOS.

	Comm.:	YOU MEAN...THEIR NEED VERSUS...

	Scientist:   VERSUS THE AMOUNT OF FOOD AVAILABLE. LETS BE BLUNT.

	There is a commotion in the TV studio. We hear noises and
	shouting, as we did J.A.S. earlier.

607	Steve:	JESUS CHRIST.

	He squats near the set, staring. Fran comes up behind him.

608	Scientist:   PROJECT OUT THEIR RATE OF GROWTH...THERE'S A
			CRITICAL BALANCE...AND IT'S THE WASTE THAT KILLS
			US. LITERALLY...THEY USE...THEY USE MAYBE FIVE
			PERCENT OF THE FOOD AVAILABLE ON THE HUMAN
			BODY...AND THEN THE BODY IS USUALLY INTACT ENOUGH
			TO BE MOBILE WHEN IT REVIVES. THERE'S AN ECOLOGICAL
			IMBALANCE AND THEY'RE INCAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING...

	Comm.:	WHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING?

	Scientist:   WE HAVE TO BE UNEMOTIONAL...WE HAVE TO PROVIDE
			COUNTER MEASURES OR WE'RE ALL...

	Comm.:	COUNTER MEASURES?

	Scientist:   THEY CAN'T CONTROL THE RATE OF GROWTH AND CON-
			SUMPTION...WE HAVE TO CONTROL IT FOR THEM!

	Comm.:	YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT WE HELP THEM?

	Scientist:   BY HELPING THEM IN THIS CASE WE SAVE OURSELVES...

	A great outcry is heard in the studio. The camera bobbles
	around. The scientist is fumbling for words.

609	Stephen:	GOOD GOD.

610	In the other room, Peter sits against a wall. He can hear the
	television. His eyes stare straight ahead at something.

	Scientist:   I'M PROPOSING THAT CERTAIN...NECESSARY MEASURES
			BE PUT INTO EFFECT AT ONCE...MEASURES APPLYING TO
			ALL OFFICIAL SEARCH AND DESTROY UNITS, WHILE
			THEY'RE STILL OPERATIVE...HOSPITALS...RESCUE
			STATIONS...AND ANY...PRIVATE CITIZENS...

	The camera pulls off Peter's face. We see that his rifle is
	stretched across his lap. The TV drones on from the other room.

	Scientist:   IN CO-OPERATION WITH THE MOBILE UNITS OF THE O.B.P.
			THE CORPSES OF THE RECENTLY DEAD SHOULD BE
			DELIVERED OVER TO THE AUTHORITIES FOR COLLECTION
			IN REFRIGERATED VANS...THEY SHOULD BE DECAPITATED
			TO PREVENT REVIVAL...

	We see now what Peter is staring at. On the floor, twenty feet
	away lies the corpse of Roger. It's face is covered with a
	blanket. It lies very still.

	Scientist:   THIS COLLECTION...THIS COLLECTION...

	The man's voice is heard almost shouting over the voices from
	the studio. The angry staff protests vigorously, with
	emotional language...

	Scientist:   THIS COLLECTION COULD BE...STORED...RATIONED...
			FOR DISTRIBUTION AMONG THE INFECTED SOCIETY...

	The shouts of anger continue.

			IN AN ATTEMPT...IN AN ATTEMPT TO CURB THE SENSELESS
			SLAUGHTER...THE SENSELESS SLAUGHTER OF OUR OWN
			SOCIETY...

	Suddenly the dead Roger's foot seems to move under the blanket.
	Peter's eyes pick up the movement immediately. His hands
	tighten on his weapon.

	Scientist:   THE DISSECTION...THE DISSECTION OF THE CORPSES CAN
			BE CARRIED OUT...CARRIED OUT WITH RESPECT FOR THE
			DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN BODY...

	Roger's arms seem to move, in slight twitching motions...

			THE HEADS...THE HEADS AND THE ...SKELETONS...
			WHENEVER POSSIBLE...COULD BE IDENTIFIED AND...
			AND BURIED IN CONSECRATED GROUNDS...

	The commotion in the studio reaches a fever pitch.

	From the movement beneath, the blanket starts to creep down off
	Roger's face. Peter stares with fascination and disbelief.
	The blanket clears the blankly staring eyes...the drooling
	mouth...Roger tries to sit up/ Peter's hands click a shell into
	his super-gun.

	Suddenly, the corpse sits up. It stares at Peter, blankly at
	first, then with purpose...it starts to move towards the Trooper
	who calmly raises his weapon...

611	On the TV, the commotion still rages. Stephen and Fran stare at
	the tube, hardly believing what they see. The scientist is
	shouting above the din. He is nervous. He wipes his brow with
	his sleeve...

	Scientist:   WE'VE GOT TO REMAIN UNEMOTIONAL...UNEMOTIONAL...
			RATIONAL...LOGICAL...TACTICAL! TACTICAL!

612	Steve:	THEY'RE CRAZY...THEY'RE CRAZY...

	Fran:	IT'S REALLY...ALL OVER, ISN'T IT...

	BLAM! The loud roar of Peter's gun from the next room. Fran
	startles and falls into Stephen's arms.

613	Roger's corpse is dumped on top of the stack of bodies in the
	Bank vault. His eyes stare with a puzzled expression. The arms
	and legs of the other bodies make the room look like a
	Renaissance Painting of hell itself. There is the familiar
	gunshot wound in Roger's forehead.

	The heavy door of the vault closes with a metallic slam which
	echoes through out the mall.

614	A small puppy lifts its leg and urinates on a table.

	Fran:	ADAM! NO NO!

	The woman's hands reach into frame and grab the little animal.
	She carries it through the room and drops it on some papers laid
	out in an unused part of the storage area.

	Fran's stomach is big now, her pregnancy evident. She wipes her
	brow like an exhausted housewife, and shuffles back into the
	living area. She fumbles with the sheets on the double mattress
	which she and Steve obviously share. There is an end table near
	the bed, with a reading light. Books lie strewn around, along
	with magazines and half drunk cups of coffee.

615	In the sitting room, we see a scene which could be comfortable
	suburban. The furniture is neatly arranged. There is a small
	portable stove which operates on bottled gas, a refrigerator,
	and cabinets with dishes and silverware.

616	There is a modern calendar on the wall, which has three months
	crossed off. There are a variety of radio and TV units and a
	stereo record player. There are even decorations: paintings
	hung, knick knacks on the tables. The room almost looks like a
	wealthy man's den, with all the gadget-oriented affluence.

617	In the Department Store, Stephen wanders about. He fiddles with
	a new supersonic calculator and he looks at adult games.

618	On the roof, in the bright sun of early morning, Peter plays
	tennis against one of the shed walls. He's dressed in a new
	sweat suit with brightly coloured Addidas sneakers. He has a
	sleek new racquet, slamming phosphorescent balls with all his
	might. His face is set in what is almost anger. He attacks each
	shot with determination and emotion.

619	One of his shots misses the shed. The ball bounces and banks off
	the lip of the roof, then it tumbles over the edge.

620	In the parking lot below, the ball hits the pavement. It bounces
	several times, rolling off among the feet of the army of Zombies
	wandering this way and that through the area.

621	The creatures mob around the trucks at the main entrances. They
	moan and gurgle, clawing at the building. There seem to be
	hundreds of them, all different ages, sexes, shapes. Some
	clothed, some naked, some wounded, some almost untouched.

622	Now Fran, the pregnant housewife, is cooking supper.

623	The men play cards with hundred dollar bills in the living space.

624	The three sit around the dinner table, just finishing their
	supper. The TV set is on, but only grey snow fills the screen
	and the speaker hisses as it receives no signal.

	Fran:	THERE HASN'T BEEN A BROADCAST FOR THREE DAYS.
			WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT UP?

	Steve:	THEY MIGHT COME BACK ON.

	Fran angrily throws down her silverware and stomps over to the
	TV. She clicks it off. The woman returns to the table.

	Steve stands up and moves to the set. He clicks it back on.
	Peter watches the two sheepishly. It is a domestic scene. The
	group has become a family, with all the disadvantages of
	comfortable living, including the inability to communicate.  

	Fran:	WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO OURSELVES?

625	The thunderous roar of the helicopter engine. The machine is
	hovering over the roof of the mall.

626	Fran is at the controls. Steve sits in the passenger seat.

	Steve:	OK, NOW EASY...EASY...BRING 'ER DOWN...

627	The whirlybird starts down for the roof. It is somewhat
	unstable, but it eases down regularly.

628	In the cockpit, a flustered Fran manages to handle the controls.

	Steve:	EASY...STABILISE IT...THAT'S IT...

	The woman reacts efficiently. She handles the controls better as
	The chopper's runners are just about on the roofs surface.

	Steve:	THAT'S IT...THAT'S IT...YOU GOT IT!

629	The runners hit the roof surface and the chopper settles.

630	Fran throws her arms impulsively around Stephen's neck.

	Steve:	YOU DID IT...YOU DID IT, HON...YOU DID IT...

	The woman excitedly hugs and kisses Stephen with childish joy.
	She is bubbling.

631	Seen from a great distance, the helicopter atop the mall looks
	very small. Its engine dies and begins to whine.

632	A pair of binoculars is watching the action. The lenses pull
	away from a pair of beady eyes.

	Voice:	THEY MUST GET IN THROUGH THE ROOF.

	Voice:	SON OF A BITCH!

	Voice:	THERE'S TRUCKS BLOCKIN' ALL THE ENTRANCES.

	Voice:	NO SWEAT!

	Voice:	WHAT DO YA THINK? HIT 'EM NOW OR WAIT
			FOR TONIGHT?

	Voice:	TONIGHT.

633	We see the short wave radio speaker installed in the living
	space near the TV. A voice rattles over the unit:

	Voice:	WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE...SEEN THE WHIRLYBIRD
			ON THE ROOF.

634	Fran steps to the doorway attracted by the signal. Peter sits at
	the radio, not knowing whether to send. Steve listens.

	Voice:	HEY, ER...COULD YA USE SOME COMPANY IN THERE?

	Steve is about to say something. Peter stops him.

	Voice:	WE'RE JUST RIDIN' BY...WE COULD SURE USE
			SOME SUPPLIES...WHAT'S THE CHANCE US
			GETTIN' IN THERE TO STOCK UP?

	Peter listens intently, trying to read the voice's inflections.

	Voice:	HOW MANY OF YOU IN THERE, ANYWAY...THERE'S
			THREE OF US. COULDN'T YA USE THREE MORE GUNS?

	Peter:	RAIDERS.

	Fran:	WELL, THEY KNOW WE'RE HERE, MAYBE WE SHOULD...

	Peter:	(cutting her off)
			NO CHANCE.

	The little puppy scrambles up to Fran's feet, seeking attention.
	She picks the little dog up in her arms.

	Fran:	WELL, IF THERE'S ONLY THREE OF THEM...

	Peter:	WHO SAYS?

	There's a long silence. The radio sputters static. Voices are
	heard, but they aren't speaking into the microphone. They are
	obviously conferring among themselves. Steve starts to speak,
	Peter cuts him off.

	Peter:	SHHHH! QUIET!

	He is trying to hear the muffled conversation.

	Fran:	I THINK WE SHOULD...

	Peter:	JESUS CHRIST, SHUT UP AND LISTEN!

	More static. Slight laughter is heard. Steve looks into Peter's
	face. The bug trooper just stares at the speaker without moving.
	Finally, the voice again.

	Voice:	HEY...YOU IN THE MALL...YOU JUST FUCKED UP
			REAL BAD! WE DON'T LIKE PEOPLE WHO DON'T SHARE.

	Instantly Peter grabs his weapon and straps on his holster.

	Peter:	COME ON, MAN...GET IT UP.

635	Under the cover of darkness, a pair of hands stores a microphone
	on a portable radio unit. The radio is in a small van which is
	cluttered with junk. An arsenal of weapons is strewn about.

636	We see several men, and a few women, huddling inside the van.
	They look like banditos. One even wears a Mexican sombrero. The
	men are armed to the teeth, wearing ammunition belts criss-
	crossed on their chests. They are dirty and sloppily dressed in
	all sorts of surplus clothing.

637	Outside, in close-up shots, hands turn controls on big motor-
	cycles and feet stomp accelerators. The bikes roar, creating a
	thunderous sound. Clouds of dust and fumes rise into the air.

638	Peter and Stephen are running across the mall roof. The roar of
	the cycles can be heard in the distance.

639	Reaching the roof's edge, Peter stares off at the horizon, but
	sees nothing. The thunder draws nearer. Peter tries binoculars.

640	Through the lenses are vague shapes in the darkness. As the
	sound swells, we see the riders. Their powerful bikes come
	charging over a rise...two...then three more...three more...
	more...

	They are accompanied by two small vans. There are at least
	fifteen bikes. The sound is deafening.

641	Peter:	JUST THREE, HUH?

	Steve:	HOLY SHIT!

	Peter:	THEY'LL GET IN. THEY'LL MOVE THE TRUCKS.

	Steve:	THERE'S HUNDREDS OF THOSE CREATURES DOWN THERE.

	Peter:	COME ON, MAN. THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL ARMY.
			LOOKS LIKE THEY BEEN SURVIVIN' ON THE ROAD ALL
			THROUGH THIS THING...DAMN! HOW MANY OF THE
			STORES ARE OPEN?

	Steve:	I DUNNO...SEVERAL OF 'EM...

	Peter:	WELL LET'S NOT MAKE IT EASY FOR 'EM...COME ON!

642	The men charge down through the skylight. The roar of the
	convoy can now be heard in the living space.

	Fran is desperate. Steve rushes by her with Peter, who crashes
	on ahead through the door onto the firestairs.

	Fran:	WHAT'S HAPPENING?

	Steve:	THERE'S FIFTEEN OR TWENTY OF 'EM...
			WE'RE GONNA SHUT OFF THE GATES.

	Fran:	STEPHEN!

	Steve:	WE'RE JUST GONNA SHUT THE GATES.
			THEY'LL NEVER FIND US UP HERE.

	The man disappears through the stairway door. Fran drops the
	puppy which goes running after the men floppily.

	Fran thinks to chase the dog, but instead moves to the storage
	area and snatches her weapons. She starts to load her rifle.

643	Outside, the convoy makes a pass at one of the trucks. In the
	darkness the Zombies clutch at the fast bikes. The raiders
	fire their guns, dropping several of the creatures.

	The mob of creatures is impenetrable at first. The raiders
	leader signals the convoy to drop back across the parking lot.
	Some raiders have trouble keeping balance as Zombies claw them.

644	The lead bikes pull up on the other side of the lot.

	Raider:	 THEY'LL SPREAD OUT COMIN' AFTER US...
			THEN WE GO IN WITH THE VAN...

645	The other bikes ride to the leaders. A van pulls in and two
	bikers scramble aboard through the side doors. One of the women
	jumps into the driver's seat and revs the engine.

646	The Zombies are starting to move out after the convoy. The mob
	at the mall entrance is thinning somewhat.

647	In the mall, Peter drops from the grill in the exterior corridor.
	He charges out and into the Maintenance corridor, where he
	breaks for the mall proper. He is followed by Stephen.

	Peter:	(shouting)
			DOWNSTAIRS FIRST...

	Steve:	OK...

	Peter:	GOT YOUR TALK BOX?

	Steve:	YEAH.

	Peter:	KEEP IS HANDY.

648	Outside, the Raiders' van revs and roars towards the mall. The
	bikers stay at the other side of the lot, engines idling. Some
	of them whoop and holler like American Indians.

649	The van crashes through the advancing Zombies. Several of them
	are knocked flying. The vehicle pulls up to the truck cab. Three
	men pile out and scramble into the truck. The Zombies in the
	area clutch at the raiders, but they fight their way clear. The
	woman in the van revs the engine again. Zombies claw at her
	window. She squeals back to the main biker group.

650	The Zombies in the parking lot are approaching the ranks of
	motorcycles from a good distance. The raiders open fire. They,
	too, possess sophisticated weapons, the barrage sets up a great
	noise. Several creatures fall. The little van pulls up behind
	the bikes. The men still whoop and shout.

651	On the floor on the mall, Peter and Steve dash about slamming
	roll gates down on the open stores. They run desperately through
	the empty concourses. They hear the din from outside.

652	At the trailer cab, a raider fires point blank at the Zombies
	that claw at the passenger window. Another man checks cables.

	Raider:	 SHIT...IT'S STILL TAPED UP...IT'S ALL READY
			FOR US...

	The man sits at the wheel, revving the engine. Ghouls at
	windows.

653	Inside, the men hear the truck starting. Steve slams down the
	Pharmacy gate. Peter is already running to the Department
	Store. The big Trooper crashes up the escalator to the second
	floor aisles. Steve breaks for the open Hardware Store.

654	The huge trailer rolls away from the mall entrance. A shout of
	victory goes up from the raiders. The Zombies at the door do not
	yet enter the mall, their focus on the raiders now. From other
	entrances Zombies start converging on the parking lot.

655	Across the lot, the bikers rev their engines ready to make a run
	on the building. The raiders in the truck hop from the cab. They
	run to the doors, shooting Zombies at they move. Some creatures
	fall, others claw at the runners. One raider is brought down by
	the ghouls. His friends pay no attention.

656	One gunman slams into the mall doors to find they are locked.
	He levels his machine gun on the locks and rips open the
	mechanism. The men push through the doors. The little alarm
	units are knocked flying sending out a high pitched signal.

657	Peter is just slamming down the gates on the balcony when he
	hears the alarms go off.

658	One of the raiders hears the gates rumbling. He looks up and
	sees Peter running by the railing upstairs. He fires with his
	machine gun.

659	Peter dives, sliding across the balcony. The bullets miss him
	and he crawls around the balcony just out of sight from below.

660	Steve has just slammed down the Hardware Store gate, and makes a
	dash for the Department Store.

661	The raiders spot him as well, and open fire.

662	Steve runs zip-zag and dives into the big store, where he ducks
	into the shadows leaving the gate open.

663	Peter, at the balcony railing, levels his super-gun on the
	bikers.

664	One accurate shot fires and a raider falls with a giant wound in
	his chest.

665	The last raider at the doors ducks out of Peter's sight.

666	Steve now charges the roll gate and slams it shut on the store.

667	The bikers toward the building. Zombies scatter on the lot.

668	Just as the bikers are reaching the building, the raider inside
	rushes the doors. He holds them open as the big fleet of
	rumbling cycles comes screaming into the building.

669	Steve is in awe, watching from the Department Store grid.

670	The cycles pull down the concourse and Zombies lumber in after
	them. The raider at the door is grabbed by a Zombie. Then
	another. He manages to fight away.

671	Peter, shooting above, downs the raider and one of the ghouls.

672	The main band of bikers hear the gunfire and pull down a side
	concourse to regroup. They make their turn close to the
	Department Store and Steve backs into he shadows.

673	Peter moves down the balcony as Zombies are clamouring back to
	the big concourses. Peter's eyes are wide at the invasion.

674	Upstairs, Fran hears the noises. She is at the top of the
	firestair, weapons ready. On the landing below, the puppy
	scamper and barks. Fran calls the dog, but it doesn't listen.

675	The bikes arc around and several pull up to the Dept. Store.

	Raider:	 ALRIGHT...COUPLE OF YOU HOLD OFF THEM ZOMBIES...
			CHARLIE?...HIT THE GATES...WE GOTTA GET THAT
			SNIPER.

	The leader rolls out. Others follow. Peter fires and drops a
	raider, his bikes flying into the approaching Zombies.

676	The action is too fast and furious. Neither Peter or Steve can
	see the whole layout of the concourse.

677	The lead bikers pulls out of range behind a set of columns. A
	couple of bikers dismount and start up the stationary stairs.

678	Steve talks into his walkie talkie:

	Steve:	THEY'RE COMIN' UP, PETER...THEY'RE COMIN'
			UP THE STAIRS.

679	Peter moves to another spot on the balcony.

680	Suddenly the raiders at the Dept. Store door turn a machine
	gun on the roll gate locks. One flies open...another...

681	Steve runs into the store, about to charge up the escalator when
	he realises he'll be in the line of fire. he runs to the
	elevator, hits a button, and starts for the second floor.

682	Peter fires and drops one of the charging men on the balcony.
	The other takes cover. Just as Peter is changing position, the
	lights in the building blink out...the escalators stop... the
	power has gone off.

683	Upstairs, Fran is alone in total darkness. Below, she hears the
	puppy still barking. She starts carefully down the steps.

684	In the stuck elevator, Steve gropes and fumbles for his talk box.

	Steve:	PETER...PETER...

685	The big trooper charges through the darkness to the Maintenance
	corridor, ignoring the buzzing on his talk unit.

686	The raiders on the balcony approach quickly, ducking against the
	walls occasionally for cover.

687	The other bikers spill into the Dept. Store, raiding the
	counters and raping the displays. They throw things into sacks
	while others move to different stores and shoot off roll gate
	locks. They raid the arsenal in the Sporting Goods store.

688	The main pack of bandits are holding off the Zombies. The
	creatures charge with new vigour. Some raiders fall and the
	ghouls pounce on them, ripping flesh with teeth and hands.

689	The van pulls up outside the doors and two bikers ride out to
	it, loading supplies into it. The Zombies are everywhere, but
	the actions of the professional looters befuddle them.

690	Several creatures move onto the balcony. One Zombie pounces the
	raider Peter shot and tears at his body.

691	As remaining raiders appear at the mouth of the corridor, Peter
	opens fire, killing the lead raider with a clean shot in the
	heart. The man flies back over the railing, falling to the
	concourse below where Zombies attack it. The other raider falls
	back against the wall.

692	Peter dashes into the Maintenance Room and rushes to throw the
	emergency power switch.

693	The portable emergency light units blink on all over the mall.

694	Steve, who has crawled through the escape hatch of the elevator,
	suddenly feels the car move. He grabs onto the cables but his
	hands slip from grease and his rifle falls down and wedges
	between the wall of the shaft and the moving car.

	Suddenly, the car stops again, and Steve sees through the
	escape hatch as light spills in as the main elevator doors open.
	He thinks to jump down, but hears raiders below.

695	Two of the big, greasy bandits charge into the car. They whoop
	and shout as they see the open escape hatch.

696	Steve settles back out of sight against the wall.

697	Raider:	 COME ON, MAN...LET'S GO...

	The other raider whoops loudly and fires a barrage of bullets
	into the escape hatch.

698	The shells bang and clatter in the shaft and ricochet off the
	walls and gears. A shell nicks Stephen's arm, but he is silent.

699	Finally, the barrage stops. The raiders charge back to the
	store.

700	Other bandits battle with Zombies. The men crash through
	stores, collecting weapons, ammunition, tools, clothes, food.

701	Bikers shuttle goods out to the side doors of the van. The
	woman in the front seat is ready with giant pistols. Zombies
	try to pound their way in, but they cannot succeed.

702	In the mall, another biker drops to the Zombies. They pounce
	on him and start devouring his screaming body.

703	Several creatures now wander through the Department Store,
	having entered from the second storey gate. They move through
	aisles knocking against displays. One grabs a mannequin thinking
	it human, throws the dummy aside roughly.

704	The raider on the balcony is approached by several Zombies. He
	runs down the corridor to the Maintenance office. Peter is gone.
	Breaking into the various empty offices, the raider comes to the
	fake wall panel and assumes it goes nowhere. Then he hears the
	faint barking of the dog. He checks the panel again by running
	his hand along the edge.

	Suddenly a sound in the corridor and the raider turns. There
	are three ghouls coming. He fires and knocks off the ghouls one
	at a time and runs onto the balcony.

705	Bikes roar this way and that. It is a war zone.

706	The man is about to run downstairs when he hears a noise above.
	He spins and looks up. He sees Peter just too late.

707	The big Trooper, in an open ceiling grid, aims his super-gun
	squarely at the raider's head. The gun roars and the man flies.

708	Below, the raiders are starting to regroup. The bikes begin to
	peel out of the mall entrance one at a time.

709	Another raider is snatched off his machine by the Zombies.

710	The bikers toss a last bit of booty in the van and the woman
	driver gets ready to pull out. She lowers her window and fires
	point blank at the heads of the clutching creatures.

711	The last wave of raiders is at the first floor entrance. The
	Zombies are mobbing around the bikes outside. The men shoot and
	beat their way to the cycles. One man is brought down, but three
	manage to mount their cycles. The big bikes roar out.

712	Peter is crawling through the ductwork. Just as he opens a grid,
	he sees the last bike rolling across the concourse. He levels
	off with his scope.

713	He shoots one raider out of the saddle. Two others get out.

714	Regrouping in the lot, the band of twenty is now seven or eight.

715	One last cyclist revs his engine and roars through the
	concourse. He dodges several ghouls and heads for the entrance.
	He is the leader. The one who was on the radio. He whoops
	victorious just as he is about to drive through the doors.

716	Peter leans out of the grid work and settles the cross-hairs on
	the back of the riders head. He waits as the biker roars out
	onto the lot. The rider lets out one last victorious shout in
	the fresh air. Peter's scope is locked on the riders back and
	the super-gun roars. The biker is blown off his machine.

717	The bike flies into a pack of Zombies. Some fall back, but
	others advance on the rider. The man rolls over the cement,
	stops, not dead yet. He screams wildly as they move onto him.

718	The other bikers move off in the night and the engines fade
	away.

719	The puppy stops barking. Fran is tense in the darkness clutching
	her rifle. She stands on the now silent landing.

720	In the parking lot and main concourse the Zombies move freely.
	They fight over the remains of the corpses. They eat ravenously,
	the sounds of their feast the only thing in the area.

721	Peter peers down at the slaughter below from the ductwork.
	Suddenly he hears the beeper of his talk unit, hits the button.

	Steve:	PETER!

	Peter:	WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

	Steve:	IN THE ELEVATOR!

	Peter:	LISTEN, THOSE THINGS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE.
			CLIMB UP TOP...I'LL GET YOU OUT THE GRID ON
			THE SHAFT...I'M COMIN.

	Peter starts to crawl through the ducts.

722	Steve hits the second floor button and the car moves. He
	clamours up on the hand rail on the car. His hands reach up and
	grab the escape hatch pulling his head and shoulders out the
	opening. He kicks with his legs to force himself up when the car
	stops. He sees the grid in the shaft wall.

723	Suddenly, the car doors open on the second storey and abruptly
	several Zombies dart into the car. They claw at Steve's legs and
	pull him out of the hatch. He screams, thrashes violently.

724	In the duct, Peter hears the screams. He stops and listens for a
	moment. He backs away heading for the Maintenance corridor.

725	In the elevator, Steve thrashes with all his might. The ghouls
	try to pull him out of the car while the elevator doors open and
	close repeatedly against the creatures which block it.

	A Zombie bites Steve's arm, another bites his neck. The man
	scrambles to unholster his gun. Although he is bleeding
	profusely, he finally pulls his gun and fires...once...twice...

726	Peter is dropping out of the washroom duct. He hears the pistol
	shots and realises Steve is not dead. He thinks about climbing
	back in the grid, but stops. He punches at the wall violently.
	He is angry and confused.

727	Again the pistol roars and rips through a Zombie head, flying
	out of the elevator. The doors still slam against the last
	creature and Steve fires. The Zombie flies back and the doors
	finally close.

728	Outside, Zombies fall against the elevator doors.

729	Inside, Steve falls to the floor. His neck runs red. His eyes
	are wide with terror. He sits stupidly staring at the pistol in
	his hand. He finds it hard to breathe.

730	Peter appears at the bottom of the firestair. The puppy runs to
	meet him, tails wagging and yapping. He hangs his head as Fran
	looks down.

	Fran:	NO.....NO!

	She runs down the steps. The big Trooper catches her bodily as
	she is about to charge out into the hall.

	Peter:	I HEARD HIS GUN...MAYBE HE'S ALRIGHT...WE'LL
			WAIT...WE'LL JUST WAIT A WHILE...

731	The mall stands silent in the blue haze of impending dawn.

732	Zombies move through the building freely, walking the halls,
	lumbering through the stores.

733	Several creatures still pound and scratch the elevator doors.
	As they push each other, one creature inadvertently makes
	contact with the elevator call button.

	The doors glide open. Steve is standing, his blood dry now.
	His eyes are blank as he steps forward. The creatures step
	away seeing that he is no longer prey...he is among them now.

	The doors slam against Steve and open again. Steve lumbers into
	the store down the aisle. Other creatures drift away.

734	Upstairs, Fran is packing her sack slowly and ponderously. Her
	face is red from crying.

735	Peter stands at the stair top looking down at the landing.

736	Fran sets the sack down at the escape ladder leading to the
	roof. She deliberately goes to fill another sack.

737	On the mall balcony, Stephen's corpse walks to the Maintenance
	corridor. He looks past other wandering Zombies and sees the
	fake partition. Something in him remembers. He moves forward.

738	Fran:	IT'S ALMOST LIGHT...LET'S GO.

	Peter looks at her silently from the stairway door.

	Fran:	HE DOESN'T ANSWER THE RADIO...IT'S BEEN HOURS...

	She starts to cry again.

	Fran:	FOR GOD SAKE. YOU BETTER COME ON BECAUSE IF
			I GET TO THINKIN' ABOUT THIS, I'LL JUST GO ON
			DOWN THERE AND LET THEM...LET THEM...

	The puppy suddenly growls. It charges between Peter's feet and
	runs floppily down the steps.

739	In the hallway, Steve pounds at the fake wall. Other creatures
	notice and they all move toward the partition.

740	Upstairs, the pounding can be heard. Peter stands stoically,
	looking down into the darkness. The dog barks below.

	Fran:	WHAT IS IT?

	Peter:	IT'S STEPHEN...THEY'RE COMIN' UP!

741	With a great crunching noise the partition gives way from the
	army of creatures.

742	Peter slams the door. He speaks quietly.

	Peter:	GO ON...YOU GET OUT OF HERE.

	Fran:	PETER...

	Peter:	I SAID...GET OUT OF HERE.

	From the firestair, we hear the sudden yelping of the puppy as
	it falls victim to the creatures. The sound echoes through the
	barren spaces of the storage area.

	Fran:	OH, JESUS, PETER...PLEASE...

	Peter:	I DON'T WANT TO GO...I REALLY DON'T...
			YOU KNOW THAT? I REALLY DON'T.

743	Suddenly, the door flies open and the creatures lumber into the
	living space. Peter stares at them. He smiles slightly. The
	creatures advance, led by Stephen.

744	Fran starts to scream.

	Fran:	STEPHEN...STEPHEN...

	She makes a slight move for her lover, but Peter raises his
	super-gun and shoots the Zombie through the head.

	As Stephen falls, Fran comes up short. The act startles her into
	awareness. Peter faces her as the creatures come up behind him.

	Peter:	MOVE, WOMAN!

745	Fran grabs the sacks and climbs the ladder to the roof.

746	The creatures advance on Peter. He backs away, trying to lead
	them from the skylight. They crash through the living space,
	upsetting the carefully planned room.

747	On the roof, Fran desperately starts the helicopter engine.

748	Peter backs into the storage room, slamming the door. The
	creatures approach the door and the super-gun roars one last
	time. The Zombies push through the door and move in for their
	feast.

749	Several zombies manage to scramble up the skylight to the roof.

	Fran stares, transfixed. The blades roar up to full speed.

	The creatures advance toward the machine.

	Fran steps out onto the running board; the creatures very close
	now. She crouches, watching for a moment, then looks up at the
	spinning blades.

	She stands straight up, driving her head into the spinning
	blades.

	A headless form falls to the roof. The Zombies advance.

750	In a wide shot, silhouetted against the dawn sky, we see the
	creatures huddled under the chopper blades, feasting on their
	last victim.

	The credits crawl up.

	Just as the credits end...

	the engine of the helicopter sputters...

	and dies.

          FADE IN:

          1 NEW YORK CITY - PARK AVENUE - NIGHT - 1982 1
          A TAXI pulls over to a curb where an ELDERLY MAN waits with
          his MIDDLE-AGED SON in THE RAIN.

          MIDDLE-AGED SON
          (as they climb in)
          23rd and Lex.
          The CABBIE grunts a reply.

          MIDDLE-AGED SON (CONT'D)
          How ya doin', Papa, you doin'
          alright?

          ELDERLY MAN
          Fine, fine...

          MIDDLE-AGED SON
          This is just a check-up, okay?
          Doctor Katz says you'll outlive us
          all.
          (looks out the window)
          Traffic isn't bad. We should be
          back in time to watch the Mets.
          He notices his father is STARING, wide-eyed, at the cabby's
          HACK LICENSE. We glimpse only the last name..."Bielski."

          MIDDLE-AGED SON (CONT'D)
          Papa? .Papa, what is it?
          IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR, the old man catches the furtive
          eyes of the cabby.

          ELDERLY MAN
          ...You. Can it be?
          The eyes in the mirror look away. And then back.

          ELDERLY MAN (CONT'D)
          Bielski. Can it possibly be?
          As we PUSH IN on the eyes in the mirror, we HEAR THE

          DESPERATE RASPING SOUND OF PANTING.

          CUT TO:

          2 A MAN RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE THROUGH THE WOODS. 2
          Bombs EXPLODE all around as he passes dead bodies and BURNT-
          OUT VEHICLES. Without slowing he discards a WW II Red Army
          helmet, a field jacket, a heavy pack, anything that might
          impede his flight. He glances back up over his shoulder.
          The sky is filled with BOMBERS. He runs on.

          4 THE VILLAGE OF NALIBOKI 4
          A typical Eastern European shtetl. LOCAL POLICE help German
          Einsatzgruppen, mobile killing squads, round up Jews.
          PEASANTS beat them with sticks as they are herded into lines.
          One man tries to run and is beaten.
          Others look on, or look away with indifference as they are
          loaded onto waiting trucks.

          5 TWO MEN HIDE IN THE NEARBY WOODS (ZUS & ASAEL BIELSKI) 5
          We study their faces: a turbulent portrait of impotent rage,
          terrible fear, overwhelming grief, and secret relief.

          ASAEL
          Where are they taking them?

          ZUS
          --Shveig! Shveig!

          ASAEL

          BUT--

          ZUS
          Just shut up! Please...

          6 AN ALLEY WAY IN NOVAGRUDOK 6
          The man we last saw in flight (TUVIA BIELSKI) wearing the
          remnants of his uniform, slips down a cobble-stoned street.
          He ducks into a doorway as A PATROL passes by.

          6A A REMOTE FARM 6A
          Zus and Asael move warily through a barnyard. A tethered
          dog BARKS furiously. A farmer challenges them.

          WALENCKI
          (in Russian; subtitles)

          WHAT DO YOU WANT?
          Walencki brandishes a pitchfork.

          ASAEL
          (in Russian; subtitles)
          Some food...?

          WALENCKI
          They are looking for you people.
          The two brothers glance nervously around.

          WALENCKI (CONT'D)
          Get away from here! GO!
          ZUS, the older of the two brothers, takes a menacing step
          toward the farmer but his younger brother holds him back.

          ASAEL
          Zus. Let's go.
          As they retreat toward the woods, Zus warns the farmer.

          ZUS
          We'll be back.

          7 A BOURGEOIS APARTMENT -- DAY 7
          Tuvia is getting dressed as AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN -- his wife,
          RIFKA -- stands by the window, smoking a cigarette.

          TUVIA
          And no news of my brothers?

          RIFKA
          They are used to trouble, they'll
          be all right.

          TUVIA
          If you stay, you'll have to go to
          the ghetto.

          RIFKA
          I can get false papers and pass as
          a gentile. So can you.
          Tuvia shakes his head, no. He finishes dressing. Theirs
          is a relationship long past passion.

          RIFKA (CONT'D)
          Will you at least stay tonight?

          TUVIA
          I need to see to my family. Will
          you come?

          RIFKA
          To the country? No.

          CUT TO:

          8 A MODEST MILL - LATER THAT DAY 8
          A PAIR OF LEGS lie motionless behind a trough. Beyond, A
          MAN'S TORSO. Zus and Asael stare in mute horror.

          ASAEL
          Papa-- Gottenyu...
          Flies buzz about dead LIVESTOCK. A WOMAN'S BODY lies nearby.

          9 IN THE HOUSE 9
          A still portrait of a life interrupted.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          
           DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 4.

          9 CONTINUED: 9
          A table set for dinner. Candles lit. An open book. A
          NOISE from a cupboard. Zus grabs a hatchet.
          From the root cellar, a YOUNG BOY, 14, appears. His face
          is dirty and tear-streaked. They go to embrace him.

          ASAEL
          Aron.
          The boy (ARON) recoils. He is disoriented and WILL NOT

          SPEAK.

          9A EXT. MODEST MILL - MOMENTS LATER 9A

          Loaded down with possessions, Asael hurries back to the
          woods. Zus pauses long enough to pry the mezuzah from the
          door.

          CUT TO:

          10 THE FOREST AT DUSK 10
          Aron stares mutely straight ahead. Asael is shaking
          uncontrollably and crying. Zus is at a loss what to do.

          ZUS

          But Asael is lost in a confusion of grief and panic.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          Stop it. STOP IT!
          Finally Zus grabs him in a gesture halfway between violence
          and comfort...and holds him as Asael rocks back and forth.

          11 THE NALIBOKI FOREST AT DAWN - VIEWED FROM ABOVE 11
          A million acres of dense, impenetrable woods and swamps.

          12 ASAEL AND ARON SLEEP HUDDLED ON THE GROUND 12
          The sound of a FOOTSTEP. They sit up in terror.

          TUVIA
          If I was a German you are dead.

          ASAEL
          Tuvia!
          Asael leaps up to embrace him as if he were salvation itself.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          Papa and Mama. They killed them.

          Asael clings to him. Even Aron allows himself to be held.
          Tuvia hold them silently. Zus appears, hatchet in hand.

          ZUS
          Big brother returns.
          Tuvia and Zus look at each other warily.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          You saw them?
          Yes. Tuvia saw them. Zus takes the mezuzah from his pocket,
          tosses it to Tuvia.

          Are you going back to the army?

          TUVIA
          There is no more army.
          Asael worships his big brother.

          ZUS
          Hope at least you killed a few.
          Tuvia just stares at him.

          ASAEL
          What is it like? To be in a war?

          TUVIA
          It wasn't war. It was something
          else.
          Zus eyes him carefully.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Where is Sonia and the baby?

          ZUS
          Horodysze. Hiding in a cellar.
          I'll bring her when it is safe.
          Where is Rifka?

          TUVIA
          In Novgrudok. She wouldn't leave.

          ZUS
          You are still separated?

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          So why exactly have you come back?
          Tuvia just stares at him. The reason is obvious as he holds
          his younger brothers.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          You have a plan?

          TUVIA
          Is there anything left to eat?
          Only a few potatoes in Asael's bag. WORMS writhe among
          them.

          ASAEL
          Zus finished the last of the sausage.
          Tuvia glares at Zus, who glares back. Sibling rivals.

          ZUS
          Stankowicz' farm is closest.

          ASAEL
          He has dogs.

          A moment of decision. Who holds the balance of power?

          We know these woods. They'll never

          The farmer (WALENCKI) who threatened them with the pitchfork
          sits eating a simple dinner.
          Zus and Tuvia burst in. Zus brandishes a hoe.

          Where is your gun, farmer?

          WALENCKI
          I have no gun.

          Zus dumps the remains of the farmer's dinner onto him.

          The farmer knows Zus won't hesitate.

          WALENCKI

          Zus kicks the man aside. Above the stove is an old rifle.

          18 ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST 18
          Aron has been left alone. He holds a STICK which he "shoots"
          like a gun -- kachew -- as he creeps from tree to tree.
          Aron freezes. SOMETHING is moving in the trees. He
          crouches. A dark blur. An animal? It moves off. He follows.
          The shape appears again. It's a SMALL GIRL, roughly Aron's
          age. Aron waves at her. The girl stares, then runs off.
          Aron hurries after her into a wooded grove, then stops short.

          A PILE OF NAKED CORPSES.
          Overflows a newly-dug trench. The small girl runs to A
          MIDDLE-AGED MAN with a crude Star-of-David sewn to his
          tattered coat. He holds an OLDER GIRL, 14, in his arms.
          Nearby, three or four OTHERS emerge from hiding. Starved,
          in tatters, the living waiting to die.

          Tuvia imitates his father's criticism of Zus. Asael laughs.
          Zus can't help but laugh as well. Even in grief there is
          laughter. A glimpse of ties that bind them.

          ASAEL
          I can't believe Papa's dead.

          Bernicki.

          Koscik has a pistol. He showed it
          to me once.

          One pistol isn't enough. We need
          rifles. Machine guns.

          Machine guns? You're going to take
          on the whole German army?

          The SOUND of footsteps. Zus jumps up cocking the rifle.
          ARON emerges from the trees. And then, behind him, THE
          SURVIVORS he discovered among the corpses.
          THE MIDDLE-AGED MAN holds a teenage GIRL by one hand and
          carries his younger daughter.

          MIDDLE-AGED MAN
          The child is hurt.
          The brothers stare at him. Wary and unwelcoming.

          TUVIA
          Set her down.
          The man lowers the child to the ground. She isn't moving.

          He cannot bring himself to say the words. OTHERS shuffle
          forward, still in shock, barely able to speak their gratitude
          as Tuvia offers chunks of bread and cheese. The man tries
          to feed his daughter. She is barely alive.
          Asael turns to Aron. Gently.

          ASAEL
          Where did you find them?
          Aron still won't speak. Asael addresses the other girl.

          KOSCIK
          You people. Why is it so fucking
          hard to be friends with a Jew?
          They embrace.

          TUVIA
          Imagine being one.

          Tuvia leads them. He notices an OLD MAN staring at him.

          OLD MAN
          You sat in back.
          Tuvia just looks at him.

          OLD MAN (CONT'D)
          In school. I am Shimon H'aretz.

          TUVIA
          I thought you were dead.

          SHIMON
          I am at least half-dead.
          (after a moment)
          I heard them speaking of your
          parents. I am very sorry.
          Tuvia shakes his head.

          SHIMON (CONT'D)
          And the other brothers? What was
          his name, the wild one?

          TUVIA
          Zus. He's with the other two.

          SHIMON
          You are hiding here? In the forest?
          Tuvia nods.

          SHIMON (CONT'D)
          There has been trouble before maybe?
          With the police?
          Tuvia doesn't answer.

          So now you go to the forest. A
          wise choice.

          TUVIA
          For a dumb schoolboy, you mean.

          SHIMON
          My whole life I presumed to teach
          others the right way to live. I
          had no doubt: this is God's way,
          this isn't. You'll forgive me if
          recent events have somewhat shaken
          my resolve.

          TUVIA
          It is just like school, I don't
          know what you're talking about.

          The new arrivals squat by a fire where potatoes are cooking
          in the ashes. Everyone shares from the soup pot. There
          aren't enough spoons to go around.
          Shimon offers Aron something to eat.

          SHIMON
          Here... You're not hungry?
          Aron doesn't respond.

          TUVIA, MEANWHILE
          stares fixedly as Avram digs his daughter's grave. The gun
          is still in his belt. Zus is constructing a shelter.

          ZUS
          I send you for food and you bring
          more mouths to feed.

          TUVIA

          Only four bullets.

          ZUS
          Then we'll have to make them count.
          Zus heads for the food. Asael is trying to start a fire
          but the kindling is wet.

          SHIMON
          Here...
          Shimon takes a book from his coat, rips out pages covered
          in Hebrew and crumples them into the fire. They burst into
          flame.

          SHIMON (CONT'D)
          The Psalms have many uses.

          ZUS SITS AMONG THE NEWCOMERS
          watching as they eat hungrily.
          Tuvia stops near Avram DIGGING a grave before heading out
          of the camp. We realize Avram's daughter has died while
          Tuvia was away. THE SOUND OF DISTANT THUNDER.

          34 INSIDE THE HOUSE 34
          The POLICE CAPTAIN we saw earlier eats dinner with his WIFE
          and TWO SONS. They speak in Russian.

          WIFE
          You worked late.
          The man nods, his mouth full of food.

          Tuvia stands on the threshold, dripping wet, a spectral
          figure. He holds the pistol at his side.

          TUVIA
          You know who I am?
          The policeman says nothing. His wife is instantly terrified.
          One of the SONS stands. Tuvia turns the gun on him.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Sit.
          The son obeys. The SOUND of the rain on the tin roof is
          deafening. Tuvia turns back to the Police Captain.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          And you know why I am here.

          POLICE CAPTAIN
          ...what are you talking about?

          You have no idea what I'm talking
          about...

          POLICE CAPTAIN
          If they say find someone, I find
          him. It's my job.

          To find Jews.

          POLICE CAPTAIN
          Or lose my job.

          TUVIA
          And it's a good job, isn't it? You
          like your job.

          POLICEMAN
          I was always fair with your family.

          SHOOTS him in the chest. His mother SCREAMS. The Policeman
          suddenly starts to stand. Tuvia backs away, shoots him.

          Kill me, too!
          Tuvia should indeed kill her, too. To avoid being

          Zus awakens, sodden and stiff. He looks at the group, now
          numbering fourteen. People sleep huddled together: Asael
          holds Aron; Avram keeps his surviving daughter close.
          And there is Tuvia -- sitting by the fire. Zus takes the
          pistol from Tuvia's belt. Checks the cylinder.

          ZUS
          Only one bullet left.

          name is Peretz, this is Jacov.

          Two days ago there were three
          thousand Jews in Horodyszcze. Now

          ASAEL
          (to the newcomers)
          His family.
          Tuvia puts his arms around his brother. Zus's shoulders
          begin to heave. Soon his body convulses with deep wracking
          sobs. He is absolutely unself-conscious in his grief.

          ZUS
          So many dead.

          TUVIA
          I know.

          ZUS
          Mama. Papa.
          Their heads are close together, their faces wet with tears.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          Why not us?

          TUVIA
          I don't know.

          ZUS
          I thought they'd be safe. I should
          have been with them.

          TUVIA
          No.

          ZUS
          I could have protected them.
          Tuvia just holds him. He, too, is crying quietly.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          Better to be rabbits? Hunted?
          Hiding? No...
          Zus breaks free of Tuvia's embrace and walks away.

          41 LATER - BY THE FIRE 41
          Jacov and Peretz are eating. Between ravenous bites--

          PERETZ
          We are looking for partisans.

          JACOV
          What is the name of your otriad?
          Tuvia laughs ruefully.

          ASAEL
          What is an 'otriad?'

          TUVIA
          An armed brigade.

          JACOV
          We heard the Russians are beginning
          to organize.

          JACOV
          And also in the Lipicanska.

          ASAEL
          Then we are the Bielski Otriad.
          You want to join?

          PERETZ
          (looks around)
          The Russians are fighters.

          JACOV
          --But you need a gun to join them.
          Without a gun you are nothing.
          They sabotage railroads and kill
          Germans.

          ZUS (O.S.)
          We will kill all the Germans you
          can handle. Starting tonight.
          They stare up at him, his face a mask of blood and filth.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          If you're not afraid to use that
          rifle.

          42 MOMENTS LATER - JUST OUTSIDE OF CAMP -- 42
          Zus is loading Wilencki's gun.

          TUVIA
          --we must get what we need without
          killing. We can't make more enemies--
          Zus concentrates on opening the breach.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          --It won't bring your family back
          to life. Or Mama. Or Papa.

          ZUS
          Blood for blood. You had your
          revenge.

          TUVIA
          And I can still see their faces.

          ZUS
          'Vengeance is mine.' Who said that?

          TUVIA
          So this is God's work you're doing,
          Zussie?

          ZUS
          No. Only YOU can play God. Save a
          few lives, take a few others...

          TUVIA
          We cannot become...like them.

          ZUS
          If only...
          (a hard look)
          Are you coming with us or not?

          TUVIA
          Us?

          ZUS
          Peretz and Jacov.

          (POINTEDLY)
          Asael, too.
          Tuvia looks over at Asael, who looks away.

          TUVIA
          (to Zus)
          You are making the decisions now?
          A stand-off. Zus stares back at him. The struggle for
          command has grown more obvious.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          We wait for dark.

          CUT TO:

          43 A BURNING TRUCK 43
          Lights up the night sky. A MAN comes running out of a
          tavern, the same man who loaded Jews onto trucks in an
          earlier scene.

          MAN
          My truck! WHO DID THIS TO MY TRUCK?
          Tuvia, Zus and the others appear out the shadows.

          TUVIA
          We did.

          The man stops short at the sight of their weapons.

          MAN
          Who are you?

          (REALIZING)
          You don't understand. They made me
          give them my truck...
          Zus FIRES. Jacov and Peretz follow suit. The man goes
          down. They throw his DEAD BODY onto the burning truck.

          CUT TO:

          43A A CLUSTER OF HOUSES - LATER THAT NIGHT 43A
          Zus and Peretz are backing out of an open doorway, FIRING
          BACK INSIDE AS THEY GO. From within, the sound of SCREAMS.

          ZUS

          THIS IS WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU

          COOPERATE WITH NAZI SCUM..!
          FACES appear furtively at the windows of nearby houses.
          Zus addresses the little neighborhood, delirious with joy.

          ZUS (CONT'D)

          WE ARE THE BIELSKI OTRIAD! WE ARE

          JEWS! YOU LIKE TO KILL JEWS! HERE

          WE ARE! WE ARE THE BIELSKI'S!

          TELL THEM!
          Tuvia looks around warily. This is getting out of hand.

          CUT TO:

          44 A ROADSIDE DITCH - LATER THAT NIGHT 44
          Tuvia and Asael lie in on one side of a road. Tuvia has
          looped ONE END OF THE WIRE around a post.

          45 IN THE DITCH ON THE OTHER SIDE 45
          Zus, Peretz, and Jacov WRAP THE WIRE to a tree.

          46 UP AHEAD 46
          The lights of a MOTORCYCLE, a GERMAN COURIER.

          47 IN THE DITCH 47
          Tuvia waits until the BIKE is almost upon them. Then he
          TIGHTENS the WIRE so it stretches INVISIBLY ACROSS THE ROAD.

          

          

          

          
           GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 29.

          48 THE MOTORCYCLIST IS GARROTED 48
          by the wire. His bike goes sliding away as the Bielski's
          swarm him, KILLING HIM with the last bullet from the
          Mahkarov.
          ZUS rummages through the downed-bike's saddlebags. He finds
          a beautiful KNIFE and lifts it up triumphantly.

          PERETZ
          Look--!
          MORE HEADLIGHTS fast approaching.

          TUVIA
          Hide! Everyone!
          They all scramble back into the ditch, dragging the dead
          courier with them.

          49 A GERMAN STAFF CAR 49
          approaches. As its headlights pick up the downed motorcycle,
          it slows and pulls off to the side --

          50 DIRECTLY OVER THE DITCH 50
          Where Tuvia and Zus are concealed. From within the car, we
          hear VOICES SPEAKING GERMAN. A YOUNG PRIVATE gets out and
          walks up the road to investigate.

          PRIVATE
          (in German; subtitled)
          It's one of ours, but no one is
          here. Maybe he was drunk?
          From the car, an SERGEANT yells a reply.

          SERGEANT
          (in German; subtitled)
          Move it off the road before the
          convoy passes. I'll report the
          sonuvabitch.
          As the soldier drags the bike off the road, AN OFFICER steps
          out of the car and lights a cigarette.
          He's followed by the Sergeant. He carries a Schmeisser
          SUBMACHINE GUN dangling from his shoulder.

          51 IN THE DITCH - ZUS 51
          can see the Sergeant's feet peeking out over the ditch.

          A STREAM OF PISS
          Cascades onto him. He tries to inch his body away...

          51 CONTINUED: 51

          THE PISSING SERGEANT
          catches the flicker of MOVEMENT below, SEES Zus lying in
          the ditch. Stunned, he tries to zip up his fly. It catches.
          ZUS LEAPS UP brandishing the KNIFE. He's on the Sergeant
          before he can get the gun off his shoulder. Stabbing him
          through his greatcoat, the BLADE BREAKS OFF IN HIS HAND.
          MEANWHILE, THE LIEUTENANT drops his cigarette, reaching
          under his coat for a pistol. Tuvia TACKLES him. The GUN
          skids away. They roll around on the road, CLAWING, PUNCHING,
          BITING. Tuvia SLAMS the man's head against the pavement.

          52 UP THE ROAD 52
          The Private sees Asael and Peretz coming at him. Jacov
          follows with his rifle. The Private turns and runs down
          the road. They give chase.

          53 FROM INSIDE THE CAR 53
          Another OFFICER is in the back seat with A WOMAN. He reaches
          for his gun, stands up in the seat and begins FIRING WILDLY
          at Tuvia. TUVIA ROLLS UNDER THE CAR, avoiding the burst.
          MEANWHILE, ZUS USES THE HANDLE OF THE KNIFE to BREAK the
          Sergeant's nose. He RIPS the SCHMEISSER away, firing point-
          blank into the man, whose greatcoat CATCHES FIRE.

          INSIDE THE STAFF CAR
          The officer takes close aim at Tuvia, just as ZUS TURNS THE
          MACHINE GUN on the car BLOWING OUT THE WINDOWS, killing the
          Officer and the woman -- and saving his brother's life.

          54 MEANWHILE, DOWN THE ROAD 54
          Jacov fires at the Private, MISSES. The man keeps RUNNING.
          Jacov fires again. MISSES AGAIN.
          FINALLY his THIRD SHOT hits him in the leg. The Private
          keeps running. Limping now.

          JACOV
          I got him!
          Peretz and Asael can now catch up to the soldier.

          FROM FAR AWAY
          We SEE them knock the Private to the ground, KICKING him
          until Jacov catches up to them and FIRES A FINAL SHOT.

          

          

          

          
           GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 31.

          55 BACK AT THE STAFF CAR 55
          Tuvia stands, out of breath.

          TUVIA
          Stupid! The gunfire could be heard
          for miles.

          ZUS
          He was pissing on my head.
          Zus is high from the killing, covered in the dead man's
          blood. He begins calling out orders.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          Peretz, Jacov, check the car for
          guns...
          (to Tuvia)
          This one's yours.
          He presents him with the Schmeisser as if it were a trophy.
          Tuvia accepts it, checking the gun efficiently.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          I'll check his pockets for more
          ammo.

          TUVIA
          Hurry--!

          AT THE STAFF CAR
          Peretz and Jacov emerge with two MACHINE-PISTOLS, several
          BOTTLES OF SCHNAPPS and a beautiful LEICA CAMERA.

          JACOV
          They were on their way to a party!
          They toss one bottle to Zus and another to Tuvia.

          56 UP THE ROAD 56
          Asael stands over the dead Private. He isn't much older
          than Aron.

          57 BACK AT THE STAFF CAR 57
          ZUS rifles the pockets of the dead Sergeant for ammo. He
          finds cigarettes and the man's wallet. He opens it.

          ZUS
          Welcome to Belarus, herr Henkel.
          A CHAMPAGNE CORK POPS as Peretz and Jacov toast their
          victory.

          JACOV
          To the Bielski Otriad!

          58 SUDDENLY - ANOTHER SET OF HEADLIGHTS 58
          are rounding the bend. Troop trucks. The Staff Car was
          leading A CONVOY.

          TUVIA
          Into the fields! RUN!
          Tuvia pulls Peretz off the road, but Jacov reloads his rifle
          and begins to FIRE at the approaching trucks.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Jacov, NO!
          THE TRUCKS STOP. Troops pour off and begin RETURNING FIRE.
          Jacov is CUT DOWN by a MACHINE GUN.
          Peretz, Zus, and Tuvia race into the WHEAT FIELD. It's not
          clear if they can make it into the woods. A FLARE IGNITES
          OVERHEAD turning the wheat fields BRIGHT WHITE in flickering
          incandescence. Malbin is almost paralytic with fear.
          ASAEL doesn't know which way to run. He plunges into the
          WHEAT FIELD...but ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD.
          ONE OF THE TRUCKS drives forward, CUTTING HIM OFF, using
          its SPOTLIGHT to reveal him. FIFTEEN SOLDIERS start after
          him.

          59 SEEN FROM ABOVE 59
          We watch as they CONVERGE on him.

          TUVIA, ZUS AND PERETZ
          Have almost made it into the woods when PERETZ IS HIT. He
          falls. Tuvia and Zus pick him up and half-carry, half-drag
          him into the sanctuary of the forest.

          TUVIA
          Zus. His rifle.
          Zus races back to pick up Peretz's weapon.

          60 ASAEL, MEANWHILE 60
          has realized his mistake. He tries to circle back toward
          the woods but the SOLDIERS move to CUT HIM OFF. He is fast,
          but not fast enough. We realize he isn't going to make it.

          61 IN THE WOODS 61
          Tuvia and Zus look at the scene with mounting horror.

          TUVIA
          Asael...
          He rips the rifle from Zus's hands. For a moment we think
          he's going to go back after him. Instead, he wedges the
          rifle into a tree-trunk and takes careful aim...

          THE SPOTLIGHT SHATTERS
          Plunging the field into darkness as the flare burns out.
          ASAEL seizes the moment and dives to his knees, disappearing
          from view and CRAWLING NOW rather than expose himself.
          AN IRRIGATION DITCH is nearby. Frantically he DIGS into
          the soft mud on its banks. As he scrapes his hands raw, he
          can HEAR his pursuers drawing near, CALLING OUT to one
          another.

          CUT TO:

          62 THE FOREST CAMP - DAWN 62
          A somber mood. Tuvia watches someone scrape at the porridge
          congealed in an empty pot. OTHERS stare listlessly into
          space. ONE MAN chews on a piece of leather, ANOTHER sucks
          on an old chicken bone.
          Zus, meanwhile, is in the middle of a nasty drunk from the
          captured schnapps. Nearby, Aron shares his ration of bread
          with Rachel. Little enough, but a connection is made.
          Peretz lies nearby. Malbin is trying to comforts him.
          There is nothing that can help him. Malbin looks to Tuvia.

          SHIMON
          They thought you were bringing food.
          Tuvia just stares at him.

          SHIMON (CONT'D)
          Did the farmers stop you?
          Still no answer from Tuvia.

          SHIMON (CONT'D)
          They had guns? Dogs?

          TUVIA
          No.

          SHIMON
          I don't understand.
          Tuvia says nothing. Nearby, a child cries in hunger.

          SHIMON (CONT'D)
          The Talmud says if you save a life
          you must take responsibility for
          it.

          Again I have no idea what you are
          talking about.
          Around them, the beseeching eyes of so many hungry faces.

          SHIMON
          I think you do.

          VOICE
          You are the Bielski's?
          A MAN stands in the clearing. BEN ZION GULKOWITZ is tall,
          well muscled, a rifle strapped over his shoulder.

          ZUS
          How'd you get past the Lazar?

          BEN ZION
          Who?
          Zus stands unsteadily, then lurches into the woods, leaning
          on an occasional tree for support. He finds the erstwhile
          sentry --LAZAR -- ambling toward him.

          ZUS
          You shit! You worthless shit!
          Zus punches him, knocking him the ground. In a sloppy,
          drunken frenzy, Zus SLAPS him again.

          TUVIA
          Enough!

          ZUS
          He walked right by you! Someone
          could have been killed!
          Tuvia pulls Zus off him.

          If we were real partisans he'd be
          shot.

          ZUS
          MISTAKE! We cannot make mistakes!
          As Zus goes for Lazar again, Tuvia roughly PULLS HIM OFF.
          Zus goes flying, tripping over, landing on his ass.

          TUVIA
          That's right, Zus. No mistakes.
          Like last night.
          (looks at him)
          First they will torture Asael...and
          then they will hang him.
          Tuvia walks away, leaving his brother on the ground.

          63 BACK IN CAMP 63
          Tuvia rejoins them. Ben Zion looks up at him.

          BEN ZION
          You are Tuvia Bielski.

          TUVIA
          You know me?

          BEN ZION
          I am Ben Zion Gulkowitz.
          Ben Zion is besieged by questions about friends and family.

          MIRIAM
          Pardon me, you are from Vilna. My
          sister lives on Passaya Street.

          BEN ZION
          The SD came without warning.

          THE WOMAN begins to cry.

          MIRIAM
          My poor sister...dear God, no...
          Meanwhile, Peretz's MOANING ceases. A woman grumbles:

          WOMAN #1
          We'd be better off in the ghetto...

          TAMARA
          At least here we are safe.

          LOVA
          There at least we had hope...

          SHIMON
          No. Here, we have hope.
          A FEW MORE join in, grumbling their dissatisfaction. Others
          take the opposite position. These are Jews, after all, and
          arguing is a revered sport and a pastime. It escalates.

          WOMAN #1
          We are hungry!
          This is a defining moment for Tuvia. When at first he
          speaks, it is awkward, ineffectual amid the growing tumult.

          TUVIA
          I know we have no food. But
          tomorrow... tomorrow will be another
          mission.

          RONA
          Look what happened the last time.

          TUVIA
          That was a mistake! But the mistakes
          we made will not be made again!
          More objections. Tuvia must raise his voice to be heard.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          We could be here a long time. And
          we have to prepare.

          LOVA
          How?

          TUVIA
          Better security. Better at getting
          food and information--
          (talking over their

          OBJECTIONS)
          --at making shelters. Whatever is
          needed. We all participate. We
          don't work against each other.
          At this he looks directly at Zus. Daring him to object.

          Not right now. We cannot afford to
          lose friends like Jacov and Peretz.
          A small voice speaks up.

          ARON

          (trying to hold it

          TOGETHER)
          --cannot lose anyone.
          He looks from face to face. Filthy, ravaged, many of them
          with tears in their eyes. This is what they need --
          leadership, faith, something to believe in.
          And gradually, his tentativeness and awkwardness is replaced
          by something else. A new voice. From deep inside.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          ...We will map out where we've been
          so as to not visit the same farms
          too often. And we take only from
          those who can afford to give, and
          leave those who can't alone.

          LOVA
          The poorest farmer has more than
          us.

          TUVIA
          True. But what I am saying is...
          what I mean is... We are not thieves.
          (his resolve growing
          with every word)
          Or murderers. We may be hunted
          like animals but we will not become
          animals.
          (looks at them all)
          We have all chosen this -- to live
          free, like human beings, for as
          long as we can. Each day of freedom
          is an act of faith. And if we die
          trying to live, at least we die
          like human beings.
          His mission statement. A vision of their future.
          Everyone nods in mute acknowledgement. Zus lowers his head.
          The shift in power between them has occurred. Tuvia has
          emerged as the undisputed leader.

          Koscik's wife looks up from her garden and glares at them.

          Hello.
          She refuses to be flattered. In Russian:

          KOSCIK'S WIFE
          In the barn.

          67 IN THE BARN 67
          Zus calls out.

          ZUS
          Koscik, put your pants back on and
          leave those sheep alone.
          He steps into the shadows to find:

          KOSCIK HANGING FROM A THRESHING HOOK
          that has been driven through his chest. A sign attached to
          the hook reads (in Polish) "JEW LOVER."

          dug into a hillside. Overgrown with tall grass it is
          undetectable. Koscik's wife opens the heavy door, revealing
          ASAEL, who emerges blinking into the bright light.

          Two LOVELY YOUNG WOMEN -- BELLA and CHAYA -- emerge,
          tentative and scared. Though their dresses are dirty, it is
          obvious they were once expensive. Zus eyes them

          Aron and Rachel are walking through the woods. For a brief
          moment, viewed through the eyes of the young, we see these
          woods as a magical place. Strange mushrooms, gnarled roots,
          an enormous spider's web glistening with dew.

          72 THE CAMP HAS BEGUN TO SHOW PROGRESS 72
          Sentries are posted. Zus expertly helps with the building
          a bunker ("zemylanka"). There's a more permanent kitchen,
          a wash trough, a clothesline. Pinchas tends his goat.
          Though primitive and raw...a haven.

          SHIMON AND MALBIN ARE DIGGING A HOLE
          Their bickering will become for them, as time goes on, a
          sport and a pastime.

          You're trying to tell me all politics
          is meaningless.

          SHIMON
          In the West a monster with a little
          mustache, in the East a monster
          with a big mustache. This is all I
          need to know about politics.

          MALBIN
          Your messiah will have a mustache,
          too, and a full beard.

          SHIMON
          No. The messiahs are all in
          politics, and they're killing us.

          the villages, how the Germans patrol,

          He realizes that Asael is not fully concentrating; instead
          he is watching as Chaya walks past.

          So talk to her.

          ASAEL
          I hardly know her.

          We notice a FEW NEW FACES. Their number has exceeded twenty.
          Among them are two lumbering, dark-skinned men, ARKADY and
          MOTL LUBCZANSKI. Ben Zion is showing Lazar and the other
          newcomers how to clean a weapon.

          BEN ZION
          This is not a gun. It is Bar
          Kochba's spear. It is Ehud's sword.
          You fix the patch to the rod--
          They do as he instructs.

          --then run it through the barrel...
          and don't lose the patch in the

          ARKADY LUBCZANSKI whispers contemptuously to his brother,

          The village idiot.
          Zus shoves Arkady out of the way and approaches Lazar, who
          cowers. But rather than abuse him, Zus removes the patch
          from the rifle and hands it back to him.

          (a pleasant tone)
          Good morning, friend. Getting an
          early start to market? Could you
          possibly spare us a bit of milk?
          Zus' tone is belied by the rifle in his hand.

          KISSELY
          This is what I'm required to give
          the Germans. If I don't meet my
          quota they'll shoot me and my family.
          Zus is tempted to shoot him himself.

          Leave half. He can't go to the
          Germans empty-handed.

          ZUS
          Lazar, you can see it's us, you
          idiot. You only ask, 'who goes
          there' when you don't know who it

          ARKADY LUBCZANSKi approaches Chaya.

          ARKADY
          I don't think we've been properly
          introduced. Arkady Lubczanski.

          CHAYA
          Hello.

          ARKADY
          You are Chaya?

          CHAYA
          ...Yes.

          ARKADY
          You are getting along all right?
          Anything you need? An extra blanket?

          CHAYA
          Oh. Well... Yes, that would be
          nice.

          ARKADY
          You'll have it by tonight. Something
          nice and soft.
          (smiles at her)
          I couldn't help but notice you don't
          have a husband yet.

          CHAYA

          CHAYA
          No. But thank you for explaining
          it.
          She hurries away. Malbin sits down wearily beside Shimon.

          MALBIN
          Descartes at least provided for the
          subjective nature of experience.
          He takes a spoon from his sock.

          SHIMON
          Yes. You annoy me therefore I exist.

          MALBIN
          You are not eating?

          SHIMON
          By my best calculation, today is
          High Holiday. I am fasting.
          Malbin can't believe this. He rolls his eyes and digs in.
          One of the NEWCOMERS has brought a violin. He begins to
          play. A bittersweet melody. People stop talking and listen,
          eyes filling at this reminder of a sweeter, civilized time.
          Ben Zion has left the new arrivals and approached Tuvia.
          He looks grave. Tuvia immediately knows something is wrong.

          TUVIA
          What is it?

          BEN ZION
          The new ones, they are from
          Novagroduk. Your wife--
          Tuvia tenses. Ben Zion hesitates...

          BEN ZION (CONT'D)
          They say...She was killed last week.
          (at a loss)
          I'm sorry.
          Tuvia nods. No outward display of grief. An awkward moment.

          TUVIA
          Thank you for telling me.
          (changes the subject)
          We have to dig a trench around the
          new zemylanka. If it rains I'm
          afraid water will seep in.
          Tuvia clearly cannot deal with his news.

          BEN ZION
          I'll see to it, then.

          Cathedral light cuts through the trees forming visible
          shafts.

          ARON
          Jacob's ladders. Like in his dream.
          Asael says you can see the angels.
          They walk on, eventually coming upon RAILROAD TRACKS. A
          TRAIN is rounding the bend, headed in their direction.

          RACHEL
          Can we stay to watch?

          ARON
          If we hide.
          They move back into the trees as the train NEARS: a slow-
          moving engine pulling a line of WOODEN CATTLE CARS.

          RACHEL
          Is that a Nazi train?

          ARON
          If we had some dynamite we could
          blow the shit out of it.

          RACHEL
          (with undisguised

          AWE)
          ...Just like your brothers.
          Aron can't help but be pleased by this notion.
          Then, as the train passes, they can see HANDS gripping the
          small barred windows. And every now and then a gaunt,
          desperate FACE.
           They stare in astonishment.

          81A UNDER A SHELTER -- CONTINUOUS 81A
          Tuvia sits alone. Outside, the SOUND of the violin
          continues. Shimon comes to sit beside him.

          SHIMON
          I am sorry for your loss.
          Tuvia nods. He is deep inside himself.

          SHIMON (CONT'D)
          Do you want to say the Kaddish?
          When at last Tuvia speaks, it is almost to himself.

          TUVIA
          She was a beautiful woman. But
          cold. Not a day went by she didn't
          remind me I wasn't a good provider.
          For years it wasn't really a marriage
          at all. And now...
          He lowers his head. All Shimon can do is sit beside him.

          Bella takes Chaya aside.

          BELLA
          You have lipstick? Please, I know
          you have some left.
          Chaya digs in her pocket and produces a tiny remnant. Bella
          dabs it on and casually approaches Zus, who is on guard
          duty.

          BELLA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          May I join you?

          ZUS
          Of course.

          BELLA
          You get lonely out here?

          ZUS
          I like the woods.
          LAUGHTER and MUSIC waft through the trees.

          BELLA
          I'm a little scared out here.
          Zus knows an opportunity when he sees one. He offers her a
          drink from his bottle of vodka.

          Go ahead.
          She drinks, refuses to grimace. Drinks again. Zus laughs. -
          Bella touches the rifle in his arms.

          BELLA
          Why is there a rule against women
          having guns?

          ZUS
          There aren't enough for the men.

          BELLA
          Women need guns, too.

          ZUS
          What for?

          BELLA
          For protection.

          ZUS
          Women have men for protection.
          Bella bites her lip. She's a virgin but also realistic.

          BELLA
          I want protection.
          She steps closer and takes Zus's hand...under her coat...onto
          her breast...never taking her eyes off him.

          BELLA (CONT'D)
          You will take good care of me? You
          will be my commander.

          84 MEANWHILE - DEEP IN THE FOREST 84
          Aron and Rachel are walking back from the train tracks.
          Suddenly he senses movement, freezes:
          ARMED POLICEMEN are advancing through the trees.
          Aron and Rachel bury themselves beneath piles of leaves
          until the police pass by, then he grabs her hand and dashes

          OFF--
          ARON RUNS through the woods like a deer. She follows.

          He bursts in, SCREAMING.

          ARON

          MEN WITH GUNS!
          Chaos.
          People panic, search for family members, grab whatever they
          can carry,
          ZUS AND BELLA emerge from the woods where they have lain
          together for the first time. He grabs his rifle.
          TUVIA tries to maintain order.

          TUVIA

          ONLY FOOD AND GUNS! FOLLOW ASAEL!
          Asael clutches Chaya's hand. Rounding up others.

          ASAEL
          Don't panic. THIS WAY!. GO.

          ZUS

          QUIET! NOT ANOTHER WORD!!!
          THE POLICEMEN begin FIRING. TWO of the group are KILLED.
          Tuvia roughly pushes people deeper into the woods.

          TUVIA
          Lova, Ben Zion -- stay with us.
          Asael, keep them moving. Don't
          stop!
          THE POLICEMEN enter the camp. A submachine gun RAKES a
          shelter. KISSELY has found the escape trail into the woods.

          KISSELY
          This way--

          86 THE FOREST IS DEATHLY STILL 86
          Tuvia and Zus usher the group across the river and up the
          embankment.

          TUVIA
          Go! Go! Move!
          (holding back)
          Isaac, keep them moving! Zus, Asael,

          Tuvia motions for them to take defensive positions while
          the others escape.-
          The policemen emerge hurriedly through the trees and begin
          crossing the river.
          SHOTS rings out. A Policeman goes down. The German Soldier
          is shot in the leg. They are dragged from the water.

          Behind a tree, Tuvia is surprised by the mention of his
          name.

          TUVIA
          You are from Belarussia, pig! Why

          Soon it's a full-scale retreat.

          AFTER A MOMENT
          Tuvia, Zus, Lova & Ben Zion emerge. Zus picks up the dead

          What does that mean?

          It means -- we should have killed
          the fucking milkman. Your policy
          of diplomacy is shit.
          Zus is breathing hard, full of the adrenaline of battle.

          Zus and Bella walk side-by-side. Pinchas leads his goat.

          A primitive tent camp. RUSSIAN PARTISANS move about, quiet
          and cold-eyed men wearing remnants of Red Army uniforms.
          Zus can't help but be impressed by the array of weaponry.
          VICTOR PACHENKO emerges from a tent. A former lieutenant,
          dashing in a fur cap and long officer's coat. He addresses
          them in Russian.

          VIKTOR
          I am Viktor Panchenko, commander of
          the October otriad. We have had
          complaints of a Jewish gang stealing
          from villages loyal to us.
          (a steely look)
          How do you respond to these charges?

          TUVIA
          When you take food it is from loyal
          supporters. When we do, you call
          it stealing.

          VIKTOR
          We are soldiers.

          TUVIA
          And we fight a common enemy. The
          motherland doesn't distinguish
          between Jews and non-Jews.
          Viktor is amused by this bit of Soviet dogma.

          We are honored to be of service.
          Tuvia and Zus SALUTE and head back the way they came.

          92 THE NEW CAMP (CAMP #2) 92
          Tuvia and Malbin are working together on a new bunker.
          Malbin expertly nails a header across a doorway.

          (shakes his head)
          I haven't read a book in months.

          TUVIA
          I haven't read one in years.
          Malbin looks up from his work.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          I wasn't a very good student. You
          can ask Shimon.

          MALBIN
          .I did.
          Tuvia laughs ruefully. Considers him for a moment.

          MALBIN (CONT'D)
          Might I make an observation?
          Tuvia gestures, go ahead.

          MALBIN (CONT'D)
          We need to be strong, but--

          TUVIA
          ...But--?

          MALBIN
          Other things are important, too.

          Malbin tries to think how best to put it.

          Tuvia considers the word. As if trying it on for size.

          TUVIA
          You have more ideas? About all
          this?

          MALBIN

          Bloodsuckers.

          TUVIA
          They are people. Jews.

          ZUS
          Pretentious Jews. Jews who stuck
          up their noses and wouldn't give us
          the time of day when we passed them
          on the street. Jews who went out
          of their way to keep their daughters
          locked away from our dirty hands.

          You think your old teacher will

          You are the man of her dreams? The
          Romeo of Novagrudok?
          Zus can't take anymore. He charges Tuvia, who sidesteps
          and SLAMS him in the gut. All the frustration of the past
          months, not to mention years of sibling rivalry, translates
          into fists and elbows.
          Ben Zion moves to break it up. Tuvia and Zus turn on him.

          ZUS
          Is this your business?
          Zus gains the upper hand and starts to beat the crap put of
          Tuvia. Finally, in desperation Tuvia rolls away and picks
          up a rock. He is about to slam it into his brother's head
          when suddenly he stops himself.
          The two brothers look at each other, both breathing heavily --
          realizing that they have crossed some line.

          He looks at Asael.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          Are you coming?
          Asael looks at one brother, then the other. Once again, he
          is in the middle. He looks at Chaya, then back at Zus.

          ASAEL
          No.

          ZUS
          Good. I'll dance at your wedding.

          TUVIA

          alliances with the Russian Partisans.

          Look what we found running free.
          Must have belonged to an aristocrat.

          TUVIA
          My God, she's beautiful.
          (strokes her flanks)
          May I?
          He mounts her easily, urges her around the perimeter,
          greeting the new arrivals. Heads turn as he trots past.
          He is the center of attention, and he knows it. And likes
          it.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Friends, we are happy to see you
          safely among us. But there are
          many things you must learn about
          living here...
          All attention turns to him. The Lubczanski brothers grumble
          to each other, none too pleased with Tuvia's show-boating.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Once you are settled, you'll be
          assigned work duties. Everyone
          works, no exceptions.

          Of people being introduced to various tasks: shoemaking,
          sewing, cooking. Asael teaching them to use guns.

          TUVIA
          We will help supply the Russian
          Partisans by making clothes,
          repairing guns.

          101B BACK TO TUVIA ON HORSEBACK 101B
          Malbin catches his eye and winks -- clearly this has been
          part of their "strategy" discussions.

          TUVIA
          Women will learn to use weapons and
          fight alongside men.
          Tuvia takes a rifle from Asael and holds it aloft.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          This is not a gun. It is Bar
          Kochba's spear. It is Ehud's sword.
          You will all learn to protect
          yourselves.
          A LITTLE BOY holds Lilka's hand and looks up at Tuvia in
          wonder. He cuts an iconic figure.

           He is a Jew?
          Lilka is equally struck -- although there is something more
          than wonder in her regard. She nods.

          TUVU
          Pregnancies are forbidden. We cannot
          accommodate an infant's needs. Our
          bunkers are overcrowded so you will
          have to build new ones.
          He looks out over the sea of expectant faces.

          ...This is the one place in all of
          Belorussia where a Jew can be free.

          We will make again, here in this
          forest, the life that was taken
          from you. We welcome you into our
          community.

          when Riva stops him.

          RIVA
          You are Tuvia Bielski? You are
          really him?
          (Tuvia nods

          TENTATIVELY)
          You are a hero. A Maccabee.
          She vigorously shakes Tuvia's hand and walks away. Tuvia
          catches his reflection in the water. And likes it.

          102 THE CAMP AT DAWN - TO ESTABLISH 102

          102A IN AN UNDERGROUND BUNKER - DAWN 102A
          Lilka awakens to find TEN WOMEN wedged in beside her --
          back to front -- like spoons.
          Idly, she begins to ITCH her scalp. Then her leg. In the
          pale morning light she sees that she is crawling with lice.
          She SCREAMS. The women around her wake up, terrified.

          LILKA
          Get them off! Get them off me!

          CHAYA
          What? Where?

          LILKA

          EVERYWHERE! OH, MY GOD, OH, MY

          GOD...

          RIVA
          Lice need somewhere to sleep, too.
          The others LAUGH, but Lilka is on the verge of hysteria.
          She stumbles out, stepping on several others as she goes.

          102B OUTSIDE THE BUNKER 102B
          Crying, she tears at her clothes -- only to discover Tuvia
          and OTHERS staring at her with interest. She is mortified.

          102C LATER THAT DAY 102C
          THE WOMEN wash clothes in the stream. Lilka is by the
          riverbank, scrubbing furiously. Tamara works beside her.

          TAMARA
          You get rid of them quicker if you
          boil them.

          So modest...

          Oh, take me to that dream!

          RIVA
          I was dreaming of shoes...

          CHAYA
          Shoes, Riva?

          RIVA
          There was a man in a shop on Grudek
          street... and the way he caressed
          my feet when I tried on his shoes...
          Riva swoons. The women burst into ribald laughter. The
          SOUND of a horse. They look to the opposite bank where:
          TUVIA RIDES BY on his horse. Lilka can't help but stare.

          BELLA
          Doesn't take a fortune teller to
          know what Lilka's dreaming about...
           Lilka blushes furiously. The women laugh even louder.

          Zus falls over, startled. Gramov laughs. Partisan humor.

          Chaya is on kitchen detail with Tamara.

          TAMARA
          Yesterday, potatoes with beets,
          Today, beets with potatoes. Special
          treat tomorrow...potato soup. With
          beets.
          Not far away, Arkady and several others have created a
          primitive still -- turning potatoes into vodka.

          ARKADY
          We love potatoes, don't we, boys!
          Here, put some hair on your chest!
          They give Aron his first taste.

          NEARBY
          Bella is walking, arm in arm, with Asael.

          BELLA

          certain someone is waiting...for
          another certain someone to ask a
          certain question... Go on...
          She indicates Chaya by wiggling her eyebrows in her
          direction. Asael shakes his head but heads in that
          direction.

          104A NEARBY 104A
          Asael "happens" to bump into Chaya.

          I do.

          104B ANOTHER DAY 104B
          Asael and Chaya are getting married. A LIGHT SNOW is falling
          as they say repeat their vows as Shimon instructs. Their
          breath condenses in the cold.

          ASAEL
          Behold thou art consecrated unto me
          by this ring according to the Laws
          of Moses and Israel.
          But rather than a ring, Asael gives her a shiny new rifle.
          As the ceremony continues, we:

          104C INTERCUT: A TREE LINE OVERLOOKING A MUDDY ROAD 104C
          Zus, Ben Zion and several BIELSKI FIGHTERS hide alongside
          TEN RUSSIAN PARTISANS as a GERMAN TROOP TRUCK approaches.
          Pachenko watches as Zus follows the approaching truck through
          binoculars, then cocks the heavy machine gun.
          The truck SLOWS TO A CRAWL as it encounters an overturned
          PEASANT CART blocking the road.

          104D BACK TO THE WEDDING 104D
          As Asael kisses the bride, Tuvia is staring not at the
          newlyweds but rather at Lilka, who has washed and let down
          her hair. She glances up and meets his eye, then looks
          away.
          As Asael crushes the traditional glass underfoot:

          104E ZUS OPENS FIRE. 104E
          The driver SLUMPS over the wheel and the truck careens lazily
          off the road.
          GERMAN SOLDIERS spill out, blindly returning fire as Zus's
          fighters SWARM down the hill. Several are HIT right away.

          104F INTERCUT: THE GROWING ECSTASY OF THE WEDDING CELEBRATION 104F

          WITH THE FRENZY OF BATTLE.
          People dance and sing, their joy juxtaposed with the
          murderous intensity of the firefight, their twirling
          movements a cracked mirror of the death agonies of fighters
          of both sides as they are hit and fall.

          104F CONTINUED: 104F
          Some of the inexperienced Jewish fighters freeze, some fire
          their weapons blindly. Ben Zion does well. ZUS RUNS AMONG
          THEM, fiercely EXHORTING them to attack.

          ZUS
          Get up! Move! SHOOT OR I'LL SHOOT

          YOU...

          FROM A VANTAGE POINT IN THE ROCKS
          Viktor watches, heartened by Zus' natural aggression.
          GERMAN SOLDIERS TAKE COVER behind the overturned truck
          effectively RETURNING FIRE. Several partisans are KILLED.
          ZUS PULLS A POTATO MASHER GRENADE from his belt and RUNS AT
          THE TRUCK in a mad headlong assault.

          ZUS (CONT'D)

          ARRRRGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
          He ROLLS THE GRENADE under the truck and dives away as it
          EXPLODES. The remaining Germans RAISE THEIR HANDS.
          CHEERING PARTISANS leap into the truck, capturing an arsenal
          of rifles and ammo. THE JEWISH FIGHTERS join in the looting.
          Boots, coats, blankets, etc.
          Zus approaches the wounded and captured German prisoners,
          kneeling in surrender, hands behind their necks.
          Without hesitation, he shoots them, point-blank, one after
          another.
          VIKTOR approaches Zus, who salutes.

          VIKTOR
          You are related to Bielski?

          ZUS
          I am a Bielski, too.
          Viktor looks at him appraisingly.

          VIKTOR
          Indeed.
          He walks away. Zus has found a home.

          109 THE RUSSIAN WINTER (MONTAGE- MUSIC OVER) 109
          SNOW covers the camp. A driving wind. Bundled in scarves,
          overcoats and as many layers as they can wear, Bella and
          Chaya break ice in a pot. Tamara takes FROZEN LAUNDRY from
          a line.
          In a bunker, Malbin and Shimon shiver under a shared blanket.
          Women and children stare blankly into space.
          Riva unwraps rags from a man's foot and examines his toes,
          BLACK with frostbite.
          Asael and Tuvia are making their rounds. They pass Aron
          and Rachel who have built a snowman which they top off by
          adding a German helmet with a bullet hole in it.

          109A IN A STORAGE AREA 109A
          Asael shows Tuvia the last few potatoes.

          ASAEL
          There is talk of returning to the 
          ghetto.

          TUVIA
          Madness.

          ASAEL
          They've barely eaten in days. Even
          when our food missions manage to
          get through, there are armed patrols.
          Farmers who once helped us now guard
          their barns with shotguns.
          Tuvia considers for a moment.

          TUVIA
          Send out more missions. And bring
          shotguns.
          Tuvia sets off. In every face he passes, there's misery
          and accusation in the shivering bodies and trembling blue
          lips. Children stare at him with sunken, haunted eyes.

          109AA A MAKESHIFT STABLE 109AA
           Tuvia visits his beautiful horse. He unties him.

          Snow falling outside. Several partisans are singing. Zus
          is drinking heavily with Viktor; they take pinches of salt
          with each swallow. Viktor finishes a bottle, tosses it.

          VIKTOR
          Another dead soldier!
          Zus looks at him, bleary-eyed, confused. Viktor explains:

          More dead soldiers than empty
          bottles.

          ZUS
          (slurring his words)
          That is so...Russian.
          He cracks open another bottle and takes a big slug.

          VIKTOR
          At least you drink like one.

          ZUS
          'A Jew can't drink, a Jew can't
          fight.' What is it we are good at,
          Viktor? Dying. That is what we

          VIKTOR
          You compete with him.

          He competes with me.

          VIKTOR
          My older brother and I have the
          same relationship.

          ZUS
          He is a Big Shit also?

          VIKTOR
          A soldier.
          (a long moment)
          He was killed in the first hour of
          the German invasion.
          This sobers them up a bit.

          LILKA is shivering, her eyes inward and unfocused.

          LILKA
          Sorry, Tuvia. I was...thinking.
          It's nothing.
          He looks at her intently, knowing there's more.

          LILKA
          No. Today I go on my first food
          mission.
          Tuvia's order has consigned her to this dangerous duty.

          TUVIA
          I will have Asael send someone else.

          LILKA
          No. I must go now. I want to go.
          She is clearly scared but desperate not to show it. He
          reaches into his belt and hands her a revolver.

          TUVIA
          You know how to use this?
          She nods. Leaving, she passes the Lubczanski brothers, who
          are on their way in.

          MOTL LUBCZANSKI
          She is a tasty one, your aristocrat.

          TUVIA
          She is not my aristocrat.

          ARKADY LUBCZANSKI
          No? We were told, 'hands off,'
          property of the Commander.
          Tuvia just stares, daring him to continue.

          111 LATER THAT DAY 111
          Tuvia walks past the now-empty stable heading into the woods.
          A voice calls out of the misty snow.

          VOICE

          HALT! WHO GOES THERE--!

          TUVIA
          Lazar. I am coming from camp. The
          danger is from those coming to camp.

          LAZAR

          TUVIA
          No sign of the food mission?

          LAZAR
          Not yet.
          Tuvia looks anxiously into the deep woods.

          111A MEANWHILE - DEEP IN THE WOODS 111A
          Lilka and Shulman are walking backwards, retracing their
          steps to obscure their footprints in the drifting snow.

          SHULMAN
          We mustn't have any tracks leading
          back to base.
          He loads two sacks of food onto her shoulders.

          SHULMAN (CONT'D)
          Stay on this side of the creek until
          you reach the river then up the
          hill.
          (points the way)
          I'll wait here for the others.
          She nods and trudges on toward camp through waist-deep snow.

          112 BACK IN CAMP - OUTSIDE A MAKESHIFT INFIRMARY 112
          As they head toward a zemylanka, Riva is briefing Tuvia on
          the sick. Every now and then, he glances toward the woods.

          RIVA
          --several cases of pneumonia...
          Also I'm beginning to see signs of
          scurvy. No one's had a vegetable
          in weeks.

          LAZAR
          Tuvia!
          Lazar is dragging a WOUNDED MAN back into camp.

          RIVA 
          Bring him to the infirmary.
          Tuvia glances back toward the woods. Looks at his watch.

          RIVA (CONT'D)
          ...Shulman will look after her.
          He looks up. She looks at him sympathetically. Apparently
           his interest in Lilka isn' quite as secret as he imagines. 

          112A BACK TO THE WOODS 112A
          Exhausted, cold and alone, Lilka is becoming increasingly
          disoriented in a snowy landscape where every tree looks

          alike. She turns in a circle, trying to decide which way
          to go.
          A MANGY DOG appears out of nowhere, its coat matted, its
          ribs showing, a wild look in its eye. It GROWLS ferociously.

          LILKA

          But the dog, as ravenous as she, smells the food and won't
          back down. It inches forward, FOAMING at the mouth.
          Lilka tries to step back but the dog LUNGES, snapping its
          jaws. It's terrifying. She looks desperately for help.
          Suddenly the dog LEAPS at her. She turns away and it rips
          a sack from her shoulder, knocking her down. Viciously it
          begins tearing the sack apart in search of the food within.
          A SHOT RINGS OUT. The dog drops.
          Lilka holds the smoking gun in two hands. Grimly, she pockets
          the weapon, picks up the sack of food, and starts off.
          Reconsidering, she walks back and hoists the dead dog onto
          her shoulder, too. More food.

          112B IN THE INFIRMARY 112B
          Riva bandages Edjelman's head. Tuvia looks at all the sick.

          TUVIA
          What's wrong with them all?

          RIVA
          If it's typhus we're in trouble.
          The lice are carriers.

          ASAEL
          The partisans have ampicillin. But
          they say they need it for themselves.
          In the background Lilka enters, face scratched, blood smeared
          hands and arms -- like some kind of primitive huntress.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          (sees he is distracted)
          Tuvia...

          TUVIA
          Medicine for typhus. I heard you.
          I'll go see Viktor right away.
          On his way out, he passes Lilka, who is being looked after.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Are you all right?

          LILKA
          Fine.
          (handing him the gun)
          Thank you.
          Tuvia can clearly see that she is shaken -- but he has no
          time to ask more. He has to find out about the medicine.

          TUVIA
          I must go.

          for the troops in Stankiewcze and
          the machine guns out front.
          THE TENT FLAP OPENS. Tuvia enters. He has developed a cough.

          VIKTOR (CONT'D)
          Two Bielski's in one room! To what
          do we owe this honor?

          TUVIA
          We have sickness. I need ampicillin.

          VIKTOR
          This medicine is reserved for
          fighters.

          TUVIA
          If typhus breaks out in our camp,
          it may spread to yours.

          VIKTOR
          I will have to take that chance.
          Zus looks from one immovable force to the other.

          TUVIA
          I must insist. Comrade.

          VIKTOR
          You'd better not.
          Zus is watching this dick-measuring with keen interest.

          There would be medicine in the police
          headquarters at Stankiewcze, yes?

          Perhaps the Bielski otriad will

          transmitter.
          Viktor looks from Zus to Tuvia.

          Tuvia and Zus sit in the cab of an old truck, its exhaust
          sending plumes of condensation into the freezing night.

          ZUS
          Well...
          He looks into the back where the others wait, anxiously
          clutching their weapons. Tuvia tries to hold back a cough.

          Stay with the truck. And make sure
          it's in gear when we get back.

          I give the orders tonight.
          Across the square, the police station looms.

          You don't have to do this.

          A grim smile from Zus. Tuvia is broken up inside.

          ZUS
          I have been given this mission by
          my superior officer.
          He starts to get out the cab. Tuvia reaches into his pocket,
          takes out the mezuzah that once blessed their parents' home.

          TUVIA
          Zus...
          (hands him the mezuzah)
          For luck.
          Zuz pockets it and joins the others creeping into the
          shadows.
          But rather than follow them into the police station, we
          HOLD on Tuvia's face. Suddenly we HEAR The sound of gunfire.
          Then nothing. Ten seconds. More gunfire. Twenty. It is
          excruciating. Thirty. The longest CLOSE-UP in film history.

          Ben Zion bursts in and opens fire, killing two policemen.
          Krensky jumps the counter and smashes the transmitter.
          A policeman appears behind them on the stairs and shoots
          Krensky in the back. Ben Zion whirls and kills him.

          OPENS IT. STOPS. HE HAS PROMISED TO WAIT WITH THE TRUCK.
          Zus, meanwhile, rummages cabinets, looking for ampicillin.

          BEN ZION
          Let's GO!
          In the back room, Zus keeps rummaging. A window EXPLODES.
          Ben Zion is hit. Mortally wounded, he sinks to his knees,
          returning fire as Zus reappears.

          118 TUVIA WATCHES 118
          as Zus bursts out the door. He races to the truck and
          struggles into the passenger seat, BLEEDING FROM HIS

          SHOULDER.

          Zus lays his head back on the seat, closes his eyes.

          Tuvia emerges from his bunker. He is weaving a bit and his

          Whassa problem, Arkady?

          ARKADY
          Those who risk their lives to bring
          back food deserve a larger portion
          than those who risk nothing.

          ASAEL
          Everyone gets the same portion.

          ARKADY
          Not when you're serving, pisher. I

          Asael is astonished that Tuvia would go against him in public
          and embarrassed by his public drunkenness.

          ASAEL
          What consequences?
          Others are closely watching this test of Tuvia's authority.

          Fischer is with them. So is Levine.

          I had a perfectly good reason. He
          is a Jew.

          Anti-semitism is a violation of

          real food. Lazar calls out from the other line.

          I will piss on your head and you 
          will say it's raining. Eat it. 
          The rest of Lubczanski's cabal laughs.
          TUVIA emerges from his bunker. The first thing he sees is
          Asael, whose face is BATTERED AND SWOLLEN.

          TUVIA
          What happened?
          Asael just looks over at the food line -- where Arkady has
          grabbed Chaya by the waist -- to the delight of the others.
          Tuvia strides over to them.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          What is this?

          Against my orders...

          ARKADY
          You are no longer Commander. Sorry.
          Tuvia nods, considering his remark for a moment.

          AND THEN TAKES OUT HIS PISTOL AND SHOOTS ARKADY IN THE CHEST!
          He then turns the gun on Motl and the others -- they
          literally cower in fear. He raises his voice to those
          watching.

          Take his body into the woods and
          leave it for the wolves.

          I cannot keep the living alive.
          Tamara and the man who fathered
          this child are responsible for its
          fate.

          LILKA
          She was raped by the Nazis.
          Tuvia closes his eyes. He is tired of being in charge,
          tired of being the arbiter of other peoples' fate.

          LILKA (CONT'D)
          ...You tell us to hold onto our
          humanity. Not to become like
          animals. What better way than by
          bringing a life into this world of
          suffering and death. It's our only
          hope.
          Tuvia is undone by her intensity. The very nearness of
          her. The smell of her newly-washed hair. The glow of her
          skin.
          He looks at her. And nods in surrender.

          LILKA (CONT'D)
          Thank you, Tuvia.
          She kisses him. A chaste kiss of gratitude.
          She pulls back and they look into each other's eyes.
          The next kiss is something entirely different.

          TUVIA
          Lilka...

          LILKA
          I knew what was expected of the
          women here -- yet you never touched
          me...

          TUVIA
          Shhh..

          LILKA
          I'm not afraid of anything, Tuvia.
          I'm not even afraid of you.
          They kiss deeply.

          Lilka lies in his arms.

          TUVIA
          The Germans are coming into the
          forest. I don't know what is going
          to become of us.

          LILKA
          It doesn't matter. If I had stayed
          in the ghetto I'd be dead. You
          saved my life.

          TUVIA
          No. You have saved mine.
          He reaches for her but before they can begin to make love
          again-- THE BLANKET DOOR IS PUSHED ASIDE. Malbin is there.

          MALBIN
          Oh... ..I..... Hello, Lilka.

          LILKA
          Hello, Asael.

          TUVIA
          Yes?

          MALBIN
          We've caught one.

          CUT TO:

          137 A GERMAN SS SCOUT, HANDS TIED BEHIND HIS BACK 137
          is led into the clearing. He wears the same uniform as
          those who marched the villagers into the forest for
          execution.

          ASAEL
          He's a scout.

          TUVIA
          They're coming for us.
          Group members have begun to gather around him. They begin
          to hurl insults -- schtik drek, paskudnyak -- as the hapless
          man is pushed to his knees.

          ASAEL
          We found this in his pouch.
          He hands Tuvia a sheaf of documents -- including a map.

          (re: the documents)
          They've assigned an entire division
          to surround the forest.
          A tidal wave is coming.

          ASAEL
          Don't they have a war to fight?

          SHIMON
          (still reading)
          Assault begins in two days.
          Passover. How fitting.
          Meanwhile, some of the group have begun TORMENTING the man.

          MOTL
          Monster!
          He kicks him in the head.

          SHULMAN
          Bulvan!
          Shulman PUNCHES him in the face.

          Did you reach Viktor?

          ASAEL
          He's on his way.
          The tormenting of the poor courier is gaining intensity.

          MALBIN

          TUVIA--
          The German lets loose a torrent of pleading.

          GERMAN COURIER
          Ich habe frau und kinder!

          SHIMON
          He says he has a wife and children.
          Lazar picks up a stick. The German tries to crawl away;
          the crowd blocks his escape, pushing him back into the
          center.

          our location.
          Shimon translates.

          SHIMON
          Sie mussen versprechen nicht zu
          sagan wo wir sind.
          The man looks up at him, pleadingly.

          GERMAN COURIER
          Nein....Nein...

          SHULMAN
          He'll say anything.
          He breaks the stick across the man's back.

          LAZAR
          We want justice...

          MOTL
          Justice...
          Soon it is a chant: "Justice! .Justice!" Tuvia looks at
          their faces. Only months ago they were decorous, civilized.
          Now they are hungry, almost feral. Murderous.
          Bella has been silently watching. She steps into the circle,
          looks down at the terrified German man.

          BELLA
          My son's name was David. David
          Kagan.
          We SEE now that she is holding a sharpened hoe.

          BELLA (CONT'D)
          He was fifteen. He had blue eyes.
          She raises it above her head.

          BELLA (CONT'D)
          He played the piano.
          She swings with all her might. The others watch with a mix
          of thrilled horror and perverse delight. A line has been
          crossed. Riva steps forward, holding a large shovel.

          RIVA
          My sister's name was Ellie...
          As she swings the shovel, the CAMERA begins to back away.
          Miriam steps forward, carrying a large rock.

          MIRIAM
          My husband was Meyer...
          The group closes in, obscuring our view of the body. Aron
          can't take any more. He runs off into the woods.

          Tuvia closes his eyes. He has done nothing to stop it.
          Asael looks at Malbin and Shimon. They are undone by what
          they have witnessed. Tuvia walks away.
          Behind them, the group separates -- staring at the lifeless
          body on the ground. And then they look at each other, their
          blood lust sated, beginning to reckon with what they have
          done. What they have become.

          138 TUVIA STANDS ALONE IN THE FOREST, HIS FACE IN SHADOW 138
          He sees Aron, squatting beside a tree, crying silently.
          Tuvia kneels beside him, cradling him.

          TUVIA
          Reeboynoy shel oylum... Lord of the
          Universe. We have done unspeakable
          things yet still I seek your mercy...
          He HEARS something. Malbin waits at the edge of the forest.
          His face is drawn and pale from what has just happened.

           Viktor is here.

           CUT TO:

          139 VIKTOR AND ZUS 139
          are waiting in the clearing. Tuvia approaches. He and Zus
          nod to each other but do not speak. It is excruciating.
          Tuvia and Viktor walk into the woods. Zus waits with other
          BODYGUARDS as Asael joins them. Zus wears a Nazi jacket.

          ZUS
          He doesn't look good.

          ASAEL
          I could say the same about you.
          Where'd you get the jacket?

          ZUS
          Let's just say the former owner no
          longer had need of it.
          Zus winks. The other bodyguards stare impassively.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          Embrace me.
          Asael looks confused for a moment, then embraces him.

          ZUS (CONT'D)

          (WHISPERING)
          Hide this.
          (shoves a revolver
          into his pocket)
          Wolnicky stores ammunition for us
          in his barn. There's no guard.
          He slaps Asael fondly on the cheek and rejoins his comrades.

          140 VIKTOR AND TUVIA 140
          sit on a downed tree and converse in Russian, with subtitles:

          VIKTOR
          You found these on the prisoner?
          Tuvia nods. Viktor studies the scout's documents. Tisking.

          TUVIA
          We can't fight an entire division.

          VIKTOR
          The battle on the Eastern Front has
          begun. The more troops we engage
          here, the fewer they have to attack
          the Motherland.

          VIKTOR
          My orders are to take command of
          all partisan operations. You will
          bring the rest of your fighters to
          me.

          TUVIA
          And the others? Old people, women
          and children.

          VIKTOR
          In war there are casualties.

          TUVIA
          And if I refuse?

          VIKTOR
          You are officially a deserter. Do
          you know the policy on dealing with
          deserters?
          Viktor unfolds a paper flyer from his pocket.

          VIKTOR (CONT'D)
          ...The Germans are offering fifty
          thousand marks for information
          leading to your capture.
          (hands it to him)
          Not a very flattering likeness.
          Too Jewish.
          Viktor rejoins his bodyguards, turns back for a last word.

          VIKTOR (CONT'D)
          Have your men in my camp by tonight.
          He walks off. Asael takes the wanted poster from Tuvia.

          ASAEL
          I wouldn't show this around. There
          are some who'd turn you in for less.

          CUT TO:

          141 LATER - A SPOTTER PLANE BUZZES HIGH ABOVE - HUNTING 141
          Down below, Viktor and the Russian partisans have struck
          their tents and hidden beneath the sheltering trees.
          Viktor's gaze follows the plane. He gives an order into a
          field radio. Zus has been listening.

          Viktor just looks at him.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          You're deliberately sacrificing
          them so we can remain safe?

          VIKTOR
          No. So we can keep fighting.
          Everyone must sacrifice in the
          struggle.

          ZUS
          Those are my brothers.

          VIKTOR
          I am your brother! He is your
          brother! Comrade Zus. Your Jewish
          sentimentality is heart-warming,
          but counter-revolutionary.
          Zus has secretly known he would hear these words. He grips
          his rifle but holds his tongue.

          BACK TO:

          142 THE SPOTTER PLANE -- FLIES OVER THE BIELSKI CAMP 142
          Tuvia stares up at it. Have they been spotted?
          Shimon is sitting nearby with a group of children. He looks
          pale. His cough is worse. He is very ill.

          SHIMON
          ...but the children of Israel were
          afraid to leave Egypt. Until Moses
          said, 'Do not trust in me, trust in
          God.' He will take care of you'
          (a wrenching cough)
          And so tomorrow we celebrate the
          Passover by sitting around and
          arguing just as we have done for
          centuries.
          Tuvia stares at them, a curious expression on his face.
          Malbin comes to stand beside him.

          MALBIN

          MALBIN
          ...How should I know?

          TUVIA
          Moses. The Exodus.
          Malbin doesn't get it at first.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          --He left before Pharaoh could stop
          them.
          Now Malbin understands. He looks at Shimon.

          MALBIN
          You want to move them all? The
          old, the sick. They'll never make
          it.
          It isn't the first time Tuvia has consigned people to their
          death, and apparently it won't be the last.

          TUVIA
          We leave now. Spread the word.

          143 MOMENTS LATER - THE BIELSKI CAMP 143
          is a blur of activity as everyone mobilizes for evacuation.
          Sacks and cooking equipment is tied onto impromptu packs.
          Asael and Malbin coax the older people into motion--

          Come, tateh--

          OPPENHEIM
          But my tools--
          The SOUND of approaching aircraft. Tuvia searches the sky.
          Riva pairs each of the elderly with a child. Tamara tucks
          her newborn under her coat.
          The SOUND of the approaching aircraft grows LOUDER. People
          look up, shielding their eyes. Then from out of the sun,
          two ominous silhouettes:

          STUKA DIVE BOMBERS!

          TUVIA

          TAKE COVER!

          144 THE SCREAMING WHISTLE OF THE FIRST BOMBER 144

          Some race into the forest; others are frozen. Tuvia grabs
          people and bodily drags them to cover.
          STRAFING 20MM CANNON chew up the ground.
          Several people are hit before they can reach cover. Lilka
          herds everyone she can into:

          145 A BUNKER 145
          where people crowd in like sardines. Chaya and Riva gather
          children around them. They hear the WHISTLE of an incoming
          shell....BOOM! Dirt from the roof rains down on them.

          146 BOMBS BEGIN TO RAIN DOWN 146
          Dirt and debris everywhere. AN INCENDIARY SHELL HITS high
          in a tree. Its branches burst into flame.
          An hysterical woman leaps out of a bunker and is BLOWN APART.

          147 MEANWHILE - IN VIKTOR'S CAMP 147
          Zus listens helplessly to the distant sound of bombs dropping
          on his brothers.

          148 BACK IN THE BIELSKI CAMP - A DIRECT HIT ON A ZEMYLANKA 148
          It explodes into a million pieces. Wood shrapnel everywhere.
          Where once was a bunker, now there is only a gaping crater.
          Tuvia races into the maelstrom to help the wounded.

          AN EXPLOSION KNOCKS HIM DOWN
          He tries to clear his head but he cannot focus. ALL SOUND
          FADES AWAY to be replaced by a high-pitched hum.

          149 TUVIA'S WORLD IS IN SLOW-MOTION 149
          Falling dirt and debris, tumbling bodies, exploding bunkers --
          a surreal effect.

          150 IN REAL TIME -- THE CAMP IS BEING TORN APART 150
          Cowering in safety, Malbin sees Tuvia lying in the open and
          gathers his courage -- RACING through danger to his side.

          MALBIN
          Are you alright?
          Tuvia shakes his head, points to his ears. He cannot hear.

          MALBIN (CONT'D)

          ARE...YOU...ALRIGHT?
          When Tuvia speaks, his WORDS sound DULL and MUFFLED.

          TUVIA

          MUST...GO!

          MALBIN

          ...WHAT?

          TUVIA

          THE GERMANS...COMING...!
          Malbin looks around, panicked. Asael appears out of the
          smoke, yells at Malbin above the din.

          ASAEL
          Get them out of the bunkers!
          Malbin runs off. Asael helps Tuvia to his feet. A nearby
          explosion SHOWERS THEM with dirt as they CRAWL to safety.
          The world RAMPS BACK TO NORMAL SPEED at a dizzying rate.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          We need to hold them off...until
          the rest are safe.
          Tuvia still can't hear. Asael pantomimes firing a rifle.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)

          ...HOLD...THEM...OFF!
          Tuvia nods, trying to clear the buzzing in his head.

          TUVIA

          ...MACHINE GUN...

          ASAEL
          With Levine and Miriam... There.
          (points out positions)
          Lazar, Rosa, and Schmuel. There
          and there.
          (Tuvia nods)
          And me.
          Tuvia shakes his head, no.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          Yes.
          He runs off. Still clearing his head, Tuvia regains his
          footing -- suddenly realizing the the bombing has stopped.

          Malbin appears, eyes wild.

          MALBIN
          Everybody out! Now!
          But the group's natural reaction is to stay huddled in safety

          MALBIN (CONT'D)

          THE COSSACKS ARE COMING!
          This gets the job done. People begin to crawl out.

          152 OTHERS EMERGE FROM THE BUNKERS 152
          YOUNG PEOPLE holding hands with OLD, PARENTS with CHILDREN
          on their backs. Tuvia urges Lilka and Bella to hurry them
          into the woods.

          153 MEANWHILE -- THE ASSIGNED DEFENDERS, MEN AND WOMEN ALIKE 153
          take up their assigned positions: Levine mans the heavy
          machine gun behind a log; Lazar, Miriam and Rosa in the
          trees.
          Tuvia anxiously waits for the last of the women and children
          to disappear into the forest.

          A SUDDEN SILENCE DESCENDS - EVERYONE LOOKS TO THE SKY
          Tuvia realizes the bombers have broken off their attack.
          He knows the ground troops will soon follow.
          He turns to Asael, grabbing his shoulders.

          TUVIA
          Don't try to fight... Just slow
          them down. Then join us.
          Asael nods. No need for more words. They embrace fiercely.
          Asael pushes Chaya toward Tuvia.

          ASAEL
          Take her.
          She resists, clinging to his arm for a moment.

          TUVIA
          Come.
          He forces her to join him and catch up to the others.

          154 THE CAMP 154
          is eerily quiet as the dust begins to settle. The defenders
          check their weapons with grim efficiency. They are no longer
          inept innocents; they have become warriors.

          155 DEEPER IN THE WOODS 155
          Tuvia catches up with the fleeing group and urges them on.

          156 MOMENTS LATER -- THE DEFENDERS WAIT ANXIOUSLY 156
          We study their faces. Beautiful in their stoic acceptance.

          SUDDENLY -- A FUSILLADE from the woods. Rosa falls dead.
          The defenders RETURN FIRE. Levine fires the machine gun;
          Miriam feeds the belt.

          157 UP AHEAD WITH THE FLEEING GROUP 157
          Tuvia hears small arms fire. He knows what it means.

          158 BACK AT THE CAMP 158
          The rear guard action can't hold out for very long. Tree
          by tree, they begin to fall back.
          Asael fires blindly into the murky shadows. The SOUND of a
          man crying out.
          Then Levine is hit. Miriam pushes him out of the way and
          TAKES OVER. She expertly kills several assault troops who
          appear out of the woods.
          The rest of the attackers TAKE COVER.

          159 WITH THE FLEEING GROUP 159
          Malbin waits anxiously for Tuvia, clutching a map.

          MALBIN
          (struggling to control
          his panic)
          This swamp here...goes...for miles.

          TUVIA
          Show me.

          160 BACK AT THE CAMP 160
          Lazar runs from tree to tree, keeping up a steady stream of
          fire. He is surprisingly brave. Until A GRENADE flies out
          of the woods and lands at his feet, killing him instantly.
          The Assault Troops have begun to outflank them. Asael is
          suddenly in jeopardy. Sara sees the danger.

          MIRIAM

          GO!
          Miriam keeps their ATTACKERS pinned down as the two men
          race for new positions. Then she is hit. She keeps firing
          anyway, her finger locked on the trigger even as she is
          dying.
          More troops begin firing from their flank. Asael has no
          choice but to break off. They race into the woods.

          161 BACK TO THE FLEEING GROUP 161
          Tuvia hears the guns go silent. This, too, has meaning.

          162 A RISE REVEALS THE IMMENSITY OF THE KRASNAYA GORKA SWAMP 162
           Malbin stares at what lies ahead.

          TUVIA
          Are the others back yet?
          (Malbin looks
          stricken; he shakes
          his head)
          ..Asael?
          Malbin shakes his head once more. Asael is not coming back.
          Chaya begins to weep. Riva comforts her.

          SHULMAN
          We've got to keep going!

          BELLA
          The Germans will be here any minute!

          MALBIN
          (to Tuvia)
          Do we wait...a while?

          MORDECAI
          We could hide...

          MAN #3
          I say, fight them here.

          MOTL
          Yes. Fight!

          SHULMAN
          That's crazy!
          Tuvia is in hell. If he waits for Asael, he risks them all
          being caught. Suddenly it all falls apart. Tuvia sinks to
          his knees as if his legs can no longer bear his weight.

          MALBIN
          Tuvia--?
          Tuvia can't speak. He has no more answers. Nothing to
          say. He stares at the impenetrable swamp. The end of the
          line.
          The sudden vacuum of leadership is felt by them all. They
          stare at one another, anxious and rudderless.

          WOMAN (ZOE)
          My father cannot make it.

          RONA
          There are snakes--
          Tamara's newborn is crying. She tries to comfort it. An
          old woman stares at the swamp in terror.

          MAN #1 (FROHMAN)
          The children...

          SHULMAN

          Oppenheim is petrified. Rona is crying.

          MALBIN

          TUVIA--
          And still Tuvia is silent.
          More arguing. A general MURMUR of dread is rising.
          Malbin goes to kneel beside Shimon, who is covered in sweat --
          undone by the forced march.

          MALBIN (CONT'D)
          What's wrong with him?

          SHIMON
          (fighting for breath)
          ...He... ..is... ..tired.
          Malbin hears something, looks up.

          FROM HIGH ABOVE - THE SPOTTER PLANE APPEARS
          They have been found. Lilka kneels beside Tuvia.

          She takes his hand silently.

          LILKA

          COME--
          He shakes his head.

          TUVIA
          You have a weapon?
          She shows him her revolver. He checks the clip, then looks
          into her eyes.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Use it on yourself before you let
          them take you.
          She nods gravely. Suddenly a VOICE interrupts.

          VOICE
          Why are we stopping?
          Everyone turns. It's Asael. Back from the dead. He hands
          off a wounded comrade to Riva's care.

          ASAEL

          (WILD-EYED)
          They're coming!
          (to Tuvia)
          Why aren't we moving?
          Tuvia looks up at him, lost. Almost helpless.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          We must keep going!

          TAMARA
          In there?

          RONA
          It is impossible!
          More murmuring. Asael raises his voice.

          ASAEL
          Nothing is impossible! What we
          have done is impossible!
          The murmuring quiets.
          Asael meets Tuvia's eyes. He is literally willing his older
          brother to be strong for them, as he has been, time and
          again.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          God will not part these waters. We
          will do it ourselves.

          Now, you....give me your belt.

          We don't have enough rope.

          What are you talking about?
          Tuvia is deeply moved. His little brother has become a
          man. Once more, he finds his voice.

          TUVIA
          Each person takes care of the other.
          (meeting Asael's eye)
          .Give him your belt.
          Asael nods at Tuvia gratefully. The group is hushed,
          apprehensive. Then:

          ONE MAN
          Removes his belt and offers it to Asael.

          ANOTHER STANDS, HOLDING HIS BELT
          And then another. One by one they offer them. There is
          something quietly heroic in the gesture.
          Tuvia looks at the group, looks away, fighting back emotion.

          No tracks on land. Get back in.
          It is almost impossible to make any progress. Especially
          when one is weak and malnourished.

          162C IN A DEEP BOG 162C
          The mud sticks to their clothes, faces. Soon they are
          indistinguishable from their surroundings.
          When one person sinks in the muck, it takes three to get
          him back on his feet. The column slows.
          Tuvia gestures for them to keep moving. They can't.
          Literally cannot. He begins to physically push them on.
          Sometimes harshly. Eventually they are moving again.

          CUT TO:

          163 A GHOSTLY LANDSCAPE 163
          Gnarled bare trees shrouded in mist. They trudge forward,
          their expressions wan and empty. Tuvia find Malbin and
          pulls him aside.

          TUVIA

          (WHISPERING)
          How much farther?
          Malbin shrugs his shoulders. Who knows...?

          Parents hoist children onto their shoulders, hold weapons
          overhead as they claw at tall reeds to propel themselves
          forward, step by tortuous step.
          SHIMON clings to a tree. His wracking cough is terrifying
          and he is deathly pale.

          TUVIA
          Come...
          Shimon can't catch his breath, he just shakes his head, no.
          He can't go on. Tuvia half-drags, half-carries him onward.

          Shimon is deposited on dry ground. He is barely alive.

          MALBIN
          Is he...?
          Tuvia shakes his head. It's only a matter of time. The
          Spotter Plane drones overhead.

          Take off your glasses. Reflections.
          Tuvia moves off to check on the others.

          MALBIN
          Shimon, listen to me, the physical
          plane is just an illusion. Only
          the spiritual plane is real.

          SHIMON
          (fighting for breath)
          No. The physical plane is where
          man acts to redeem himself.

          MALBIN
          You've redeemed yourself enough,
          you should shut up now.

          SHIMON
          Look who's talking about shutting
          up... I need to tell you something.

          (leans closer)
          What is it?

          SHIMON
          You shouldn't think so much. The
          world around you is beautiful.

          MALBIN
          (stunned; looks around)
          This world?

          Tuvia has come to sit beside Lilka. She leans into him.

          We're lost.

          LILKA
          No. ..No.

          PANCHENKO
          You will hold this crossroads until
          the brigade has completed its
          retreat.
          Zus looks around at the position.

          ZUS
          For how long?
          Panchenko's orders are never to be questioned.

          PANCHENKO
          Until you are ordered to withdraw.

          ZUS
          And if we cannot hold the position?
          Panchenko looks at Gramov, who stands nearby cradling a
          submachine gun.

          PANCHENKO
          Comrade Gramov will enforce
          discipline, if necessary.
          Gramov smiles. The implications are clear: nobody retreats.

          PANCHENKO (CONT'D)
          You have served us well, Comrade.

          ZUS
          (a wintry smile)
          I am so honored, Comrade.
          Panchenko wheels his horse and gallops off. Zus and his
          men take cover in the woods.
          In the distance we can HEAR the unmistakable SOUND of
          approaching armor. Lova kneels beside Zus.

          LOVA
          What are we doing here? Zus?
          Half a mile down the road, A TANK rumbles into view.

          LOVA (CONT'D)
          Tell me. Who are we doing this
          for?
          With a shaking hand, Zus tries to light a Molotov cocktail
          but his matches are wet. He reaches into his pocket for
          more. Instead he finds the mezuzah that was once affixed to
          his family's door.
          As he stares at it, the SOUND of the approaching tank grows
          louder.

          167 THE KRASNAYA GORKA SWAMP 167
          empties at last into a shallow river. On the opposite bank
          is dry land, and beyond, the deep forest. And safety.
          The bedraggled group makes their way across.

          169 ON THE OPPOSITE BANK 169
          Asael pulls people up onto dry ground. They lie there,
          freezing and exhausted. Some cannot control their shivering.

          SHULMAN
          What's next...Sinai?
          Tuvia can't help but laugh. Soon they are all laughing.
          It ripples throughout the group. Joyous. Contagious. An
          overwhelming feeling of relief.
          They are safe.
          Tuvia lies on the ground. All the adrenaline has suddenly
          left his body. Then Aron appears, tugging at his sleeve.
          Shimon is asking for him.
          Tuvia kneels down beside his teacher, whose eyes are closed.
          Malbin is weeping quietly. Who will he argue with?

          SHIMON
          (a whisper)
          .Tuvia...

          TUVIA
          Right here.
          Shimon is at the end.

          SHIMON
          ...Something...to say...

          TUVIA
          Shhhh...

          SHIMON
          ...no...please...
          (finding the strength)
          I almost lost...my faith....but
          you...were sent..by God..to save
          us.

          TUVIA
          Ridiculous.

          SHIMON
          I know... ... But just...in case... .I
          thank....HIM... .and I thank you.
          He closes his eyes.
          It's too much for Tuvia. Hard as he tries, he cannot stop
          the tears from filling his eyes.

          170 SUDDENLY -- UP THE RIVERBANK 170
          Trees begin to FALL OVER -- as if pushed by a dinosaur.

          A PANZER TANK
          emerges onto the banks, less than a quarter-of-mile away.

          ITS TURRET BEGINS TO SWIVEL
          The menacing gun turning in their direction.

          171 THE GROUP IS CAUGHT OUT IN THE OPEN. 171
          THE TANK ROARS FIRE. The first round EXPLODES among them.
          Several are killed.

          TUVIA
          Back to the river!
          He pushes people down. They cling to the banks, cowering.
          THOSE WITH WEAPONS take cover, using the embankment as if
          it were the lip of a trench.
          They RETURN FIRE -- old men, young women, even some children.

          172 A SQUAD OF GERMAN INFANTRY ADVANCES 172
          behind the tank, using it as protection.
          Aron kills one. But the Germans are well-trained. They
          direct a withering fire -- forcing the partisans to keep
          their heads below the embankment.

          BUT THE TANK IS UNSTOPPABLE
          It turns its attentions on the riverbank -- its first round
          SAILS OVERHEAD, sending up a huge geyser of water.
          But the next round PLOWS INTO THE EARTH, tearing a huge
          chunk of earth and killing two of the brigade.
          TUVIA grabs a satchel and begins filling it with grenades.
          He throws the satchel over Malbin's head, grabs his arm and
          races, crouching low, beneath the lip of the riverbank.
          Asael provides covering fire. So do Lilka, Chaya and the
          women alongside the men.

          UP AHEAD
          A stand of trees hides Tuvia from view as he climbs out of
          the river and heads into the forest. He pulls Malbin down
          just as A SQUAD OF GERMAN INFANTRY approaches and begins to
          set up a heavy machine gun.

          Tuvia POPS UP behind them, spraying them with his submachine
          gun. He then turns the heavy machine gun on the infantry
          advancing behind the tank -- to devastating effect.
          But now, the tank turns its attention to Tuvia. Its machine
          gun begins to chew up the forest, forcing Tuvia to take
          cover.
          Without pausing to think, Malbin grabs a grenade from the
          satchel and races toward the tank.
          It falls pitifully short, exploding harmlessly as Malbin is
          cut down.

          173 TUVIA IS NOW ISOLATED AND PINNED DOWN 173
          Bullets tear chunks out of trees as he tries to take cover.

          THE TURRET SWIVELS IN HIS DIRECTION
          It is only a matter of moments before he is dead.

          WHEN SUDDENLY FROM OUT OF THE WOODS
          Zus and the rest of Jewish fighters emerge, firing on the
          run. Without regard for his own life, Zus charges.
          The German infantry is caught in a cross-fire as the Bielski
          brigade climbs out the river, firing wildly.
          Zus guns down the tank commander manning the machine gun
          from the open hatch. Jumps onto the tank and DROPS A GRENADE
          inside. An EXPLOSION of BLACK SMOKE BILLOWS.
          Zus stands up amid the billowing smoke. He sees Tuvia who
          is staring back at him.

          174 BOTH GROUPS MEET - THE DESTROYED TANK SMOLDERS NEARBY 174
          Asael is the first to reach Tuvia, who is carrying the German
          assault machine gun.

          TUVIA
          Only weapons and ammunition! Spread
          the word.
          Tuvia hands him the machine gun.

          ASAEL
          Anything else?
          Tuvia looks at him. Is he fucking with him? Just a little.

          TUVIA
          Go on.
          Lilka is carrying a small child.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Lilka, please help. We've got to
          get the injured into the forest.

          LILKA
          What about the dead?

          TUVIA
          Everybody gather your things! We
          have to get out of the open!
          Nearby, Aron removes the machine from the tank and hands it
          to Zus. Bella approaches. Zus embraces her.
          Tuvia seizes one of the German rifles. He yells to Shulman.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Shulman! Weapons only! Tell them.

          You've been promoted.
          Congratulations!
          Tuvia turns, sees Bella with Zus. They see him. Zus hands
          Bella the machine gun from the tank and approaches.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Where is the rest of your unit?

          ZUS
          Good question.

          TUVIA
          You are going back?

          ZUS
          No.
          They look at each other. So much unsaid. No time to say
          it.

          TUVIA
          We've got to build a new camp.
          Zus nods.

          ZUS
          Perhaps you have room for one more?

          Tuvia reaches out his arms and they embrace fiercely.

          175 IN THE DEEP WOODS - LATER 175
          They walk in silence. Lilka comes to walk beside him,
          resting her head on his shoulder as they walk.
          Tuvia looks up at the shafts of light slanting through the
          towering trees, as if allowing himself to appreciate its
          beauty for the first time.
          Suddenly, he stops, listening, puzzled.

          TUVIA
          Don't you hear it?

          ZUS
          What...?

          TUVIA
          Nothing. Isn't it beautiful?
          We HOLD on Tuvia. He has aged ten years in one.

          But for now he allows himself a brief moment of satisfaction.
          We might even see the ghost of a smile. But it is short-
          lived as Asael appears by his side and we see concern once
          again clouding his face. Another problem to attend to.
          And as THE CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL AWAY he is already hurrying
          to catch up with the others.
          As they all disappear from sight into the sheltering darkness
          of the woods, these words appear on screen:

          THEY LIVED IN THE FOREST FOR TWO MORE YEARS.

          IN THEIR NEW CAMP THEY BUILT A SCHOOL, A HOSPITAL, A NURSERY.

          AND STILL MORE CAME TO FIND THEM.

          AT THE TIME OF LIBERATION, TWELVE HUNDRED WALKED OUT OF THE

          FOREST.

          ASAEL JOINED THE RUSSIAN ARMY AND DIED SIX MONTHS LATER.

          ZUS AND TUVIA EMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES.
          In the taxi, THE ELDERLY MAN thrusts his hand through the
          slot in the Plexiglas window separating him from the driver.

          ELDERLY MAN
          Here is money. I can get more. So
          much more. Take it, please.

          CAB DRIVER
          No, no...
          Indeed, when the CABBIE speaks, though the voice is older
          and somewhat frail, we recognize it as Tuvia's.

          ELDERLY MAN
          What else can I give you, do for
          you?

          AGED TUVIA
          Nothing, it isn't necessary.
          Tears stream down the elderly man's cheeks.

          ELDERLY MAN
          We are alive because of you.

          THE CAB PULLS AWAY FROM THE CURB INTO THE RAIN -

          MIDDLE-AGED SON
          Papa, who was that man?
          The Elderly Man watches the cab pull away, wiping his eyes.

          ELDERLY MAN
          That wasn't a man. That was an
          angel.
          As the cab pulls away, the CAMERA CRANES UP until it is
          lost in an anonymous sea of traffic. These words appear on

          HE DROVE A CAB IN NEW YORK CITY FOR TWENTY YEARS.

          TUVIA AND LILKA REMAINED MARRIED UNTIL HIS DEATH IN 1987.
