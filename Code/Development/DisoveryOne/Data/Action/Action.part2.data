     EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - DUSK

     It's finally happened.  Hell's frozen over.

     Christmas is two weeks off, arid SNOW is falling in Gotham.
     Beneath its pristine white blanket, the city looks
     uncharacteristically serene -- almost inviting.  Peace has
     been miraculously restored: strangers wave hello.  Salvation
     Army Santas ring their bells on streetcorners.  And now, as
     night falls, an ILLUMINATED SIGN winks on above Broad Avenue:
     "JOYEUX NOEL GOTHAM -- Only 16 Shopping Days Left Till
     Christmas."

     The streets are bustling with jolly shoppers.  At a souvenir
     store, we find an exasperated MOM squabbling with her seven-
     year old.  Like many other storefronts in Gotham, this one is
     overflowing with bootleg BATMAN MERCHANDISE: t-shirts, key
     chains, ceramic figurines.  The kid is already wearing a
     Batman baseball cap and a little black cape, but he obviously
     wants more.

     Mom drags him off past another store window, this one full of
     SCRAP METAL, with a sign reading "AUTHENTIC FRAGMENTS OF THE
     BATWING -- $19.95 and up."  A PANHANDLER is perched at the
     entrance.  Beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt
     with the familiar yellow-and-black logo.  In Gotham this
     winter, Batmania is everywhere...

     EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - LATER THAT NIGHT

     Two hours later, the SNOWSTORM's grown into a full-fledged
     blizzard.  The drifts are two feet deep and the streets are
     all but empty of cars.  A massive SNOW PLOW the size of a
     Panzer tank rumbles past, FILLING THE FRAME...

     ...and revealing, as it passes, a group of CAROLERS, all
     bundled up in mufflers and parkas.  Unbothered by the weather,
     they walk the street singing, spreading cheer and goodwill to
     the few passersby.

     They've just gone into a lovely a capella rendition of "Silent
     Night" when an oversized DELIVERY TRUCK, outfitted with snow
     chains, clanks slowly past in the wake of the plow.  Its sides
     are decorated with cartoon igloos advertising a popular ice
     cream snack -- POLAR BARS -- oddly inappropriate for this time
     of year.

     A streetcorner SANTA, with bell and bucket, WAVES at the truck
     as it rounds a corner.  The CAROLERS carol.  Then --

     -- a VIOLENT EXPLOSION rocks the street -- followed by the
     sound of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE and a high, wailing SECURITY ALARM.

     EXT. SCHRACH AND CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     Around the corner there's CARNAGE on the streets.  The windows
     have blown out of Gotham's leading jewelry store.  Gut-shot
     SECURITY GUARDS stagger and go face down in the snow as
     ROBBERS, dressed in white camouflage gear, clamber out through
     the shattered glass with SACKFULS OF LOOT.

     CAROLERS spill around the corner to see what's going on, but a
     spray of GUNFIRE sends them scattering in panic.  The POLAR
     BAR truck pulls even with the jewelry store, and as it does...

     The REAR DOORS open.  A RAMP slides down from the back of the
     truck.  The ROBBERS scramble aboard, and mere seconds later
     SLIDE out AGAIN -- riding atop five SKIDOO SNOWMOBILES.

     SIRENS HOWL.  A POLICE CAR appears, taking the corner just a
     trifle too fast -- FISHTAILING on the icy street and plowing
     into a drift.

     INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The COPS gun the engine, but their wheels are spinning in the
     snow -- no traction.  They're about to climb out and give
     chase on foot when, through the windshield, they see the
     Salvation Army SANTA...

     ...HOISTING AN AK-47 AND FIRING DIRECTLY AT THEM.  The
     windshield disintegrates and the COPS sink from view as SANTA
     races off to the last of the snowmobiles, which is already
     burdened with LOOT.

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     MORE SQUAD CARS converge on the jewelry store -- but it's
     difficult to carry on a high-speed pursuit when the snow's a
     foot deep and the best you can do is 6 MPH.  The COP CARS skid
     to a halt, blocked by the rumbling SNOWPLOW.  By now, of
     course, the LOOTERS are gone -- scooting off on either side of
     the plow, sticking to the snowy sidewalks.

     EXT. STREETS - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     SNOWMOBILES glide across the sidewalks, sending the few hardy
     souls who are out on the streets DIVING FOR COVER.  A couple
     of DERELICTS are cowering behind a fire hydrant, trying to
     avoid getting run over.  Every time they poke their heads out,
     another SKIDOO whizzes past, missing them by inches.

     The ROBBERS fan out in various directions.  These guys are
     obviously going to get away clean -- unless...

     The DERELICT points up at the night sky, where a BEACON is
     blazing in the darkness -- THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT...

     INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     MORE SIRENS.  A COP takes a radio call as he streaks down the
     long wide avenue which borders Gotham Park -- one of the few
     streets which is relatively clear.  The COP at the wheel goes
     wide-eyed and nudges his partner in disbelief.

     Before their eyes, FIVE SNOWMOBILES appear from the cross
     streets up ahead and CONVERGE at the entrance to Gotham Park.
     Bringing up the rear is SANTA CLAUS.

                               COP
               What the hell -- ?

     EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BRAKES SQUEAL.  Several squad cars are now massed at the
     entrance to the park -- but there's one problem.  The city's
     snow plows don't operate on the park roads -- and the entrance
     is blocked off with SAWHORSES reading "CLOSED TO TRAFFIC."  A
     huge steep drift prevents them from entering -- and so all
     they can do is stand by helplessly, WATCHING as the
     snowmobiles vanish into the trees.

     The COPS race about like headless chickens, trying to concoct
     a plan.  A couple of them are trying to scale the stone walls
     of the park.  Another is at his car, barking into a radio
     mike:

                               COP WITH MIKE
               Yeah, you heard me.  Snowmobiles!
                    (pause)
               So what do we do?  Chase 'em on foot??

     ALL EYES TURN at the blare of a horn.  The COPS peer down the
     long corridor of the cross street -- and see a STRANGE BLACK
     VEHICLE barreling toward them at 90 MPH, with no intention of
     stopping...

     THE BATMOBILE!!  COPS dive left and right.  A split-second
     later...

     ...a FORTY-FOOT JET of NOVA-INTENSITY FLAME erupts from the
     front of the jet-black supercar -- instantaneously DISSOLVING
     the drift that blocks the entrance to the park -- turning the
     ice and snow on the paths before it into water!

     The BATMOBILE screams past in the wink of an eye.  The COPS
     get to their feet; cold as it is, they're sweating.  One of
     them mops his brow and announces, dumfounded:

                               COP I
               ...That was Batman.

                               COP II
               NO SHIT!!

     COP II yanks COP I into the nearest squad car, and the others
     follow suit.  ENGINES REV.  As long as the BATMOBILE's cleared
     a path, they might as well join in the chase...

     EXT. BRIDLE PATH - THAT MOMENT

     TWO BURLY TEENAGERS -- both dressed in RED BERETS and PARKAS
     with BLACK BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS visible underneath -- are
     trudging along the path when they're STARTLED by a pair of
     speeding SKIDOOS.  Moments later, they spot a RED GLOW on the
     horizon...

     ...and their JAWS DROP as the BATMOBILE roars into view,
     BURNING OFF THE SNOW IN ITS PATH.  Thrilled beyond words, they
     WHOOP WITH GLEE, slapping high-fives as the car streaks past.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT

     His face is weirdly illuminated by the flame still spitting
     from the front of the car.  Cool as ever -- approaching the
     chase as a simple problem in logic -- he checks a radar
     display on his dashboard and sees FIVE BLIPS.

     EXT. PARK - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The cops follow along in BATMAN's path.  The lead car LOSES
     CONTROL and plows headlong into a drift.  The DRIVER jams the
     pedal, but his rear wheels end up digging a deep rut in the
     ice.  He sits there cursing, pumping the accelerator as other
     COPS race past him on foot.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

     The various ROBBERS have spread out, their vehicles BOUNDING
     over the hilly terrain of the park.  He spots two of them up
     ahead; as he draws closer, they PART WAYS, veering off to the
     left and right...

     ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - MOVING

     PODS OPEN on the front fenders, and MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate
     into place.  The Batmobile fires a pair of HEAT-SEEKING
     TORPEDOS, which BURROW into the snow on either side and
     disappear.

     ANGLE ON LEFT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING

     The DRIVER looks back over his shoulder and sees what appears
     to be a BLACK SHARK FIN plowing through the snow behind him,
     GAINING FAST.  He takes evasive action, but the SHARK FIN
     always seems to follow.  Just as he approaches the crest of a
     hill...

     ...the TORPEDO slams into the rear of the SNOWMOBILE.  The
     force of impact knocks the ROBBER cleanly off.  His LOOT lands
     in the snow beside him, but the SNOWMOBILE keeps going --
     sailing over the crest of the hill and striking the rocks
     beyond with a deafening EXPLOSION.

     ANGLE ON RIGHT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING

     This ROBBER's a little smarter than his buddy.  When he sees
     the shark fin on his tail, he noses his snowmobile off into a
     GROVE OF TREES.  The trees are too closely spaced for the
     torpedo to maneuver; it strikes the nearest tree trunk and
     explodes harmlessly.

     The ROBBER is feeling good about himself, because the
     Batmobile can't follow either.  But BATMAN has a Plan B.  As
     he drives alongside the grove, he HITS THE ACCELERATOR,
     passing the snowmobile on its left.  A STEEL SPIKE attached to
     a cable launches from the side of the Batmobile and WEDGES
     ITSELF into a distant TREE.

     The cable goes taut, and the tree TOPPLES -- directly into the
     path of the second SNOWMOBILE.  The vehicle crashes into the
     trunk, and the hapless ROBBER goes cartwheeling head-over-
     heels into a drift.

     In the distance, COPS appear -- racing to the scene on foot,
     ready for mop-up duty.  BATMAN kills the flamethrower, hits
     the brakes, and FISHTAILS, doing a quick 180 on the snow.
     He's just spotted fresh quarry: snowmobiles three and four,
     whizzing over a rolling white pasture in the distance.

     EXT. PARK - THAT MOMENT

     We're at a makeshift CAMPSITE -- where a cluster of HOMELESS
     PEOPLE are burning refuse in a garbage can to keep warm.  They
     look on in puzzlement as the two SNOWMOBILES whiz past and
     disappear over a crest of a hill...

     EXT. LAKEFRONT - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4

     They bounce down the hillside and SKID -- arriving at the edge
     of a frozen-over LAKE.  With the roar of the Batmobile behind
     them, the two DRIVERS get the same idea simultaneously.
     Smiling, they rev their engines and set out over the surface
     of the lake.

     Now the Batmobile crests the ridge.  The car's weight tips
     suddenly and it begins to skid down the hill toward the lake.
     BATMAN sees what's happening and kills the flamethrower just
     in time -- but he can't brake the car on the snowy slope.  The
     prow of the Batmobile slides out onto the edge of the lake --

     -- and under its weight, the ICE begins to crack.  The left
     front tire takes a sudden dip -- and worse yet, the car is
     sliding forward.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

     He shifts frantically from drive to reverse, trying to rock
     the car out of its predicament, but his rear wheels find no
     purchase.  He can hear the ice cracking beneath him.
     Grimacing, he throws a switch on the dashboard --

     EXT. LAKE - ON BATMOBILE

     -- and the trunk pops open.  An industrial-strength GRAPPLING
     HOOK shoots upward and digs in at a point beyond the crest of
     the hill; and a concealed WINCH ASSEMBLY begins to grind away,
     hauling the Batmobile uphill, out of danger.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

     Suspended just above the icy lake, he sees the SNOWMOBILE
     vanishing into the distance.  He opens (yet another) panel on
     the dashboard...

     EXT. LAKE - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4

     The ROBBERS give each other a big thumbs-up.  They're almost
     halfway across the lake now and the Batmobile is disabled.
     All at once they hear a strange WHISTLING overhead...

     Fireworks?  No, it's a THERMITE BOMB -- rocketing past them,
     hitting the ice some forty feet ahead and EXPLODING GAUDILY.
     JAGGED CHUNKS OF ICE break free and SHIFT in the frigid water
     -- and the ROBBERS are skidding into the drink before they
     know what's hit them.

     ANGLE ON SNOWMOBILE #5 - MOVING

     The last of the robbers is SANTA CLAUS -- his big sack filled
     not with toys, but precious stones.  He approaches the edge of
     the park, negotiating his way through a maze of rocky
     outcroppings.  He squirts out from behind a boulder into a
     clearing...

     ...and GASPS in PANIC as a SEARING BURST OF FLAME erupts
     behind him.  The BATMOBILE speeds out from the other side of
     the boulder; SANTA twists his accelerator, desperately trying
     to build up speed.

     As it is, he's barely managing to stay ahead of the
     flamethrower.  But the jet of flame suddenly DIES; the HOOD of
     the Batmobile rises half a foot --

     -- and TWIN PROJECTILES launch into the air.  A heavy NET is
     strung between them -- and it lands SMACK ON TOP OF SANTA
     CLAUS, entangling the snowmobile and stopping him in his
     tracks.

     Immobilized, he watches through the net in horror as the
     Batmobile barrels down.  When the great black machine is
     almost atop him --

     -- it stops on a dime six inches from his heavily-padded
     frame.

     EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT

     The COPS are spread out near the entrance.  They've rounded up
     the other ROBBERS and returned most of the loot.  They hear a
     dull ROAR in the distance...

     ...and a few seconds later the BATMOBILE streaks into view,
     dragging the NET behind it -- SANTA, his loot, and his
     snowmobile, all tied up in one tidy parcel.

     At the entrance to the park, the NET detaches itself from the
     Batmobile, dumping SANTA into the hands of the waiting COPS.
     Without stopping, the BATMOBILE roars out of the park and
     vanishes whence it came.  A mildly-humiliated COP turns to his
     colleague and SHRUGS:

                               COP I
               ...Merry Christmas.

     The second COP points to SANTA, still struggling in the net.

                               COP II
               Gift-wrapped and everything.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

     TV MINICAM CREWS are camped out on the steps of City Hall,
     with a sizable crowd watching from the street.  COMMISSIONER
     GORDON is reading from a prepared statement.

                               GORDON
               After a high-speed chase -- over $750,000
               in precious jewels were recovered intact
               by the police force -- working in concert
               with Batman.

     At the sound of Batman's name, a CHANTING goes up in the
     crowd:

                               VOICES IN CROWD
               TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE
               STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE --

     GORDON winces and lets out a sigh.  The CHANTERS are a group
     of pugnacious, well-muscled KIDS, late teens and early
     twenties, all dressed in identical garb: black Batman
     SWEATSHIRTS and little red Guardian-angel BERETS.  They're
     obviously members of the same club -- just like the guys we
     saw in the park.

     GORDON waits for them to shut up, but they don't; so he grabs
     the mike and speaks slowly and distinctly, trying to be heard
     over the din.

                               GORDON
               I would like to stress -- that while this
               city enjoys a special relationship with
               Batman --
                    (louder)
               -- we do not condone vigilantism --
                    (practically screaming)
               -- IN ANY FORM.

     It's no use.  He's totally drowned out by the RED BERETS, who
     continue to shout and shake their fists.  Giving up, he
     returns the mike to a REPORTER and marches up the steps in a
     huff.  The RED BERETS CHEER.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

     The evening news: a live, on-the-spot interview from Gotham
     Square.  A superimposed GRAPHIC identifies a surly kid in a
     RED BERET as "MIKE SEKOWSKY -- SPOKESPERSON -- ORDER OF THE
     BAT."

                               SEKOWSKY
               And hey!  Where does this --
                    (BLEEP; expletive deleted)
               -- Gordon get off calling us ?
               We're not breakin' any laws.  We're a
               group of concerned citizens, that's all --
               just like Batman.

 WOMAN IN CROWD                You people are nothing but hoodlums!

 SEKOWSKY                Hey, lady -- we're out here on patrol
               riskin' our necks to protect old biddies
               like you.
                    (into mike)
               If this lame-o Gordon could do his job --

     MORE CATCALLS from the crowd.  The picture jumps suddenly as a
     minicam is jostled; some sort of SCUFFLE appears to be
     breaking out.  Before it does, CAMERA PULLS BACK from the TV
     screen, placing us in:

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - NIGHT

     where ALFRED THE BUTLER is watching the Sekowsky interview
     with extreme dismay.  As he trims the crusts from a pair of
     hearty watercress sandwiches, he SLICES HIS FINGER OPEN.

     ALFRED makes a pained face -- it's all Sekowsky's fault.
     Onscreen, the fracas continues; SEKOWSKY has recommandeered
     the mike...

                               SEKOWSKY (on TV)
               We're provin' that the spirit of Batman is
               alive in this city.  We're gonna take back
               the streets!

     SEKOWSKY raises a fist.  Behind him, his CRONIES begin to
     chant: "TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE STREETS!"
     Incensed, sucking on his finger, ALFRED moves to the TV and
     flicks it off.

     He turns on the radio in search of something more soothing.
     "Good King Wenceslas" pipes through the manor; smiling, ALFRED
     sets the sandwich plate alongside a steaming kettle on a
     Sterling silver tea service.

     INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The CAROL CONTINUES UNDERNEATH as ALFRED, white linen draped
     over one forearm, sets the tea tray down on his master's big
     mahogany desk.  He digs in his pocket for a key and unlocks a
     side drawer.

     The drawer contains a stack of yellowed, aging NEWPAPER
     CLIPPINGS -- among them one which reads "THOMAS WAYNE
     MURDERED: Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery.
     Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed."  ALFRED digs
     around beneath the clippings and finds a concealed SWITCH at
     the rear of the drawer.

     Gears grind, and a sectional bookcase detaches itself from the
     wall -- sliding out a couple of feet to reveal a STONE
     STAIRWAY which descends into darkness...

     INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     Descending the stone stairs, ALFRED arrives in the Batcave.
     "Good King Wenceslas" is on the speakers down here as well.
     Across a catwalk the BATMOBILE rests on its little plateau,
     wrapped in a tarp.

     ALFRED clears some space on a lab table and sets the tea
     service down.  He glances up at the bank of video monitors and
     sees SEKOWSKY, still babbling, on several channels
     simultaneously.  He scans the cave, but there's no trace of
 BRUCE. 
 ALFRED                Sir?  -- MASTER BRUCE??

     As if in response, BATS screech and flutter in the distant
     recesses of the cavern.  ALFRED turns suddenly and sees BRUCE
     behind him, suspended from a thin filament wire, RISING OUT OF
 A BOTTOMLESS ABYSS. 
 BRUCE                I'm not deaf, Alfred.  I hear you.

     He's wearing his civvie -- tweed pants and cashmere sweater --
     but he's got the utility belt, with its spring-action reel,
     buckled about his waist.  Clutching a bundle, he hangs in
     midair for a moment, dangling over the void.  ALFRED slowly
     regains his composure:

 ALFRED                I took the liberty of preparing tea.
                    (indicating tbe monitors)
               I take it you've been watching the news?

     BRUCE, still dangling, glances up at the SEKOWSKY interview
     and nods.

 BRUCE                Yeah...lot of crazy people in this world.

     BRUCE rocks back and forth to build up momentum.  He kicks off
     on the nearest stone outcropping, lands gracefully on the
     Batcave floor, and unbuckles his belt.  Preoccupied, he drops
     his mysterious bundle on the lab table: a roll of black
     fabric, and a cluster of lightweight, hollow ALUMINUM RODS,
     connected by what appears to be SURGICAL TUBING.

 ALFRED                I should inform you...Christmas is
               approaching, and we've received our annual
               solicitation from the Fireman's Toy Fund.
                    (eyeing the equipment)
               If I may inquire...?

 BRUCE                Oh, yeah.  Watch this.

     BRUCE hits a trigger on a tiny gas canister attached to the
     tubing.  The tubing inflates and the rods spring erect --
     stiffening, wing-like, into something which looks remarkably
     like the skeleton of an umbrella.

 ALFRED                Most ingenious, sir.  What exactly it? BRUCE What does it look like? ALFRED To the untrained eye, sir, it looks remarkably like...the skeleton of an umbrella. Sounds good. BRUCE eyes his new invention, thinks it over, smiles slyly. BRUCE Good guess, Alfred. That's exactly right. BRUCE hits the trigger, and the rods WILT with a hiss. He sits at his lab table; ALFRED unfolds a napkin on his lap, pours a cup of tea. ALFRED Splendid, sir, and if I may say, I'm glad you're putting your time to such productive use. (beat) Now -- the Toy Fund. Our contribution last year was a half-million dollars... BRUCE We can do better than that. ALFRED Then there's the foster-parents program... the Gotham homeless crusade... BRUCE nods abstractedly and tucks into his sandwich. He seems oddly preoccupied -- not exactly melancholy, but his thoughts are obviously a million miles away. ALFRED looks on, concerned: ALFRED (cont.) Is something troubling you, sir? BRUCE Yeah...the holidays, I guess. Always gets me thinking about... (he changes the subject) And to tell you the truth, I'm a little -- concerned about Vicki. ALFRED (anxiously) Miss Vale, sir...? BRUCE Yeah. I've been thinking about it lately. Thinking about it a lot... (gravely; shaking his head) ...and I still can't figure out what to get her for Christmas. BRUCE shoots ALFRED a solemn, perplexed look -- and ALFRED heaves an audible sigh of relief as we CUT TO: INT. PRISON CELL - DAY TIGHT ON a stack of COOPS and CAGES, piled high against a bare concrete wall. Each cage -- and there are at least two dozen of them -- contains a twittering BIRD: starlings, pigeons, cardinals, titwillows... CAMERA PULLS BACK from the bars of the cages to reveal a VERY ODD FIGURE in prison greys. A CANARY, perched on his shoulder, SINGS HAPPILY as he stands in front of a grimy, cracked mirror, plastering back his hair, BUFFING HIS NAILS with quick, birdlike strokes. MR. BONIFACE is beak-nosed, epicene, and so fat that it seems his skin should burst; the adjective that comes to mind is "obscene." Despite his eccentric appearance, he comports himself with overblown, theatrical dignity. Fastidious and preening, he does not suffer insults lightly. CAMERA PULLS BACK FURTHER -- through another set of bars -- and we realize that MR. BONIFACE is himself caged. A PRISON GUARD arrives to slide back his cell door... GUARD Up and at 'em, Pengy. -- Pengy? MR. BONIFACE pointedly ignores the GUARD, refusing to acknowledge the odious (if wholly appropriate) nickname. GUARD (cont.) Boniface... MR. BONIFACE finally turns. With an expression of extreme distaste, he affixes a MONOCLE over one eye, returns the canary to its cage and allows himself to be ushered out. INT. WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY MR. BONIFACE and his ATTORNEY sit at a long table across from the WARDEN and the members of the PAROLE BOARD. PAROLE OFFICER You want to return the money you stole. BONIFACE Intact. The map will show you where it's buried. The PAROLE OFFICER stares skeptically at a hand-scrawled MAP. PAROLE OFFICER All of it. Forty-two million dollars. MR. BONIFACE stares down humbly at the table -- as if he finds the mere mention of his transgression too embarrassing to bear. PAROLE OFFICER II Why this sudden change of heart? MR. BONIFACE Gentlemen, I want my debt to be repaid in full. I want to be a part of civilized society! (oozing sincerity) Prison life is not for me. The guilt, the fear, the constant shame...one meets a disturbingly low class of people. PAROLE OFFICER II Sure, but -- forty-two million dollars?? MR. BONIFACE nods plaintively. It's quite a perfomlance. He dabs at his face with a handkerchief; it's hot in here, and he's the delicate type... WARDEN His record's clean. Thirteen years without an incident. ATTORNEY I'd like to point out, my client's put his time to good use. A student of ornithology...articles published in several respected journals... The PAROLE OFFICER thumbs through a stack of magazines: Bird World, Ornithological Review, Beaks And Feathers, Nest Egg. MR. BONIFACE Birds, yes. My only source of solace. PAROLE OFFICER In light of this rather extraordinary gesture, I see no reason not to endorse your application for parole. BONIFACE Thank you, sir. You won't regret it. MR. BONIFACE shakes hands with the members of the PAROLE BOARD. As the GUARDS escort him out, a BLACK MYNAH BIRD SQUAWKS LOUDLY from its cage in the corner of the office: MYNAH CRIME DOES NOT PAY. AAWWK!! CRIME DOES NOT PAY. CHUCKLES all around. On his way out the ATTORNEY gestures toward the mynah -- and BEAMS at the parole board: ATTORNEY Personally trained by my client. INT. PRISON CELL - DAY Free time -- the cell doors are open and the convicts are milling around in the common area. T-BONE, 220 lbs. of dumb, hulking beef, saunters up to his cell and finds his bunkmate, MR. BONIFACE, staring at a stack of EMPTY CAGES. BONIFACE whirls on him suddenly, his face beet-red, APOPLECTIC WITH RAGE: MR. BONIFACE -- Where are my birds?!? T-BONE Shit, Pengy. I let 'em go. MR. BONIFACE Hermione. My canary. It's the dead of winter! T-BONE flops casually on his bunk, obviously enjoying MR. BONIFACE's profound distress. T-BONE They were all cooped up. With you leaving and all -- seemed like the humane thing to do. BONIFACE'S GAZE FALLS on a corner of the cell. He spots a scattering of YELLOW FEATHERS -- a patch of FRESH BLOOD. With a supreme effort of restraint, he turns and forces a smile... MR. BONIFACE I see. -- You might as well have this. I won't be needing it... He tosses a SONY WALKMAN to T-BONE, who flicks it on. The dim strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC are audible through the earphones... T-BONE Well, thanks, Pengy. No hard feelings. (chuckling to himself) Y'know, I'm gonna miss that pudgy little ass of yours. T-BONE tunes the Walkman to a rock station, slips the headset on, grins from his bunk. TWO GUARDS arrive. As they escort him out, MR. BONIFACE mutters: MR. BONIFACE You won't miss it long. EXT. PRISON - MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY It's fifteen degrees outside as MR. BONIFACE -- aka THE PENGUIN -- waddles forth from the prison gates, regally attired in cutaway and pin-stripes. He pauses to inhale a deep lungful of the icy air; then, with a smile of exhilaration, he removes his coat and STRETCHES -- spreading his wings, REVELING in the cold. A STRETCH LIMO pulls up. Two identically gaunt and vulture- like DANDIES, formally dressed, with bowler hats and umbrellas, step out to meet him. These two gentlemen -- FRICK and FRACK -- serve as the Penguin's general factoti and "business managers." FRICK Welcome back, Mr. Boniface. PENGUIN Mr. Frick. Mr. Frack. Our years of planning are about to pay off. INT. LIMO - MOVING - DAY Now that he's loose, the PENGUIN's rapacious side is beginning to show. His eyes twinkle with greed as he contemplates his own ingenuity. PENGUIN I take it they found the money all right? FRACK We buried it exactly as you specified. $42,271,009... PENGUIN How much have we got left? FRICK reaches into his coat for a BALANCE SHEET. FRICK Let's see -- an initial capitalization of 42 million and change, compounded over thirteen years, at an annual return of just under sixteen percent -- PENGUIN Fine, fine. How much? FRICK Seventy-nine million. -- Excluding the sum we buried. THE PENGUIN lets out a dry, heaving CHORTLE, midway between a normal laugh and a DUCK'S QUACK. He checks his watch and reaches into his pocket for a small ELECTRONIC DEVICE. PENGUIN Speaking of burials... EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY T-BONE on work detail. He's got the Walkman on and he's shoveling snow to the beat. He winces, and removes the headphones... The MUSIC he was listening to has been replaced by an eerie, high-pitched WHINE. He's twisting the knob, trying to find the station he was tuned to, when a PIGEON dives down STRAIGHT AT HIS HEAD. T-BONE HEY -- ! He drops the shovel as the bird STRIKES, glancing off his head. Before he can react, THREE MORE PIGEONS have swooped down at him, PECKING at his head and shoulders in a frenzy. He lets out a HOWL and staggers through the prison yard in a frenzy. DOZENS of PIGEONS are pouring over the prison walls, SHRIEKING HIDEOUSLY, descending on him. He falls to the ground screaming for help, but the other prisoners run like rabbits, terrified... By the time the GUARDS come racing across the courtyard, T-BONE's no longer even visible. There's just a swarming, man-shaped mass of PIGEONS, pecking away, flapping their wings insanely. Covering their faces as they move in, the GUARDS blow their whistles -- BEAT AT the pigeons with billy clubs. All at once, the PIGEONS take off en masse -- leaving T-BONE's mutilated corpse sprawled in the yard. A GUARD notices the Walkman, picks up the earphones to listen, and hears nothing but ROCK MUSIC -- "Surfin' Bird" by the Trashmen. Bird bird bird, bird is the word... EXT. ROAD - ON PENGUIN'S LIMO - MOVING An AERIAL VIEW of the LIMO as it cruises down the deserted road leading away from the prison. It disappears from view -- and all at once the frame is filled with PIGEONS, great squalling FLOCKS of them, dutifully following their master as he makes his way back to Gotham City. DISSOLVE TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT ALFRED opens the front door and finds a bundled-up VICKI out on the portico, red-cheeked, flushed, and happy. She pulls him forward, gives him a quick peck on the cheek. VICKI Guess what, Alfred. I think I found a present for Bruce. She's got a long, skinny GIFT BOX propped up against the exterior wall. At first it doesn't want to fit through the door -- it must be eight feet long -- but with ALFRED's help she gets it inside. The faithful butler stares curiously at this odd-shaped gift... VICKI (cont.) Skis. -- Don't let on, okay? ALFRED He won't hear a word of it from me. VICKI He's such a nightmare to shop for. -- What do you get him year after year, Alfred? ALFRED (conspiratorially) I find you can't go wrong with surveillance equipment. Let me put this under the tree... VICKI Not so fast. She reaches into the pocket of her coat and pulls out another small gift. ALFRED stares at the tag -- "TO ALFRED, LOVE VICKI" -- and tries to suppress a HUGE GRIN. ALFRED Why, Miss Vale -- ! VOICE FROM BEHIND What's all this? ALFRED and VICKI turn. It's BRUCE, dressed for dinner, marching down the long stairway in the entry hall. VICKI waves frantically. VICKI Don't look. It's your present. VICKI rushes over to embrace him. He gapes at the long skinny box -- BRUCE What'd you get me? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? VICKI frowns and gives him a kiss. She nestles up against him. WHISPERS in his ear: VICKI I'm going to give you the happiest Christmas you've ever had. Still in the clinch, BRUCE shoots a look at ALFRED. Taking the hint, ALFRED clears his throat and bends to pick up one end of the ski box. He backs out of the entry hall, dragging the box before him... CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM PARK - NIGHT FIRES burn in garbage cans. TENTS and LEAN-TOS dot the snowy landscape. Men, women, and children wander aimlessly, huddling against the cold. An army of the HOMELESS has set up camp in Gotham Park. On the nearby periphery, PICKETERS -- half concerned citizens, half down-and-outers -- are marching the sidewalks, keeping a candlelight VIGIL. Hand-lettered placards read: "SAVE THE PARK." "PARKS ARE FOR PEOPLE." "THIS PARK IS OUR HOME." The source of the protest? A towering SIGN posted in a corner of the park, announcing the imminent consuuction of a new luxury highrise -- the GOTHAM PARK TOWERS -- a project of Shaw Construction, Inc. A LAMBORGHINI sits at a traffic light nearby... INT. LAMBORGHINI - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT BRUCE and VICKI, dressed for dinner, stare out at the demonstration. VICKI Homeless. (beat) I was just down here Tuesday. Seems like there's more every day. BRUCE starts to say something, but can't think of anything to say. VICKI (cont.) Christmas time. And they say there's over a thousand people living in the park already. BRUCE -- Yeah. The light changes. BRUCE throws the car into gear and -- at the next intersection -- turns the car right, into the park. EXT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT Despite the name, it's a tony little bistro catering to Gotham's elite. A PANHANDLER, underdressed for the cold, has been hustling the customers as they come out; a couple of PARKING ATTENDANTS are trying to drag him discreetly away as BRUCE'S CAR pulls up. A VALET opens the car for BRUCE and VICKI, who look on in concern as the PANHANDLER gets the bum's rush. The liveried DOORMAN shrugs apolagetically -- sorry for the inconvenience -- as they enter. INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT Post-dinner. VICKI's got a sheaf of PHOTOS spread out on the table in front of BRUCE -- shots of Gotham's HOMELESS, being forcibly evicted from slum dwellings, erecting their SHANTYTOWNS in Gotham Park. VICKI They're already razing the tenements and SRO's downtown. These people don't have anyplace else to go. (beat) If the city starts selling off the park... BRUCE takes a good long look at his opulent surroundings. HUGE WINDOWS open on a serene and picturesque view of the park; CAMPFIRES flicker in the distance... BRUCE -- Yeah. I guess I'll pass on dessert. VICKI (taking his hand) Bruce, you do a lot more than most people even dream of. BRUCE Sure. Comes off the top of my taxes -- VICKI That's not what I meant. They exchange a long silent look. Of course she's referring to Batman. Still, the argument doesn't hold much water with BRUCE. BRUCE -- What I "do" doesn't come close to the root of the problem, Vicki. (long pause) I'm just a Band-Aid. VOICE FROM BEHIND Bruce! It's been ages! VICKI turns -- and rapidly closes her photo folder. Millionaire construction magnate RANDALL SHAW is in the restaurant table-hopping, and he's just glommed onto BRUCE. BRUCE Randall. You remember Vicki. -- How's the construction business? SHAW The park tower? All systems go. If we can get the junkies and winos cleared out... (a big grin) Not too late to get in on the deal. BRUCE I'll think about it. SHAW Say, Walter Barrett's due back from Europe. We should all get together at the club. (clapping him on the shoulder) Nice to see you again, Miss Veal. "Miss Veal" maintains a big phony smile as SHAW moves off to the next table. She murmurs to BRUCE through clenched teeth: VICKI What a pig. BRUCE I've known him since he was seven years old. He was a pig then too. VICKI Now he wants to gobble up the park... (shivering) Bruce -- isn't there something you can do about people like that? BRUCE What, tie him up with a bat-rope? VICKI No, you idiot. I meant you. Bruce. BRUCE nods -- oh, yeah. Subtle distinction. INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT BRUCE and VICKI emerge from the restaurant. He hands his parking stub to a VALET. A crowd's beginning to form in the lot outside... The red-and-blue bubble of a POLICE CAR is flashing a short distance off, near the entrance to the park. TWO RED BERETS, in full Order-of-the-Bat regalia, look on as a recently-mugged WOMAN JOGGER gives her statement to the investigating COPS. BRUCE and VICKI, intrigued by the Batman-wannabes, move a little closer -- within eavesdropping range: RED BERET I We were on patrol. Saw the whole thing. JOGGER I was attacked. Three men in ski masks -- COP I (indicating the RED BERETS) And these two broke it up? JOGGER These two?? They ran like rabbits. I never saw anybody take off so -- RED BERET II Hey! Somebody had to go for the cops. COP II You. SHUT UP, all right?? (to the JOGGER) Lady, who was it that bailed you out?? JOGGER A kid. Thirteen or fourteen tops. He just came out of nowhere and -- tore into 'em. (shaking her head) It was so quick I didn't even see his face. Nearby, VICKI shoots a highly quizzical look at BRUCE, who responds with a mystified shrug. Her professional curiosity piqued, she wanders over to introduce herself to the JOGGER. An exasperated COP leads the RED BERETS away from the crime site: RED BERET I Dumb shit. Shouldn'ta been jogging in the park at night anyway. (sullenly) Look around you. It's fulla bums. BRUCE gestures at the RED BERET's Batman sweatshirt as he passes. BRUCE Nice outfit. RED BERET I Piss off, geek. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WATERFRONT DISTRICT - NIGHT Snow blankets the abandoned warehouses rimming Gotham Harbor. FOGHORNS blare in the distance as a pair of STILETTO HEELS -- totally inappropriate for the weather -- click across the sidewalk and pause at mid-block, where a wide wooden plank leads down from street level to a seedy hole-in-the-wall bar: the WHARF RAT. INT. WHARF RAT - NIGHT A roughneck joint, about as trendy as the average bait shack. The clientele consists primarily of surly types who are saving up for their next tattoo. A TV over the bar is tuned to the late news: ANCHORWOMAN ...and tomorrow, the city's power elite will be turning out in force to greet millionaire industrialist Walter Barrett, who returns to Gotham after a five-year stay in Europe... The BARTENDER switches to a hockey game, because none of the rowdies at the bar give a shit about Walter Barrett. None, that is, except for a strapping young bruiser named RICKY, who gets up and makes his way to a pay phone in the corner. Moments later, the owner of the high heels enters; she opens her black fur coat and unwraps her muffler, revealing exotic, vaguely Eurasian features. She's dark and elegant, fine- boned, regal of bearing -- and her name, though we don't know it yet, is SELINA KYLE. She's not the kind of girl who typically frequents the Wharf Rat, and so her entrance creates quite a stir. A LONGSHOREMAN at the nearby pool table misses his shot and digs a rut in the felt. Two blowsy WHORES size her up territorially as she finds an open stool at the bar and settles in with serene indifference. The regulars, of course, are all but licking their chops. The only guy in the joint who hasn't noticed her yet is RICKY, who's still on the phone: RICKY Yo. Ricky here. What's the haps? In mid-conversation he notices SELINA. She smiles invitingly -- right at him. Mildly startled, he smiles back. RICKY (cont.) Midnight. No sweat. See you then. He hangs up eagerly. Then, with a deep breath, he hitches up his pants and swaggers over to SELINA's end of the bar. SELINA Well. "Ricky," is it? RICKY How'd you know that? SELINA I heard you on the phone. Talking to your girlfriend. RICKY Girlfriend? No, no. That was business. SELINA makes a big show of peeling off her gloves. SELINA If you've got time for a little pleasure ...maybe you'd like to buy me a drink. She clasps his hand. His EYES BUG OUT. Three enormous rings, a diamond bracelet -- there must be several thousand in rocks on her left hand alone. RICKY gapes at the sparklers, bedazzled. RICKY Jeez -- they look almost real. SELINA Why wouldn't they be? RICKY is not the smoothest guy around, and his line of thought is all too evident. He swallows hard and tries not to stare. RICKY You'd have to be crazy. Nobody'd wear the real thing to a dive like this. SELINA Oh, they're real, all right. So are these. She waves her FINGERNAILS -- long, polished, and talon-sharp -- in front of his eyes. With lightning speed, before he can react, she pins his wrist to the bar -- and with one quick stroke carves a THIN BLOODY STRIPE in the back of his hand. SELINA's eyes flash as he gasps in shock. He tries to jerk his hand away, but he can't break her grip. Then -- her dominance firmly established -- she releases his hand with a coy, Cheshire-cat smile. SELINA (cont.) Weren't we going to have a drink? He blinks, forces a chuckle, smiles unsteadily. She takes his wounded hand, lifts it slowly to her mouth, and LAPS GENTLY at the blood. RICKY is hypnotized. She's got an odd way of flirting, but RICKY finds it somehow -- intriguing. He dabs at his hand with a napkin and signals to the BARTENDER. CUT TO: EXT. WATERFRONT - PIER 31 - NIGHT Just after midnight; the snow's still failing, the waters are icy, and the wharfs are deserted -- almost. A small STEAMBOAT is docked at Pier 31, and the deck is lined with THUGS -- mean, ugly, and heavily armed. A similar contingent of gun-toting GOONS is waiting to greet them on the dock below. The boys on the dock hoist ASSAULT RIFLES as the BOAT THUGS extend a gangplank. Something major is about to happen... The CHIEF DOCK GOON gestures to his LIEUTENANT, who grabs a black MEDICAL BAG. Hands raised, the two of them start up the gangplank. Throughout all this, the DOCK GOONS keep their guns trained on the BOAT THUGS, covering their buddies. One of them turns to a colleague: DOCK GOON I Where's that goddam Ricky? DOCK GOON II Probably out gettin' laid. And here we are freezin' our balls off... EXT. STEAMBOAT - ON DECK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The LIEUTENANT unloads chemical testing gear from his doctor's bag. The lead BOAT THUG gestures to a stack of SHIPPING CRATES which rest atop a large NET spread out across the deck. BOAT THUG I You pick. The CHIEF GOON selects a crate at random. Two BOAT THUGS tip it on its side and, using a crowbar, pry off a FALSE BOTTOM -- revealing a dozen packets of WHITE POWDER. POV SHOT - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT We're now watching the scene from a vantage point atop a ramshackle boathouse at water's edge. Down on the deck of the steamboat, the LIEUTENANT goes to work testing the merchandise. LIEUTENANT It's pure. REVERSE ANGLE - THAT MOMENT A BLACK SILHOUETTE is peering down from the boathouse roof. The mysterious watcher ducks quickly out of sight; the only details that register are a pair of ominously familiar POINTY EARS... CHIEF GOON (O.S.) Let's do it. He gestures to his boys on the dock. A CRANE-AND-WINCH assembly rotates into place over the deck -- and the BOAT THUGS gather up the corners of the netting and attach them to the big hook. BOAT THUG I Hold it. Let's see the money. Down on the wharf, a DOCK GOON kneels beside a metal suitcase and opens it. Lots of long green inside. The BOAT THUG signals thumbs up, and the CRATES rise into the air as the goon with the suitcase starts up the gangplank. LOW ANGLE - ON GANGPLANK - THAT MOMENT The goon with the suitcase marches up. Beyond him, in the distance, a LITHE BLACK SHADOW vaults off the boathouse roof and makes a silent, graceful landing on the long shaft of the CRANE. ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT The moment of maximum tension: grim faces all around, everyone holding a gun on someone else as the suitcase arrives on deck and crane swings over the pier. ANGLE ON CRANE - THAT MOMENT Razor-sharp, CHROME-STEEL TALONS slash suddenly through the air. ON DOCK - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT The netting GIVES WAY, and TWO DOZEN SHIPPING CRATES rain down onto the pier, CRUSHING two DOCK GOONS underneath. The crates explode into splinters, littering the dock with drugs and random ART OBJECTS as the other DOCK GOONS scatter in panic. ON STEAMBOAT - THAT MOMENT Nobody knows quite what's going on. Panicking, the GOON with the suitcase full of money turns tail and dives for the gangplank. BOAT THUG I sees him and squeezes off a quick shot. Winged, the GOON topples off the gangplank and hits the drink, suitcase and all. Pandemonium. All at once, everyone's OPENING FIRE. Thinking he's been double-crossed, BOAT THUG I turns on the CHIEF GOON and SHOOTS HIM TWICE at point-blank range. BOAT THUG I YOU SON OF A BITCH! (to another BOAT THUG) Go after it. Get the money. GO!! He raises his gun, and the second BOAT THUG dutifully obeys -- diving off the deck into a hail of gunfire. Everyone's ducking for cover. BOAT THUG I barks orders at the pilothouse: BOAT THUG I Soltar las amarras! -- CAST OFF!! ANOTHER BOAT THUG LOOK! BOAT THUG I whirls, just in time to see a SHADOWY FIGURE landing cat-like on the deck mere yards away. Clad in inky black leather from head to toe, the intruder's face is concealed by what appears to be a BONDAGE MASK. Studded, with openings for the eyes and mouth, it spans one incongruous touch: a pair of POINTED CAT EARS. She bares her teeth and HISSES. It's a woman. BOAT THUG I is momentarily mesmerized. In the time it takes him to lift his gun, she's produced a CAT-O'-NINE-TAILS. She SNAPS it at him: REELS HIM IN; and with one lethal stroke, RAKES her steel talons across his face and throat. He slumps to the deck, lifeless. The other BOAT THUG rushes her; she catches him under the jaw with a sudden upthrust, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR, and sends him toppling into the water. The gangplank falls aside as the steamboat pulls away from the pier. She hoists an abandoned ASSAULT RIFLE, SCATTERS the DOCK GOONS with a round of automatic fire, and VAULTS off the boat -- landing in a graceful crouch on the edge of the pier. Most of the DOCK GOONS have taken flight, but a few unlucky specimens remain behind. She somersaults forward; takes one goon off his feet with a crack of the whip; knocks another off the dock with a twirling high-kick to the jaw; sends two more reeling with swift talon-slashes. The whole frenzied mop-up action takes just under ten seconds. Alone at last, she stands back to survey the scene. Counting the stiff's on the boat -- which is now receding in the harbor -- there must be well over a dozen dead. The snow is speckled with red. A half-dozen bodies lie sprawled in their own blood; one of them, the lone survivor, is face-down and softly MOANING. Retracting her steel claws, the MASKED WOMAN crouches amid the wreckage of the smashed shipping crates. BINDLES OF WHITE POWDER -- millions of dollars' worth -- are scattered all about the pier, but she couldn't seem less interested. Instead, she's checking the MANIFEST NUMBERS stamped on the sides of the crates. She finds crate #18396-BB and rummages among its contents until she comes up with a carefully-wrapped parcel. She opens it carefully and holds it up for inspection. The statuette of a RAVEN -- carved from solid onyx -- glistens in the moonlight. The WOMAN pauses long enough to slip a small CARD in the MOANING PUNK's back pocket. Then, cradling the raven under one arm, she dashes off on silent cat feet. A LANTERN approaches. It's an OLD SALT -- some kind of hapless night watchman -- and his face goes bone-white at the sight of the carnage on the docks. He kneels beside the moaning punk, turns the body over, and GASPS -- because the PUNK'S FACE has been CLAWED TO SHREDS. PUNK Murcielago. MURCIELAGO!! CUT TO: INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - NIGHT The unique chamber in which we find ourselves is alive with the flutter and song of COLD-WEATHER BIRDS -- dozens of them, all chirping, flitting about in the rafters, alighting on special perches mounted in the walls. At the center of this penthouse room is a vast sunken POOL. ARCTIC TERNS loll on the surrounding rocks as a LACKEY with a wheelbarrow empties cracked ice into the already-frigid water. Carefully landscaped, it looks like the penguin exhibit at the Gotham Zoological Gardens. A MASSIVE, INDISTINCT SHAPE glides beneath the surface. It's not a whale; it's too pink. It is, instead, the PENGUIN -- and as he breaks the surface, sputtering, he sees FRICK standing in the open doorway. FRICK Mr. Boniface? Your...visitor has arrived. PENGUIN Thank you, Mr. Frick. Show her in. The PENGUIN moves to the edge of the sunken pool. Two of his LACKEYS swivel a CROSSBAR, which hangs from the ceiling by a long chain, into place over his head. He grasps it with both hands -- and the crossbar RISES, hoisting his formidable bulk out of the water. INT. HIGH-RISE - CORRIDOR - THAT MOMENT FRICK leads the VISITOR down a long corridor lined on either side with BIRD CAGES -- exotic songbirds with brilliantly-hued plumage. CAMERA TRACKS ALONG behind her, and although we can't see her face, there must be something distinctively feline about her -- because the BIRDS are shrieking and fluttering in their cages, RECOILING INSTINCTIVELY as she strolls past. FRICK opens a door and ushers her into... INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT Our visitor -- SELINA KYLE -- enters the penguin-pool room. Her teeth begin to chatter. The big bay windows have been thrown open, and SNOW is blowing in from outside. It's freezing in here. She sees the PENGUIN -- wearing a thin dressing gown and an APRON outfitted with SEED POUCHES -- scattering birdseed on the window ledge for the pigeons, totally oblivious to the cold. He turns, throws his arms wide in greeting, kisses the back of SELINA's hand. PENGUIN Ah, Miss Kyle! At last we meet. SELINA At last we meet. -- Pigeons? PENGUIN Yes, they're common birds -- dirty, stupid, unattractive -- but they're very obedient, and they do crap on people's heads. May I? She extends a SHOPPING BAG. The PENGUIN removes a parcel and unwraps it, revealing the RAVEN STATUETTE. He sets it on a nearby desk, fondles it reverently...and BEAMS at SELINA. PENGUIN (cont.) I see your reputation was not exaggerated. SELINA I've located the others. All but one. (shivering) I'm surprised you don't catch pneumonia -- ! With an apologetic smile, the PENGUIN pulls the windows shut. PENGUIN My normal body temperature is ninety-two degrees. Germs find me inhospitable. SELINA I see why they call you the Penguin. PENGUIN They may call me that...but rarely more than once. Champagne? She nods. He pours two glasses, hands one to SELINA, raises a toast. PENGUIN (cont.) My dear. Here's to the second biggest crime in the history of Gotham City. CUT TO: INT. POLICE OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT COMMISSIONER GORDON and another cop, LT. EDDIE BULLOCK, are in darkened antechamber adjacent to an interrogation room. BULLOCK It wasn't about the drugs. Whoever it was left thirty kilos sitting on the docks. They're watching, through a two-way glass panel, as a terrified man with a heavily-bandaged face tells his story. It's the lone survivor of the dock massacre, JULIO, and his voice is audible over a concealed intercom: JULIO (filter) Un silueta negra -- con colmillos, y garras -- el demonio. El murcielago. MURCIELAGO! GORDON What's that he keeps saying? BULLOCK "Murcielago." -- Bat. GORDON Nonsense. That dock looked like a slaughter-house. Batman's never committed murder. BULLOCK We did find this in his back pocket. BULLOCK hands GORDON a CARD. It reads: "THOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH" -- and in lieu of a signature, there's a little black BAT-EMBLEM in the bottom corner. While GORDON's staring at it, a POLICEMAN pokes his head in: POLICEMAN Commissioner? We've got Barrett. INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT A cubicle down the hall. The splenetic WALTER BARRETT, millionaire industrialist, is fidgeting in his chair as GORDON enters. BARRETT Fine welcome. These storm troopers of yours dragged me away from my coming-home party! (beat) I'd like to know the meaning of this -- GORDON I'd like to know how thirty kilos of pure cocaine wound up concealed in your personal effects. BARRETT Gordon -- I come from one of the oldest and most influential familles in Gotham. If you plan to accuse me of smuggling drugs, be my guest. (long, menacing pause) I'll have your badge before you leave this room. GORDON weighs the threat. He nods to the COPS in attendance... GORDON Book the son of a bitch. GORDON storms out. BARRETT jumps out of his chair, but the COPS restrain him. Outraged, he bats their hands away... BARRETT I believe I'm still entitled to a phone call. CUT TO: EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - DAY VICKI with her camera, squeezing off snaps. She's standing behind a SAWHORSE, part of a crowd of onlookers at a downtown DEMOLITION SITE. SURVEYORS and HARDHATS bustle about in a VACANT LOT, a full city block in size, fenced off and strewn with rubble. The only structure still standing is a lone, decrepit TENEMENT BUILDING; a WRECKING BALL is poised above it, ready to strike. A SIGN at one corner of the lot announces a forty-story OFFICE COMPLEX soon to be erected on this site by SHAW CONSTRUCTION, INC. Down below is RANDALL SHAW HIMSELF, in necktie and hardhat, speaking into a WALKIE-TALKIE: SHAW Come on! Let's move it! We're an hour behind as it is!! A few moments later, a CLUSTER OF PEOPLE emerge from the tenement building -- a mixed team of COPS and CONSTRUCTION GOONS who are forcibly removing a DESTITUTE FAMILY from the condenmed building. VICKI watches angrily... HER POV - TELEPHOTO LENS A quick series of shots: the SQUATTERS wailing and struggling, clinging to the doorways, unwilling to leave. Their few belongings are packed in a couple of CARDBOARD BOXES, which the cops heave rudely out onto the street. Finally, the handcuffs and nightsticks come out... ANGLE ON SHAW - THAT MOMENT - DAY A SURVEYOR grabs SHAW by the arm and points out the woman taking photos in the crowd. SHAW recognizes her instantly. His face turns into a mask of outrage -- as if he's been personally betrayed. SHAW Jesus Christ, that's Bruce Wayne's bimbo! He makes eye contact with her. VICKI stares back defiantly. He's about to stroll over and tell her off when a HARDHAT signals to him: HARDHAT Phone call, Mr. Shaw. Guy said it's urgent. SHAW (to tbe SURVEYOR) Hold the ball. I wanna hear it crash. He climbs into the cab of a nearby TRUCK, where he picks up a CELLULAR PHONE. INTERCUT - BARRETT AND SHAW BARRETT's still in custody at the police station -- using his one phone call to contact the construction magnate. BARRETT It's me, Randall -- Walter Barrett. I want you to call my attorney. That was my shipment they busted up last night. SHAW Jesus, Walter, I -- (suddenly puzzled) Why are you calling me?? BARRETT It's worse than that. Somebody took my raven. SHAW stares at the phone in horrified disbelief. ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT SHE WATCHES as SHAW climbs out of the truck -- numb, in a daze. He signals to the WRECKING BALL OPERATOR; a WHISTLE blows, and the great iron ball knocks a MAMMOTH HOLE in the facade of the tenement. SHAW doesn't even stick around to watch it. He scurries off to his car at the end of the block. VICKI, highly intrigued, gets it all on film... INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY VICKI's in a huddle with the Managing Editor, SCHULTZ, showing him her PHOTOS -- SHAW orchestrating the eviction of the SQUATTER FAMILY. SCHULTZ Great stuff, but we're looking at a shitfight with our beloved publisher. He and Shaw... (crossing his fingers) Old money sticks together. VICKI points to a photo of SHAW racing from the truck to his car. VICKI I'd sure like to know what shook him up so. He was out of there like a scared rabbit... Just then, a reporter -- WILK -- rushes up excitedly to SCHULTZ's desk. WILK Got a blind tip from downtown. You know that massacre on the docks? Batman. VICKI reacts in astonishment. SCHULTZ's jaw drops -- this is hot. EDITOR Whoa! Is this on the level? WILK Cops even got a note. "Those who feed on the soul of Gotham will suffer my wrath!" (grinning; to VICKI) Sounds like your pal's cranked it up a notch. VICKI starts to protest, but thinks better of it. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - EVENING ALFRED opens the door. A BANNER HEADLINE stares him in the face: BATMAN IMPLICATED IN DOCK MASSACRE Industrialist Linked to Drug Smuggling Ring VICKI, who's holding up the afternoon paper for ALFRED's inspection, peeks out glumly from behind the masthead. VICKI Seen the late edition? ALFRED I'm afraid so, Miss Vale. Master Bruce is sequestered in the cave. INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING On their way to the Batcave, ALFRED and VICKI pass through the library. They pause in front of the television -- which is tuned to a PANEL SHOW, with various experts discussing the hot issue of the day. ENVIRONMENTALIST (on TV) Walter Barrett's no saint. His factories have been dumping poison into the air and water for years. If he is mixed up with drugs... PUNDIT (on TV) That's not the issue. The issue is, do we entrust our public safety to some...masked vigilante. Does Batman have a license to kill? ALFRED (shaking his head) Ah, the public. Dishearteningly fickle. VICKI follows ALFRED out. We HOLD on the TV as the CAMERA PANS OVER to the third guest on the panel, loudly demanding air time. He's wearing a RED BERET and a BATMAN SWEATSHIRT: MIKE SEKOWSKY (on TV) Yo, here's the tip, man. Drug dealers are scum. If Batman did wax these punks...SO WHAT? They deserved it! End of discussion. INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING ALFRED and VICKI arrive; BRUCE gestures for them to keep quiet. He's hunched over a TAPE RECORDER -- and COMMISSIONER GORDON'S VOICE is blaring from a nearby speaker... GORDON (O.S.; filter) Anyone could've written that note. INT. GORDON'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT GORDON's in conference with a number of CITY OFFICIALS -- blissfully unaware that anyone might be eavesdropping. CITY OFFICIAL I And I suppose anyone could've taken out a boatload of armed thugs. A dozen men, Jim -- murdered in cold blood -- GORDON Before we forget, Batman's saved hundreds of lives! CITY OFFICIAL II He's still a vigilante. We don't know who he is, where he comes from, why he does it... CITY OFFICIAL I Street punks are one thing, Jim. This is Walter Barrett -- a personal friend of mine! As the conversation continues, CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN ON a COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner. We see the tiny TRADEMARK embossed on the CPU -- "WAYNE TECHNOLOGIES." INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - ON BRUCE as he LISTENS through his concealed bug. CITY OFFCIAL II You've gotta bring him in, Jim -- at least for questioning. It would sure help if we could get that mask off... BRUCE shuts the recorder off. He turns to face ALFRED and VICKI -- BRUCE Ladies and gentlemen...I've been framed. CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT The BAT-SIGNAL blazing in the night sky. After a beat, the CAMERA TILTS DOWN to a cluster of EXCITED CITIZENS, who point and holler as the BATMOBILE streaks past. INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT TWO COPS are parked in an alleyway, watching as the BATMOBILE whizzes past on the street. The DRIVER pulls out behind it as the second COP grabs his radio mike... COP One-delta-niner -- 10-80 on Riverview north-bound at 33rd -- 10-78, repeat 10-78. VOICE ON RADIO (filter) 10-4, one-delta-niner -- that's a 10-37, repeat 10-37. Backup on the way. EXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE BARRELING TOWARD US on the street. The SQUAD CAR gains behind it. A SIREN HOWLS; a red-and-blue bubble begins to flash... The BATMOBILE makes a HAIRPIN TURN -- and ACCELERATES. OVERHEAD ANGLE - THE STREETS As the BATMOBILE rounds the corner and picks up speed, TWO MORE SQUAD CARS scream down the cross street, joining in the pursuit. All at once THICK BLACK SMOKE billows from the back of the Batmobile -- ENVELOPING the police cars, BLINDING THE DRIVERS... EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TWO SQUAD CARS parked in a V-formation -- a makeshift roadblock. ANXIOUS POLICEMEN mill about in front of them. They move into position as the BATMOBILE, still trailing smoke, rounds a corner and careens directly toward them... ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT The FRONT FENDER of the Batmobile detaches and EXTENDS itself from the body of the car. It BENDS in the middle; WING-PANELS flip into place, forming an arrowhead-shaped COW-CATCHER. EXT. STREET - ON ROADBLOCK A SHRIEKING HORN BLARES. The COPS see the Batmobile SPEEDING UP and dive for the sidewalk. The COW-CATCHER slams into the SOUAD CARS, pushes them effortlessly aside, and cruises through the gap. As the PURSUING CARS emerge from the smoke cloud and follow the Batmobile through, we TILT UP to the roof of a nearby building -- EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT -- and realize that the Batmobile's on automatic pilot, because BATMAN's been on the roof all along -- watching the action with some dismay. His relationship with the Gotham PD appears to be on shaky ground. He speaks into his voice-activated REMOTE CONTROL UNIT: BATMAN Evasive. SIRENS HOWL below as he strolls across the rooftop, lost in thought. CUT TO: INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT At this height, the SIRENS are a distant insect drone. We're in the palatial digs of RANDALL SHAW, the construction magnate. There's obviously money to be made in real-estate development -- because the walls are lined with art, and the floor-to-ceiling windows open on the most spectacular view in Gotham. At the moment, SHAW's posing casually in front of his new Brancusi -- which rests on a pedestal near the windows. An UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN in a slinky black dress LOOKS ON, her back to the camera... WOMAN It's a fake. SHAW Hmm. It cost me a half a million dollars. You're sure? WOMAN Absolutely. You see, I...happen to know where the real one is stashed. The WOMAN wanders out of frame as SHAW smiles, impressed. He seems peculiarly nonchalant about the whole deal; at the moment, art is not the first thing on his mind. CAMERA STAYS ON HIM as he pours two glasses of red wine and circles in on his mysterious guest. SHAW I guess you'd know. I have some "friends" in the art world. They say that -- for certain hard-to-get items -- you're the one to call. WOMAN (O.S.) How flattering. SHAW They say for the right price...you could steal Michelangelo off the Sistine Chapel Wall. WOMAN (O.S.) Mr. Shaw. Do you believe everything you hear? SHAW Oh, I'm not one to judge. I admire people who take what they want. I'm just curious how you do it. SHAW hands her the wine, and for the first time we see her face. It's SELINA KYLE, perching seductively on the arm of the sofa... SELINA I find that the old methods work best. Setting her wine down, flashing her patented Cheshire-cat smile, SELINA moves in on him -- and they go into a deep, passionate kiss. Her long red nails dig into his back; SHAW drops his wine glass, which SHATTERS -- splashing red wine across the polished parquet floor. INT. PENTHOUSE - SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT The action's gone horizontal. SELINA, peeled down to a sheer lace teddy, is on the bed atop SHAW -- tickling his throat with quick, lapping kisses. She rolls off suddenly; when he tries to sit up, she pushes him back down with a single finger. Sitting on the edge of the bed, she peels off her STOCKINGS, twisting them around into tight cords. With a coy smile she runs her finger in a circle around SHAW's hairy chest -- and then, abruptly, knots one stocking tightly about his wrist and ties it off on the bedpost. SHAW Hey, what are you doing -- ? He tries to break her grip. She BACKHANDS him sharply across the face. SELINA You're very inquisitive. You'll just have to be disciplined. An EDGY SMILE spreads across his face as she binds his other hand to the bedpost. None too quick, he's just caught on that all this is part of SELINA's kinky scene. She crosses quickly to the bathroom -- SHAW You know, I've...I've never really done this kind of thing before. -- and reemerges wearing her CATWOMAN mask...which seems perfectly appropriate in this context. SELINA I think people should indulge their fantasies. Don't you? Now that he's all trussed up, she crosses the room and reaches into an oversized bag. She withdraws an odd-looking chromium BRACE, slips it on over her wrist, and hits a trigger. SIX- INCH STEEL TALONS snick into place. SHAW's dopey smile fades... SHAW Hey, what are those -- what are you -- He lets out an awful, shrill SHRIEK as the camera WHIP PANS away from the bed to a Jackson Pollack on the wall nearby. A SPRAY OF BLOOD spatters across it -- in an aesthetically pleasing way -- and the SHRIEK ends in a LOW GURGLE as we CUT TO: INT. BUILDING LOBBY - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT A SECURITY GUARD is working a crossword at his booth near the entrance of the building. Behind him, a bank of MONITORS show various empty hallways throughout the building. He reaches for his coffee and sees a RED LIGHT flashing on a wall panel nearby. INT. SHAW'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT The penthouse is THROBBING with the clangorous sound of a BURGLAR ALARM. SELINA is standing by an OPEN WALL SAFE -- concealed behind a painting, which has been swung away on hinges -- and she's HOLDING HER EARS, wearing a look of complete exasperation: oh, shit. The GUARD'S VOICE crackles over a nearby intercom: GUARD (O.S.; filter) Mr. Shaw? What's going on up there? -- Mr. Shaw? Furious with herself, she reaches inside the safe and extracts a BLACK RAVEN statuette -- identical to the one she took on the docks. She slams the door shut and swings the picture back into place. EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT SIRENS echo in the streets. SQUAD CARS make sudden turns and streak off toward SHAW's building. EXT. ROOFTOP - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT Watching the cars from his rooftop vantage, BATMAN raises an ANTENNA mounted on his utility belt and cups one hand to his head. An EARPIECE concealed inside his cowl gives him the police frequency: DISPATCHER (O.S.; filter) -- possible 15 in progress, 188 E. 69th at Gotham Park West. Move out. It's Randall Shaw. Repeat, all units -- BATMAN's eyes widen. He steps to the ledge and pulls a TINY METAL CYLINDER from his belt -- immediately recognizable as part of BRUCE's hydraulic umbrella-gizmo. But it's no umbrella. When BATMAN thumbs the switch, his BLACK CAPE begins to SPREAD and RISE -- stiffening, expanding -- INFLATING itself into a pair of RIGID BLACK BATWINGS. He steps OFF THE LEDGE, INTO MIDAIR -- SOARING SILENTLY ACROSS THE STREET LIKE A HUMAN HANG-GLIDER as the cop cars cruise past far below. INT. SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT There's an awful BANGING at the front door. SHAW lies under the bloody sheets, hands folded, staring lifelessly up at the ceiling. SELINA, now dressed in full Catwoman regalia, slings a lightweight KNAPSACK over her shoulders. She picks up the nearest chair, RAMS IT through SHAW's plate-glass window, and clambers out onto the ledge outside. Ten seconds later the COPS burst in. They rush to the bedroom -- spot the shattered window, the inert gory mass on the bed -- -- but the real shock comes when they glance over at the wall. Painted there, in blood...is a big, red, dripping BAT. COP JESUS! EXT. ROOFTOP - SHAW'S BUILDING - NIGHT Forty stories up. The CATWOMAN, in a surefooted crouch, she scurries along the ledge -- SPRINGS at a cornice -- and in one lithe motion VAULTS UP onto the ROOF. She scampers across the rooftops, dropping from one to the next with rope and tackle, like a mountain climber -- -- until she reaches the building at the end of the block. Here she pauses to dig in her knapsack. She pulls out a retractable HOOK at the end of a rope, swings it around, HEAVES IT at the rooftop across the street... EXT. STREET BELOW - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT POLICE pile out of cars and race for the entrance, totally oblivious to the odd scene taking place overhead -- where the small, barely-visible figure of a WOMAN, clad entirely in black leather, is doing a TIGHTROPE WALK across the intersection. EXT. ROOFTOP - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT The CATWOMAN bounds across snowy rooftops until she decides she's out of danger. Then, weary and exhilarated, she drops to her knees; bathed in moonlight, she preens, stretches, emits eerie little purrs and hisses of pleasure. She's just made a kill and her blood is running high, so she's stopped for a moment of Quality Time. She hears an odd crunching noise two roofs over. Her whole body tenses and -- though her head doesn't move -- her eyes dart left. A CAPED SHADOW has just touched down at the end of a line. The gold BAT-EMBLEM on his chest is visible for the briefest of seconds before he steps back into the shadows. She acts like she hasn't noticed... ...but a little smile flickers across her lips just the same. TIGHT ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT His eyes widen -- his LIPS PART as he watches her. If it's possible to see absolute consternation behind that mask, we're seeing it now. HIS POV - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT She still doesn't let on that she's seen him. Instead, she goes to the ledge of the roof and begins to STRUT, like a gymnast on the balance beam -- POSING for him in a little private show -- a strange, self-infatuated, AUTOEROTIC DANCE ROUTINE for BATMAN's benefit. EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT His jaw is down around his knees. Whoa. He edges forward slightly, as if hypnotically drawn to her... She hears a noise. Stops. Makes a big show of looking left and right. Somehow afraid she'll see him watching, BATMAN jumps back into the shadows. She gathers her things; a small WHITE CARD flutters from her knapsack to the snowy roof, and she VANISHES over the edge. Snapping back to reality, he bolts across the roof just in time to see -- EXT. SIDE OF BUILDING - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT She's rapidly working her way down the side of the building, flipping down from one fire escape to tile next -- a master gymnast. Three stories up, she lands on a railing, then STOPS -- LAUNCHING HERSELF out over the street, making a perfect landing on the roof of a passing BUS. EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT BATMAN turns -- and his eyes fall on the WHITE CARD. He kneels to pick it up; a brief three-word MESSAGE is scrawled upon it... LOOKING FOR LOVE? He goes goggle-eyed with astonishment. He rushes back to the edge of the roof and sees the BUS just turning toward the entrance to Gotham Park. He's reaching for his grappling-gun, figuring to follow, when a FLOODLIGHT catches him full in the face. EXT. STREETS BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT Down below, the cops are sweeping their beams across the rooftops. Two of them catch a quick glimpse of BATMAN just as he ducks back behind the cornice, out of view. COP Hey. You see what I saw...? This sends the astounded COPS rushing to their radios. Right on cue, COMMISSIONER GORDON's car pulls up. LT. BULLOCK, who's already on the scene, fills him in as he climbs out. BULLOCK It's Randall Shaw. Torn to ribbons. -- We just made Batman up on the roof. GORDON Oh God. EXT. GOTHAM PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The BUS rumbles deeper into the snowy park. A BLACK SILHOUETTE springs off the roof into the trees, disappearing among the branches... We TRACK WITH the bus as it moves through the park, arriving finally at: EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - SHANTYTOWN - NIGHT The little colony of HOMELESS PEOPLE in their cardboard shacks and lean-tos, still occupying the future site of the Park Towers. MARCHERS and PICKETERS are continuing their protest nearby, and some charitable organization's set up a makeshift soup kitchen on folding tables -- hot coffee and sandwiches. VICKI's on the periphery of the camp, camera in hand. She's trying to persuade a HOMELESS MAN to let his picture be taken. VICKI Please, just one. It's important for people to see what's happening. HOMELESS MAN They don't want to see us, lady. They just want us gone -- out of sight, and out of mind. (mumbling as he wanders off) Get worse before it gets better. It always does. VICKI TURNS. In the distance, the PICKETERS are shrieking and wailing. A VAN's just pulled up to the edge of the park, and a dozen HARDHATS are elbowing their way through the crowd. All at once they're swarming through shantytown with TIRE IRONS and BASEBALL BATS, overturning the sandwich tables, RIPPING DOWN the shabby tents and lean-tos. Some of the HOMELESS PEOPLE run. Those who resist meet with swift and sudden violence. A MARCHER jumps a hardhat, and gets a baseball bat in the gut for his trouble. VICKI waits for the police sirens, but they don't come. She backs off toward the trees, she begins SNAPPING PHOTOS FRANTICALLY, capturing the carnage on film. A HARDHAT is dismantling a lean-to with his tire iron -- sending the terrified family inside scurrying off into the snow -- when he glances up and sees VICKI taking his picture. He points her out to a colleague... ...and suddenly the two of them are RUSHING TOWARD HER with pure cold malice in their eyes. VICKI turns to run, but it's slow going in the snow. She SLIPS and FALLS; her attackers are almost upon her... ...when a SHADOWY FIGURE DIVES OUT OF THE TREES and TACKLES one of the HARDHATS. The FIGURE lands a powerhouse blow to the fallen HARDHATs jaw, knocking him out cold. The second HARDHAT turns and lifts his TIRE IRON. But the FIGURE, with surprising agility, is already rolling out of the way. As he rolls, he grabs the first guy's HARDHAT off his head and brings it up in front of him -- blocking the blow from the second guy's tire iron. In the same motion, he plants a FOOT in the second HARDHAT's belly and sends him REELING BACKWARD, HARDHAT II drops the tire iron, and the FIGURE snatches it out of midair as he gets to his feet. He moves in on the second HARDHAT, BRANDISHING the iron -- -- and while HARDHAT II is staring at it, the FIGURE HIGH- KICKS HIM in the face. HOP; KICK. HOP; KICK. The FIGURE has nailed him three times squarely on the jaw before he can hit the ground. The FIGURE turns toward VICKI. Her eyes go wide with astonishment. It's a KID, thirteen or fourteen at the outside, sunken-eyed, grimy-looking, in a torn-and-tattered RAINCOAT. She stares at him for the briefest of instants before he rushes off to the aid of his fellow homeless... She can't believe what she's seeing. The KID wades smack into the midst of the remaining HARDHATS, and kicks ass -- spinning, pirouetting, kicking, clawing in a furious display of pure athleticism. It seems like he's everywhere at once. There's only one other guy in Gotham City who can handle himself like this... Rallying behind him, the MARCHERS and HOMELESS PEOPLE snatch bats and tire irons from the fallen HARDHATS -- and the tide turns. The invasion is being repelled. Faced with renewed resistance, the few HARDHATS still left standing TURN TAIL and race off to their VAN. Triumph in shantytown. The MARCHERS and HOMELESS cluster together to lick their wounds -- and the KID, satisfied that everything is under control, turns and sprints off toward the trees. But one prostrate HARDHAT is only playing dead. As the KID runs past, the HARDHAT extends a TIRE IRON into his path -- TRIPPING HIM, sending him sprawling in the snow. The KID throws up his hands as the HARDHAT prepares to smash down at him... CLANG. The HARDHAT drops his tire iron and topples over, BOARDLIKE. The KID looks up and sees VICKI standing there with a baseball bat. He gives her a quick nod of acknowledgement as he gets to his feet -- thanks for returning the favor. He's about to light out again when -- VICKI WAIT! Don't be afraid. I wanted to thank you. I -- KID (cautiously) Twenty. VICKI What? KID Twenty bucks. VICKI's mildly taken aback, but she reaches for her purse just the same. She's barely gotten her wallet open when the KID snatches the bill out of her hands. They stare at each other for a long moment -- VICKI ...Who are you? KID Dick. -- and then he's bounding off like a shot. VAULTING up into a tree and vanishing amid the snowy branches. VICKI starts to follow, but there's no way she can keep up. Instead she digs into her CAMERA BAG... HER POV - THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS Using the long lens, she tracks the KID's progress through the treetops. She can't actually see him, but occasional chunks of SNOW and ICE are falling to the ground as he jumps from limb to limb... For a moment it seems like she's lost him. As she sweeps the lens back and forth, scanning the trees, she catches sight of an EQUESTRIAN STATUE in the distance. She ups the magnification so she can see the plaque on the pedestal. The stone figure on the horse is Union war hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE -- BRUCE's great-grandfather. As luck would have it, the KID drops to earth not ten feet from the statue -- VICKI's got him in her sights again. He looks around cautiously to make sure no one's following, then races toward a STONE BRIDGE which arches between two small hillocks, over a frozen creek. There's a DRAINAGE TUNNEL, four or five feet in diameter, mounted in the bridge abutment, the KID pries off a wire grate and clambers inside, then pulls the grate back into place behind him. Home sweet home. EXT. PARK - ON VICKI - NIGHT as she lowers the lens. Her face is full of conflicting emotions. She'd love to corner this boy vigilante and find out what his story is. But on the other hand -- even the homeless are entitled to their privacy... CUT TO: INT. PENGUIN'S AVIARY - NIGHT A CANARY sings in its cage as a BLACK CAT watches transfixed from a nearby chair. The cat arches its back -- waits -- and SPRINGS AT THE CAGE, BATTING at it in midair. The canary SHRIEKS; the cat YOWLS; a WOMAN snatches it up off the floor, cradles it in her arms... WOMAN'S VOICE Now Hecate. You don't want that scrawny little bird -- It's SELINA, looking ripe and slinky in a sheer black ensemble. At the desk behind her is the PENGUIN, in his customary cutaway and waist-coat, polishing his new RAVEN. He bares his teeth: PENGUIN Do you want me to wring that creature's neck? SELINA You try it, I'll do the same to you. (as he grumbles; bemused) I saw him, you know. PENGUIN Saw who? SELINA Batman. He was dreamy. She strokes the cat, in a reverie. The PENGUIN drops his polishing cloth, startled. PENGUIN Dreamy?!? Are you insane!? My God -- (sputtering wildly) Are you sure it was him? What did he do? SELINA He stood on a roof and watched me. He didn't realize I'd seen him. I don't think he knew quite what to make of me. (smiling) But he was definitely interested. This sends the PENGUIN into a frantic round of pacing. (Or waddling.) PENGUIN This scheme of yours is backfiring. We don't need him on our tails. Do you know how much money is at stake here? SELINA Money isn't everything. (casually) What's the point if we can't enjoy ourselves? She chuckles to herself. He stares at her in disbelief -- and SQUAWKS. CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - MORNING The big SIGN over Gotham Square tells us there are only 9 shopping days left until Christmas. Down below, BRUCE is walking VICKI to work. VICKI Six-on-one, and he took 'em all out...then vanished into a drainage pipe -- right next to the statue of General Wayne. BRUCE My illustrious great-grandfather. Think it's the same kid we heard about? VICKI Must be. He reminded me of you. BRUCE chuckles. They pass a NEWSSTAND just outside the Globe building, pausing to stare at the headlines -- which SCREAM: NEW BAT-MURDER? Batman Suspect in Slaying of Millionaire Developer Commissioner Gordon Refuses Comment The accompanying photo is a full-color spread of the BLOODY RED BAT painted on SHAW's wall. BRUCE scowls at VICKI: BRUCE -- You work for this rag? (snatching up a paper) Your boss is calling for Gordon's resignation -- unless he brings Batman in for questioning... VICKI nudges BRUCE and points at a STOREFRONT across the street. THEIR POV - SOUVENIR SHOP The owner is in the store window, hastily removing all of his Batman merchandise and setting up new displays devoted to TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES and THE SIMPSONS. A MOTHER drags her squirming TODDLER past the entrance -- the kid smells heavy markdowns on Bat-shit, but Mom clearly doesn't approve... BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND VICKI looking on in dismay. BRUCE crumples the paper in outrage: BRUCE I need a good PR man. NEWS VENDOR Hey, pal -- you buyin' or borrowin'? With a sullen look, BRUCE tosses the paper back on the rack. VICKI pulls him off toward the entrance of the Globe. VICKI That's what happens when you go after the rich and powerful. BRUCE Hey, it wasn't me, remember? I am rich and powerful -- As he's talking, BRUCE glances back at the newsstand. He sees an AD FLYER tacked up on one side -- "LOOKING FOR LOVE? Find it in the GOTHAM GLOBE PERSONALS." Looking for Love. Eyes widening, he digs in his pocket for a quarter and races back to the newsstand. VICKI keeps walking... VICKI Maybe it's almost...good. In a weird way. I mean, Shaw, and Barrett -- if people like that were really scared, maybe they'd -- She suddenly realizes she's talking to herself. She turns around and sees BRUCE back at the newsstand, hurriedly unfolding a copy of the Globe. She marches back and tugs at his sleeve. VICKI (cont.) Hey, I'm late for work. You can read that later. BRUCE Quiet. I'm looking for a personal ad. Her face screws up in confusion as BRUCE frantically scans the page. BRUCE (cont.) "Tall, Dark And Handsome -- You saw me on the roof 12/16. I was in black; you were too." VICKI Is this some kind of bad joke? BRUCE It's her. That cat woman, or whatever she is. (reading aloud) "I jumped a bus into Gotham Park hoping you'd follow, but you were too shy..." VICKI What does she want -- a date? BRUCE She's trying to contact me. Says she's gonna leave me another ad... The two of them exchange a look of utter perplexity. BRUCE's mind is racing; he seems bizarrely aroused -- in a way that makes VICKI just a trifle nervous... INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY VICKI arrives at her desk and sets her portfolio down. She spots a message in the "in" file. She takes one look at it, and her eyes go wide with RAGE. She storms out in a fury... INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - A MINUTE LATER - DAY Barging past a phalanx of SECRETARIES, VICKI bursts into the inner office of HARRISON J. PROVOST, publisher of the Globe. He's just opening his mail. He heaves a weary sigh as VICKI BARKS at him: VICKI WHY DID YOU KILL MY STORY? PROVOST Close the door. (waiting for her to calm down) Your story isn't news. With Shaw dead -- VICKI But the project's still going ahead! If attacking homeless people in the park isn't news, I'd like to know what is -- PROVOST There's a psycho out there in a mask and cape -- killing off Gotham's most prominent citizens! That's news. (beat) I've known Randall Shaw all my life. His family is in mourning. And it just so happens I don't believe in slandering the dead. VICKI FUMES. She turns and stares PROVOST straight in the eye. VICKI Mr. Provost -- how much money do you have tied up in the Park Tower project? PROVOST Vicki...I'm going to forget you made that remark. For the sake of your job, I suggest you do the same. VICKI stalks of -- and PROVOST goes back to his mail. He finds an envelope addressed in a shaky, psychotic scrawl, with the word "CONFIDENTIAL" underlined three times in ink. He tears it open -- -- and HIS FACE TURNS PALE as he stares down at the contents: a small business-sized card, signed with a BAT-EMBLEM... THOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY WALTER BARRETT and his ATTORNEY emerge onto the front steps of the courthouse. BARRETT is instantly mobbed by REPORTERS. REPORTER I Mr. Barrett! Any comment on the arraignment? REPORTER II Is it true bail was set at two million dollars? ATTORNEY Stand back! My client has nothing to say at this time! The ATTORNEY clears a path for BARRETT, who climbs into a waiting CAR, shielding his face. REPORTERS cluster around it... As the car pulls out into traffic, we see a flock of PIGEONS taking wing from their perches on the statues outside the Hall of Justice. OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR PIGEONS fill the frame, swooping down toward the CAR, which is idling at a traffic light far below. INT. BARRETT'S CAR - THAT MOMENT The liveried DRIVER drums his fingers as he waits for the light to change. BARRETT's in the back, speaking into his cellular phone. BARRETT It's time we called an emergency meeting of the Raven Society. Get back to me... Looking troubled, he hangs up. A fat white glob of PIGEON SHIT splatters across the windshield. Seconds later -- another SPLAT. BARRETT (cont.) Damn pigeons. DRIVER Just washed it, too. The DRIVER reaches for the wiper switch. They hear a tiny DINK as a SOLID PELLET bounces off the windshield. BARRETT and the DRIVER exchange a mystified look. A small, blinking CAPSULE has just lodged in the wiper-blade assembly... OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR Just as the light changes, the CAR EXPLODES into a million fragments -- leaving a BLACKENED CRATER in the middle of the intersection. CUT TO: INT. BATCAVE - DAY TIGHT ON A VIDEO MONITOR -- showing FIRE TRUCKS in the intersection we've just left, hosing down the wreckage of BARRETT's car. BRUCE is watching intently when ALFRED appears behind him. ALFRED The Fluegelheim called again, sir. They want to know if you'll be attending the opening of the new Egyptian exhibit. BRUCE, still engrossed in his news broadcast, waves ALFRED off. BRUCE Cancel. ANCHORWOMAN (on TV) -- and, citing new evidence in the so- called string of "millionaire murders," Police Commissioner J.T. Gordon today swore out a warrant for the arrest of Batman. (beat) We go now live to Mike Sekowsky, spokesperson, Order of the Bat. SEKOWSKY Jeez! Talk about gratitude -- !! At the sight of SEKOWSKY's face, BRUCE kills the sound in disgust. ALFRED looks on helplessly as he paces the floor of the Batcave. BRUCE Well, Alfred, it's official. I'm a wanted man. (beat) "New evidence"...I've gotta find that woman. Did you check the personals? As ALFRED shakes his head no, a BUZZER sounds. They've got a visitor. BRUCE hits a switch on a monitor, and sees COMMISSIONER GORDON'S CAR sitting outside the wrought-iron gates of Wayne Manor. He throws a nervous look at ALFRED. ALFRED speaks into a microphone: ALFRED Who's there? GORDON Jim Gordon, Alfred. I've got to see Bruce. A spooky development. Does GORDON suspect? After a moment's hesitation, BRUCE nods to ALFRED -- let him in. ALFRED Mr. Wayne will see you, sir. INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER A curious BRUCE ushers GORDON into the library, gestures toward the liquor cabinet. The Commissioner nods his head no. He's fidgety, ill at ease -- he obviously doesn't want to be here. GORDON Sorry to bother you. Bruce -- I'll get right down to it. You knew Shaw and Barrett -- BRUCE I saw them occasionally. We all sat on the board of the Fluegelheim... GORDON Did you have any...dealings with them, or -- BRUCE No. I never liked the way they did business. GORDON The thing is, Bruce, you're all lumped together in the public mind -- the Five Families of Gotham, that sort of thing -- and, uh... (taking a card from his pocket) Harrison Provost got this in the mail. BRUCE examines the card, -- "THOSE WHO FEED," etc. He stares at GORDON in mock-concern, playing it close to the vest... BRUCE Then Batman is behind all this. GORDON Batman or a damned good imitation. BRUCE Well. He's changed tactics, hasn't he. GORDON (shrugging; at a loss) Shaw, with his high-rises -- Barrett, a druglord, major polluter -- they weren't exactly model citizens. Who knows, it could be some crazy social-conscience kind of thing. BRUCE You mean he's going after...the root of the problem. GORDON shakes his head and gets up to go. BRUCE hands him the card. GORDON Let me know if you get one of these. We'll put all our resources at your disposal. BRUCE nods thoughtfully as ALFRED appears to see the Commissioner out. A moment later, the butler reappears. BRUCE Changed my mind, Alfred. I'll be dropping in on the Fluegelheim after all. CUT TO: INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT It's a party to celebrate the opening of the new Egyptian exhibit, and the Fluegelheim is hopping. BOARD MEMBERS, MUSEUM PATRONS, and SOCIALITES mill about in dinner jackets and evening gowns, making small talk. AN OPEN SARCOPHAGUS has been set up as a wet bar. On a raised concrete platform in the center of the hall, rimmed by a decorative moat, sits an ancient Egyptian SHRINE. The TEMPLE OF BASTET has been moved to Gotham and reconstructed in the Fluegelheim --sandstone walls, fountains, statuary and all. Guarding the entrance is a stately bronze statue of the goddess BASTET -- who has the body of a woman and the head of a pointy-eared CAT. She holds an aegis and a sistrum; four tiny KITTENS romp at her feet. BRUCE, who's just arrived, is taking an intense interest in the cat-goddess... VICKI What is it? BRUCE I just had a weird sense of deja vu. He glances over by the sarcophagus and sees PROVOST, the publisher, huddle with ELIOT TIPTREE III, transit magnate -- the remaining member of Gotham's "Five Families." The two of them are engaged in some urgent conversation which he can't quite make out... TIPTREE Harrison -- we really ought to warn Bruce. We owe him that much. BRUCE detaches himself from VICKI and strolls toward them. PROVOST and TIPTREE force smiles and wave, affecting an air of nonchalance. PROVOST (cont.) The man's a space cadet. Let him look out for himself. (as BRUCE arrives; cheerfully) Why, Bruce! What a delightful surprise. BRUCE Good to see you two. Looks like the Five Families are suddenly down to three. (looking around) In fact, if somebody dropped a bomb on this room right now -- TIPTREE chuckles nervously. PROVOST is even less amused. PROVOST Is that your idea of a joke, Bruce? BRUCE Not at all. Commissioner Gordon seems to think we should all be hiring bodyguards. TIPTREE PROVOST Oh, that's absurd. I already have. The two of them glower at each other. It's like an outtake from The Newlywed Game. BRUCE shrugs it off and makes a vacuous face: BRUCE Thing is, I can't imagine why Batman would be after us. Can you? PROVOST and TIPTREE are about to go into another round of hemming-and-hawing when a NEW FACE joins the party. It's SELINA KYLE -- stunning as ever in an extravagantly revealing dress slit up to the armpits. She's holding two glasses of CHAMPAGNE... SELINA You two look like you need a drink. -- And is this who I think it is? She flashes BRUCE her most winning, seductive, heavy-artillery SMILE. He BLINKS, temporarily speechless. PROVOST Selina Kyle -- Bruce Wayne. SELINA Our absentee board member! I've been wanting to meet you forever. TIPTREE Selina's the new Curator of Antiquities. She brought the Temple over block by block -- SELINA You two won't be terribly upset if I borrow Bruce for a moment, will you? Before he can protest, she's linked an arm around his and dragged him off. A nearby FAT MAN spots SELINA, wiggles his eyebrows and WAVES BRIGHTLY. His tongue is practically hanging out -- he's just dying to write her a check. SELINA SIGHS WEARILY to BRUCE: SELINA (cont.) Major contributor. -- I always seem to wind up in charge of fund-raising... BRUCE I can't imagine why. SELINA Tax year's almost over, you know. I hope we can count on your usual generous donation. (indicating PROVOST and TIPTREE) Someone's got to set an example for those two tightwads. BRUCE They're proccupied. This string of murders -- SELINA I asked them if they'd consider including us in their wills. (chuckling to herself) They didn't seem a bit amused... ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT She's making small talk with a bunch of STUFFED SHIRTS and their overdressed WIVES. She glances across the room at the statue of Bastet, sees SELINA draped all over BRUCE. A frown crosses her face... ANGLE ON BRUCE AND SELINA - THAT MOMENT She's still clinging to his arm as they stare up at the statue. SELINA -- and this is my good friend Bastet, the Egyptian Cat Goddess. BRUCE I think we've already met. -- This is quite an expedition you've put together. SELINA I'm glad you think so. I have to say, Bruce -- you're not at all what I expected. BRUCE Sorry to disappoint you. SELINA Oh, it's not that. Not at all. It's just that I'd always heard you were... BRUCE What? SELINA (coyly) Oh...sort of a... BRUCE (smiling; fascinated) No. Come on. What? BRUCE's state of mounting infatuation is abruptly shattered when VICKI sidles up alongside him and -- territorially -- takes his other arm. The women exchange big, toothy, plastic smiles; stranded in the middle, BRUCE realizes they're waiting for him to introduce them. BRUCE Oh. Selina Kyle -- my friend Vicki Vale. SELINA The photographer. I've seen your pictures in the Gazette. VICKI The Globe. SELINA Oh, that's right. The tabloid one. -- What an original dress! VICKI, still smiling, cocks an eyebrow at BRUCE. He senses trouble coming and tries to head it off at the pass. BRUCE Selina supervised the reconstruction of the temple. Brought it back from Egypt... stone by stone. VICKI Really. She must be awfully tired. (to SELINA) How'd you get to be in charge of a huge project like this? SELINA It was easy. I slept with the Pharoah. She laughs at her own joke. VICKI responds with a dry little chuckle of her own. SELINA gives BRUCE a SHARP YANK on the sleeve. SELINA (cont.) Excuse us, won't you, sweetheart? We have some boring museum business to talk about. VICKI fumes. BRUCE shrugs apologetically as SELINA drags him off out of earshot. SELINA (cont.) I. Short leash. BRUCE Pull in the claws, okay? She's really terrific. SELINA I'm sorry, Bruce. Sometimes I get a little...aggressive, you know? (handing him a card) Look, I need to talk to you. Come by sometime. I'll give you the private tour. BRUCE Wait. Let me explain about Vicki -- SELINA (shushing him) I understand. Anyone who's that protective must have a pretty good reason for it. She shoots him one last smile -- sly, conspiratorial, unmistakably juicy. Then she's off in pursuit of another major funder. BRUCE is thoughtfully turning the card over in his hands when VICKI rejoins him. VICKI How's "business"? BRUCE Relax, okay? I like you better. He scans the room, trying to find PROVOST and TIPTREE. No luck. VICKI If you're looking for your fellow millionaires, they left some time back. CUT TO: INT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT The roof of the Gotham Globe. A STARLING circles overhead for a moment -- then DIVES down an exposed VENTILATION SHAFT. INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT TWO ARMED BODYGUARDS are standing watch outside an office. Brass letters on the door read "J. HARRISON PROVOST, PUBLISHER." INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT PROVOST, agitated, working late. He speaks, sotto voce, into the phone: PROVOST Don't worry about that. I've had the office swept for bugs. No one's listening... INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TIPTREE in his paneled study at home. There's an open bottle on the table and he's been hitting the sauce -- hard. His VOICE QUAVERS: TIPTREE It's just so -- unfair. I mean...it was over a century ago. It's not like we're responsible. (hollow-eyed) How could he know? How could Batman know about the Raven Society?? INT. OFFICE - ON PROVOST - THAT MOMENT PROVOST Who knows and who cares. The point is, it's happened... He hears a CHIRP and looks up. It seems to be coming from a HEATING VENT on the wall. But then it stops, so he resumes his conversation -- PROVOST (cont.) I'm clearing out of the country, and I'm taking the raven with me. I suggest you do the same. INT. HEATING VENT - THAT MOMENT In the metal shaft on the other side of the grate is a tiny BIRD -- the same one we saw flying down the air shaft. Now that we've got a close-up view, we can see the thin BATTERY PACK wired to its underbelly...and the MINIATURE MICROPHONE taped to its leg. PROVOST (O.S.) I'll tell you how to reach me. And don't repeat this to anyone. CUT TO: INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - DAY The PENGUIN stands over his indoor penguin pool. He's wearing rubber gloves, feeding LIVE FISH from an ice chest to his arctic birds. The vents in the windows are open, and the climate in the room is downright icy as SELINA's wrapped in fur, stroking her pet cat: SELINA He's just another rich idiot. (chuckling to herself) The odd thing is, he didn't seem a bit concerned. PENGUIN Then he is an idiot. SELINA He lives in some big sprawling manor. I'll have to get inside, scope it out... see where he's got the raven stashed. PENGUIN How do you plan to do that? SELINA How do you think! A feline smile from SELINA. The PENGUIN chuckles to himself, lobs a FISH out over the pool. A swooping GULL snatches it out of the air before it hits the water. FRICK arrives in the doorway. FRICK It's Mr. Provost, sir. He's planning to embark on an unscheduled Christmas vacation. PENGUIN Good! That should save us a trip to the bank. CUT TO: INT. FLUEGELHEIM - BACK ROOM - DAY A huge open room cluttered with all kinds of junk: archaeologist's tools, restoration equipment, etc., plus a healthy assortment of curios and oddities from all over. This is SELINA's private domain. CAMERA TRACKS past a glass case full of ugly, withered, turdlike specimens... BRUCE What have we got here? SELINA Mummified cats. Bastet's sacred animal. They were buried by the thousands at Bubastis. -- Oh, careful! BRUCE FREEZES with his hand poised over a set of four earthen JARS. Each has a lid carved in the shape of a HEAD: ape, jackal, man, falcon. SELINA (cont.) Canopic jars. In the process of mummification, the internal organs were buried separately. (pointing to each jar in turn) Lungs -- stomach -- liver -- intestine -- BRUCE withdraws his hand with a bemused shudder. BRUCE You're in a gruesome line of work. SELINA Keeps me interested. And that's not easy to do... BRUCE's attention turns to a crumbling statuette of an odd beast: a WINGED LION with the head of a FALCON. BRUCE This one I know. It's a gryphon, right? SELINA Very good. A mythical demon, half-bird, half-lion...sweeping down from the sky to deliver retribution and justice. BRUCE nods. He can dig it. He regards the gryphon for a long moment and CHUCKLES. BRUCE Poor guy. Birds and cats -- you wouldn't think the two halves would cooperate. SELINA Only under certain circumstances. (beat) I'm really glad you came, Bruce. I was afraid I'd given you the wrong impression. Or maybe it was the right impression. BRUCE What was it you wanted to talk to me about? SELINA Your collection. I'd love to see it. I mean, everyone says you've got a fabulous -- She breaks off in midstream and chuckles to herself. She toys demurely with her equipment. She looks up at BRUCE and switches tactics -- going for the direct approach. BRUCE braces himself... SELINA (cont.) Mainly I just wanted an excuse to see you again. Does she know you're here -- Vicki? BRUCE (shrugging) No. SELINA It must be strange. Having all that power, and money -- never really knowing if that's what people are attracted to. BRUCE What are you attracted to? SELINA I think you're a little bit nuts. (beat) I think you're a little -- bored with your life. Having everything you want. No variety, no...danger. And every once in a while you need to take a risk. Shake it all up. BRUCE How? SELINA Maybe by...coming here today. She leans back against a crate, moistens her lips. She's letting him have it with both barrels. SELINA (cont.) That's one thing I can give you, Bruce -- danger -- a little something you can't get at home. BRUCE hesitates -- but the lure is irresistible. He moves forward slowly; SELINA's eyes close; their lips draw slowly closer... ...and he SNEEZES IN HER FACE. She backs off in shock as he covers his face. His eyes are watering and he's WHEEZING. She rushes over -- SELINA Are you okay? BRUCE Is there a cat in here? Right on cue, SELINA's black cat HECATE lets out a loud MEOW -- and STRETCHES against BRUCE's pants leg. He brushes the animal aside and it LEAPS into SELINA's arms. BRUCE sniffles uncontrollably. BRUCE (cont.) Get it away! She drops the cat, which scampers off. BRUCE rubs his eyes. SELINA Poor thing. You're allergic! BRUCE Yeah, cats...ever since I was a kid... (snorting and weeping) Look, I'd better get some fresh air. Maybe another time, okay... He heads for the door before SELINA can stop him. He's gone, but she knows she's left a dent in his armor. She smiles in bemusement as HECATE jumps into her arms and PURRS. EXT. FLUEGELHEIM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY BRUCE stumbles out the museum feeling mildly discombobulated. He marches down the front steps past a NEWSSTAND -- where he stops to buy a copy of the afternoon GLOBE. He opens it to the PERSONAL ADS and finds what he's been waiting for: TALL, DARK, AND HANDSOME -- Christmas is coming. Why don't we trim the tree together? This puzzles him for a moment -- until he looks up the street. In the distance, at the very center of Gotham Square, WORKMEN are stringing lights around an enormous CHRISTMAS TREE, almost fifty feet tall. The LIGHTING CEREMONY is an annual event in Gotham. BRUCE smiles slightly, tucks the paper under one arm and walks to his car. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT SNOW falls on a huge CROWD gathered around the big tree. The tree won't be lit for another twenty minutes or so, and so the ONLOOKERS are singing CHRISTMAS CAROLS from printed lyric sheets. A BAND is playing on a makeshift ORCHESTRA PLATFORM erected in front of the tree, leading the crowd in a spirited rendition of "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen." The Square is rocking with good will toward men. When they get to the part about saving us all from Satan's power -- EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT -- the CAMERA TILTS UPWARD to BATMAN, watching the action from his usual gargoyle's perch. He's scanning the streets and the rooftops, waiting tor the CATWOMAN to make her move -- whatever it is. He glances at the building directly across the square from him. On the roof is a neon sign reading Gotham City Globe in ornate old-English letters -- and above that, a ROTATING METAL SCULPTURE of the world turning. His eyes rove downward along the facade of the building... EXT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT At street level, an ARMORED CAR has pulled up in front of the Globe offices. THREE SECURITY GUARDS with rifles climb out of the ARMORED CAR, followed by a FOURTH -- who has an OBLONG BOX handcuffed to his wrist. Of course, we can't see what's inside, but to those of us in the know the box looks just about the right size for a RAVEN STATUETTE. The GUARDS scan the street and enter the building without incident. As they do, a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN crosses the frame; mounted on its side is an ADVERTISING PLACARD which reads: BATMAN: HERO OR MENACE? Read All About It in the GOTHAM GLOBE! EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN He watches with some curiosity. An armored car: is this some part of the CATWOMAN's scheme? But no...the GUARDS are safely inside the building, and the CAR is leaving. He settles back to wait. INT. NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN - THAT MOMENT The innocuous-looking VAN rounds the corner of the Globe building. FRICK is at the wheel, FRACK is riding shotgun, and the PENGUIN is between them, peering out eagerly through the windshield. They turn into the Globe's BASEMENT GARAGE -- where dozens of similar vans are parked at the LOADING BAYS. Just part of the fleet... INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER The quartet of SECURITY GUARDS arrive at PROVOST's office. The publisher has already packed his suitcases for a speedy getaway. The LEAD GUARD -- the one cuffed to the RAVEN BOX -- sets his precious cargo on a desk and stands discreetly at arm's length while PROVOST unlocks it and checks its contents. Satisfied, he slams it shut. He reaches into his top drawer for an ENVELOPE, which he hands to his PERSONAL SECRETARY. PROVOST Open this in an hour. Phone my wife and tell her where to meet me. (to the GUARDS; edgily) No trouble on the way, I take it? LEAD GUARD No sir, Mr. Provost. We came straight from the bank vault. GUARD II 'Copter should be just touching down. We'll have you safely out of here in no time. EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN "Here Comes Santa Claus" echoes up from the streets. BATMAN watches as a COPTER descends toward the HELIPAD on the roof of the Globe... INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER PROVOST and the LEAD GUARD with the raven box are at an elevator bank. The other GUARDS head for a stairwell. GUARD II We'll check the stairs. See you on the roof. The LEAD GUARD starts to press the UP button, but PROVOST pulls a key from his pocket instead: PROVOST No -- my private elevator. It's safer. INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT shooting DOWN on the car as it rises. The shaft above it is filled with BIRDS -- starlings, crows, pigeons and the like, swooping and gliding among the gears and cables... EXT. ROOF OF GLOBE BUILDING - THAT MOMENT In BG, the helicopter on its pad, idling noisily, the rotors still spinning. In FG, the small dormer-like structure that houses the STAIRWAY. The metal access door opens, and the first of the GUARDS steps warily out, rifle at the ready. He smiles back at his pal. GUARD No way. They don't pay us enough to tangle with Batm-- A black-gloved, CHROME-TALONED HAND snakes around the edge of the dormer and RAKES ACROSS HIS THROAT... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT SWEAT beads up on PROVOST's lip as the GUARD hits the up button and the car begins to rise. Suddenly, the LIGHTS GO OUT. The car stops with a lurch. PROVOST What is it?? What's happening?? Suddenly, there in the darkness, they hear a series of loud POPPING SOUNDS...which could be gunfire... EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - ON CROWD singing "Here Comes Santa Claus" at the top of their lungs. Happy faces beam. No one hears anything unusual over the music... EXT. ROOFTOP - ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN BATMAN straining to listen. We get another faint series of POPS -- barely audible over the CAROLING from below, and the loud PUTT-PUTT-PUTT of the helicopter blades. He can't really be sure he's heard anything at all. He scans the roof of the Globe building, but he can't see what's happening beyond the big steel globe sculpture and the neon sign... EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN lets fly with another burst of automatic fire from the dead GUARD's rifle. The helicopter is still idling, but no one's left to fly it -- the rooftop is littered with stiffs... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT PITCH BLACK. Pre-verbal GROANS and MURMURINGS OF FEAR issue from the darkness. An EERIE RED LIGHT kicks on -- the emergency generators -- and we see PROVOST backed up in a corner of the car, twitching and jumping like a crazed spastic. The GUARD, in a futile effort to placate him, points up at the LIGHT: GUARD There. Mr. Provost. See? The generator's kicked in. It's just an electrical problem. PROVOST is only marginally consoled. They hear a strange TWITTERING NOISE in the shaft above them... PROVOST starts babbling again. The GUARD slaps him across the face. But the TWITTERING has him a bit concerned as well. He stares up at the ceiling of the car as he PUNCHES BUTTONS on the panel; with another LURCH, the car begins to move. GUARD There. See? It's moving. We're fine. PROVOST It's going down. We're going DOWN!!! INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT The BIRDS in the shaft have all ROOSTED on the TOP OF THE CAR. They're patiently riding it down as it descends... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT The car stops again. PROVOST is totally losing it. The exasperated GUARD grabs him and SHAKES HIM. GUARD Okay, Mr. Provost -- I'm gonna have a look through the trap door. But I need you to help me. Okay? You have to help. PROVOST nods and tries to get a grip on himself. The GUARD looks up at the trap door in the ceiling of the car. He can't reach it... He uncuffs the BOX containing PROVOST'S RAVEN from his wrist -- and STANDS on it. Still short. Unholstering his gun and using it as a prod, he can almost reach the trap door. He JUMPS UP and, poking with the gun, manages to dislodge the panel slightly. More TWITTERING. PROVOST and the guard look up through the tiny crack in the ceiling and see nothing but darkness. GUARD Probably just some bird that's gotten in the shaft. Now calm down. You'll have to give me a boost. The GUARD climbs back atop the raven box. PROVOST gives him a boost and he manages to catch hold of the lip of the trap door. GUARD (cont.) Okay, help me out...steady... PROVOST wraps both arms around the GUARD's wriggling LEGS and tries to hoist him upward. INT. SHAFT - ON ROOF OF CAR - THAT MOMENT From a vantage level with the roof of the car, we see the GUARD'S FINGERS, clinging to the lip of the trap door. Now his HEAD rises into view, pushing the panel aside as he pulls himself upward. He peers around. His BROW wrinkles as he sees a bizarre sight -- PASSELS of SQUAWKING BIRDS, walking back and forth in front of him, STRUTTING and PREENING mere inches from his face... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT The bottom half of the GUARD dangles from the ceiling. PROVOST still has his arms wrapped around the GUARD's knees. All at once, the GUARD begins to SCREAM -- his body JERKS and his legs KICK WILDLY. Still PROVOST struggles to hang on -- even as BLOOD spatters across the top of his bald dome... Finally, the GUARD's violent spasms are too much. PROVOST trips over the raven box, stumbles backward and lands on his ass in a corner of the car. The GUARD tumbles in a heap to the elevator floor, his face PECKED and CLAWED beyond recognition, his eyes gone altogether. PROVOST lets out a series of SHRIEKS. He peers at the open trap door, sees the BIRDS staring curiously down at him, and SHRIEKS AGAIN. The EMERGENCY TELEPHONE rings. He stares at it. It rings again. Shielding his eyes and screwing up his courage, PROVOST crawls across the floor and reaches for the receiver. PENGUIN (V.O.; filter) Sixteenth floor. Linens, housewares, ladies' lingerie! PROVOST W-who is this?? INT. GLOBE - BASEMENT LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VANS are parked in neat rows -- all driverless. FRICK is sitting with a boxful of electrical equipment next to a bank of ELEVATORS; all the cars have been LOCKED OPEN here in the basement, except for ONE -- PROVOST's private elevator, the doors to which are still closed. The PENGUIN stands beside it, speaking into a RED PHONE. PENGUIN Mr. Provost? If you want to get out of that car alive, I suggest you follow my instructions to the letter. As he talks, we see various NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES sprawled on the concrete nearby, DEAD. A CORRUGATED METAL DOOR has been lowered over the LOADING BAY, separating the newspaper production staff from the VAN POOL. They're trapped on the other side. BANGING AWAY LOUDLY on the door... PENGUIN (cont.) SHUT UP IN THERE. (calmly; into phone) You should see a cord hanging just behind you. INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT PROVOST looks over his shoulder and sees the aforementioned CORD descending through the trap door. PROVOST Yes -- yes, I see it -- PENGUIN (V.O; filter) Tie the cord to the handle of your box. PROVOST lets the phone drop. He grits his teeth, but hastens to obey. As he's knotting the cord around the handle of the box, a DINKY BIRD flutters down through the trap and sends him into a panic. Practically weeping, he reaches for the phone. PENGUIN (V.O.; filter) When you're done, I want you to give two sharp yanks on the cord. Cowering in terror, PROVOST reaches for the cord and yanks it twice. PROVOST Who are you?? Why are you doing this?? INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN Behind him, FRICK and FRACK are pulling on RED BERETS and BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS -- Order of the Bat gear. FRICK climbs into a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN and starts the engine. PENGUIN Well, Mr. Provost, I guess you could call me an irate reader. And to be perfectly frank -- I'm doing this because I hate Garfield. Chuckling, the PENGUIN holds a SONIC DEVICE up to the mouthpiece of the phone. INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT A SHRILL WHINE emanates from the receiver. All at once, the elevator car is FULL OF BIRDS -- squawking wildly, flinging themselves against the wall, going insane in the tiny confined space. PROVOST is screaming like a madman. The birds are in his hair, his face -- everywhere. He fights his way over to the panel and begins punching buttons in a frenzy... All at once the car PLUNGES DOWNWARD. It's as if the floor has DROPS AWAY beneath PROVOST's feet -- he's in FREE-FALL. INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN PENGUIN Going down! He hangs up the phone and steps a discreet distance back from the ELEVATOR DOORS. INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT The RAVEN BOX dangles from its cord in FG as the CAR rockets uncontrollably downward. A steady stream ot BIRDS are making a quick exit from the trap door in the roof... INT. TOP-FLOOR LANDING - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN's on a landing near the stairwell, just below the dormer that leads to the roof. She pries open a pair of ELEVATOR DOORS... ...and a FLOCK of BIRDS pours out of the empty shaft, making for the open ACCESS DOOR a half-story above. She reaches inside, finds the cord attached to the RAVEN BOX, and reels it in. She rips off the lock and opens the box for a quick look at her trophy. It's there, all right -- another RAVEN just like the first two. An awful CRASH, from twenty-five stories down, RATTLES THE SHAFT... She makes a disgusted face, grabs the RAVEN, and bolts for the roof. EXT. ROOFTOP ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN He watches in puzzlement as a VAST FLOCK OF BIRDS takes flight from the Globe roof across the square. Something weird is definitely going on. He's about to abandon his post -- -- but down below, the CAROLERS have stopped CAROLING. The big tree's about to be lit, and they're counting off the seconds: CROWD Ten! Nine!... EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - CORNER NEWSTAND A ramshackle kiosk at street level. The NEWS VENDOR has stepped out onto the sidewalk to watch the tree festivities. A GLOBE DELIVERY VAN, its side bearing the "BATMAN -- HERO OR MENACE?" advertisement, cruises past and dumps a bundle of papers on the curb. EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE EXCITEMENT is BUILDING as the seconds tick off: CROWD ...Three! Two! One! The CHRISTMAS LIGHTS come on, and the CROWD breaks into CHEERS. The ORCHESTRA strikes up a sprightly version of "JINGLE BELLS." EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON NEWSTAND The NEWS VENDOR is applauding and singing along like everyone else when a second newspaper van rumbles past... NEWS VENDOR Hey! No! I aleady got a -- He spots TWO MASKED MEN in the doorway of the van -- wearing RED BERETS and BAT-SHIRTS. They shove a BODY out the door -- The mutilated corpse of HARRISON PROVOST lands on the sidewalk with a THUD -- right beside a bundle of NEWSPAPERS which read "BATMAN MURDER SPREE BAFFLES POLICE." EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON VAN - MOVING The NEWS VENDOR chases after the VAN, but it's already rounded a corner and is cruising along the periphery of Gotham Square. The CROWD is still singing merrily, unaware of its presence -- -- until the BACK DOORS fly open -- and a swarm of RABID, CHITTERING BATS screech out into the midst of the crowd!! EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE The CAROLERS break into MASS HYSTERIA as HIDEOUS BATS swoop down from above, CLAWING at their heads and shoulders. ORCHESTRA MEMBERS drop their instruments and stagger off the BAND PLATFORM, falling into the branches of the giant Christmas tree. EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON SIDEWALKS CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS are teeming in and out of nearby STORES. They drop their SHOPPING BAGS and race about in utter CHAOS as the bats attack. WOMEN SCREAM. CHILDREN SCREAM. MEN SCREAM TOO. A MAN staggers backward through a GLASS STOREFRONT and lands on his butt in a WINDOW DISPLAY -- a big mechanical SANTA CLAUS on his North-Pole throne, chuckling merrily in a prerecorded voice: "HO HO HO." The MAN STRUGGLES WILDLY as the BATS converge on him. INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - THAT MOMENT HORRIFIED SHOPPERS scatter through the aisles as the BATS pour in through the broken window. WOMEN lined up for a FREE MAKEOVER squeal in panic as BATS arrive to rearrange their hairdos. EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN He stares down stunned at the PANDEMONIUM raging below. He glances across the street...and sees the TINY SILHOUETTE of a WOMAN standing atop the cast-iron GLOBE SCULPTURE, LAUGHING at the chaos, TAUNTING him. EXT. STREETS - OVERHEAD ANGLE - THAT MOMENT A few blocks away from Gotham Square. SIRENS HOWL. There's a steady stream of COP CARS speeding toward the site of the disturbance. One vehicle is moving in the opposite direction, against traffic -- a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN. EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - A MOMENT LATER BATMAN touches down on the roof and stares in horror at the CORPSES strewn across the helipad. A dying GUARD raises a shaky hand... BATMAN crouches beside him. A GURGLE comes up from his throat and a bubble of BLOOD swells on his lips. All at once he hears a WOMAN'S VOICE from the shadows of the GLOBE SCULPTURE... CATWOMAN (O.S.) Some people just can't take discipline. (beat) Go ahead. Finish 'em off... His head jerks up. He can't see anything. A sudden WHOOSHING noise, and now the voice is coming from the other side of the roof. CATWOMAN (O.S.) You might as well. You're going to get blamed for it anyway. He stands. He gets a quick glimpse of a FELINE SHADOW springing past a skylight; she's jumping all around the roof, clinging to exposed pipes and fixtures. He reaches for a Batarang. CATWOMAN (O.S.) Oh, come on, angel. You know you want to. (purring loudly) Besides -- I want to see how you do it! BATMAN Who are you? He's barely gotten it out when she SLAMS INTO HIM from behind, feet first, knocking him to the rooftop. He tries to get up, but she comes at him with a couple of CARTWHEELING KICKS, knocking him back into a cornice. He ducks right just as a SHARP SPIKED HEEL strikes the exposed brick a mere three inches from his throat. He catches her leg, upends her -- but she somersaults away and lands on her feet. Cats always do... CATWOMAN My, aren't we frisky tonight. He flings the BATARANG. It CLANGS into the big NEON SIGN as she SPRINGS up into the darkness, out of reach. GLASS TUBING shatters and SPARKS FLY as she calls down from the shadows -- CATWOMAN I should tell you -- I've got nine lives to play with -- and you've only got one... He turns -- she drops DIRECTLY ONTO HIM -- and locked in a death grip, they STAGGER BACKWARDS across the roof, directly toward the HELICOPTER. The huge ROTOR BLADES are still turning... BATMAN ducks instinctively and the CATWOMAN breaks free -- FALLING BACKWARD onto the roof. It's a strategic move: when he rushes at her, she BRACES HERSELF against the ground and KICKS UPWARD with startling force. This time the spiked heel connects -- LIFTING BATMAN off his feet, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARD into the TAIL of the HELICOPTER. He slumps there, stunned -- and before he knows it, she's on him. She grabs his THROAT with one hand and clamps the other around his CROTCH. He tries to break her grip, but she's just as strong as he is. And she's LIFTING him -- forcing him upward, toward the REAR STABILIZING ROTOR on the tail of the helicopter! The rear ROTOR BLADES WHINE LIKE A BUZZSAW as his head rises perilously closer. At the last possible instant, he grabs a handful of her HAIR -- YANKS IT as hard as he can -- With a YOWL, she releases him. They tumble to the roof and she DIVES ATOP HIM. Her TALONS click into place -- he sees them poised directly above his EYES -- -- but manages to slam an ELBOW under her chin before she can strike. Now they're disentangled; they get up groggily and circle each other... SOMEONE IS BANGING on the metal door that leads up to the roof, trying to break it down. BATMAN turns for an instant -- a sudden CRACK -- -- and he finds himself all wrapped up in the CATWOMAN's CAT- O'-NINE-TAILS...which is also outfitted with a TASER. She sends a PARALYZING ELECTRIC CHARGE through his body and he collapses to the roof in a jittering heap. The BANGING on the door is louder... CATWOMAN Did I tell you I invited company? -- Keep 'em busy, angel, I've gotta scat. She kneels down and plants a BIG WET KISS on his twitching face. Then she scurries to the edge of the roof, DISAPPEARING -- -- just as the DOOR gives way -- and an ARMED SWAT TEAM comes crashing out onto the roof! Just coming around, BATMAN tries to roll out of sight -- but the COPS are swarming the place. They spot the BODIES on the tar and gravel, see BATMAN scuttling for cover, and draw the obvious conclusion. Pulling guns, they OPEN FIRE. BULLETS RICOCHET off the big metal GLOBE. BATMAN, as is customary in these situations, shoots a GRAPPLING HOOK at the roof of the next building over -- which is a couple of stories taller than the Globe -- and REELS HIMSELF UPWARD along the side wall. The SWAT COPS score a couple of dead hits which set him swinging like a pendulum, but his body armor holds and he clings to the line long enough to reach the roof. CUT TO: INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT FRlCK and FRACK, still in their Order-of-the-Bat garb, are in the front seats; the PENGUIN is leaning out the side door. Someone's obviously tipped the COPS about the source of all the ruckus -- -- because a pair of POLICE CARS are on their tail and gaining fast. Still hanging in the doorway, the PENGUIN raises his UMBRELLA, peers down its length like a RIFLE SIGHT, and PULLS A TRIGGER. ANGLE ON SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT A SONIC DART -- one of the PENGUIN'S BIRD MAGNETS -- lodges itself in the GRILLE of the foremost POLICE CAR. INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT The COPS in the car react in astonishment as PIGEONS begin HURLING THEMSELVES at the WINDSHIELDS. A DOZEN KAMIKAZE BIRDS bounce off in rapid succession. CRACKS begin to spread across the glass. The COPS can't see where they're driving. The car SWERVES WILDLY. And still the PIGEONS KEEP COMING -- COVERING THE WINDSHIELD -- TOTALLY OBSCURING THE STREETS FROM VIEW... EXT. STREETS - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT The first car, COMPLETELY COVERED WITH BIRDS, smacks into a LAMPPOST and SKIDS. The second car CRASHES INTO IT. And the pigeons continue to pour down from the heavens, SWARMING onto the immobilized squad cars. INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT The PENGUIN grins with delight as the van speeds off unmolested. PENGUIN Look at that, boys -- they do flock together!! CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT AMBULANCES are pouring into the square as the BAT ATTACK continues. COPS are firing their guns blindly into the skies as they try to evacuate the citizenry. PARAMEDICS drop the stretcher they're carrying when BATS swoop down at their heads... EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT BATMAN is still pursuing the CATWOMAN, who's perched one roof over, in a squat, wiggling a finger for him to follow. The roofs are icy and treacherous, but he matches her step for step, leap for leap, as she vaults from one building to the next, leading him on. Finally she reaches the edge of a building on the corner of the block; there's no place to go but down. She squats on the ledge and smiles, beckoning to him -- CATWOMAN Ooh. Where have you been all my life? He edges closer. Suddenly, she does a BACKFLIP -- DIRECTLY OFF THE EDGE OF THE ROOF. BATMAN hears GLASS SHATTERING. He hesitates a second -- moves closer to the edge of the roof -- PEERS OVER THE ICY CORNICE. BATMAN'S POV - THAT MOMENT Staring down, he sees a narrow LEDGE running around the facade of the building some ten or twelve feet below. The window of a corner apartment has been smashed; the curtains are flapping in the chill wind. EXT. ROOF - ON BATMAN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT She's obviously making her getaway through the apartment. BATMAN climbs up on the slippery cornice and prepares to drop to the ledge below -- cautiously, because it's a long way down. A sudden CRACK -- The CATWOMAN hasn't entered the apartment. Instead, she's followed the ledge around the corner of the building, silently doubling back onto the roof behind BATMAN. He TURNS just as her WHIP wraps itself around his left leg. She gives it a sharp tug -- his feet SKID on the ice -- and HE TOPPLES OVER THE EDGE OF THE ROOF. EXT. FACADE OF BUILDING - ON BATMAN He plunges downward for the briefest of seconds -- then JERKS UP SHORT, SLAMMING INTO THE WALL OF THE BUILDING. The WHIP has coiled itself around his leg, and for now it's holding tight. He's dangling upside down, bat-like; he bounces away from the wall; he SPINS in midair as one loop of the whip UNRAVELS, dropping him another foot or so. He manages to brace his left foot against the wall. It's a massive strain, but he's momentarily safe if he can keep from moving. The alternative is a twelve-story drop, straight down to the pavement... EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT She's wrapped the handle-end of the whip around an exposed pipe on the roof, anchoring BATMAN in place. With a cheshire- cat grin, she removes the RAVEN from her knapsack and holds it on the edge of the cornice. EXT. FACADE - THAT MOMENT BATMAN hanging immobile. Craning his neck, he can just see the RAVEN STATUETTE on the ledge above him -- bouncing slightly, and apparently talking to him... CATWOMAN (O.S.) Nevermore. Nevermore! Now the CATWOMAN appears beside it -- elbows on the cornice, chin propped up on her folded hands, like a chatty girl at a fern bar. CATWOMAN Cute, huh! I think it'll look nice over the fireplace. Maybe you can drop by and see it sometime. (demurely) I hope you won't think I'm too... aggressive or anything, but I find you very attractive. She toys aimlessly with the whipcord, batting at it like a cat with a piece of yarn. BATMAN grimaces. She speaks in a low, soothing, seductive tone -- almost a purr. Behind the bondage mask she bats her eyelashes. CATWOMAN (cont.) It's just so hard to meet interesting men these days. Don't you think so? (sighing) I have trouble with relationships. Men find me intimidating...kind of predatory, you know? Really I'm not. Really I'm just playful... BATMAN huffs and puffs, trying to bend at the waist so he can grab hold of the whip. She frowns and YANKS on it. His foot flies free of the wall, and another loop of the whip uncoils before he can stabilize himself. CATWOMAN (cont.) Don't laugh! I'm trying to open up to you! Angrily, she holds a STEEL CLAW to the whip -- ready to cut him loose. ANGLE ON BATMAN He's palmed the GRAPPLING-HOOK LAUNCHER from his belt. Holding it close to his body, out of view, he works it around into firing position. He'll shoot it right through her if he has to... CATWOMAN (cont.) I always seem to fall for the wrong guys. You know...most men are rats. ANGLE ON CATWOMAN She withdraws her hand from the whip, reverts to her philosphical mode. CATWOMAN Mice, really. It's disgusting -- they beg you to walk all over them and then they whine when you do it. Once you've had your fun there's not much you can do but kill them. (beat) But you seem different. I mean, you obviously understand about dressing up... that saves a lot of explaining. I think people should indulge their fantasies, don't you? BATMAN is sweating profusely. He can't hold his position much longer. And the CATWOMAN is dragging this insane flirtation out endlessly... CATWOMAN So I think I'll let you live. Cute boys like you are hard to find... (standing up) 'Bye, angel. I'll be thinking about you. And just like that, she VANISHES -- moving silently off with her raven, leaving BATMAN to dangle. He hangs there a moment, tries to twist himself around without moving his foot. He braces one hand against the wall; with the other, he lifts his grappling gun and FIRES. The HOOK SNAGS somewhere on the roof. BATMAN yanks the line taut and is laboriously trying to pull himself erect when -- -- the CATWOMAN reappears over the edge of the cornice! CATWOMAN Gee...I'm so fickle. A QUICK SWIPE of her STEEL TALONS, and the whipcord is neatly SEVERED. BATMAN'S FOOT slips out from under him -- but he's still got hold of the GRAPPLING GUN. He DROPS eight or ten feet... EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN watching with amusement as BATMAN's weight causes the hook to DISLODGE. It skitters across the gravel surface of the roof and CATCHES, at the last instant, on the edge of the CORNICE -- -- which promptly CRUMBLES and GIVES WAY. Fascinated, the CATWOMAN leans over the edge of the roof and peers down... ANGLE ON BATMAN - AS HE FALLS He flails wildly, tangled in his cape, as the ground rushes up toward him. He gets a last-ditch inspiration -- finds the GAS CYLINDER on his belt and hits the switch. The rods in his cape begin to INFLATE... Six stories up, his BATWINGS spring erect, slowing his plunge. Five stories up, an UPDRAFT hits him and he suddenly INVERTS. Four stories up, he rights himself. Three stories up, he goes into a downward spiral, out of control, gliding in great wide arcs over the street... ...and a moment later there are no stories left. With an ugly crunch, he smacks into the slush-covered pavement and BOUNCES. Face down, he skids some twenty feet to a halt -- right in the middle of a BUSY INTERSECTION. EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A DELIVERY TRUCK hits the brakes and screeches to a stop, two feet away from BATMAN'S HEAD. He doesn't move. PEDESTRIANS are already gawking and pointing as the DRIVER climbs out and peers down at the inert caped figure lying face-down in the street: DRIVER What the hell is this? CARS are backed up, due to the panic in Gotham Square a few blocks over. HORNS are honking. A TRAFFIC COP marches over -- TRAFFIC COP Awright, what's the problem here? (spotting BATMAN) Jesus. He tries to clear the crowd away. A full-fledged GRIDLOCK is forming around the prostrate BATMAN. The COP blows his whistle, tries to maintain order as two unifonned PATROLMEN rush up to join him. They manage to roll the unconscious BATMAN over on his back. The assembled COPS stare down at the mask, the scuffed body armor. Still waxy, they finger the GUNS in their holsters... PATROLMAN Good God. Cowan -- get to the car -- radio the commissioner!! By now there must be two hundred people in the intersection, all surging forward to get a look. More COPS are arriving to beat them back. TRAFFIC COP Is he dead? What do we do? PATROLMAN The mask. Get the mask off. They hunker down over BATMAN. One of them tugs at his mask -- but the helmet-like cowl doesn't want to give way. He feels around -- TRAFFIC COP Some kinda seam here on the neck... The PATROLMAN nods okay, and the COP tugs at a Velcro-like fastening under BATMAN's chin. The instant it comes open -- -- a BURST of FINE GREEN MIST spews forth from concealed JETS in the gold-and-black BAT-EMBLEM, and the COPS reel backward, shrieking, gasping for breath and clewing at their eyes. Booby-trap -- they've just been Maced. One of the ONLOOKING COPS steps back in horror and confusion. On impulse, he draws his gun and FIRES TWICE at BATMAN. The body JERKS and the bullets RICOCHET OFF -- TRAFFIC COP DON'T SHOOT, you idiot. The crowd -- Before he can finish, a BLACK BOOT kicks the gun out of the ONLOOKING COP's hand. BATMAN is back among the living. SIRENS BLARE as he spins and rolls into a crouch -- lashing out with elbows and knees -- driving the cops back -- Fuck the crowd. TWO MORE COPS pull their guns and open fire in absolute panic. BATMAN slams backward into the delivery truck and crumples to the ground. As he falls, he grabs a couple of SMOKE CAPSULES from his belt and flings them to the pavement. Seconds later, a THICK CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE is spreading through the intersection. BATMAN emerges into the midst of the crowd -- weaving in and out among the stalled vehicles -- EXT. INTERSECTION - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT A MOUNTED COP rides up to the outer fringe of the traffic jam, drawn by all the confusion. He rears the horse back, turns it in a circle; blows his piercing whistle as he tries to reroute the incoming cars... Suddenly a WIRE wraps itself around his chest and arms. He looks down. He sees a BATARANG in the instant before a sudden JERK pulls him cleanly off his mount. BATMAN climbs up on the hood of the nearest car -- vaults over to the next -- and the next -- then hops into the saddle of the MOUNTED COP's waiting HORSE. He digs in his heels, maneuvering through traffic... EXT. POLICE CAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT LT. EDDIE BULLOCK and another plainclothesman are a few blocks off trying to get through the jam. Their siren is on, but the cars blocking their path have no room to pull over. BULLOCK grabs the radio mike: BULLOCK Hell of a mess up here, Commissioner. We'll have to go in on foot... As they wait for a response, they see a HORSE charging past in the opposite direction. On the back of the horse...is BATMAN. Gaping, BULLOCK nudges his partner -- who throws the car immediately into REVERSE. As they watch, BATMAN kicks the horse's flanks and turns right -- toward Gotham Park. INT. GOTHAM PARK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT Two RED BERETS, members of the Order of the Bat, are on night patrol, strolling down a rambling path near the entrance to the park. RED BERET I This is wack, man. Nothing ever happens around here anymore. The other RED BERET lets out a WHOOP OF FEAR and yanks his partner out of the way. They tumble into a snowdrift as BATMAN'S HORSE vaults over the stone wall of the park and gallops past, nearly trampling them in the process. By now, SQUAD CARS are roaring into the park... INT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER SIRENS BLARE and RED LIGHTS FLASH in the distance as the COP CARS spread out along the winding roads that run through the park. BATMAN reins the horse in suddenly as a black-and-white whips past on an access road just ahead of him, no more than twenty yards away. He turns the horse in a circle. MORE RED LIGHTS appear in the distance; another contingent of SQUAD CARS has just entered from the opposite side of the park. It's going to be tough getting out of here... Then: his eyes fall on the statue of his great-grandfather, GENERAL WAYNE -- two Waynes on horseback, not twenty feet apart. He thinks back to his earlier conversation with VICKI and gets an inspiration. He rides past General Wayne to the STONE BRIDGE which spans the little frozen creek. There he finds the DRAINAGE TUNNEL VICKI described, obscured by the wire-mesh grate. This must be where the boy vigilante holes up... He dismounts, ties his CAPE to the pommel of the horse's saddle and sends it off with a slap. He pries the grate loose and crawls inside. INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT A dank, but cozy, hideout; WARM STEAM hisses from a grate in the floor. RUMBLING SOUNDS fill the little chamber as a SUBWAY TRAIN passes directly underneath. A little farther back there's an ACCESS SHAFT, with a Jacob's ladder, leading to the train tracks below. Poking around, he finds a couple of cardboard BOXES -- the boy vigilante's stash. The first contains tins of food, plus various odds and ends. The second's more in line with what he needs -- it's full of OLD CLOTHING. A TRAIN rumbles past underneath. BRUCE removes his COWL and sets about putting together a civilian disguise that'll get him out of the park. A wool hat and a long, moth-eaten topcoat: perfect. As he's pulling them out of the box, he spies something extremely odd -- It's a COSTUME -- a spangled red-and-green GYMNASTS OUTFIT with a little yellow CAPE -- neatly folded and in pristine condition. He removes it carefully from the box and holds it up in front of him. Stitched on the vest is a single initial, "R," in a black circle. He stares at the whole mystifying ensemble in complete befuddlement... The roar of the train subsides, and he hears a SCUFFLING NOISE. Someone's in the tunnel with him. He lowers the costume abruptly -- -- revealing DICK, the boy vigilante, who's crouched in front of him not three feet away. The kid's just crawled up through the ACCESS SHAFT, and he's not at all happy to see an intruder messing with his stuff: DICK It's MINE! He lunges furiously at BRUCE. The two of them tumble back into the grate at the tunnel entrance, KNOCKING IT LOOSE -- EXT. PARK - MOUTH OF TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A POLICE CAR streaks past on the bridge overhead mere seconds before BRUCE and DICK roll out into the snow, still grappling. BRUCE flings the kid into the bridge abutment. DICK lands hard; when he looks up, his EYES WIDEN, and a weird crooked smile comes to his face... Out here in the moonlight he can see his opponent. The body armor -- the gold-and-black emblem on the breastplate -- and above it all, the face of BRUCE WAYNE, exposed to view... As a siren howls nearby, BRUCE flattens himself against the bridge. Like it or not, his fate rests entirely in a strange little boy's hands. The kid sizes up the situation immediately. He nods his head up and down. Then he takes off his own ratty coat and throws it to BRUCE. BRUCE is in no position to look a gift horse in the mouth. He pulls on the coat, gives DICK a nod of acknowledgement, and starts to move off. DICK NO. WAIT! BRUCE turns, uncertainly. DICK throws him his woolen SKI CAP. The KID GIGGLES -- oddly, uncontrollably. Then he sprints off into the woods, dancing, leaping. As he disappears from view, he lets out a shrill, piercing, almost FERAL SHRIEK -- -- which is obviously intended to divert the cops. BRUCE makes haste in the opposite direction. EXT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER BRUCE'S HORSE gallops through the trees, the black bat-cape still attached to its saddle and BILLOWING behind it. INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TWO COPS scanning the park. The CAPED HORSE charges past in front of them and is momentarily silhouetted in the headlights. From a distance, it looks like BATMAN is still in the saddle. The COP at the wheel makes a sudden turn. A moment later, he SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. A MAN has just stepped out onto the road, directly in the squad car's path -- a hunched figure in an old coat and woolen ski cap, obviously one of the homeless. A COP leans on the horn and shouts out the window: COP Dumb son of a bitch!! The MAN -- BRUCE -- steps back out of the squad car's path. The COPS take off -- in hot pursuit of a riderless horse. CUT TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - PRE-DAWN A DOCTOR'S BAG rests on the kitchen table. ALFRED, in robe and slippers, rummages inside it and comes up with an ACE BANDAGE. ALFRED Commissioner Gordon called. He wants to install a full contingent of police guards here at the manor -- in round-the-clock shifts -- to protect you from Batman. BRUCE is sitting erect in a straightbacked chair. His shirt is open and he's holding his arms aloft while ALFRED wraps a full roll of adhesive tape around his battered RIBS. BRUCE Great. What'd you tell him? ALFRED I told him that since you were Batman, you'd require no protection from Batman. BRUCE makes a face: how droll. ALFRED tears off the tape with a brisk YANK -- and BRUCE lets out an involuntary YELP OF PAIN. BRUCE Jesus, Alfred -- !! ALFRED In future, sir...I strongly advise against trying to fly off twenty-story buildings. BRUCE It's just a few bruises. ALFRED One bruise, sir. Which covers your entire body. BRUCE gets up -- stiffly -- and buttons his shirt in gingerly fashion while ALFRED packs his first-aid gear in the doctor's bag. BRUCE I'm getting too old for this line of work. (beat) Cops placed me at the scene of the crime -- that weird kid of Vicki's saw my face -- ALFRED I shouldn't worry overmuch. I doubt the two of you move in the same circles. BRUCE -- and I got the living shit knocked out of me by a woman. ALFRED Sir -- such outmoded sexist attitudes are quite unbecoming. INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY In a lavishly-appointed guest room on Gotham's Upper East Side (or equivalent thereof), we find a pair of PLAINCLOTHES COPS settled in for a stakeout: rumpled topcoats thrown across antique chairs, french-fry bags and GREASY BURGER WRAPPINGS littering the carpet. HIGH-POWERED RIFLES propped against one wall. They peer through venetian blinds at an ELEGANT OLD BROWNSTONE across the street... HIS POV - ROOF OF BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT A UNIFORMED COP, also carrying a walkie-talkie, is keeping watch on the roof of the brownstone. He signals "all clear" to his counterpart watching from the house opposite. INT. UNMARKED CAR - THAT MOMENT TWO MORE PLAINCLOTHESMEN are parked at the end of the block, munching on donuts and watching the same brownstone. They spot a POSTMAN lugging his sack up the tree-lined street on his way to the brownstone. One of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN picks up his RADIO MIKE: PLAINCLOTHESMAN Mailman's coming. EXT. BROWNSTONE - A MINUTE LATER The POSTMAN marches up the front steps of the brownstone, sorting through letters and packages. He hasn't even rung the bell when the door is opened by ANOTHER COP -- who snatches the mail delivery from his hands and SLAMS THE DOOR IN HIS FACE. INT. BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT MORE COPS, at least half a dozen, are milling about inside -- unshaven, ties loosened, shirtsleeves rolled up. They're in for the long haul. The first COP gives a handful of letters to a couple of COLLEAGUES -- then hands over a PARCEL, wrapped in brown paper, to a pair of BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERTS. They carry it gingerly into the kitchen. Into the midst of all this bustling activity strides COMMISSIONER GORDON: GORDON Anything suspicious! In the parlor, where all the shades are drawn, TWO COPS are examining each letter in turn, holding them up to a light bulb, CREASING THEM carefully before slitting them open. COP Nothing yet. Christmas cards and bills. He anxiously watches their progress. A VOICE calls from the kitchen. BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT (V.O.) Commissioner -- ? INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER GORDON enters. The bomb-disposal boys have their equipment scattered all over the kitchen table. They've slit the brown- paper wrapping of the PACKAGE, exposing a ROUND DECORATIVE TIN. BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT It's a fruitcake. He lifts the lid for GORDON to have a look. GORDON ...Have it analyzed. INT. BROWNSTONE - ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT A bleary-eyed ELLIOTT TIPTREE marches down the stairs carrying a pair of OVERSIZED SUITCASES. His WIFE and TWO KIDS are behind him -- all bundled up, preparing to embark on an extended vacation. POLICEMAN Mrs. Tiptree? The car's here. TIPTREE, fighting back tears, embraces his wife for a long wordless moment. Their LITTLE GIRL, aged six, tugs at Mommy's sleeve. LITTLE GIRL I don't wanna go to Grandma's. I wanna stay here with Daddy. MRS. TIPTREE She's got a nice tree just like ours, honey. Daddy'll be up as soon as he can. LITTLE GIRL She's old. She doesn't even have cable. LITTLE BOY What about our presents? He gestures toward the GIFTS piled high around the tree in the parlor. TIPTREE Don't worry. I'll bring 'em up with me. We'll open 'em when I get there. TIPTREE forces a smile for the kids. He CLUTCHES his wife's hand. GORDON Sorry, folks, but we'd better move along. MRS. TIPTREE Kids? Tell your Daddy goodbye... Tearful hugs all around; then a cadre of UNIFORMED COPS escort MRS. TIPTREE and the KIDS to the door. TIPTREE pulls GORDON aside. TIPTREE They'll be safe, won't they? GORDON As safe as we can make 'em. (beat; sternly) It would help if you could give us some small hint what this is all about. TIPTREE I told you. I... TIPTREE shrugs helplessly and stares at his shoes. GORDON is convinced he's holding something back. GORDON You have no idea what was in that box that Provost had delivered from the bank. TIPTREE shakes his head wearily. GORDON glowers as he turns to go. GORDON (cont.) All right, Mr. Tiptree. Merry Christmas. GORDON exits. TIPTREE wanders listlessly into the living room, pulls back the drapes, and WATCHES as his wife and kids ride off in a convoy of POLICE CARS. One of the COPS tries to pull him away from the window, but he refuses to move... ...until a PHONE RINGS. Everyone jumps at once. A TECHNICIAN hits a switch on a loudspeaker-and-tape-recorder assembly, then gestures for TIPTREE to pick up the receiver... TIPTREE Hello...? VOICE ON LOUDSPEAKER Mr. Tiptree? Andy here. Listen -- we've got a chance to grab a good-sized block of Atlantic Teledyne at twenty-six and an eighth -- The COPS heave sighs and turn off their tracing equipment. TIPTREE Not today, Andy. Let's talk after New Year's. TIPTREE hangs up and starts to BAWL right there in the middle of the room. The COPS turn away in sympathetic embarrassment as he goes to a corner wet bar and pours himself a good stiff jolt. INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - DAY Wallowing in despair, TIPTREE sits at an antique secretary composing a LETTER. He takes a long pull on a glass of Scotch, signs his name, and inserts the letter into an envelope. He opens the desk drawer -- takes a long look at a .38 automatic stashed inside -- then finds a stamp and affixes it to the envelope. He addresses it to BRUCE WAYNE. A moment later he hears a noise at the window: TINK TINK TINK. He peers through the blinds and sees a CARRIER PIGEON on the ledge outside -- pecking at the glass, asking to come in. He raises the window and the PIGEON hops fearlessly inside, onto the sill. The bird, well-trained, struggles only slightly as he unties a tiny CAPSULE from its leg and removes a FOLDED NOTE. Scrawled across it is a handwritten message: IF POLICE SEE THIS YOUR FAMILY IS DEAD He opens the note and begins to read as the PIGEON takes wing. CUT TO: INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - DAY BRUCE is at his desk examining the morning editions. A BANNER HEAD-LINE shrieks: BATMAN SOUGHT IN PUBLISHER'S MURDER Bat Attack Panics Gotham Square J. Harrison Provost, 41, Leaves Distinguished Legacy He hears a VISITOR arriving in the entry hall. He gets up... INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT - DAY BRUCE ambles out and sees SELINA, who's just arrived, doing her patetented thing on ALFRED. SELINA English accents are so stimulating. (beat) You have the most beautiful silver hair! ALFRED stammers as she reaches up to STROKE HIS HAIR. He's about to break into a sweat. He's eminently relieved when she turns and sees -- SELINA (cont.) Bruce! BRUCE Selina. What are you doing here? ALFRED affects a look of grandmotherly outrage as SELINA slinks over and takes BRUCE by the arm. She's on him like a barnacle. SELINA I wanted to see your things, remember? And I got tired of waiting for you to call me back. (gesturing toward ALFRED) He's adorable. How long have you had him? INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY BRUCE leads SELINA down a hallway to the armory. He glances back over his shoulder and sees ALFRED peering snoopily around the corner. BRUCE You heard about Harry Provost. SELINA It's incredibly awful. It got me a little worried. (sidling up closer) I hate to think of something happening to you. BRUCE Same here. SELINA It's odd, though. Danger, the thought of suddenly dying -- in a weird way it gets you sort of...aroused. Don't you think? BRUCE cocks an eyebrow at her. Everything gets her sort of aroused. INT. ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER SELINA BEAMS at the fantastic collection of armored gear and exotic weapons. She's like a kid in a toy shop. SELINA Bruce, this is incredible. (indicating a suit of armor) Malaysian -- ? BRUCE Not bad. Sarawak warrior caste. SELINA It's like -- everything in here is another little piece of your mind. I was right about you. (turning to face him) Promise, okay? Promise you'll show me every inch of this place. PAGE 87 MISSING FROM HARD COPY INT. BATCAVE - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER ALFRED is at a PRINTER, scanning page after page of computer printout. He delivers his findings to BRUCE, who's seated at a nearby terminal, scanning data and tapping away at the keyboard. ALFRED The police have no files whatsoever on Selina Kyle. BRUCE (abstractedly) London...Cairo...Belgium... ALFRED What exactly are you -- BRUCE Her credit card records. (looking up) Every major art theft in the last five years -- she's been on the scene or close to it. ALFRED You mean she's some sort of -- collector? A...cat burglar, or -- BRUCE Could be. Museum curator, authenticator -- she's got the perfect cover for it. (beat) What would she want with that stupid raven? ALFRED Raven, sir? BRUCE That's what the Catwoman took from Provost. A little raven statuette, about so big... (shaking his head) But it couldn't have been that valuable. He continues to scan the screen. ALFRED is suddenly lost in thought. ALFRED How very odd. (long pause) I'm sure it's nothing, but -- BRUCE What, Alfred? ALFRED Your father had a raven, sir. A small statue of the very sort you describe. It used to sit on his desk. This piques BRUCE's interest. He swivels around in his chair and stares directly up at ALFRED. BRUCE What happened to it? ALFRED After your father's...demise, Mr. Tiptree came to the house and asked if he could have it. As a keepsake. I saw no harm... (shrugging) That was thirty years ago. BRUCE Wait a minute. Mr. Tiptree? ALFRED George Tiptree. Your friend Elliott's father. CUT TO: INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON TIPTREE has an oversized suitcase open on the bed. It's empty -- except for the BALLED-UP WADS of NEWSPAPER which he's stuffing inside it. His head turns suddenly at the sound of the doorbell... INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE emerges from his bedroom and peers over a bannister into the ENTRYWAY below. Standing there is an unexpected visitor -- BRUCE WAYNE -- holding his arms aloft while a battery of COPS pat him down. BRUCE What are you looking for -- Batarangs? TIPTREE Bruce! Come on up. (to the COPS) I want to talk to Mr. Wayne alone. The COPS look on suspiciously as BRUCE ascends the stairs. INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE lets BRUCE inside and shuts the door behind him. BRUCE hands him a GIFT BOX. BRUCE I brought you a Christmas present. Sorry about the wrapping -- the police made me open it. TIPTREE opens the box and pulls out a diamond-studded TIE CLASP. He looks up at BRUCE with an odd mixture of bewilderment and gratitude. BRUCE nods for him to try it on, and he obliges... TIPTREE ...I'm afraid I don't have anything for you. BRUCE I think you may have something that belonged to my father. TIPTREE -- You know? He stares at BRUCE, astonished. His head sinks into his hands. TIPTREE (cont.) It'll all be over tomorrow. One way or another, it'll all be over. (looking up; despondent) I've decided, Bruce. I'm gonna give him the last two ravens. He's already got the others. BRUCE What are you talking about? Who? TIPTREE Batman. I don't know how he found out, but -- TIPTREE reaches for the bottle on his desk to pour himself a drink, but BRUCE angrily knocks the glass out of his hands. BRUCE It's time you told me what's going on here. TIPTREE Didn't you ever wonder where it came from, Bruce? All the privilege, all the power ...all the money? (beat) The ravens are a...a kind of map, Bruce. The key to an incredibly vast fortune. BRUCE Whose fortune? TIPTREE Gotham City's. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS) The cobblestone streets of 19th-Century Gotham. A massive EXPLOSION blows open one wall of a municipal building, and total CHAOS erupts: fires starting, BYSTANDERS screaming, POLICE rushing to the scene... TIPTREE In 1880 the Gotham City Treasury was looted. It was a fantastic operation -- perfect military precision. The robbers made off with milllons in gold and silver bullion... A HORSE-DRAWN CART weighted down with gold bricks careens around a corner. Atop it are two men in MASKS, firing a GATLING GUN into the crowd. POLICE and ONLOOKERS tumble to the pavement, shot dead, as ANOTHER CART emerges from the wreckage of the treasury and takes off in the opposite direction. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS) CITY OFFICIALS in a boardroom trading papers back and forth, arguing furiously with five calm, distinguished-looking GENTS -- one of whom is the bushy-bearded Civil War hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE. TIPTREE (V.O.) The city was going under. Bankrupt... until five rich men stepped in to bail it out. In exchange they took the land rights, the mineral rights, the service contracts -- BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE BRUCE The Five Families. TIPTREE Our ancestors. They bought Gotham City -- carved it up and ran it into the ground. In five years they were rich beyond imagining. (pause) We've just been following in their footsteps. And in all this time no one's ever suspected -- BRUCE -- that they were the ones behind the robbery? FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS) The FIVE PATRIARCHS in front of a roaring fireplace at Wayne Manor, raising a celebratory toast. CAMERA PANS OVER to a nearby table; on it rest FIVE RAVEN STATUETTES. TIPTREE (O.S.) They had five ravens made. Five ravens which -- combined -- would reveal the location of the treasure they'd stolen. (beat) But they never touched it. They never needed to. It's still there to this day. BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE TIPTREE The ravens, and the secret -- have been passed down through generations. Father to son... (shaking his head) Your father -- died before he could tell you. BRUCE So they stole his piece of the puzzle. TIPTREE Yeah. I've got it, Bruce, and I'm going to hand it over. He's right, you know. We've all been feeding -- feeding on the soul of Gotham... BRUCE stares at him, stony-faced. There's one part of the story that doesn't quite add up. BRUCE (cont.) I don't believe you, Elliott. My father was a decent man -- an honorable man. He would never have taken part in a scheme like this. TIPTREE It wasn't his doing, Bruce. It was -- BRUCE That doesn't matter. If he knew that his fortune was based on a crime -- a crime against the city... (violently) Reputation or not, he would've tried to -- TIPTREE Christ, Bruce! Do you want me to spell it out for you?!? BRUCE backs off. An awful shiver of anticipation runs down his spine. TIPTREE (cont.) He was a decent man. He was an honorable man. That's why they had him killed. CAMERA ZEROES IN ON BRUCE'S HORRIFIED FACE as we get a SERIES OF SHOTS Quick, almost subliminal glimpses of BRUCE's primal trauma: a MUGGER snatching at his mother's necklace. THOMAS WAYNE lunging at him. The young JACK NAPIER firing at THOMAS. PEARLS showering down on the rain-drenched sidewalk. A second bullet felling his MOTHER -- -- and finally, young BRUCE himself, face wracked with PAIN and GRIEF -- BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE -- an expression which perfectly matches the one which the adult BRUCE is wearing as he relives it all thirty years later. Staggered and glassy-eyed, he stares off into space as TIPTREE finishes his tale. TIPTREE They killed him...to protect their secret ...and now the bill's come due. Now the bill's come due. CUT TO: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - TOWARD DUSK The wrought-iron gate outside BRUCE's vast estate -- and beyond it, Wayne Manor itself, rising bold and stately against the setting sun. A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past... INT. WAYNE MANOR - BRUCE'S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT BRUCE lies motionless on his bed. Scattered about him are SCRAPBOOKS, FAMILY PHOTOS and yellowed NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS which describe the murder of his parents. Disoriented, he gazes about aimlessly at his familiar surroundings -- which no longer seem quite so familiar... He folds his arms formally across his chest and stares up at the ceiling, inert, as if the very weight of his heritage is crushing him down. Somewhere, a PHONE RINGS. He makes no move to answer it. INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - DUSK VICKI's at the kitchen table drinking coffee. ALFRED, who's in his apron preparing dinner, picks up the ringing phone. ALFRED Thank you, yes, everything's fine. I'll expect your next call in an hour. (hanging up; to VICKI) The police are becoming an awful nuisance. VICKI I feel so awful for him, Alfred. There must be something we can do. ALFRED I realized long ago -- that there are places in Mr. Wayne's heart which no one will ever penetrate -- or share. (pause) He loves you, Miss Vale. But in certain ways he will always be alone. BRUCE (O.S.) ...Thanks for the testimonial. ALFRED turns and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway, staring at him. He starts to say something, but thinks better of it. He returns to his dinner preparations as BRUCE sits down across from VICKI. She extends a hand and he takes it -- making a visible effort to hold himself together. BRUCE Tiptree's planning some kind of rendezvous with 'Batman.' I think Batman ought to be there when it happens. ALFRED I see, sir. When shall we expect you back? BRUCE Get your cap. You're driving. INT. TIPTREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT It's late, and the house is dark as TIPTREE treeds silently downstairs carrying an OVERSIZED SUITCASE. The lights are on in the kitchen, where the COPS are playing poker and watching TV. INT. PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTS twinkle in the darkness. TIPTREE kneels beside the tree and digs around among the packages. He pulls out an OBLONG GIFT BOX with a tag addressed "TO DADDY -- FROM SANTA." With a glance back at the kitchen, he soundlessly unwraps the package -- and opens it to reveal a matched set of RAVEN STATUETTES. He transfers them to the big suitcase -- then slinks into the hallway... INT. BEDROOM ACROSS STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The two STAKEOUT COPS are chuckling at a Charlie Brown Christmas special on a portable TV. One of them glances out the window and sees a man in a topcoat emerging from the brownstone, SUITCASE in hand... STAKEOUT COP I Shit -- that's Tiptree!! The COP grabs for his WALKIE-TALKIE. EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TIPTREE is halfway down the block when two COPS burst out of the brownstone. COP Mr. Tiptree! What the hell are you -- HEADLIGHTS FLASH ON as the SURVEILLANCE CAR revs its engine. TIPTREE breaks into a RUN -- and the COPS from the brownstone follow suit. At the end of the block he vanishes down a SUBWAY ENTRANCE. INT. SUBWAY STATION - THAT MOMENT A VIOLINIST is panhandling outside the token booth as the COPS come racing down the stairs. The COPS trip over his open violin case, scattering small change across the conrete floor. They flash their badges at the booth and VAULT OVER THE TURNSTILE -- -- just in time to see TIPTREE, with his SUITCASE, scuttling down a stairway which leads to the train platform below. INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE steps onto an EXPRESS TRAIN. The doors slide shut behind him -- and the hapless COPS curse under their breath as he rolls off. COP We've gotta get back to the radio. INT. SUBWAY CAR - A MOMENT LATER - MOVING TIPTREE takes an open seat and looks around apprehensively. Being fabulously rich, be's probably ridden the subway twice in his life -- and at this time of night, EVERY FACE in the sparsely-populated car looks vaguely menacing. Derelicts, prostitutes, teen-gang members -- ALL OF THEM eye this well- heeled stranger with intense curiosity as he clutches his suitcase and stares anxiously at the floor... An ODD, GAUNT FIGURE enters at the end of the car. It's a DEAFMUTE. He shambles down the aisle passing out little white CARDS. One side is a guide to International Sign Language. The other reads: DEAF AND DUMB PLEASE HELP -- $1.00 TWO YOUNG TOUGHS take a card and tear it in half, chuckling, shining the DEAFMUTE on. A HOOKER, the heart-of-gold type, stuffs a buck in his tin cup. He reaches TIPTREE and extends a card; TIPTREE ignores him, refusing to make eye contact -- -- but the DEAFMUTE shoves the card insistently into his face. Now TIPTREE looks up. THIS CARD bears a personalized message: GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION B-TRAIN WEST TO RIVERVIEW TIPTREE's eyes widen. The DEAFMUTE -- who is in fact FRICK -- glowers down and holds out his cup. TIPTREE digs in his pocket; the smallest bill he's got is a twenty, but he hands it over anyway. Smiling at this act of generosity, FRICK moves on to the next car. TIPTREE stares down tremulously at the card. He fidgets with his TIE CLASP -- the one BRUCE gave him earlier... INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT TIGHT on a hand-held ELECTRONIC TRACING DEVICE. A small BLIP moves across a shifting GRID not unlike a radar screen. BRUCE is in the back of the limo, eyeing the tracer intently. ALFRED's up front, at the wheel. BRUCE According to this, he's directly below us. ALFRED The subway, sir? BRUCE Yeah. Take a right. INT. GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION - THAT MOMENT It's slightly more crowded here in the hub of Gotham. TIPTREE emerges onto the platform and spies a squad of TRANSIT COPS thirty or forty feet away -- speaking into WALKIE-TALKIES as they scan the crowd. Sticking close to the tracks, he turns swiftly toward the nearest stairway -- blending in with the crowd, trying to hold the SUITCASE out of view. INT. LOWER PLATFORM - A MINUTE LATER TIPTREE IS RUNNING for the B-train just as the doors begin to close. He manages to thrust the suitcase inside -- but the doors SLIDE SHUT on his hand, and he DROPS IT. He stands there on the platform, his face turning BONE WHITE as the train lurches forward... False alarm. The train stops, and the doors hiss open again. INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE clambers aboard with a severe case of palpitations. As the train pulls out, a couple of rough-looking but helpful STREET TYPES show him to a seat and hand him his precious suitcase. He sits there panting... Moments later, a DEAFMUTE enters the car. TIPTREE does a take: it's the exact same guy who was riding the other line! Of course, he doesn't know about Frick's malignant twin -- FRACK... WIPE TO: INT. LOCAL STOP - TEN MINUTES LATER - NIGHT Having changed trains twice more since we left him, TIPTREE debarks at a deserted local stop. The station is EMPTY except for one other passenger, who's gotten off here as well -- a WOMAN in a long fur coat. TIPTREE WATCHES as she approaches on her way to the stairwell, STILLETO HEELS clicking across the floor. There's something familiar about her -- but she's wearing a big, broad-brimmed hat, and she TILTS IT DOWN as she passes, obscuring her face. It is, of course, SELINA... TIPTREE stands there expectantly with his suitcase, awaiting further instructions. They aren't long in coming. A BLACK MYNAH BIRD swoops out of the tunnel, lands on the platform, and STRUTS in front of him. MYNAH FOLLOW ME. AWWWKK! FOLLOW ME. The bird flutters its wings and takes off again -- INTO THE TUNNEL. TIPTREE stares after it in disbelief. Then the bird CAWS AGAIN -- its shrill voice echoing from the darkness of the tunnel: MYNAH (O.S.) FOLLOW ME. AWWWKK! TIPTREE clambers over the edge of the platform, dropping awkwardly to the tracks below. Suitcase in hand, he begins to walk... INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT ALFRED tearing up the streets as BRUCE consults his tracer. BRUCE He's slowed down. Looks like he's under the park. ALFRED How do you propose to get down there, sir? We can't have Batman strolling up to buy a token. BRUCE I know another way in. (beat) Step on it. They're down there waiting for him. ALFRED turns the limo hard right -- into GOTHAM PARK -- past the statue of GENERAL WAYNE atop his horse... INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT A LOCAL TRAIN roars by, filling the screen. When it passes, we see TIPTREE with his suitcase, walking along the express tracks at the far wall of the tunnel -- more frightened with each step. It's dark and eerie down here in the tunnels; the only illumination comes from dim LANTERNS spaced at fifty-foot intervals. He sees the lights of an EXPRESS TRAIN behind him, and quickly switches to the local tracks. The train rumbles past with a deafening blare, and the car lights briefly illuminate his surroundings. TIPTREE glances over at the inside wall of the tunnel... ...where he sees, huddled in an ALCOVE just off the tracks, a small gathering of HOMELESS PEOPLE. They've set up camp down here in the tunnels, away from the elements. Surrounded by bags full of old clothes, DINING on canned food and cheap wine, they stare curiously at the well-heeled stranger with the suitcase who's invaded their domain. TIPTREE eyes them fearfully and picks up his pace, hastening down the tunnel. The HOMELESS make no move to follow -- with one exception. A KID, thirteen or fourteen, in a ratty topcoat, climbs down onto the tracks and watches inquisitively as TIPTREE vanishes into the shadows. His face is familiar. It's DICK -- the boy vigilante from the park. INT. TUNNEL - FARTHER DOWN TRACKS - A MOMENT LATER In this stretch of the tunnel the LANTERNS don't seem to be working -- and the MYNAH is completely invisible. When he comes to a fork in the tracks, he has to wait for the sound of the bird's shrill voice to guide him: MYNAH AWWRRK! FOLLOW ME. TIPTREE stumbles ahead blindly in the darkness. He trips on the tracks and drops the suitcase. As he's getting to his feet, a FLASHLIGHT shines DIRECTLY IN HIS FACE... VOICE STOP THERE. The MYNAH BIRD flutters through the beam of light and perches on the shoulder of an UNSEEN FIGURE. TIPTREE COWERS and SQUINTS, trying to make him out, but the figure who stands before him is shielding his face with an open UMBRELLA. TIPTREE I've cooperated. I've done everything you said. PENGUIN Open the case. TIPTREE lifts the lid, revealirig TWO RAVENS in the suitcase. A CACKLING LAUGH echoes in the darkness. PENGUIN (cont.) ...Two ravens? TIPTREE The other one is Bruce Wayne's. (trembling) He doesn't know anything about this. You've got what you want. There's no need to -- PENGUIN Thank you, Mr. Tiptree. You may go. TIPTREE stands. He backs away from the suitcase warily. TIPTREE My family. You won't -- PENGUIN We'll certainly take your unexpected generosity into consideration. TIPTREE We -- ?!? (shielding his eyes) You're not Batman. PENGUIN No. I'm his brother-in-law -- Birdman. Now move out. INT. TUNNEL - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT TIPTREE marches slowly down the tracks, TOWARD CAMERA, silhouetted in the flashlight beam. The beam SHIFTS SLIGHTLY as the Penguin moves toward the suitcase and sets the light down -- -- and we catch sight of the CATWOMAN perched on a steel cross-girder above the rails, her CHROME-STEEL TALONS GLINTING as she waits for TIPTREE to pass underneath. INT. TUNNEL - ON TIPTREE looking increasingly twitchy as he approaches the cross- girder. He slips a hand into the pocket of his topcoat, WHIRLS SUDDENLY -- -- and brings up his .38 AUTOMATIC, firing THREE QUICK SHOTS at the PENGUIN. The shots RICOCHET LOUDLY off the umbrella -- which happens to be a bulletproof job. The PENGUIN lifts his brolly; FIRE SPITS out of the shaft -- -- and TIPTREE staggers backward. SHOT IN THE CHEST. He spins into a steel upright and topples, face-forward, onto the ELECTRIFIED THIRD RAIL -- FRYING HIMSELF in a shower of sparks. The smoke is still clearing when the CATWOMAN drops to the tracks. The PENGUIN rushes to her side to check TIPTREE for signs of life. CATWOMAN That idiot. Another six feet -- PENGUIN So sorry to spoil your fun. -- He brought two ravens. We've got a complete set! CATWOMAN What?? PENGUIN Yeah! They're in the suitcase -- An AWFUL RUMBLING fills the tunnel. They see the lights of a TRAIN approaching on the center track -- the same one they're standing on, the one TIPTREE's body is slumped across. The PENGUIN's first impulse is to run back toward the inner track, where the ravens lie, but the CATWOMAN is trying to drag TIPTREE out of the train's path... CATWOMAN GIVE ME A HAND! They pull the corpse onto the outer express track just as the train arrives. They stand against the outer wall, waiting for the train to pass... ...and when it does, they see DICK -- the boy vigilante -- standing on the inner track directly across from them. HOLDING THE SUITCASE. The kid takes off like a shot. The CATWOMAN and the PENGUIN exchange quick looks of utter disbelief -- and BOLT AFTER DICK. INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK The bulky suitcase is slowing his progress. He looks back over his shoulder; although the stubby-legged PENGUIN has fallen well behind, the CATWOMAN is gaining fast. PAGE 101 MISSING FROM HARD COPY INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK watching in the light from the train as the two costumed figures grapple in the distance. He races back toward the scene of the melee... INT. TUNNEL - OUTTER EXPRESS TRACK - THAT MOMENT ...where BATMAN and the CATWOMAN are trading punches, blow for blow. He knocks her off her feet with a vicious right hook, and she sprawls on the track, dazed and bleeding. She lifts a hand: no mas... He looks back toward the suitcase on the center track. Before he can make a move toward it, he spots ANOTHER TRAIN approaching on the outer tracks -- right on the heels of the last one. He crouches to pull the CATWOMAN's limp frame out of its path... ...but as he does so, a HORN BLARES -- and a SECOND TRAIN comes barrelling down the center track from the opposite direction! Now he's got trains approaching on either side, and there's no place to go -- The CATWOMAN is groggily getting to her feet. He LUNGES at her -- THRUSTS HER BACKWARD, toward an ALCOVE in the outer tunnel wall. INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK - THAT MOMENT The OUTER train is already speeding past, obscuring BATMAN and the CATWOMAN from view. The CENTER train is bearing down fast. A split-second before it arrives, DICK'S HAND snatches the suitcase out of its path -- and he TUMBLES TO SAFETY on the innermost LOCAL TRACK. He stands and watches as the two trains pass in opposite directions. He doesn't know if BATMAN is alive or dead... INT. ALCOVE - THAT MOMENT BATMAN and CATWOMAN are flattened in the tiny alcove -- there's not two inches of breathing space between them and the passing TRAIN. She's come around now, and she's FLAILING and CLAWING at him, trying to PUSH HIM OUT. HER HAND closes around his UTILITY BELT. As they struggle, she hits the trigger of a SMALL GAS CYLINDER... It's BRUCE's hydraulic BATWING DEVICE -- the one that saved him when he fell off the roof. But this time the results are altogether different. He GASPS IN HORROR as the WINGS OF HIS CAPE stiffen and inflate -- FORCING HIM AWAY FROM THE WALL OF THE TUNNEL. His OUTER WING strikes the TRAIN -- FLAPPING WILDLY against the passing CARS -- SNAGGING FINALLY on the ralling of the rearmost car -- -- and BATMAN is suddenly RIPPED OUT OF THE ALCOVE -- DRAGGED OFF DOWN THE TRACKS by the passing train! INT. TUNNEL - INNERMOST TRACK - ON DICK He's still there with the suitcase -- waiting apprehensively to see what's become of BATMAN. Finally the center train passes -- -- and he sees CATWOMAN standing ALONE IN THE ALCOVE -- smiling at him -- advancing menacingly. DICK TURNS TO RUN... A GUNSHOT rings out -- and the last thing he sees as he slumps to the tracks is a whiff of SMOKE pluming from the shaft of the PENGUIN'S UMBRELLA. The PENGUIN's panting -- soaked with sweat. The CATWOMAN snatches up the suitcase and rushes over to join him. She peers off into the tunnels after BATMAN, exhilarated... CATWOMAN God. Did you see him? Isn't he hot? PENGUIN Haven't you got anything else to think about? (mopping sweat from his brow) I'm hot. That was exhausting. CATWOMAN No pain, no gain! -- Suck it up. We're not out of here yet. She sprints off down the tracks. SQUAWKING, he waddles along behind her, as fast as his fat little legs will carry him... As they vanish into the darkness, the CAMERA TRACKS back -- past DICK, who lies unconscious on the tracks, bleeding heavily from his shoulder wound -- DEEPER INTO THE MAZE OF TUNNELS -- -- arriving finally on the ragged black figure of BATMAN as he staggers forth from the shadows, dazed and bloody. He scans the tunnel, finding no trace of his enemies -- and then his gaze falls on DICK. He limps over and KNEELS at the boy's side -- cradling his head protectively, staring helplessly into the blackness all around him... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GOTHAM CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT The stark outlines of the city, BATHED IN MOONLIGHT. CAMERA ZEROES IN on the glowing, ornamental DOME of CITY HALL... INT. CITY HALL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A PENTAGONAL BALCONY girds the interior of the dome. We TILT DOWN to ground level -- where TWO AGED SECURITY GUARDS lie sprawled at odd angles on the marble floor, FATALLY SHOT. The PENGUIN closes his gun-umbrella and waddles across the atrium of City Hall, past a statue of blind Justice, to a point directly under the dome. There, encased in a plexiglass case, is a SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM CITY -- circa 1885, when City Hall was erected. He shouts up: PENGUIN LETS DO IT! INT. CITY HALL - BALCONY UNDER DOME - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN, FRICK, and FRACK are already up on the balcony. Lining its periphery are various DISPLAY CASES of historical interest; and positioned along the wall at each point of the pentagon are FIVE ARCHED NICHES -- each one containing a bronze bust. The patriarchs of Gotham's Five Families... The CATWOMAN and co. go to work quickly. She removes the FIVE RAVENS from a gunny sack as FRICK and FRACK work their way around the balcony, YANKING the busts from their recessed bases. She follows along behind them, replacing each bust with a RAVEN. When they're done, the PENGUIN yells up: PENGUIN Now. Give each raven a quarter-turn. His pals in the dome oblige -- TWISTING each raven in its recessed socket, in quick succession... INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN The moment of maximum tension. He stands there frothing at the mouth with anticipation. SECONDS TICK OFF, and nothing happens. CATWOMAN What happens now? PENGUIN I don't know. That's all...! He looks around expectantly as the others peer down at him from above. He really doesn't know what's supposed to happen next. Suspecting the worst, he throws his umbrella to the floor and begins STAMPING ABOUT IN A RAGE, SPUTTERING, flapping his arms like wings. PENGUIN (cont.) We've been TRICKED! It's a HOAX! It's a -- He SHUTS UP suddenly at the sound of a loud CHUNK. Somewhere behind him, ANCIENT GEARS are beginning to grind. He spins and stares at the SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM in its plexiglass case... The city model is TREMBLING slightly. As he watches, the DOME of the miniature CITY HALL -- in the dead center of the model city -- POPS OFF on a hinge. A METAL STRONGBOX rises into view... INT. DOME - ON BALCONY - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN, FRICK and FRACK stare down at the little metal box. The PENGUIN is already clambering atop the plexiglass case of the model, SMASHING AT IT with his umbrella, trying to get at the box. FRICK That's the treasure? CATWOMAN No. It's a map... She affixes a ROPE to the balcony railing and CLIMBS OVER. INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN The plexiglass case finally SHATTERS -- and the PENGUIN falls through, landing atop Gotham City. He snatches at the strongbox and gets to his feet, bestriding the city like a colossus. He's climbing down off the tabletop when the CATWOMAN, on her rope, touches down behind him. He hunkers down on the floor and knocks the rusted padlock off the box. He opens it and stares greedily at the contents -- a MAP and a bunch of old, crumbling PHOTOS. The CATWOMAN creeps over to his side: PENGUIN Bruce Wayne. So he doesn't know a thing about the treasure, eh...? (handing her the map) Look at this. It's right under Wayne Manor. It's been there all along! Now the CATWOMAN snatches at the PHOTOS. They show progressively closer views of ANCIENT GNARLED STALACTITES -- an odd, distinctive SUBTERRANEAN ROCK FORMATION... PENGUIN (cont.) Looks like some kind of cave. FADE THROUGH TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY TIGHT ON THE FACE of DICK. He lies unconscious in a big soft frilly bed A WOMAN'S HAND wipes his feverish brow with a damp cloth; he moans slightly... His eyes snap open suddenly. He sits BOLT UPRIGHT with a yelp. VICKI No, no -- don't try to get up -- you're hurt. He pushes her aside and climbs out of bed anyway. His shoulder is bandaged, his arm in a sling. The pajamas he's wearing are three sizes too large. He paces about, staring at his unfamiliar surroundings. VICKI (cont.) It's all right. You're safe. You can stay here as long as you need to. DICK I don't belong here. You can't keep me here. Vaguely unnerved, he goes to a window, pulls back the shades, looks out at the grounds. VICKI It's "Dick", isn't it? Or do you prefer "Richard"? He stares at her as if she's nuts. VICKI opens a closet door: all of his ratty belongings are hanging inside -- including the red-and-green GYMNAST'S SUIT with the "R" insigne on the breast. VICKI "R" -- for Richard, right? See, all your things are here... (staring at the costume) What is it, some kind of gymnast's outfit? DICK It's none of your business. What is this, some kind of home? VICKI No, not that kind. There's a swimming pool -- tennis court -- you can have anything you want. DICK Tennis court?! -- Lady, you're rich. How the hell would you know what I want? VICKI tries to lay a soothing arm on his shoulder. He bats it away, pushes her aside and turns toward the door in agitation -- DICK I'm not staying. You can't make me -- -- and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway looking at him. BRUCE I can make you. DICK freezes -- as if BRUCE's mere presence has mesmerized him. The hint of a smile plays across his face: ohhhhh. I'm in Batman's house. BRUCE (cont.) Come on. Wanna go at it? (no response) Look, kid -- like it or not, you're my guest -- and long as you're here you might as well enjoy it. ALFRED appears with a tray of hot food and sets it down on a bedside table. DICK edges toward it and sits down. He waits for ALFRED to leave and then TUCKS IN HUNGRILY -- eyeing BRUCE all the while. BRUCE (cont.) Will you two be okay in here? VICKI nods yes. BRUCE backs out of the room. INT. WAYNE MANOR - OUTSIDE GUEST ROOM - DAY BRUCE pulls the door shut. ALFRED follows him down the hall. ALFRED What do you propose to do with him, sir? Keep him in the room for the rest of his life? BRUCE I don't know, Alfred. I've got other stuff to worry about. ALFRED The child is hurt, sir. At the very least we should attempt to locate his parents. BRUCE He hasn't got any parents. ALFRED How do you know that, sir? BRUCE turns and fixes ALFRED with a steely gaze. BRUCE ...I know. The PHONE RINGS as BRUCE starts down the long stairway. ALFRED picks up a hallway extension. He covers the mouthpiece: ALFRED Sir -- it's Miss Kyle. BRUCE rushes back upstairs to take the call. INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - THAT MOMENT - DAY ARCTIC BIRDS chirping all around in the penguin-pool room. A SNOW OWL struts across the PENGUIN's desk as SELINA makes a phone call -- with the PENGUIN, FRICK, and FRACK hovering over her. SELINA Well! Tall, dark and handsome. Are we still on for tonight? INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON BRUCE He covers the receiver and stares intensely at ALFRED. On his look we DISSOLVE TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT Christmas carols playing. VICKI's got DICK helping her trim the tree. INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT BRUCE is getting dressed for his date with SELINA. ALFRED Is this necessary, sir? After all...it is Christmas eve. BRUCE reaches for his UTILITY BELT. He empties the contents of one packet onto a dresser: a dozen tiny, red GLASSINE CAPSULES. He scoops up a handful of the CAPSULES and deposits them in his jacket pocket. BRUCE Stuff'll knock out a moose, much less a cat. ALFRED I don't like to see you going out on a date...unprotected, sir. BRUCE She'll be ready for Batman -- but not for me. (turning to go) It's the only way, Alfred. I've got to take her out tonight. INT. ENTRY HALL - FIVE MINUTES LATER (DICK'S POV) DICK watches from the front parlor as VICKI meets BRUCE at the bottom of the stairs. The two of them exchange a few brief words; he embraces her, strokes her hair gently -- then glumly sets his jaw and moves off toward the front door. VICKI reenters the parlor, trying to force an expression of cheer as DICK turns discreetly away. This is one weird household he's landed in... INT. SELINA'S LOFT - NIGHT SOFT MUSIC plays in the background as SELINA preens in front of a vanity, doing her eye makeup, taking great pleasure in her own reflection. She's looking especially sultry tonight in a glittering low-cut gown. She lowers one shoulder strap and strikes a pose in the mirror: better. She runs a hand through her hair, TOUSLING IT for that recently-ravished look. The DOORBELL rings, and by the time SELINA crosses over to answer it, she's lowered the other strap as well -- which means she has to hold up the top of her dress with one hand. BRUCE finds himsell dumbstruck as she lets him in. She pulls up both straps as she greets him nonchalantly: SELINA You're early. I'm afraid I'm not quite dressed. BRUCE enters and takes a long look around. It's a big open loft, only partly finished, filled with Egyptian artifacts. The walls feature modern paintings with CAT MOTIFS. The finished section is dominated by a huge BED on a raised platform -- three or four CATS are walking around on it, yowling at BRUCE. SELINA CHUCKLES as he scopes it all out. SELINA (cont.) If you're looking for my bondage gear, it's at the cleaners. BRUCE Christmas eve. No tree? SELINA No presents. I've been a bad girl this year. BRUCE takes a seat on the sofa while SELINA goes to a nearby wet bar. BRUCE I'm surprised you kept this date. I thought you would've lost interest by now. SELINA What makes you say that? BRUCE You've got what you want, don't you? SELINA I do now. (smiling) We've had this date for a long, long time. With that, she sets the drinks down on the table and moves in to KISS him -- a long, slow, wet kiss. But BRUCE seems strangely unresponsive. She breaks free and gives him a funny look. BRUCE How much is it going to cost me? SELINA What? BRUCE ...To get the ravens back. He watches her closely for a reaction. SELINA's shocked, but she conceals it well -- chuckling in apparent confusion. SELINA You're the oddest man I've ever met. (moving in on him) Let's talk later, Bruce. I've got kind of a short fuse... BRUCE tenses slightly as she KISSES him again -- leaving a crimson LIPSTICK SMEAR on his cheek. She works her way downward, kissing him around his neck and throat... HIS HAND reaches into his jacket pocket. He withdraws a tiny GLASSINE CAPSULE. But before he can use it -- He JERKS BACK suddenly -- pushes her away. His free hand goes to his neck, where a thin trickle of BLOOD is oozing from between two bright red LIPSTICK LIPS. She's bitten him... Now she SHUSHES him -- reaches over to the tiny wound and massages it gently with one hand. SELINA Did I hurt you? Just relax -- you'll start to enjoy it. BRUCE pulls away again. His eyes are strangely glazed. He tries to speak, but his tongue feels thick and swollen. SELINA (cont.) Bruce, you look faint. It must be the cats. BRUCE stands suddenly. It's as if he's mired in a slo-mo nightmare. His legs give way beneath him and he topples to the floor, INERT. His fingers go slack and the capsule rolls out; he tries to reach into his pocket, but his arm won't seem to work. SELINA's cat, HECATE, strolls across his prostrate form -- purring and stretching... BRUCE'S POV A worm's-eye view -- SELINA looms over him with a predatory smile on her face, shifting in and out of focus. BRUCE What di-- what did you d-- She runs a finger across her lips and holds it up -- bright red. SELINA I guess I've...gotten under your skin. BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE His hand goes to the BITE on his neck -- and he realizes SELINA's lipstick is spiked with a fast-acting PARALYTIC DRUG. He writhes helplessly on the carpet, his whole body gradually going slack. The PENGUIN, FRICK and FRACK stroll through the doorway and stand over him -- ALL LAUGHING... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past the manor, right on schedule. INT. WAYNE MANOR - PARLOR - NIGHT ALFRED on the telephone, checking in with the County Sheriff's boys. ALFRED Everything's fine, thank you. We'll talk in an hour. Behind him, VICKI is waiting up for BRUCE. She's curled up on the sofa, reading a book, throwing the occasional anxious glance at a big grandfather clock -- which strikes eleven o'clock. INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT DICK opens the bedroom door and peeks down the hall. He's got all his belongings tied up in a bundle on the bed; he opens a window and throws the bundle outside. There's a nice strong TREE BRANCH some ten or twelve feet from the window -- just close enough that he should be able to make it. He climbs up onto the windowsill, crouches, and SPRINGS. INT. CAR - OUTSIDE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A car full of trouble: SELINA, wearing a fur coat over her Catwoman garb, at the wheel; the PENGUIN riding shotgun; and FRICK in the back seat -- next to BRUCE, who's semi-conscious and stone limp. The car idles outside the wrought-iron gates of Wayne Manor. PENGUIN Try his mag card. FRICK digs in BRUCE's pockets and finds a bunch of RED CAPSULES. FRICK Look at this. He's a pillhead. Now FRICK finds a mag-striped card and INSERTS IT into an electronic device at the edge of the drive. The gates magically part. There's a large VAN just behind the car -- driven by FRACK, and carrying two random GOONS. Both vehicles pull in before the gates slide shut. INT. WAYNE MANOR - A MOMENT LATER VICKI hears a signal from the security panel in the kitchen announcing what should be BRUCE's arrival. She heaves a huge sigh of relief -- then rushes to the door and flings it open. She sees BRUCE standing there and her face lights up. VICKI Ohh. Am I glad to -- To her horror, BRUCE topples forward -- and lands on the floor, flat as a board. VICKI SHRIEKS as the PENGUIN enters, throwing his arms wide. PENGUIN MER-R-R-RY CHRISTMAS!! EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT DICK has shimmied down to a lower branch. He lets go and drops to the snow, WINCING; his shoulder wound is bleeding again. As he grabs his bundle, he hears RAUCOUS LAUGHTER coming from around the house. He races over to peer around the corner. He sees the two cars out front. He sees the last of the goon squad barging in through the front door. His face full of confusion and conflict, he moves to a window. In the entry hall he sees BRUCE on the floor -- and VICKI surrounded by gun-toting intruders. One of them grabs her and twists her arm behind her back. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT VICKI shrieking and struggling as she stares down at BRUCE. VICKI What did you do to him?? SELINA gives her a catty little smile. SELINA First-time jitters, I guess. Everything was going great, and then...he just went limp as a noodle. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON STAIRWAY Drawn by the commotion, ALFRED rushes down the stairs to the entry hall, pulling a robe around him. He freezes in his tracks when he sees FRICK dragging VICKI into the front parlor, holding a gun to her head. PENGUIN You'd be the butler. Why don't you come on down and attend to your guests? ALFRED hesitates, until the PENGUIN pulls a gun on him. He marches down the stairs slowly, pausing by BRUCE's prostrate form. ALFRED Mr. Wayne. Is he -- ? PENGUIN You know how it is. Some guys just can't hold their egg nog. INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER The PENGUIN marches ALFRED in where the rest of the gang's already assembled. FRICK throws VICKI down roughly on a sofa just next to the Christmas tree while the GOONS drag BRUCE inside. PENGUIN I should explain the occasion of our visit. There's a treasure underneath this house -- and I don't plan to leave until you tell me how to find it. Now who's going to talk -- Miss Vale? VICKI I don't know what you're talking about. PENGUIN The cave. Under the house. How do I get there? The PENGUIN gestures. FRICK holds the gun to her head. VICKI (cont.) I don't know! I swear, I would tell you -- PENGUIN (turning to ALFRED) Then maybe you'd like to tell me. ALFRED You're no more than a common thief. PENGUIN Wrong, you old idiot. I happen to be a very uncommon thief. (beat) Are you going to tell me, or does Miss Vale get an early present this year? FRICK cocks the gun. VICKI stares aghast at ALFRED, who scans the room, weighing his options. Trembling, he shuts his eyes -- ALFRED I...don't...know... PENGUIN Then go ahead, Mr. Frick...decorate the tree. FRICK's finger tightens on the trigger. VICKI winces. ALFRED starts to blurt something out. But a split-second before he can speak -- SELINA Wait! (crossing over to VICKI) We don't know how to get down there yet. We may need her when Bruce wakes up. The PENGUIN sighs and waves FRICK off. ALFRED and VICKI heave simultaneous sighs of relief. He throws her a shamefaced look -- but she gives him a tiny nod of acknowledgement: you made the right play. SELINA (cont.) Besides -- I want this one for myself. So pretty...I'm going to give her a brand new face for Christmas. The PENGUIN throws a look at BRUCE, who's still out cold on the floor. He turns to FRICK and FRACK. PENGUIN Why don't you two tie up our host? ALFRED sits beside VICKI while SELINA wanders off to tour the premises. FRICK and FRACK, meanwhile, drag BRUCE into a back parlor which opens off the room they're in. INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT They dump BRUCE face down on a sofa -- then rip the telephone cords from around the baseboard and use them to bind his hands and feet. INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON MR. BONIFACE Still holding his gun on VICKI and ALFRED, he wanders about the room, admiring the various furnishings and expensive objects. PENGUIN It's all so plush and tasteful, isn't it? Just the sort of setting in which I've always imagined myself. ALFRED, on the sofa, can't resist letting out a snort of disgust. PENGUIN (cont.) I see. You think I'm vulgar. You think I'm...nouveau. ALFRED I think you're a dirty little man with a -- The PENGUIN silences him by sweeping one arm across a tabletop, sending a bunch of PRICELESS CHINA FIGURINES crashing to the floor. He points to ALFRED as FRICK and FRACK reappear. PENGUIN See, boys, that's old money talking. After a while, they actually start to believe they've earned all this. (smirking) I don't mind. Someday I'll be old money too -- when the statute of limitations runs out. SELINA (O.S.) Hey! -- Guess what I just found. Face full of anticipation, he TURNS -- just in time to see SELINA returning from the kitchen with a big silver tray of... SELINA (cont.) Christmas cookies! The PENGUIN is crestfallen, but that doesn't stop him from cramming a handful of cookies down his gullet. SELINA graciously serves VICKI and ALFRED, who munch away with limited enthusiasm. PENGUIN Let's spread out and see what we can find. (to FRICK and FRACK) You two -- keep an eye on our friends here. Give me a yell the minute Wayne comes to. FRICK and FRACK post themselves at the doors to the front parlor as SELINA, the PENGUIN and the GOONS fan out through the house. CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as they move past BRUCE -- -- and in a quick CLOSEUP we see his EYES OPEN -- his hands STRUGGLING against his bonds. SERIES OF SHOTS QUICK GLIMPSES of the intruders enacting their depredations as they search for the entrance to the cave. SELINA and the PENGUIN are flinging open doors, moving clocks, looking for secret panels; as they go, they systematically TEAR THE HOUSE APART -- smashing BRUCE's possessions, ripping paintings out of frames, etc. Meanwhile, the TWO GOONS are outside prowling around the grounds, looking for an exterior entrance -- and back in the parlor, FRICK and FRACK are keeping their guns trained on ALFRED and VICKI. INT. WAYNE MANOR - CORRIDOR OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT CAMERA TRACKS down a long, empty hallway -- arriving at a LOCKED DOOR with curtained-off glass panels. Suddenly, an ELBOW smashes through the glass -- a hand reaches inside and fumbles for the lock -- INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT FRICK and FRACK start at the sound of a SECURITY ALARM blaring from the kitchen. VICKI looks at ALFRED... FRICK Better check it out. FRICK stays behind as FRACK rushes out into the entryway and down a long hall to the kitchen. He tosses a glance back at VICKI and ALFRED, then steps out into the entryway himself. FRICK (cont.) What is it? What's going on?? VICKI and ALFRED look into the back parlor. DICK GRAYSON has sneaked in behind the sofa -- and he's busy sawing away at BRUCE's bonds with a letter opener. Both of them stiffen simultaneously -- if FRICK steps back inside, he'll have a clear view of DICK and BRUCE. INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT FRACK has opened a panel on the kitchen wall, revealing the SECURITY SYSTEM from which the alarm emanates. A RED LIGHT is blinking, indicating DICK's break-in. FRACK throws switches frantically, trying to kill the sound. Finally he succeeds -- and SHOUTS: FRACK Some kind of security system -- INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT DICK's gotten BRUCE free -- but BRUCE, still under the effects of the drug, isn't much use. He tries to get off the sofa and crumples in a heap. DICK Can you move, man? BRUCE Library -- got to get me to the library -- DICK slings an arm around BRUCE and drags him to a door opening onto the hallway. They're just about to step outside when FRACK comes marching back on his way from the kitchen. INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON VICKI AND ALFRED -- faces wracked with utter, desperate tension as they watch the situation develop. INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT FRICK and FRACK conferring, ignoring VICKI and ALFRED for the moment. By now the PENGUIN is waddling in from a hallway: PENGUIN What is that ungodly racket? FRACK A security alarm. It went off in the kitchen. PENGUIN My God! Is someone in here? He struts over to huddle with his cronies. BRUCE and DICK are still poised in the doorway. It looks bad... INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT ALFRED looks at BRUCE and DICK -- then at FRICK and FRACK bickering with the PENGUIN in the entryway. He pats VICKI's knee -- gestures for her to keep her seat -- -- and LUNGES at FRICK, making a play for his gun. A moment of confusion ensues -- giving DICK and BRUCE just enough time to dart out into the hallway, duck around a corner, and vanish -- -- but ALFRED is a frail old gent, and he can't keep it up for long; a blow to the face sends him sprawling to the floor. FRICK instinctively pulls the trigger and SHOOTS HIM at point- blank range. VICKI rushes into the hallway -- screaming, crying. INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT The room's a mess, books all over the floor. The groggy BRUCE props himself up against his desk. He manages to pull the bottom drawer open -- gropes frantically for the secret switch. He's CRYING. BRUCE Alfred... DICK I'll go back. BRUCE I can't...get down there...without you. DICK turns. To his amazement, the sectional bookcase is swinging open -- revealing the secret passage to the BATCAVE. INT. ENTRY HALL/FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT We will all be pleased to know that ALFRED has only suffered a superficial wound to the arm. VICKI is on her knees beside him; the PENGUIN is watching them with utter contempt. PENGUIN What an extraordinarily stupid thing to do. VICKI SHUT UP. Help me with him. The PENGUIN rolls his eyes and orders FRICK and FRACK to give VICKI a hand without him. They carry him into the parlor, lay him out on the sofa. VICKI reaches into her purse for a handkerchief and begins binding his wound as the PENGUIN pulls FRACK aside. PENGUIN You and I had better check the ground floor and see what's going on. Mr. Frick -- do you think you'll be able to manage this pair? FRICK Yes sir. PENGUIN Oh, good. That does relieve my mind -- He turns, glances into the back parlor, and sees a pile of CUT CORDS on the love seat. The blood drains out of his face. PENGUIN (cont.) Where's Wayne??? INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT DICK has just entered another world -- and he's looking around him in pure, unalloyed amazement. BRUCE is fumbling with a packet on a spare UTILITY BELT; he shakes out a fistful of pills and swallows them dry. Then he goes to his bank of monitors and begins flipping switches. They blink on one by one; DICK moves up behind BRUCE and looks on, dazzled. INSERT - MONITOR The screen shows The PENGUIN in a sun room, shouting to his two armed GOONS through a pair of French doors. PENGUIN Check the grounds! The shape he's in, he can't have gotten far. BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE He turns to his main control panel, reaches for a switch, and waits. EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The two GOONS outside, with guns and flashlights, roaming cautiously around the grounds. They turn suddenly -- -- as CORRUGATED-STEEL SECURITY PANELS slam into place over every ground-floor door and window in Wayne Manor! INT. SUN ROOM - THAT MOMENT The PENGUIN sees the same thing happening, only from inside. He listens helplessly as his GOONS pound on the steel panels from outside. It's just occurred to him that he's trapped in here... INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER DICK is up on a catwalk leading back to the library of Wayne Manor. BRUCE shouts up to him from the control console down below. BRUCE -- as soon as he gets to the East wing. Wait for my signal. You know what to do. DICK nods yes and bolts off. INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER VICKI and ALFRED are still sitting at gunpoint. With the commotion going on all around them, FRICK is getting itchy- fingered. Suddenly the STEREO begins blaring at top volwne -- "SANTA BRING MY BABY BACK TO ME." FRICK turns and stares at it in confusion -- goes over to fiddle with the controls -- -- and suddenly BRUCE'S VOICE is coming through the loudspeakers. BRUCE (O.S.; filter) VICKI! RUN! NOW! She's off the sofa like a shot, DIVING for the entry hall. FRICK turns and takes aim -- -- but before he can squeeze the trigger, DICK's come out of nowhere to HIGH-KICK him in the face! The shot goes wild and the two of them tumble into the Christmas tree, knocking it over... INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT VICKI hits the floor of the entry hall. HUGE OAKEN SLIDING DOORS are already slamming shut behind her. The same thing is happening all down the hall -- the East wing of the house is sealing itself off! INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT DICK CARTWHEELS across the carpet -- catching FRICK high on the chest and RAMMING him backward, into the hearth. Before FRICK can regain his balance, DICK's BEANED HIM across the back of the skull with a fireplace poker. He bends and picks up FRICK's gun -- which he tosses to ALFRED, who's been watching all this with some fascination from the sofa. DICK Here. You might need it. ALFRED Thank you, Master Dick. And...bravo. INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT VICKI has made it to the wall phone. She can't seem to get a dial tone -- VOICE FROM BEHIND Do you really think we're that stupid? VICKI turns, and realizes to her horror that the VOICE is SELINA's. SELINA (cont.) I tawt I taw a puddy tat...!! With that she raises a hand -- and her CLAWS pop out. VICKI turns, grabs a carving knife from a wooden block -- but before she can do anything with it, a WHIP cracks and wraps around her wrist, jerking the knife loose. SELINA tugs on the other end, reeling her closer. SELINA You know, I've got a great recipe for Sliced Bitch -- VICKI lunges forward suddenly, causing the whip to slacken and throwing SELINA off-balance into the center island. While they're tangled up, VICKI grabs a MEAT CLEAVER and tries to bring it down on SELINA, but SELINA rolls effortlessly out of the way and returns the favor, SWIPING at VICKI with her claws. VICKI brings a Calphalon skillet up just in time to block the blow: CLANG. VICKI sweeps her arm across the countertop, showering SELINA with knives and appliances. It buys her enough time to make for the door -- but SELINA comes flying after her. Another downswipe with the claws -- but VICKI shoves a BUTCHER'S BLOCK into SELINA's path, and her TALONS wedge a half-inch deep in the wood. VICKI rushes out while she's trying to pry herself loose. INT. DINING HALL - A MOMENT LATER SELINA enters but finds no trace of VICKI. SELINA I love a good old-fashioned catfight -- but this is pissing me off. VICKI charges out from behind a sideboard, pushing a WHEELED COCKTAIL CART before her. It SLAMS full-force into SELINA, who lands on her back on the great long dining table. VICKI is in the doorway to the entry hall by the time she gets up. INT. ENTRY HALL - STAIRWAY - A MOMENT LATER VICKI races up the stairs. She has a good lead, but SELINA makes up the difference in a hurry. She takes the stairway in three giant bounds -- reaches the landing just as VICKI ducks down the hall and into a bedroom, slamming the door behind her and LOCKING IT. SELINA HERE, kitty kitty kitty...HERE, kitty kitty... She KICKS THE DOOR OPEN. INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT SELINA enters and strikes a coy pose as she shuts the door behind her. VICKI has opened a pair of French doors leading to a balcony, but it's too long a drop. She stands there paralyzed as SELINA advances. SELINA So this is where you earn your keep. She GRABS VICKI -- holds her out at arm's length and shoves her roughly back onto the bed. VICKI flails wildly as SELINA kneels atop her... SELINA's CLAWS shred VICKI's blouse, revealing a frilly section of bra -- SELINA Mmm! Frederick's of Gotham? She plants a talon against VICKI's sternum and RAKES IT DOWNWARD, drawing a RED STRIPE on the exposed flesh of VICKI's belly. Now VICKI just loses it. She begins to SHRIEK uncontrollably. SELINA Not so loud, honey! The neighbors'll get the wrong idea. (laughing) Santa's coming. Time for all good girls to go to sleep... She raises her claw-hand and prepares to slash down at VICKI's neck. But an instant before she can strike -- VICKI goes wide-eyed and shuts up. A BLACK SHADOW falls across the moonlit bed. SELINA tenses -- -- as a BLACK-GLOVED HAND grabs a fistful of her hair -- BATMAN Miss me, "Angel"? He yanks her bodily off the bed. Before she knows what's happening, he delivers a POWERHOUSE UPPERCUT. She flies into the door and knocks it cleanly off its hinges. INT. HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - A MOMENT LATER BATMAN steps out after SELINA, who's only now picking herself up. SELINA Okay -- let's do it, huh? You and me... all the way this time. She HISSES and jumps him. They grapple -- a quick flurry of fists -- and he knocks her ass-over-teakettle down the long stairway. She gets to her feet, limping, and darts around a corner. BATMAN marches implacably down the stairs, taking his time... INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER VICKI rushes out of the bedroom. She looks down the hall and sees FRACK flying out of the guest room, UPSIDE DOWN -- slamming into the wall opposite. He slumps to the carpet, out cold. A moment later DICK strolls out. VICKI rushes to his side -- VICKI Come on. We'll be safe in the cave. INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY/ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER BATMAN PAUSES outside the door to the armory, which is slightly ajar. He pushes it in cautiously... ...and a HALBERD smashes through the wood frame -- slicing down mere inches from his face. It's the PENGUIN wielding the ax; he backs off in seeming terror as BATMAN advances on him. But then -- -- SELINA springs down from a perch above the doors -- landing on his back -- and the two of them are going at it again. It's a room full of exotic weaponry, and most of it gets a good workout in the next thirty seconds. BATMAN dodges a LANCE -- which embeds itself into the wall behind him, QUIVERING -- and swings a MACE squarely into SELINA's ribs. It's a crippling blow; she flies backward, knocking over a suit of exotic armor -- which TOPPLES, knocking over another -- and another -- -- until the various suits of armor have all fallen over, domino-style -- the last of them landing squarely atop the cowering PENGUIN. SELINA is badly hurt now. She makes it out of a rear door to the armory. BATMAN pauses to check on the PENGUIN -- he seems to be out for the count -- and sets off in pursuit of SELINA. SEVERAL MOMENTS PASS before the groaning PENGUIN comes around enough to dig himself out. INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER As the PENGUIN stumbles around a corner, he peers into the LIBRARY. VICKI is crouched by BRUCE's desk, reaching into a bottom drawer. A hidden panel in the bookcase pops open... INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT As she helps ALFRED into the secret passageway, VICKI turns to DICK: VICKI Come on. Come with us. DICK No. I can still help... INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER The PENGUIN flattens against the wall as DICK sprints out of the library and heads off in the opposite direction. There's a flabbergasted look on his face -- he recognizes this kid. WIPE TO: INT. BATCAVE - A MINUTE LATER At the monitor bank, watching BATMAN's pursuit of SELINA, are VICKI and ALFRED. They pivot suddenly at the sound of a VOICE: PENGUIN Such primitive entertainment. He's holding a gun on the two of them. He stares about delightedly, taking in the prehistoric splendor of the cave. His eyes light up at the sight of the BATMOBILE, parked on its little plateau. PENGUIN (cont.) So Bruce equals Batman. It seems I've discovered two treasures! (an evil smile) Don't move. I'd be only too happy to shoot you both. He pulls out his packet of photos and begins to scan the cave. He spots the distinctive ROCK FORMATION in an upper vault of the cavern. It's a couple of plateaus over; a long narrow CATWALK runs past it, some ten or twelve feet below. PENGUIN The Gotham City Treasury. It's about to be stolen twice. ALFRED Don't be absurd. You'll never be able to get it out of here. PENGUIN Oh, I'll manage somehow. You two are my guarantee of that. (nudging VICKI with the gun) Let's have a look, shall we? You go first. He shoves her. She starts across the catwalk, his gun at her head. INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT SELINA's made it back upstairs, but she's moving at quarter- speed, favoring one leg and clutching her ribs as she lopes down the hallway. She's just passed the balcony overlooking the entry hall when BATMAN appears dead ahead in her path. He's ready to rumble -- but instead of responding, she packs it in. She stops, slumps against a wall and begins to laugh. SELINA It could've been so nice -- you and me -- if only you weren't so screwed up. BATMAN It's over. I don't want to hurt you any more. SELINA Tell me something -- one thing. If you don't enjoy all this...why do you do it? He just looks at her. He doesn't have an especially good answer. She sighs. SELINA (cont.) I'll never understand men. She SPINS SUDDENLY, delivering a high-kick to BATMAN's throat. As he reels backward, into a wall, she leaps up onto the narrow BANNISTER RAILING some thirty feet above the entry hall floor and goes into a CROUCH -- preparing to SPRING at the enormous crystal CHANDELIER mounted to the ceiling -- -- but just as she launches off, BATMAN rolls -- and brings up a GUN from his belt. He fires a RAZOR-SHARP DISK which sails past her head, cleanly SLICING THROUGH the chain which suspends the chandelier. The chandelier FALLS just as CATWOMAN catches hold of it -- and she finds herself PLUMMETING to the floor of the entry hall. On impact, the chandelier EXPLODES into a thousand fragments; the CATWOMAN lands hard on her back and lies sprawled in the midst of the wreckage, unmoving. BATMAN advances slowly down the stairs. Her arms and legs jut out at unnatural angles; she lets out an eerie, whimpering YOWL OF PAIN -- a cri du chat. He stands over her; she glares up at him. BATMAN Nine lives. CATWOMAN I can't move. I can't move. Her face is cut and bleeding. She tries to lift an arm and can't quite manage it. He crouches down beside her, still cautious... CATWOMAN (cont.) DON'T LOOK AT ME!! (pleading) Do me, baby...do me now...that's what I want. Please? BATMAN looks up. DICK is standing on the balcony overlooking them, highly curious as to what he'll do. BATMAN No. BATMAN slowly rises to his feet. She lets out another gruesome WHINE. CATWOMAN COME ON. Don't stop now. FINISH ME OFF. (almost weeping with pain) Son of a bitch. You're all alike... Her STEEL CLAWS snick into place. With an agonizing effort she lifts her forearm -- bends her wrist. She's trying to slit her own throat. He reaches for his belt, extracts a GLASSINE CAPSULE, and breaks it open with his thumb. He drops it amid the shattered glass around her face. A tiny cloud of GREEN GAS plumes out, and her hand falls limply at her side as she lapses into unconsciousness. BATMAN stands over her for a minute as DICK marches down to join him. DICK You should've done it, man. You should've killed her. BATMAN gives him a long, hard look -- but says nothing. BATMAN There's a radio in the cave. We'll send for help. INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER The PENGUIN and VICKI are on a catwalk just below the ROCK FORMATION. A STONE OUTCROPPING extends toward the catwalk, and he forces her to JUMP FOR IT. Now he has to follow; the prospect makes him nervous, but it's a short hop, and he clears it okay -- finding his footing on the rocky slope. They're cautiously making their way up toward the ROCK FORMATION when BATMAN appears suddenly at the far end of the catwalk -- sizes up the situation and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS. PENGUIN Ah, the illustrious Mr. Wayne. Look at you now. Whatever would your friends say? (smiling) You've been an exceptionally congenial host -- but I must ask you to back off. The PENGUIN grabs hold of VICKI and HOLDS HER CLOSE as they climb the last few feet toward the grotto. BATMAN swings his cape around, concealing his hands from view. He takes a cautious step backward. CLOSEUP - BATMAN'S HAND His free hand closes around a BATARANG -- flicks it open. ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI They've pulled almost even with the rock formation. A LARGE DANK GROTTO is visible through a small gap in the rocks. PENGUIN No sudden moves. It's a long way down. Gun at her head, he peers into the grotto... HIS POV - INSIDE THE GROTTO A VAST FORTUNE in GOLD and SILVER BULLION, undisturbed in all these years. GLINTING in the darkness. Hanging upside-down, above it, like silent guardians, are BATS -- DOZENS of them -- their tiny wet red eyes GLIMMERING at the PENGUIN... He dislodges a rock. It tumbles into the grotto... ...and a startled BAT comes screeching out of the gap in the rocks -- FLYING DIRECTLY AT HIS FACE. ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI He BACKS AWAY IN HORROR as the bat streaks past him. He FIRES HIS GUN wildly. The SOUND OF IT rouses MORE BATS, and they come flying out of the hole -- a VAST, CHITTERING SWARM. VICKI SHRIEKS; the PENGUIN STUMBLES -- and the two of them FALL BACK ONTO THE ROCKS, hanging on for dear life. BATMAN VICKI! An instant later BATMAN lets fly with the BATARANG. Clean hit; the PENGUIN staggers back, and his GUN skitters down across the rocks. With BATS screaming all around her, VICKI takes a deep breath and VAULTS toward the CATWALK. She's a foot short; she grabs hold of the railing and HANGS THERE, over the ABYSS, trying to pull herself up. BATMAN races toward her -- -- but the PENGUIN, clambering down across the rocky outcropping, has managed to grab hold of his GUN. The BATS have begun to swirl up toward the higher recesses of the cavern, and he's able to draw a clean bead on BATMAN. THUNDEROUS ECHOES reverberate through the cave as the first shot strikes BATMAN and knocks him backward. As the second spins him around. As the third sends him TOPPLING OVER THE RAILING. VICKI screams. BATMAN manages to grab the rail with one hand. Now two of them are hanging from the catwalk -- sitting ducks -- and the PENGUIN is determined to empty the clip. The ECHOES are cacophanous. ANCIENT STALACTITES drop from the vaulted roof of the cavern, PLUMMETING DOWNWARD like deadly projectiles, shattering agaist the cave floor. And then -- BATMAN pulls a tiny DEVICE from his utility belt and FLINGS IT. It lands in the rocks at the PENGUIN's feet. He stares down at it, and two beats later -- -- it begins to emit an EERIE ELECTRONIC WHINE. Within moments, EVERY BAT IN THE CAVE is in a FRENZY -- HOMING IN ON THE SIGNAL. The PENGUIN looks up sees them coming. A CHOKED WAIL emits from his throat as he drops the gun and stands there, PARALYZED. He's just been beaten at his own game. He lets out a last awful HOWL as HUNDREDS OF BATS ENGULF HIM -- -- and he PLUNGES DOWN INTO THE PIT -- his hideous scream dwindling to a faint echo, then vanishing altogether... BATMAN manages to drag himself up onto the catwalk. He rushes over to VICKI, pulls her up, drapes his cape around her protectively. Gradually, as the BATS recede to their distant perches, he stands and helps VICKI to her feet. They embrace on the edge of the abyss. On the far plateau, DICK has hooked up with ALFRED. The butler is slumped against a lab table, weary and exhausted, clutching his wounded arm. DICK slings an arm around him and helps him to the stairway. CUT TO: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT SQUAD CARS everywhere. FRICK and FRACK emerge in handcuffs, flanked by COPS. PARAMEDICS carry the still-unconscious SELINA past on a stretcher and load her into the back of an ambulance. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - NIGHT The place is an utter mess. Amid the carnage we find BRUCE conferring with COMMISSIONER GORDON and LT. BULLOCK. In b.g., a POLICE DOCTOR is dressing ALFRED's gunshot wound. GORDON ...and then Batman showed up? BRUCE He saved all our lives, Jim. I can't say for sure, but I'd bet she's the one behind the murders. GORDON God -- I pray you're right. (beat) One thing before we go, Bruce. Who's the kid? BRUCE looks into the front parlor, where VICKI and DICK are righting the fallen Christmas tree. BRUCE Oh, that's Vicki's little cousin. He's in town for the holidays. GORDON Well, he picked a hell of a time to visit. (turning to go) Merry Christmas, Bruce. Good luck cleaning this place up. GORDON and BULLOCK file out, followed by the POLICE DOCTOR. BRUCE smiles wearily to himself and strolls into the front parlor. INT. FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT ALFRED loads 'SILENT NIGHT' on the CD. VICKI ambles up to BRUCE: VICKI What are you going to do with all that gold? BRUCE I dunno. Might be a good start on a place to live -- for some people who don't have one. She hugs him. DICK plugs in the Christmas-tree lights; they blink to life just as the GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes twelve. VICKI It's Christmas. BRUCE Yeah. Maybe you should -- open your present. She runs a hand along his cheek and laughs softly. VICKI Oh, Bruce, presents doesn't matter. None of it matters. We're all safe. We're together. BRUCE ...You might as well. He digs around in his jacket pocket and produces a tiny GIFT BOX, which he hands to VICKI. She unwraps it, opens it slowly -- and sees a DIAMOND RING inside. She gazes up at him, speechless. He gazes back. CAMERA PULLS UP and away until we can see the whole of the devastated room, and all the people in it -- VICKI, falling into BRUCE's arms; DICK, off to one side, watching them; ALFRED, tossing broken furniture into a roaring fireplace. And on the image of this decidedly eccentric family unit, we FADE OUT. THE END
BATMAN 2

     EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - DUSK

     It's finally happened.  Hell's frozen over.

     Christmas is two weeks off, arid SNOW is falling in Gotham.
     Beneath its pristine white blanket, the city looks
     uncharacteristically serene -- almost inviting.  Peace has
     been miraculously restored: strangers wave hello.  Salvation
     Army Santas ring their bells on streetcorners.  And now, as
     night falls, an ILLUMINATED SIGN winks on above Broad Avenue:
     "JOYEUX NOEL GOTHAM -- Only 16 Shopping Days Left Till
     Christmas."

     The streets are bustling with jolly shoppers.  At a souvenir
     store, we find an exasperated MOM squabbling with her seven-
     year old.  Like many other storefronts in Gotham, this one is
     overflowing with bootleg BATMAN MERCHANDISE: t-shirts, key
     chains, ceramic figurines.  The kid is already wearing a
     Batman baseball cap and a little black cape, but he obviously
     wants more.

     Mom drags him off past another store window, this one full of
     SCRAP METAL, with a sign reading "AUTHENTIC FRAGMENTS OF THE
     BATWING -- $19.95 and up."  A PANHANDLER is perched at the
     entrance.  Beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt
     with the familiar yellow-and-black logo.  In Gotham this
     winter, Batmania is everywhere...

     EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - LATER THAT NIGHT

     Two hours later, the SNOWSTORM's grown into a full-fledged
     blizzard.  The drifts are two feet deep and the streets are
     all but empty of cars.  A massive SNOW PLOW the size of a
     Panzer tank rumbles past, FILLING THE FRAME...

     ...and revealing, as it passes, a group of CAROLERS, all
     bundled up in mufflers and parkas.  Unbothered by the weather,
     they walk the street singing, spreading cheer and goodwill to
     the few passersby.

     They've just gone into a lovely a capella rendition of "Silent
     Night" when an oversized DELIVERY TRUCK, outfitted with snow
     chains, clanks slowly past in the wake of the plow.  Its sides
     are decorated with cartoon igloos advertising a popular ice
     cream snack -- POLAR BARS -- oddly inappropriate for this time
     of year.

     A streetcorner SANTA, with bell and bucket, WAVES at the truck
     as it rounds a corner.  The CAROLERS carol.  Then --

     -- a VIOLENT EXPLOSION rocks the street -- followed by the
     sound of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE and a high, wailing SECURITY ALARM.

     EXT. SCHRACH AND CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     Around the corner there's CARNAGE on the streets.  The windows
     have blown out of Gotham's leading jewelry store.  Gut-shot
     SECURITY GUARDS stagger and go face down in the snow as
     ROBBERS, dressed in white camouflage gear, clamber out through
     the shattered glass with SACKFULS OF LOOT.

     CAROLERS spill around the corner to see what's going on, but a
     spray of GUNFIRE sends them scattering in panic.  The POLAR
     BAR truck pulls even with the jewelry store, and as it does...

     The REAR DOORS open.  A RAMP slides down from the back of the
     truck.  The ROBBERS scramble aboard, and mere seconds later
     SLIDE out AGAIN -- riding atop five SKIDOO SNOWMOBILES.

     SIRENS HOWL.  A POLICE CAR appears, taking the corner just a
     trifle too fast -- FISHTAILING on the icy street and plowing
     into a drift.

     INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The COPS gun the engine, but their wheels are spinning in the
     snow -- no traction.  They're about to climb out and give
     chase on foot when, through the windshield, they see the
     Salvation Army SANTA...

     ...HOISTING AN AK-47 AND FIRING DIRECTLY AT THEM.  The
     windshield disintegrates and the COPS sink from view as SANTA
     races off to the last of the snowmobiles, which is already
     burdened with LOOT.

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     MORE SQUAD CARS converge on the jewelry store -- but it's
     difficult to carry on a high-speed pursuit when the snow's a
     foot deep and the best you can do is 6 MPH.  The COP CARS skid
     to a halt, blocked by the rumbling SNOWPLOW.  By now, of
     course, the LOOTERS are gone -- scooting off on either side of
     the plow, sticking to the snowy sidewalks.

     EXT. STREETS - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     SNOWMOBILES glide across the sidewalks, sending the few hardy
     souls who are out on the streets DIVING FOR COVER.  A couple
     of DERELICTS are cowering behind a fire hydrant, trying to
     avoid getting run over.  Every time they poke their heads out,
     another SKIDOO whizzes past, missing them by inches.

     The ROBBERS fan out in various directions.  These guys are
     obviously going to get away clean -- unless...

     The DERELICT points up at the night sky, where a BEACON is
     blazing in the darkness -- THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT...

     INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     MORE SIRENS.  A COP takes a radio call as he streaks down the
     long wide avenue which borders Gotham Park -- one of the few
     streets which is relatively clear.  The COP at the wheel goes
     wide-eyed and nudges his partner in disbelief.

     Before their eyes, FIVE SNOWMOBILES appear from the cross
     streets up ahead and CONVERGE at the entrance to Gotham Park.
     Bringing up the rear is SANTA CLAUS.

                               COP
               What the hell -- ?

     EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BRAKES SQUEAL.  Several squad cars are now massed at the
     entrance to the park -- but there's one problem.  The city's
     snow plows don't operate on the park roads -- and the entrance
     is blocked off with SAWHORSES reading "CLOSED TO TRAFFIC."  A
     huge steep drift prevents them from entering -- and so all
     they can do is stand by helplessly, WATCHING as the
     snowmobiles vanish into the trees.

     The COPS race about like headless chickens, trying to concoct
     a plan.  A couple of them are trying to scale the stone walls
     of the park.  Another is at his car, barking into a radio
     mike:

                               COP WITH MIKE
               Yeah, you heard me.  Snowmobiles!
                    (pause)
               So what do we do?  Chase 'em on foot??

     ALL EYES TURN at the blare of a horn.  The COPS peer down the
     long corridor of the cross street -- and see a STRANGE BLACK
     VEHICLE barreling toward them at 90 MPH, with no intention of
     stopping...

     THE BATMOBILE!!  COPS dive left and right.  A split-second
     later...

     ...a FORTY-FOOT JET of NOVA-INTENSITY FLAME erupts from the
     front of the jet-black supercar -- instantaneously DISSOLVING
     the drift that blocks the entrance to the park -- turning the
     ice and snow on the paths before it into water!

     The BATMOBILE screams past in the wink of an eye.  The COPS
     get to their feet; cold as it is, they're sweating.  One of
     them mops his brow and announces, dumfounded:

                               COP I
               ...That was Batman.

                               COP II
               NO SHIT!!

     COP II yanks COP I into the nearest squad car, and the others
     follow suit.  ENGINES REV.  As long as the BATMOBILE's cleared
     a path, they might as well join in the chase...

     EXT. BRIDLE PATH - THAT MOMENT

     TWO BURLY TEENAGERS -- both dressed in RED BERETS and PARKAS
     with BLACK BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS visible underneath -- are
     trudging along the path when they're STARTLED by a pair of
     speeding SKIDOOS.  Moments later, they spot a RED GLOW on the
     horizon...

     ...and their JAWS DROP as the BATMOBILE roars into view,
     BURNING OFF THE SNOW IN ITS PATH.  Thrilled beyond words, they
     WHOOP WITH GLEE, slapping high-fives as the car streaks past.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT

     His face is weirdly illuminated by the flame still spitting
     from the front of the car.  Cool as ever -- approaching the
     chase as a simple problem in logic -- he checks a radar
     display on his dashboard and sees FIVE BLIPS.

     EXT. PARK - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The cops follow along in BATMAN's path.  The lead car LOSES
     CONTROL and plows headlong into a drift.  The DRIVER jams the
     pedal, but his rear wheels end up digging a deep rut in the
     ice.  He sits there cursing, pumping the accelerator as other
     COPS race past him on foot.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

     The various ROBBERS have spread out, their vehicles BOUNDING
     over the hilly terrain of the park.  He spots two of them up
     ahead; as he draws closer, they PART WAYS, veering off to the
     left and right...

     ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - MOVING

     PODS OPEN on the front fenders, and MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate
     into place.  The Batmobile fires a pair of HEAT-SEEKING
     TORPEDOS, which BURROW into the snow on either side and
     disappear.

     ANGLE ON LEFT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING

     The DRIVER looks back over his shoulder and sees what appears
     to be a BLACK SHARK FIN plowing through the snow behind him,
     GAINING FAST.  He takes evasive action, but the SHARK FIN
     always seems to follow.  Just as he approaches the crest of a
     hill...

     ...the TORPEDO slams into the rear of the SNOWMOBILE.  The
     force of impact knocks the ROBBER cleanly off.  His LOOT lands
     in the snow beside him, but the SNOWMOBILE keeps going --
     sailing over the crest of the hill and striking the rocks
     beyond with a deafening EXPLOSION.

     ANGLE ON RIGHT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING

     This ROBBER's a little smarter than his buddy.  When he sees
     the shark fin on his tail, he noses his snowmobile off into a
     GROVE OF TREES.  The trees are too closely spaced for the
     torpedo to maneuver; it strikes the nearest tree trunk and
     explodes harmlessly.

     The ROBBER is feeling good about himself, because the
     Batmobile can't follow either.  But BATMAN has a Plan B.  As
     he drives alongside the grove, he HITS THE ACCELERATOR,
     passing the snowmobile on its left.  A STEEL SPIKE attached to
     a cable launches from the side of the Batmobile and WEDGES
     ITSELF into a distant TREE.

     The cable goes taut, and the tree TOPPLES -- directly into the
     path of the second SNOWMOBILE.  The vehicle crashes into the
     trunk, and the hapless ROBBER goes cartwheeling head-over-
     heels into a drift.

     In the distance, COPS appear -- racing to the scene on foot,
     ready for mop-up duty.  BATMAN kills the flamethrower, hits
     the brakes, and FISHTAILS, doing a quick 180 on the snow.
     He's just spotted fresh quarry: snowmobiles three and four,
     whizzing over a rolling white pasture in the distance.

     EXT. PARK - THAT MOMENT

     We're at a makeshift CAMPSITE -- where a cluster of HOMELESS
     PEOPLE are burning refuse in a garbage can to keep warm.  They
     look on in puzzlement as the two SNOWMOBILES whiz past and
     disappear over a crest of a hill...

     EXT. LAKEFRONT - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4

     They bounce down the hillside and SKID -- arriving at the edge
     of a frozen-over LAKE.  With the roar of the Batmobile behind
     them, the two DRIVERS get the same idea simultaneously.
     Smiling, they rev their engines and set out over the surface
     of the lake.

     Now the Batmobile crests the ridge.  The car's weight tips
     suddenly and it begins to skid down the hill toward the lake.
     BATMAN sees what's happening and kills the flamethrower just
     in time -- but he can't brake the car on the snowy slope.  The
     prow of the Batmobile slides out onto the edge of the lake --

     -- and under its weight, the ICE begins to crack.  The left
     front tire takes a sudden dip -- and worse yet, the car is
     sliding forward.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

     He shifts frantically from drive to reverse, trying to rock
     the car out of its predicament, but his rear wheels find no
     purchase.  He can hear the ice cracking beneath him.
     Grimacing, he throws a switch on the dashboard --

     EXT. LAKE - ON BATMOBILE

     -- and the trunk pops open.  An industrial-strength GRAPPLING
     HOOK shoots upward and digs in at a point beyond the crest of
     the hill; and a concealed WINCH ASSEMBLY begins to grind away,
     hauling the Batmobile uphill, out of danger.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

     Suspended just above the icy lake, he sees the SNOWMOBILE
     vanishing into the distance.  He opens (yet another) panel on
     the dashboard...

     EXT. LAKE - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4

     The ROBBERS give each other a big thumbs-up.  They're almost
     halfway across the lake now and the Batmobile is disabled.
     All at once they hear a strange WHISTLING overhead...

     Fireworks?  No, it's a THERMITE BOMB -- rocketing past them,
     hitting the ice some forty feet ahead and EXPLODING GAUDILY.
     JAGGED CHUNKS OF ICE break free and SHIFT in the frigid water
     -- and the ROBBERS are skidding into the drink before they
     know what's hit them.

     ANGLE ON SNOWMOBILE #5 - MOVING

     The last of the robbers is SANTA CLAUS -- his big sack filled
     not with toys, but precious stones.  He approaches the edge of
     the park, negotiating his way through a maze of rocky
     outcroppings.  He squirts out from behind a boulder into a
     clearing...

     ...and GASPS in PANIC as a SEARING BURST OF FLAME erupts
     behind him.  The BATMOBILE speeds out from the other side of
     the boulder; SANTA twists his accelerator, desperately trying
     to build up speed.

     As it is, he's barely managing to stay ahead of the
     flamethrower.  But the jet of flame suddenly DIES; the HOOD of
     the Batmobile rises half a foot --

     -- and TWIN PROJECTILES launch into the air.  A heavy NET is
     strung between them -- and it lands SMACK ON TOP OF SANTA
     CLAUS, entangling the snowmobile and stopping him in his
     tracks.

     Immobilized, he watches through the net in horror as the
     Batmobile barrels down.  When the great black machine is
     almost atop him --

     -- it stops on a dime six inches from his heavily-padded
     frame.

     EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT

     The COPS are spread out near the entrance.  They've rounded up
     the other ROBBERS and returned most of the loot.  They hear a
     dull ROAR in the distance...

     ...and a few seconds later the BATMOBILE streaks into view,
     dragging the NET behind it -- SANTA, his loot, and his
     snowmobile, all tied up in one tidy parcel.

     At the entrance to the park, the NET detaches itself from the
     Batmobile, dumping SANTA into the hands of the waiting COPS.
     Without stopping, the BATMOBILE roars out of the park and
     vanishes whence it came.  A mildly-humiliated COP turns to his
     colleague and SHRUGS:

                               COP I
               ...Merry Christmas.

     The second COP points to SANTA, still struggling in the net.

                               COP II
               Gift-wrapped and everything.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

     TV MINICAM CREWS are camped out on the steps of City Hall,
     with a sizable crowd watching from the street.  COMMISSIONER
     GORDON is reading from a prepared statement.

                               GORDON
               After a high-speed chase -- over $750,000
               in precious jewels were recovered intact
               by the police force -- working in concert
               with Batman.

     At the sound of Batman's name, a CHANTING goes up in the
     crowd:

                               VOICES IN CROWD
               TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE
               STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE --

     GORDON winces and lets out a sigh.  The CHANTERS are a group
     of pugnacious, well-muscled KIDS, late teens and early
     twenties, all dressed in identical garb: black Batman
     SWEATSHIRTS and little red Guardian-angel BERETS.  They're
     obviously members of the same club -- just like the guys we
     saw in the park.

     GORDON waits for them to shut up, but they don't; so he grabs
     the mike and speaks slowly and distinctly, trying to be heard
     over the din.

                               GORDON
               I would like to stress -- that while this
               city enjoys a special relationship with
               Batman --
                    (louder)
               -- we do not condone vigilantism --
                    (practically screaming)
               -- IN ANY FORM.

     It's no use.  He's totally drowned out by the RED BERETS, who
     continue to shout and shake their fists.  Giving up, he
     returns the mike to a REPORTER and marches up the steps in a
     huff.  The RED BERETS CHEER.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

     The evening news: a live, on-the-spot interview from Gotham
     Square.  A superimposed GRAPHIC identifies a surly kid in a
     RED BERET as "MIKE SEKOWSKY -- SPOKESPERSON -- ORDER OF THE
     BAT."

                               SEKOWSKY
               And hey!  Where does this --
                    (BLEEP; expletive deleted)
               -- Gordon get off calling us ?
               We're not breakin' any laws.  We're a
               group of concerned citizens, that's all --
               just like Batman.

 WOMAN IN CROWD                You people are nothing but hoodlums!

 SEKOWSKY                Hey, lady -- we're out here on patrol
               riskin' our necks to protect old biddies
               like you.
                    (into mike)
               If this lame-o Gordon could do his job --

     MORE CATCALLS from the crowd.  The picture jumps suddenly as a
     minicam is jostled; some sort of SCUFFLE appears to be
     breaking out.  Before it does, CAMERA PULLS BACK from the TV
     screen, placing us in:

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - NIGHT

     where ALFRED THE BUTLER is watching the Sekowsky interview
     with extreme dismay.  As he trims the crusts from a pair of
     hearty watercress sandwiches, he SLICES HIS FINGER OPEN.

     ALFRED makes a pained face -- it's all Sekowsky's fault.
     Onscreen, the fracas continues; SEKOWSKY has recommandeered
     the mike...

                               SEKOWSKY (on TV)
               We're provin' that the spirit of Batman is
               alive in this city.  We're gonna take back
               the streets!

     SEKOWSKY raises a fist.  Behind him, his CRONIES begin to
     chant: "TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE STREETS!"
     Incensed, sucking on his finger, ALFRED moves to the TV and
     flicks it off.

     He turns on the radio in search of something more soothing.
     "Good King Wenceslas" pipes through the manor; smiling, ALFRED
     sets the sandwich plate alongside a steaming kettle on a
     Sterling silver tea service.

     INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The CAROL CONTINUES UNDERNEATH as ALFRED, white linen draped
     over one forearm, sets the tea tray down on his master's big
     mahogany desk.  He digs in his pocket for a key and unlocks a
     side drawer.

     The drawer contains a stack of yellowed, aging NEWPAPER
     CLIPPINGS -- among them one which reads "THOMAS WAYNE
     MURDERED: Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery.
     Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed."  ALFRED digs
     around beneath the clippings and finds a concealed SWITCH at
     the rear of the drawer.

     Gears grind, and a sectional bookcase detaches itself from the
     wall -- sliding out a couple of feet to reveal a STONE
     STAIRWAY which descends into darkness...

     INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     Descending the stone stairs, ALFRED arrives in the Batcave.
     "Good King Wenceslas" is on the speakers down here as well.
     Across a catwalk the BATMOBILE rests on its little plateau,
     wrapped in a tarp.

     ALFRED clears some space on a lab table and sets the tea
     service down.  He glances up at the bank of video monitors and
     sees SEKOWSKY, still babbling, on several channels
     simultaneously.  He scans the cave, but there's no trace of
 BRUCE. 
 ALFRED                Sir?  -- MASTER BRUCE??

     As if in response, BATS screech and flutter in the distant
     recesses of the cavern.  ALFRED turns suddenly and sees BRUCE
     behind him, suspended from a thin filament wire, RISING OUT OF
 A BOTTOMLESS ABYSS. 
 BRUCE                I'm not deaf, Alfred.  I hear you.

     He's wearing his civvie -- tweed pants and cashmere sweater --
     but he's got the utility belt, with its spring-action reel,
     buckled about his waist.  Clutching a bundle, he hangs in
     midair for a moment, dangling over the void.  ALFRED slowly
     regains his composure:

 ALFRED                I took the liberty of preparing tea.
                    (indicating tbe monitors)
               I take it you've been watching the news?

     BRUCE, still dangling, glances up at the SEKOWSKY interview
     and nods.

 BRUCE                Yeah...lot of crazy people in this world.

     BRUCE rocks back and forth to build up momentum.  He kicks off
     on the nearest stone outcropping, lands gracefully on the
     Batcave floor, and unbuckles his belt.  Preoccupied, he drops
     his mysterious bundle on the lab table: a roll of black
     fabric, and a cluster of lightweight, hollow ALUMINUM RODS,
     connected by what appears to be SURGICAL TUBING.

 ALFRED                I should inform you...Christmas is
               approaching, and we've received our annual
               solicitation from the Fireman's Toy Fund.
                    (eyeing the equipment)
               If I may inquire...?

 BRUCE                Oh, yeah.  Watch this.

     BRUCE hits a trigger on a tiny gas canister attached to the
     tubing.  The tubing inflates and the rods spring erect --
     stiffening, wing-like, into something which looks remarkably
     like the skeleton of an umbrella.

 ALFRED                Most ingenious, sir.  What exactly it? BRUCE What does it look like? ALFRED To the untrained eye, sir, it looks remarkably like...the skeleton of an umbrella. Sounds good. BRUCE eyes his new invention, thinks it over, smiles slyly. BRUCE Good guess, Alfred. That's exactly right. BRUCE hits the trigger, and the rods WILT with a hiss. He sits at his lab table; ALFRED unfolds a napkin on his lap, pours a cup of tea. ALFRED Splendid, sir, and if I may say, I'm glad you're putting your time to such productive use. (beat) Now -- the Toy Fund. Our contribution last year was a half-million dollars... BRUCE We can do better than that. ALFRED Then there's the foster-parents program... the Gotham homeless crusade... BRUCE nods abstractedly and tucks into his sandwich. He seems oddly preoccupied -- not exactly melancholy, but his thoughts are obviously a million miles away. ALFRED looks on, concerned: ALFRED (cont.) Is something troubling you, sir? BRUCE Yeah...the holidays, I guess. Always gets me thinking about... (he changes the subject) And to tell you the truth, I'm a little -- concerned about Vicki. ALFRED (anxiously) Miss Vale, sir...? BRUCE Yeah. I've been thinking about it lately. Thinking about it a lot... (gravely; shaking his head) ...and I still can't figure out what to get her for Christmas. BRUCE shoots ALFRED a solemn, perplexed look -- and ALFRED heaves an audible sigh of relief as we CUT TO: INT. PRISON CELL - DAY TIGHT ON a stack of COOPS and CAGES, piled high against a bare concrete wall. Each cage -- and there are at least two dozen of them -- contains a twittering BIRD: starlings, pigeons, cardinals, titwillows... CAMERA PULLS BACK from the bars of the cages to reveal a VERY ODD FIGURE in prison greys. A CANARY, perched on his shoulder, SINGS HAPPILY as he stands in front of a grimy, cracked mirror, plastering back his hair, BUFFING HIS NAILS with quick, birdlike strokes. MR. BONIFACE is beak-nosed, epicene, and so fat that it seems his skin should burst; the adjective that comes to mind is "obscene." Despite his eccentric appearance, he comports himself with overblown, theatrical dignity. Fastidious and preening, he does not suffer insults lightly. CAMERA PULLS BACK FURTHER -- through another set of bars -- and we realize that MR. BONIFACE is himself caged. A PRISON GUARD arrives to slide back his cell door... GUARD Up and at 'em, Pengy. -- Pengy? MR. BONIFACE pointedly ignores the GUARD, refusing to acknowledge the odious (if wholly appropriate) nickname. GUARD (cont.) Boniface... MR. BONIFACE finally turns. With an expression of extreme distaste, he affixes a MONOCLE over one eye, returns the canary to its cage and allows himself to be ushered out. INT. WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY MR. BONIFACE and his ATTORNEY sit at a long table across from the WARDEN and the members of the PAROLE BOARD. PAROLE OFFICER You want to return the money you stole. BONIFACE Intact. The map will show you where it's buried. The PAROLE OFFICER stares skeptically at a hand-scrawled MAP. PAROLE OFFICER All of it. Forty-two million dollars. MR. BONIFACE stares down humbly at the table -- as if he finds the mere mention of his transgression too embarrassing to bear. PAROLE OFFICER II Why this sudden change of heart? MR. BONIFACE Gentlemen, I want my debt to be repaid in full. I want to be a part of civilized society! (oozing sincerity) Prison life is not for me. The guilt, the fear, the constant shame...one meets a disturbingly low class of people. PAROLE OFFICER II Sure, but -- forty-two million dollars?? MR. BONIFACE nods plaintively. It's quite a perfomlance. He dabs at his face with a handkerchief; it's hot in here, and he's the delicate type... WARDEN His record's clean. Thirteen years without an incident. ATTORNEY I'd like to point out, my client's put his time to good use. A student of ornithology...articles published in several respected journals... The PAROLE OFFICER thumbs through a stack of magazines: Bird World, Ornithological Review, Beaks And Feathers, Nest Egg. MR. BONIFACE Birds, yes. My only source of solace. PAROLE OFFICER In light of this rather extraordinary gesture, I see no reason not to endorse your application for parole. BONIFACE Thank you, sir. You won't regret it. MR. BONIFACE shakes hands with the members of the PAROLE BOARD. As the GUARDS escort him out, a BLACK MYNAH BIRD SQUAWKS LOUDLY from its cage in the corner of the office: MYNAH CRIME DOES NOT PAY. AAWWK!! CRIME DOES NOT PAY. CHUCKLES all around. On his way out the ATTORNEY gestures toward the mynah -- and BEAMS at the parole board: ATTORNEY Personally trained by my client. INT. PRISON CELL - DAY Free time -- the cell doors are open and the convicts are milling around in the common area. T-BONE, 220 lbs. of dumb, hulking beef, saunters up to his cell and finds his bunkmate, MR. BONIFACE, staring at a stack of EMPTY CAGES. BONIFACE whirls on him suddenly, his face beet-red, APOPLECTIC WITH RAGE: MR. BONIFACE -- Where are my birds?!? T-BONE Shit, Pengy. I let 'em go. MR. BONIFACE Hermione. My canary. It's the dead of winter! T-BONE flops casually on his bunk, obviously enjoying MR. BONIFACE's profound distress. T-BONE They were all cooped up. With you leaving and all -- seemed like the humane thing to do. BONIFACE'S GAZE FALLS on a corner of the cell. He spots a scattering of YELLOW FEATHERS -- a patch of FRESH BLOOD. With a supreme effort of restraint, he turns and forces a smile... MR. BONIFACE I see. -- You might as well have this. I won't be needing it... He tosses a SONY WALKMAN to T-BONE, who flicks it on. The dim strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC are audible through the earphones... T-BONE Well, thanks, Pengy. No hard feelings. (chuckling to himself) Y'know, I'm gonna miss that pudgy little ass of yours. T-BONE tunes the Walkman to a rock station, slips the headset on, grins from his bunk. TWO GUARDS arrive. As they escort him out, MR. BONIFACE mutters: MR. BONIFACE You won't miss it long. EXT. PRISON - MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY It's fifteen degrees outside as MR. BONIFACE -- aka THE PENGUIN -- waddles forth from the prison gates, regally attired in cutaway and pin-stripes. He pauses to inhale a deep lungful of the icy air; then, with a smile of exhilaration, he removes his coat and STRETCHES -- spreading his wings, REVELING in the cold. A STRETCH LIMO pulls up. Two identically gaunt and vulture- like DANDIES, formally dressed, with bowler hats and umbrellas, step out to meet him. These two gentlemen -- FRICK and FRACK -- serve as the Penguin's general factoti and "business managers." FRICK Welcome back, Mr. Boniface. PENGUIN Mr. Frick. Mr. Frack. Our years of planning are about to pay off. INT. LIMO - MOVING - DAY Now that he's loose, the PENGUIN's rapacious side is beginning to show. His eyes twinkle with greed as he contemplates his own ingenuity. PENGUIN I take it they found the money all right? FRACK We buried it exactly as you specified. $42,271,009... PENGUIN How much have we got left? FRICK reaches into his coat for a BALANCE SHEET. FRICK Let's see -- an initial capitalization of 42 million and change, compounded over thirteen years, at an annual return of just under sixteen percent -- PENGUIN Fine, fine. How much? FRICK Seventy-nine million. -- Excluding the sum we buried. THE PENGUIN lets out a dry, heaving CHORTLE, midway between a normal laugh and a DUCK'S QUACK. He checks his watch and reaches into his pocket for a small ELECTRONIC DEVICE. PENGUIN Speaking of burials... EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY T-BONE on work detail. He's got the Walkman on and he's shoveling snow to the beat. He winces, and removes the headphones... The MUSIC he was listening to has been replaced by an eerie, high-pitched WHINE. He's twisting the knob, trying to find the station he was tuned to, when a PIGEON dives down STRAIGHT AT HIS HEAD. T-BONE HEY -- ! He drops the shovel as the bird STRIKES, glancing off his head. Before he can react, THREE MORE PIGEONS have swooped down at him, PECKING at his head and shoulders in a frenzy. He lets out a HOWL and staggers through the prison yard in a frenzy. DOZENS of PIGEONS are pouring over the prison walls, SHRIEKING HIDEOUSLY, descending on him. He falls to the ground screaming for help, but the other prisoners run like rabbits, terrified... By the time the GUARDS come racing across the courtyard, T-BONE's no longer even visible. There's just a swarming, man-shaped mass of PIGEONS, pecking away, flapping their wings insanely. Covering their faces as they move in, the GUARDS blow their whistles -- BEAT AT the pigeons with billy clubs. All at once, the PIGEONS take off en masse -- leaving T-BONE's mutilated corpse sprawled in the yard. A GUARD notices the Walkman, picks up the earphones to listen, and hears nothing but ROCK MUSIC -- "Surfin' Bird" by the Trashmen. Bird bird bird, bird is the word... EXT. ROAD - ON PENGUIN'S LIMO - MOVING An AERIAL VIEW of the LIMO as it cruises down the deserted road leading away from the prison. It disappears from view -- and all at once the frame is filled with PIGEONS, great squalling FLOCKS of them, dutifully following their master as he makes his way back to Gotham City. DISSOLVE TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT ALFRED opens the front door and finds a bundled-up VICKI out on the portico, red-cheeked, flushed, and happy. She pulls him forward, gives him a quick peck on the cheek. VICKI Guess what, Alfred. I think I found a present for Bruce. She's got a long, skinny GIFT BOX propped up against the exterior wall. At first it doesn't want to fit through the door -- it must be eight feet long -- but with ALFRED's help she gets it inside. The faithful butler stares curiously at this odd-shaped gift... VICKI (cont.) Skis. -- Don't let on, okay? ALFRED He won't hear a word of it from me. VICKI He's such a nightmare to shop for. -- What do you get him year after year, Alfred? ALFRED (conspiratorially) I find you can't go wrong with surveillance equipment. Let me put this under the tree... VICKI Not so fast. She reaches into the pocket of her coat and pulls out another small gift. ALFRED stares at the tag -- "TO ALFRED, LOVE VICKI" -- and tries to suppress a HUGE GRIN. ALFRED Why, Miss Vale -- ! VOICE FROM BEHIND What's all this? ALFRED and VICKI turn. It's BRUCE, dressed for dinner, marching down the long stairway in the entry hall. VICKI waves frantically. VICKI Don't look. It's your present. VICKI rushes over to embrace him. He gapes at the long skinny box -- BRUCE What'd you get me? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? VICKI frowns and gives him a kiss. She nestles up against him. WHISPERS in his ear: VICKI I'm going to give you the happiest Christmas you've ever had. Still in the clinch, BRUCE shoots a look at ALFRED. Taking the hint, ALFRED clears his throat and bends to pick up one end of the ski box. He backs out of the entry hall, dragging the box before him... CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM PARK - NIGHT FIRES burn in garbage cans. TENTS and LEAN-TOS dot the snowy landscape. Men, women, and children wander aimlessly, huddling against the cold. An army of the HOMELESS has set up camp in Gotham Park. On the nearby periphery, PICKETERS -- half concerned citizens, half down-and-outers -- are marching the sidewalks, keeping a candlelight VIGIL. Hand-lettered placards read: "SAVE THE PARK." "PARKS ARE FOR PEOPLE." "THIS PARK IS OUR HOME." The source of the protest? A towering SIGN posted in a corner of the park, announcing the imminent consuuction of a new luxury highrise -- the GOTHAM PARK TOWERS -- a project of Shaw Construction, Inc. A LAMBORGHINI sits at a traffic light nearby... INT. LAMBORGHINI - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT BRUCE and VICKI, dressed for dinner, stare out at the demonstration. VICKI Homeless. (beat) I was just down here Tuesday. Seems like there's more every day. BRUCE starts to say something, but can't think of anything to say. VICKI (cont.) Christmas time. And they say there's over a thousand people living in the park already. BRUCE -- Yeah. The light changes. BRUCE throws the car into gear and -- at the next intersection -- turns the car right, into the park. EXT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT Despite the name, it's a tony little bistro catering to Gotham's elite. A PANHANDLER, underdressed for the cold, has been hustling the customers as they come out; a couple of PARKING ATTENDANTS are trying to drag him discreetly away as BRUCE'S CAR pulls up. A VALET opens the car for BRUCE and VICKI, who look on in concern as the PANHANDLER gets the bum's rush. The liveried DOORMAN shrugs apolagetically -- sorry for the inconvenience -- as they enter. INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT Post-dinner. VICKI's got a sheaf of PHOTOS spread out on the table in front of BRUCE -- shots of Gotham's HOMELESS, being forcibly evicted from slum dwellings, erecting their SHANTYTOWNS in Gotham Park. VICKI They're already razing the tenements and SRO's downtown. These people don't have anyplace else to go. (beat) If the city starts selling off the park... BRUCE takes a good long look at his opulent surroundings. HUGE WINDOWS open on a serene and picturesque view of the park; CAMPFIRES flicker in the distance... BRUCE -- Yeah. I guess I'll pass on dessert. VICKI (taking his hand) Bruce, you do a lot more than most people even dream of. BRUCE Sure. Comes off the top of my taxes -- VICKI That's not what I meant. They exchange a long silent look. Of course she's referring to Batman. Still, the argument doesn't hold much water with BRUCE. BRUCE -- What I "do" doesn't come close to the root of the problem, Vicki. (long pause) I'm just a Band-Aid. VOICE FROM BEHIND Bruce! It's been ages! VICKI turns -- and rapidly closes her photo folder. Millionaire construction magnate RANDALL SHAW is in the restaurant table-hopping, and he's just glommed onto BRUCE. BRUCE Randall. You remember Vicki. -- How's the construction business? SHAW The park tower? All systems go. If we can get the junkies and winos cleared out... (a big grin) Not too late to get in on the deal. BRUCE I'll think about it. SHAW Say, Walter Barrett's due back from Europe. We should all get together at the club. (clapping him on the shoulder) Nice to see you again, Miss Veal. "Miss Veal" maintains a big phony smile as SHAW moves off to the next table. She murmurs to BRUCE through clenched teeth: VICKI What a pig. BRUCE I've known him since he was seven years old. He was a pig then too. VICKI Now he wants to gobble up the park... (shivering) Bruce -- isn't there something you can do about people like that? BRUCE What, tie him up with a bat-rope? VICKI No, you idiot. I meant you. Bruce. BRUCE nods -- oh, yeah. Subtle distinction. INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT BRUCE and VICKI emerge from the restaurant. He hands his parking stub to a VALET. A crowd's beginning to form in the lot outside... The red-and-blue bubble of a POLICE CAR is flashing a short distance off, near the entrance to the park. TWO RED BERETS, in full Order-of-the-Bat regalia, look on as a recently-mugged WOMAN JOGGER gives her statement to the investigating COPS. BRUCE and VICKI, intrigued by the Batman-wannabes, move a little closer -- within eavesdropping range: RED BERET I We were on patrol. Saw the whole thing. JOGGER I was attacked. Three men in ski masks -- COP I (indicating the RED BERETS) And these two broke it up? JOGGER These two?? They ran like rabbits. I never saw anybody take off so -- RED BERET II Hey! Somebody had to go for the cops. COP II You. SHUT UP, all right?? (to the JOGGER) Lady, who was it that bailed you out?? JOGGER A kid. Thirteen or fourteen tops. He just came out of nowhere and -- tore into 'em. (shaking her head) It was so quick I didn't even see his face. Nearby, VICKI shoots a highly quizzical look at BRUCE, who responds with a mystified shrug. Her professional curiosity piqued, she wanders over to introduce herself to the JOGGER. An exasperated COP leads the RED BERETS away from the crime site: RED BERET I Dumb shit. Shouldn'ta been jogging in the park at night anyway. (sullenly) Look around you. It's fulla bums. BRUCE gestures at the RED BERET's Batman sweatshirt as he passes. BRUCE Nice outfit. RED BERET I Piss off, geek. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WATERFRONT DISTRICT - NIGHT Snow blankets the abandoned warehouses rimming Gotham Harbor. FOGHORNS blare in the distance as a pair of STILETTO HEELS -- totally inappropriate for the weather -- click across the sidewalk and pause at mid-block, where a wide wooden plank leads down from street level to a seedy hole-in-the-wall bar: the WHARF RAT. INT. WHARF RAT - NIGHT A roughneck joint, about as trendy as the average bait shack. The clientele consists primarily of surly types who are saving up for their next tattoo. A TV over the bar is tuned to the late news: ANCHORWOMAN ...and tomorrow, the city's power elite will be turning out in force to greet millionaire industrialist Walter Barrett, who returns to Gotham after a five-year stay in Europe... The BARTENDER switches to a hockey game, because none of the rowdies at the bar give a shit about Walter Barrett. None, that is, except for a strapping young bruiser named RICKY, who gets up and makes his way to a pay phone in the corner. Moments later, the owner of the high heels enters; she opens her black fur coat and unwraps her muffler, revealing exotic, vaguely Eurasian features. She's dark and elegant, fine- boned, regal of bearing -- and her name, though we don't know it yet, is SELINA KYLE. She's not the kind of girl who typically frequents the Wharf Rat, and so her entrance creates quite a stir. A LONGSHOREMAN at the nearby pool table misses his shot and digs a rut in the felt. Two blowsy WHORES size her up territorially as she finds an open stool at the bar and settles in with serene indifference. The regulars, of course, are all but licking their chops. The only guy in the joint who hasn't noticed her yet is RICKY, who's still on the phone: RICKY Yo. Ricky here. What's the haps? In mid-conversation he notices SELINA. She smiles invitingly -- right at him. Mildly startled, he smiles back. RICKY (cont.) Midnight. No sweat. See you then. He hangs up eagerly. Then, with a deep breath, he hitches up his pants and swaggers over to SELINA's end of the bar. SELINA Well. "Ricky," is it? RICKY How'd you know that? SELINA I heard you on the phone. Talking to your girlfriend. RICKY Girlfriend? No, no. That was business. SELINA makes a big show of peeling off her gloves. SELINA If you've got time for a little pleasure ...maybe you'd like to buy me a drink. She clasps his hand. His EYES BUG OUT. Three enormous rings, a diamond bracelet -- there must be several thousand in rocks on her left hand alone. RICKY gapes at the sparklers, bedazzled. RICKY Jeez -- they look almost real. SELINA Why wouldn't they be? RICKY is not the smoothest guy around, and his line of thought is all too evident. He swallows hard and tries not to stare. RICKY You'd have to be crazy. Nobody'd wear the real thing to a dive like this. SELINA Oh, they're real, all right. So are these. She waves her FINGERNAILS -- long, polished, and talon-sharp -- in front of his eyes. With lightning speed, before he can react, she pins his wrist to the bar -- and with one quick stroke carves a THIN BLOODY STRIPE in the back of his hand. SELINA's eyes flash as he gasps in shock. He tries to jerk his hand away, but he can't break her grip. Then -- her dominance firmly established -- she releases his hand with a coy, Cheshire-cat smile. SELINA (cont.) Weren't we going to have a drink? He blinks, forces a chuckle, smiles unsteadily. She takes his wounded hand, lifts it slowly to her mouth, and LAPS GENTLY at the blood. RICKY is hypnotized. She's got an odd way of flirting, but RICKY finds it somehow -- intriguing. He dabs at his hand with a napkin and signals to the BARTENDER. CUT TO: EXT. WATERFRONT - PIER 31 - NIGHT Just after midnight; the snow's still failing, the waters are icy, and the wharfs are deserted -- almost. A small STEAMBOAT is docked at Pier 31, and the deck is lined with THUGS -- mean, ugly, and heavily armed. A similar contingent of gun-toting GOONS is waiting to greet them on the dock below. The boys on the dock hoist ASSAULT RIFLES as the BOAT THUGS extend a gangplank. Something major is about to happen... The CHIEF DOCK GOON gestures to his LIEUTENANT, who grabs a black MEDICAL BAG. Hands raised, the two of them start up the gangplank. Throughout all this, the DOCK GOONS keep their guns trained on the BOAT THUGS, covering their buddies. One of them turns to a colleague: DOCK GOON I Where's that goddam Ricky? DOCK GOON II Probably out gettin' laid. And here we are freezin' our balls off... EXT. STEAMBOAT - ON DECK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The LIEUTENANT unloads chemical testing gear from his doctor's bag. The lead BOAT THUG gestures to a stack of SHIPPING CRATES which rest atop a large NET spread out across the deck. BOAT THUG I You pick. The CHIEF GOON selects a crate at random. Two BOAT THUGS tip it on its side and, using a crowbar, pry off a FALSE BOTTOM -- revealing a dozen packets of WHITE POWDER. POV SHOT - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT We're now watching the scene from a vantage point atop a ramshackle boathouse at water's edge. Down on the deck of the steamboat, the LIEUTENANT goes to work testing the merchandise. LIEUTENANT It's pure. REVERSE ANGLE - THAT MOMENT A BLACK SILHOUETTE is peering down from the boathouse roof. The mysterious watcher ducks quickly out of sight; the only details that register are a pair of ominously familiar POINTY EARS... CHIEF GOON (O.S.) Let's do it. He gestures to his boys on the dock. A CRANE-AND-WINCH assembly rotates into place over the deck -- and the BOAT THUGS gather up the corners of the netting and attach them to the big hook. BOAT THUG I Hold it. Let's see the money. Down on the wharf, a DOCK GOON kneels beside a metal suitcase and opens it. Lots of long green inside. The BOAT THUG signals thumbs up, and the CRATES rise into the air as the goon with the suitcase starts up the gangplank. LOW ANGLE - ON GANGPLANK - THAT MOMENT The goon with the suitcase marches up. Beyond him, in the distance, a LITHE BLACK SHADOW vaults off the boathouse roof and makes a silent, graceful landing on the long shaft of the CRANE. ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT The moment of maximum tension: grim faces all around, everyone holding a gun on someone else as the suitcase arrives on deck and crane swings over the pier. ANGLE ON CRANE - THAT MOMENT Razor-sharp, CHROME-STEEL TALONS slash suddenly through the air. ON DOCK - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT The netting GIVES WAY, and TWO DOZEN SHIPPING CRATES rain down onto the pier, CRUSHING two DOCK GOONS underneath. The crates explode into splinters, littering the dock with drugs and random ART OBJECTS as the other DOCK GOONS scatter in panic. ON STEAMBOAT - THAT MOMENT Nobody knows quite what's going on. Panicking, the GOON with the suitcase full of money turns tail and dives for the gangplank. BOAT THUG I sees him and squeezes off a quick shot. Winged, the GOON topples off the gangplank and hits the drink, suitcase and all. Pandemonium. All at once, everyone's OPENING FIRE. Thinking he's been double-crossed, BOAT THUG I turns on the CHIEF GOON and SHOOTS HIM TWICE at point-blank range. BOAT THUG I YOU SON OF A BITCH! (to another BOAT THUG) Go after it. Get the money. GO!! He raises his gun, and the second BOAT THUG dutifully obeys -- diving off the deck into a hail of gunfire. Everyone's ducking for cover. BOAT THUG I barks orders at the pilothouse: BOAT THUG I Soltar las amarras! -- CAST OFF!! ANOTHER BOAT THUG LOOK! BOAT THUG I whirls, just in time to see a SHADOWY FIGURE landing cat-like on the deck mere yards away. Clad in inky black leather from head to toe, the intruder's face is concealed by what appears to be a BONDAGE MASK. Studded, with openings for the eyes and mouth, it spans one incongruous touch: a pair of POINTED CAT EARS. She bares her teeth and HISSES. It's a woman. BOAT THUG I is momentarily mesmerized. In the time it takes him to lift his gun, she's produced a CAT-O'-NINE-TAILS. She SNAPS it at him: REELS HIM IN; and with one lethal stroke, RAKES her steel talons across his face and throat. He slumps to the deck, lifeless. The other BOAT THUG rushes her; she catches him under the jaw with a sudden upthrust, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR, and sends him toppling into the water. The gangplank falls aside as the steamboat pulls away from the pier. She hoists an abandoned ASSAULT RIFLE, SCATTERS the DOCK GOONS with a round of automatic fire, and VAULTS off the boat -- landing in a graceful crouch on the edge of the pier. Most of the DOCK GOONS have taken flight, but a few unlucky specimens remain behind. She somersaults forward; takes one goon off his feet with a crack of the whip; knocks another off the dock with a twirling high-kick to the jaw; sends two more reeling with swift talon-slashes. The whole frenzied mop-up action takes just under ten seconds. Alone at last, she stands back to survey the scene. Counting the stiff's on the boat -- which is now receding in the harbor -- there must be well over a dozen dead. The snow is speckled with red. A half-dozen bodies lie sprawled in their own blood; one of them, the lone survivor, is face-down and softly MOANING. Retracting her steel claws, the MASKED WOMAN crouches amid the wreckage of the smashed shipping crates. BINDLES OF WHITE POWDER -- millions of dollars' worth -- are scattered all about the pier, but she couldn't seem less interested. Instead, she's checking the MANIFEST NUMBERS stamped on the sides of the crates. She finds crate #18396-BB and rummages among its contents until she comes up with a carefully-wrapped parcel. She opens it carefully and holds it up for inspection. The statuette of a RAVEN -- carved from solid onyx -- glistens in the moonlight. The WOMAN pauses long enough to slip a small CARD in the MOANING PUNK's back pocket. Then, cradling the raven under one arm, she dashes off on silent cat feet. A LANTERN approaches. It's an OLD SALT -- some kind of hapless night watchman -- and his face goes bone-white at the sight of the carnage on the docks. He kneels beside the moaning punk, turns the body over, and GASPS -- because the PUNK'S FACE has been CLAWED TO SHREDS. PUNK Murcielago. MURCIELAGO!! CUT TO: INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - NIGHT The unique chamber in which we find ourselves is alive with the flutter and song of COLD-WEATHER BIRDS -- dozens of them, all chirping, flitting about in the rafters, alighting on special perches mounted in the walls. At the center of this penthouse room is a vast sunken POOL. ARCTIC TERNS loll on the surrounding rocks as a LACKEY with a wheelbarrow empties cracked ice into the already-frigid water. Carefully landscaped, it looks like the penguin exhibit at the Gotham Zoological Gardens. A MASSIVE, INDISTINCT SHAPE glides beneath the surface. It's not a whale; it's too pink. It is, instead, the PENGUIN -- and as he breaks the surface, sputtering, he sees FRICK standing in the open doorway. FRICK Mr. Boniface? Your...visitor has arrived. PENGUIN Thank you, Mr. Frick. Show her in. The PENGUIN moves to the edge of the sunken pool. Two of his LACKEYS swivel a CROSSBAR, which hangs from the ceiling by a long chain, into place over his head. He grasps it with both hands -- and the crossbar RISES, hoisting his formidable bulk out of the water. INT. HIGH-RISE - CORRIDOR - THAT MOMENT FRICK leads the VISITOR down a long corridor lined on either side with BIRD CAGES -- exotic songbirds with brilliantly-hued plumage. CAMERA TRACKS ALONG behind her, and although we can't see her face, there must be something distinctively feline about her -- because the BIRDS are shrieking and fluttering in their cages, RECOILING INSTINCTIVELY as she strolls past. FRICK opens a door and ushers her into... INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT Our visitor -- SELINA KYLE -- enters the penguin-pool room. Her teeth begin to chatter. The big bay windows have been thrown open, and SNOW is blowing in from outside. It's freezing in here. She sees the PENGUIN -- wearing a thin dressing gown and an APRON outfitted with SEED POUCHES -- scattering birdseed on the window ledge for the pigeons, totally oblivious to the cold. He turns, throws his arms wide in greeting, kisses the back of SELINA's hand. PENGUIN Ah, Miss Kyle! At last we meet. SELINA At last we meet. -- Pigeons? PENGUIN Yes, they're common birds -- dirty, stupid, unattractive -- but they're very obedient, and they do crap on people's heads. May I? She extends a SHOPPING BAG. The PENGUIN removes a parcel and unwraps it, revealing the RAVEN STATUETTE. He sets it on a nearby desk, fondles it reverently...and BEAMS at SELINA. PENGUIN (cont.) I see your reputation was not exaggerated. SELINA I've located the others. All but one. (shivering) I'm surprised you don't catch pneumonia -- ! With an apologetic smile, the PENGUIN pulls the windows shut. PENGUIN My normal body temperature is ninety-two degrees. Germs find me inhospitable. SELINA I see why they call you the Penguin. PENGUIN They may call me that...but rarely more than once. Champagne? She nods. He pours two glasses, hands one to SELINA, raises a toast. PENGUIN (cont.) My dear. Here's to the second biggest crime in the history of Gotham City. CUT TO: INT. POLICE OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT COMMISSIONER GORDON and another cop, LT. EDDIE BULLOCK, are in darkened antechamber adjacent to an interrogation room. BULLOCK It wasn't about the drugs. Whoever it was left thirty kilos sitting on the docks. They're watching, through a two-way glass panel, as a terrified man with a heavily-bandaged face tells his story. It's the lone survivor of the dock massacre, JULIO, and his voice is audible over a concealed intercom: JULIO (filter) Un silueta negra -- con colmillos, y garras -- el demonio. El murcielago. MURCIELAGO! GORDON What's that he keeps saying? BULLOCK "Murcielago." -- Bat. GORDON Nonsense. That dock looked like a slaughter-house. Batman's never committed murder. BULLOCK We did find this in his back pocket. BULLOCK hands GORDON a CARD. It reads: "THOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH" -- and in lieu of a signature, there's a little black BAT-EMBLEM in the bottom corner. While GORDON's staring at it, a POLICEMAN pokes his head in: POLICEMAN Commissioner? We've got Barrett. INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT A cubicle down the hall. The splenetic WALTER BARRETT, millionaire industrialist, is fidgeting in his chair as GORDON enters. BARRETT Fine welcome. These storm troopers of yours dragged me away from my coming-home party! (beat) I'd like to know the meaning of this -- GORDON I'd like to know how thirty kilos of pure cocaine wound up concealed in your personal effects. BARRETT Gordon -- I come from one of the oldest and most influential familles in Gotham. If you plan to accuse me of smuggling drugs, be my guest. (long, menacing pause) I'll have your badge before you leave this room. GORDON weighs the threat. He nods to the COPS in attendance... GORDON Book the son of a bitch. GORDON storms out. BARRETT jumps out of his chair, but the COPS restrain him. Outraged, he bats their hands away... BARRETT I believe I'm still entitled to a phone call. CUT TO: EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - DAY VICKI with her camera, squeezing off snaps. She's standing behind a SAWHORSE, part of a crowd of onlookers at a downtown DEMOLITION SITE. SURVEYORS and HARDHATS bustle about in a VACANT LOT, a full city block in size, fenced off and strewn with rubble. The only structure still standing is a lone, decrepit TENEMENT BUILDING; a WRECKING BALL is poised above it, ready to strike. A SIGN at one corner of the lot announces a forty-story OFFICE COMPLEX soon to be erected on this site by SHAW CONSTRUCTION, INC. Down below is RANDALL SHAW HIMSELF, in necktie and hardhat, speaking into a WALKIE-TALKIE: SHAW Come on! Let's move it! We're an hour behind as it is!! A few moments later, a CLUSTER OF PEOPLE emerge from the tenement building -- a mixed team of COPS and CONSTRUCTION GOONS who are forcibly removing a DESTITUTE FAMILY from the condenmed building. VICKI watches angrily... HER POV - TELEPHOTO LENS A quick series of shots: the SQUATTERS wailing and struggling, clinging to the doorways, unwilling to leave. Their few belongings are packed in a couple of CARDBOARD BOXES, which the cops heave rudely out onto the street. Finally, the handcuffs and nightsticks come out... ANGLE ON SHAW - THAT MOMENT - DAY A SURVEYOR grabs SHAW by the arm and points out the woman taking photos in the crowd. SHAW recognizes her instantly. His face turns into a mask of outrage -- as if he's been personally betrayed. SHAW Jesus Christ, that's Bruce Wayne's bimbo! He makes eye contact with her. VICKI stares back defiantly. He's about to stroll over and tell her off when a HARDHAT signals to him: HARDHAT Phone call, Mr. Shaw. Guy said it's urgent. SHAW (to tbe SURVEYOR) Hold the ball. I wanna hear it crash. He climbs into the cab of a nearby TRUCK, where he picks up a CELLULAR PHONE. INTERCUT - BARRETT AND SHAW BARRETT's still in custody at the police station -- using his one phone call to contact the construction magnate. BARRETT It's me, Randall -- Walter Barrett. I want you to call my attorney. That was my shipment they busted up last night. SHAW Jesus, Walter, I -- (suddenly puzzled) Why are you calling me?? BARRETT It's worse than that. Somebody took my raven. SHAW stares at the phone in horrified disbelief. ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT SHE WATCHES as SHAW climbs out of the truck -- numb, in a daze. He signals to the WRECKING BALL OPERATOR; a WHISTLE blows, and the great iron ball knocks a MAMMOTH HOLE in the facade of the tenement. SHAW doesn't even stick around to watch it. He scurries off to his car at the end of the block. VICKI, highly intrigued, gets it all on film... INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY VICKI's in a huddle with the Managing Editor, SCHULTZ, showing him her PHOTOS -- SHAW orchestrating the eviction of the SQUATTER FAMILY. SCHULTZ Great stuff, but we're looking at a shitfight with our beloved publisher. He and Shaw... (crossing his fingers) Old money sticks together. VICKI points to a photo of SHAW racing from the truck to his car. VICKI I'd sure like to know what shook him up so. He was out of there like a scared rabbit... Just then, a reporter -- WILK -- rushes up excitedly to SCHULTZ's desk. WILK Got a blind tip from downtown. You know that massacre on the docks? Batman. VICKI reacts in astonishment. SCHULTZ's jaw drops -- this is hot. EDITOR Whoa! Is this on the level? WILK Cops even got a note. "Those who feed on the soul of Gotham will suffer my wrath!" (grinning; to VICKI) Sounds like your pal's cranked it up a notch. VICKI starts to protest, but thinks better of it. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - EVENING ALFRED opens the door. A BANNER HEADLINE stares him in the face: BATMAN IMPLICATED IN DOCK MASSACRE Industrialist Linked to Drug Smuggling Ring VICKI, who's holding up the afternoon paper for ALFRED's inspection, peeks out glumly from behind the masthead. VICKI Seen the late edition? ALFRED I'm afraid so, Miss Vale. Master Bruce is sequestered in the cave. INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING On their way to the Batcave, ALFRED and VICKI pass through the library. They pause in front of the television -- which is tuned to a PANEL SHOW, with various experts discussing the hot issue of the day. ENVIRONMENTALIST (on TV) Walter Barrett's no saint. His factories have been dumping poison into the air and water for years. If he is mixed up with drugs... PUNDIT (on TV) That's not the issue. The issue is, do we entrust our public safety to some...masked vigilante. Does Batman have a license to kill? ALFRED (shaking his head) Ah, the public. Dishearteningly fickle. VICKI follows ALFRED out. We HOLD on the TV as the CAMERA PANS OVER to the third guest on the panel, loudly demanding air time. He's wearing a RED BERET and a BATMAN SWEATSHIRT: MIKE SEKOWSKY (on TV) Yo, here's the tip, man. Drug dealers are scum. If Batman did wax these punks...SO WHAT? They deserved it! End of discussion. INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING ALFRED and VICKI arrive; BRUCE gestures for them to keep quiet. He's hunched over a TAPE RECORDER -- and COMMISSIONER GORDON'S VOICE is blaring from a nearby speaker... GORDON (O.S.; filter) Anyone could've written that note. INT. GORDON'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT GORDON's in conference with a number of CITY OFFICIALS -- blissfully unaware that anyone might be eavesdropping. CITY OFFICIAL I And I suppose anyone could've taken out a boatload of armed thugs. A dozen men, Jim -- murdered in cold blood -- GORDON Before we forget, Batman's saved hundreds of lives! CITY OFFICIAL II He's still a vigilante. We don't know who he is, where he comes from, why he does it... CITY OFFICIAL I Street punks are one thing, Jim. This is Walter Barrett -- a personal friend of mine! As the conversation continues, CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN ON a COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner. We see the tiny TRADEMARK embossed on the CPU -- "WAYNE TECHNOLOGIES." INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - ON BRUCE as he LISTENS through his concealed bug. CITY OFFCIAL II You've gotta bring him in, Jim -- at least for questioning. It would sure help if we could get that mask off... BRUCE shuts the recorder off. He turns to face ALFRED and VICKI -- BRUCE Ladies and gentlemen...I've been framed. CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT The BAT-SIGNAL blazing in the night sky. After a beat, the CAMERA TILTS DOWN to a cluster of EXCITED CITIZENS, who point and holler as the BATMOBILE streaks past. INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT TWO COPS are parked in an alleyway, watching as the BATMOBILE whizzes past on the street. The DRIVER pulls out behind it as the second COP grabs his radio mike... COP One-delta-niner -- 10-80 on Riverview north-bound at 33rd -- 10-78, repeat 10-78. VOICE ON RADIO (filter) 10-4, one-delta-niner -- that's a 10-37, repeat 10-37. Backup on the way. EXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE BARRELING TOWARD US on the street. The SQUAD CAR gains behind it. A SIREN HOWLS; a red-and-blue bubble begins to flash... The BATMOBILE makes a HAIRPIN TURN -- and ACCELERATES. OVERHEAD ANGLE - THE STREETS As the BATMOBILE rounds the corner and picks up speed, TWO MORE SQUAD CARS scream down the cross street, joining in the pursuit. All at once THICK BLACK SMOKE billows from the back of the Batmobile -- ENVELOPING the police cars, BLINDING THE DRIVERS... EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TWO SQUAD CARS parked in a V-formation -- a makeshift roadblock. ANXIOUS POLICEMEN mill about in front of them. They move into position as the BATMOBILE, still trailing smoke, rounds a corner and careens directly toward them... ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT The FRONT FENDER of the Batmobile detaches and EXTENDS itself from the body of the car. It BENDS in the middle; WING-PANELS flip into place, forming an arrowhead-shaped COW-CATCHER. EXT. STREET - ON ROADBLOCK A SHRIEKING HORN BLARES. The COPS see the Batmobile SPEEDING UP and dive for the sidewalk. The COW-CATCHER slams into the SOUAD CARS, pushes them effortlessly aside, and cruises through the gap. As the PURSUING CARS emerge from the smoke cloud and follow the Batmobile through, we TILT UP to the roof of a nearby building -- EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT -- and realize that the Batmobile's on automatic pilot, because BATMAN's been on the roof all along -- watching the action with some dismay. His relationship with the Gotham PD appears to be on shaky ground. He speaks into his voice-activated REMOTE CONTROL UNIT: BATMAN Evasive. SIRENS HOWL below as he strolls across the rooftop, lost in thought. CUT TO: INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT At this height, the SIRENS are a distant insect drone. We're in the palatial digs of RANDALL SHAW, the construction magnate. There's obviously money to be made in real-estate development -- because the walls are lined with art, and the floor-to-ceiling windows open on the most spectacular view in Gotham. At the moment, SHAW's posing casually in front of his new Brancusi -- which rests on a pedestal near the windows. An UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN in a slinky black dress LOOKS ON, her back to the camera... WOMAN It's a fake. SHAW Hmm. It cost me a half a million dollars. You're sure? WOMAN Absolutely. You see, I...happen to know where the real one is stashed. The WOMAN wanders out of frame as SHAW smiles, impressed. He seems peculiarly nonchalant about the whole deal; at the moment, art is not the first thing on his mind. CAMERA STAYS ON HIM as he pours two glasses of red wine and circles in on his mysterious guest. SHAW I guess you'd know. I have some "friends" in the art world. They say that -- for certain hard-to-get items -- you're the one to call. WOMAN (O.S.) How flattering. SHAW They say for the right price...you could steal Michelangelo off the Sistine Chapel Wall. WOMAN (O.S.) Mr. Shaw. Do you believe everything you hear? SHAW Oh, I'm not one to judge. I admire people who take what they want. I'm just curious how you do it. SHAW hands her the wine, and for the first time we see her face. It's SELINA KYLE, perching seductively on the arm of the sofa... SELINA I find that the old methods work best. Setting her wine down, flashing her patented Cheshire-cat smile, SELINA moves in on him -- and they go into a deep, passionate kiss. Her long red nails dig into his back; SHAW drops his wine glass, which SHATTERS -- splashing red wine across the polished parquet floor. INT. PENTHOUSE - SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT The action's gone horizontal. SELINA, peeled down to a sheer lace teddy, is on the bed atop SHAW -- tickling his throat with quick, lapping kisses. She rolls off suddenly; when he tries to sit up, she pushes him back down with a single finger. Sitting on the edge of the bed, she peels off her STOCKINGS, twisting them around into tight cords. With a coy smile she runs her finger in a circle around SHAW's hairy chest -- and then, abruptly, knots one stocking tightly about his wrist and ties it off on the bedpost. SHAW Hey, what are you doing -- ? He tries to break her grip. She BACKHANDS him sharply across the face. SELINA You're very inquisitive. You'll just have to be disciplined. An EDGY SMILE spreads across his face as she binds his other hand to the bedpost. None too quick, he's just caught on that all this is part of SELINA's kinky scene. She crosses quickly to the bathroom -- SHAW You know, I've...I've never really done this kind of thing before. -- and reemerges wearing her CATWOMAN mask...which seems perfectly appropriate in this context. SELINA I think people should indulge their fantasies. Don't you? Now that he's all trussed up, she crosses the room and reaches into an oversized bag. She withdraws an odd-looking chromium BRACE, slips it on over her wrist, and hits a trigger. SIX- INCH STEEL TALONS snick into place. SHAW's dopey smile fades... SHAW Hey, what are those -- what are you -- He lets out an awful, shrill SHRIEK as the camera WHIP PANS away from the bed to a Jackson Pollack on the wall nearby. A SPRAY OF BLOOD spatters across it -- in an aesthetically pleasing way -- and the SHRIEK ends in a LOW GURGLE as we CUT TO: INT. BUILDING LOBBY - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT A SECURITY GUARD is working a crossword at his booth near the entrance of the building. Behind him, a bank of MONITORS show various empty hallways throughout the building. He reaches for his coffee and sees a RED LIGHT flashing on a wall panel nearby. INT. SHAW'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT The penthouse is THROBBING with the clangorous sound of a BURGLAR ALARM. SELINA is standing by an OPEN WALL SAFE -- concealed behind a painting, which has been swung away on hinges -- and she's HOLDING HER EARS, wearing a look of complete exasperation: oh, shit. The GUARD'S VOICE crackles over a nearby intercom: GUARD (O.S.; filter) Mr. Shaw? What's going on up there? -- Mr. Shaw? Furious with herself, she reaches inside the safe and extracts a BLACK RAVEN statuette -- identical to the one she took on the docks. She slams the door shut and swings the picture back into place. EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT SIRENS echo in the streets. SQUAD CARS make sudden turns and streak off toward SHAW's building. EXT. ROOFTOP - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT Watching the cars from his rooftop vantage, BATMAN raises an ANTENNA mounted on his utility belt and cups one hand to his head. An EARPIECE concealed inside his cowl gives him the police frequency: DISPATCHER (O.S.; filter) -- possible 15 in progress, 188 E. 69th at Gotham Park West. Move out. It's Randall Shaw. Repeat, all units -- BATMAN's eyes widen. He steps to the ledge and pulls a TINY METAL CYLINDER from his belt -- immediately recognizable as part of BRUCE's hydraulic umbrella-gizmo. But it's no umbrella. When BATMAN thumbs the switch, his BLACK CAPE begins to SPREAD and RISE -- stiffening, expanding -- INFLATING itself into a pair of RIGID BLACK BATWINGS. He steps OFF THE LEDGE, INTO MIDAIR -- SOARING SILENTLY ACROSS THE STREET LIKE A HUMAN HANG-GLIDER as the cop cars cruise past far below. INT. SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT There's an awful BANGING at the front door. SHAW lies under the bloody sheets, hands folded, staring lifelessly up at the ceiling. SELINA, now dressed in full Catwoman regalia, slings a lightweight KNAPSACK over her shoulders. She picks up the nearest chair, RAMS IT through SHAW's plate-glass window, and clambers out onto the ledge outside. Ten seconds later the COPS burst in. They rush to the bedroom -- spot the shattered window, the inert gory mass on the bed -- -- but the real shock comes when they glance over at the wall. Painted there, in blood...is a big, red, dripping BAT. COP JESUS! EXT. ROOFTOP - SHAW'S BUILDING - NIGHT Forty stories up. The CATWOMAN, in a surefooted crouch, she scurries along the ledge -- SPRINGS at a cornice -- and in one lithe motion VAULTS UP onto the ROOF. She scampers across the rooftops, dropping from one to the next with rope and tackle, like a mountain climber -- -- until she reaches the building at the end of the block. Here she pauses to dig in her knapsack. She pulls out a retractable HOOK at the end of a rope, swings it around, HEAVES IT at the rooftop across the street... EXT. STREET BELOW - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT POLICE pile out of cars and race for the entrance, totally oblivious to the odd scene taking place overhead -- where the small, barely-visible figure of a WOMAN, clad entirely in black leather, is doing a TIGHTROPE WALK across the intersection. EXT. ROOFTOP - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT The CATWOMAN bounds across snowy rooftops until she decides she's out of danger. Then, weary and exhilarated, she drops to her knees; bathed in moonlight, she preens, stretches, emits eerie little purrs and hisses of pleasure. She's just made a kill and her blood is running high, so she's stopped for a moment of Quality Time. She hears an odd crunching noise two roofs over. Her whole body tenses and -- though her head doesn't move -- her eyes dart left. A CAPED SHADOW has just touched down at the end of a line. The gold BAT-EMBLEM on his chest is visible for the briefest of seconds before he steps back into the shadows. She acts like she hasn't noticed... ...but a little smile flickers across her lips just the same. TIGHT ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT His eyes widen -- his LIPS PART as he watches her. If it's possible to see absolute consternation behind that mask, we're seeing it now. HIS POV - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT She still doesn't let on that she's seen him. Instead, she goes to the ledge of the roof and begins to STRUT, like a gymnast on the balance beam -- POSING for him in a little private show -- a strange, self-infatuated, AUTOEROTIC DANCE ROUTINE for BATMAN's benefit. EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT His jaw is down around his knees. Whoa. He edges forward slightly, as if hypnotically drawn to her... She hears a noise. Stops. Makes a big show of looking left and right. Somehow afraid she'll see him watching, BATMAN jumps back into the shadows. She gathers her things; a small WHITE CARD flutters from her knapsack to the snowy roof, and she VANISHES over the edge. Snapping back to reality, he bolts across the roof just in time to see -- EXT. SIDE OF BUILDING - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT She's rapidly working her way down the side of the building, flipping down from one fire escape to tile next -- a master gymnast. Three stories up, she lands on a railing, then STOPS -- LAUNCHING HERSELF out over the street, making a perfect landing on the roof of a passing BUS. EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT BATMAN turns -- and his eyes fall on the WHITE CARD. He kneels to pick it up; a brief three-word MESSAGE is scrawled upon it... LOOKING FOR LOVE? He goes goggle-eyed with astonishment. He rushes back to the edge of the roof and sees the BUS just turning toward the entrance to Gotham Park. He's reaching for his grappling-gun, figuring to follow, when a FLOODLIGHT catches him full in the face. EXT. STREETS BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT Down below, the cops are sweeping their beams across the rooftops. Two of them catch a quick glimpse of BATMAN just as he ducks back behind the cornice, out of view. COP Hey. You see what I saw...? This sends the astounded COPS rushing to their radios. Right on cue, COMMISSIONER GORDON's car pulls up. LT. BULLOCK, who's already on the scene, fills him in as he climbs out. BULLOCK It's Randall Shaw. Torn to ribbons. -- We just made Batman up on the roof. GORDON Oh God. EXT. GOTHAM PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The BUS rumbles deeper into the snowy park. A BLACK SILHOUETTE springs off the roof into the trees, disappearing among the branches... We TRACK WITH the bus as it moves through the park, arriving finally at: EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - SHANTYTOWN - NIGHT The little colony of HOMELESS PEOPLE in their cardboard shacks and lean-tos, still occupying the future site of the Park Towers. MARCHERS and PICKETERS are continuing their protest nearby, and some charitable organization's set up a makeshift soup kitchen on folding tables -- hot coffee and sandwiches. VICKI's on the periphery of the camp, camera in hand. She's trying to persuade a HOMELESS MAN to let his picture be taken. VICKI Please, just one. It's important for people to see what's happening. HOMELESS MAN They don't want to see us, lady. They just want us gone -- out of sight, and out of mind. (mumbling as he wanders off) Get worse before it gets better. It always does. VICKI TURNS. In the distance, the PICKETERS are shrieking and wailing. A VAN's just pulled up to the edge of the park, and a dozen HARDHATS are elbowing their way through the crowd. All at once they're swarming through shantytown with TIRE IRONS and BASEBALL BATS, overturning the sandwich tables, RIPPING DOWN the shabby tents and lean-tos. Some of the HOMELESS PEOPLE run. Those who resist meet with swift and sudden violence. A MARCHER jumps a hardhat, and gets a baseball bat in the gut for his trouble. VICKI waits for the police sirens, but they don't come. She backs off toward the trees, she begins SNAPPING PHOTOS FRANTICALLY, capturing the carnage on film. A HARDHAT is dismantling a lean-to with his tire iron -- sending the terrified family inside scurrying off into the snow -- when he glances up and sees VICKI taking his picture. He points her out to a colleague... ...and suddenly the two of them are RUSHING TOWARD HER with pure cold malice in their eyes. VICKI turns to run, but it's slow going in the snow. She SLIPS and FALLS; her attackers are almost upon her... ...when a SHADOWY FIGURE DIVES OUT OF THE TREES and TACKLES one of the HARDHATS. The FIGURE lands a powerhouse blow to the fallen HARDHATs jaw, knocking him out cold. The second HARDHAT turns and lifts his TIRE IRON. But the FIGURE, with surprising agility, is already rolling out of the way. As he rolls, he grabs the first guy's HARDHAT off his head and brings it up in front of him -- blocking the blow from the second guy's tire iron. In the same motion, he plants a FOOT in the second HARDHAT's belly and sends him REELING BACKWARD, HARDHAT II drops the tire iron, and the FIGURE snatches it out of midair as he gets to his feet. He moves in on the second HARDHAT, BRANDISHING the iron -- -- and while HARDHAT II is staring at it, the FIGURE HIGH- KICKS HIM in the face. HOP; KICK. HOP; KICK. The FIGURE has nailed him three times squarely on the jaw before he can hit the ground. The FIGURE turns toward VICKI. Her eyes go wide with astonishment. It's a KID, thirteen or fourteen at the outside, sunken-eyed, grimy-looking, in a torn-and-tattered RAINCOAT. She stares at him for the briefest of instants before he rushes off to the aid of his fellow homeless... She can't believe what she's seeing. The KID wades smack into the midst of the remaining HARDHATS, and kicks ass -- spinning, pirouetting, kicking, clawing in a furious display of pure athleticism. It seems like he's everywhere at once. There's only one other guy in Gotham City who can handle himself like this... Rallying behind him, the MARCHERS and HOMELESS PEOPLE snatch bats and tire irons from the fallen HARDHATS -- and the tide turns. The invasion is being repelled. Faced with renewed resistance, the few HARDHATS still left standing TURN TAIL and race off to their VAN. Triumph in shantytown. The MARCHERS and HOMELESS cluster together to lick their wounds -- and the KID, satisfied that everything is under control, turns and sprints off toward the trees. But one prostrate HARDHAT is only playing dead. As the KID runs past, the HARDHAT extends a TIRE IRON into his path -- TRIPPING HIM, sending him sprawling in the snow. The KID throws up his hands as the HARDHAT prepares to smash down at him... CLANG. The HARDHAT drops his tire iron and topples over, BOARDLIKE. The KID looks up and sees VICKI standing there with a baseball bat. He gives her a quick nod of acknowledgement as he gets to his feet -- thanks for returning the favor. He's about to light out again when -- VICKI WAIT! Don't be afraid. I wanted to thank you. I -- KID (cautiously) Twenty. VICKI What? KID Twenty bucks. VICKI's mildly taken aback, but she reaches for her purse just the same. She's barely gotten her wallet open when the KID snatches the bill out of her hands. They stare at each other for a long moment -- VICKI ...Who are you? KID Dick. -- and then he's bounding off like a shot. VAULTING up into a tree and vanishing amid the snowy branches. VICKI starts to follow, but there's no way she can keep up. Instead she digs into her CAMERA BAG... HER POV - THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS Using the long lens, she tracks the KID's progress through the treetops. She can't actually see him, but occasional chunks of SNOW and ICE are falling to the ground as he jumps from limb to limb... For a moment it seems like she's lost him. As she sweeps the lens back and forth, scanning the trees, she catches sight of an EQUESTRIAN STATUE in the distance. She ups the magnification so she can see the plaque on the pedestal. The stone figure on the horse is Union war hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE -- BRUCE's great-grandfather. As luck would have it, the KID drops to earth not ten feet from the statue -- VICKI's got him in her sights again. He looks around cautiously to make sure no one's following, then races toward a STONE BRIDGE which arches between two small hillocks, over a frozen creek. There's a DRAINAGE TUNNEL, four or five feet in diameter, mounted in the bridge abutment, the KID pries off a wire grate and clambers inside, then pulls the grate back into place behind him. Home sweet home. EXT. PARK - ON VICKI - NIGHT as she lowers the lens. Her face is full of conflicting emotions. She'd love to corner this boy vigilante and find out what his story is. But on the other hand -- even the homeless are entitled to their privacy... CUT TO: INT. PENGUIN'S AVIARY - NIGHT A CANARY sings in its cage as a BLACK CAT watches transfixed from a nearby chair. The cat arches its back -- waits -- and SPRINGS AT THE CAGE, BATTING at it in midair. The canary SHRIEKS; the cat YOWLS; a WOMAN snatches it up off the floor, cradles it in her arms... WOMAN'S VOICE Now Hecate. You don't want that scrawny little bird -- It's SELINA, looking ripe and slinky in a sheer black ensemble. At the desk behind her is the PENGUIN, in his customary cutaway and waist-coat, polishing his new RAVEN. He bares his teeth: PENGUIN Do you want me to wring that creature's neck? SELINA You try it, I'll do the same to you. (as he grumbles; bemused) I saw him, you know. PENGUIN Saw who? SELINA Batman. He was dreamy. She strokes the cat, in a reverie. The PENGUIN drops his polishing cloth, startled. PENGUIN Dreamy?!? Are you insane!? My God -- (sputtering wildly) Are you sure it was him? What did he do? SELINA He stood on a roof and watched me. He didn't realize I'd seen him. I don't think he knew quite what to make of me. (smiling) But he was definitely interested. This sends the PENGUIN into a frantic round of pacing. (Or waddling.) PENGUIN This scheme of yours is backfiring. We don't need him on our tails. Do you know how much money is at stake here? SELINA Money isn't everything. (casually) What's the point if we can't enjoy ourselves? She chuckles to herself. He stares at her in disbelief -- and SQUAWKS. CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - MORNING The big SIGN over Gotham Square tells us there are only 9 shopping days left until Christmas. Down below, BRUCE is walking VICKI to work. VICKI Six-on-one, and he took 'em all out...then vanished into a drainage pipe -- right next to the statue of General Wayne. BRUCE My illustrious great-grandfather. Think it's the same kid we heard about? VICKI Must be. He reminded me of you. BRUCE chuckles. They pass a NEWSSTAND just outside the Globe building, pausing to stare at the headlines -- which SCREAM: NEW BAT-MURDER? Batman Suspect in Slaying of Millionaire Developer Commissioner Gordon Refuses Comment The accompanying photo is a full-color spread of the BLOODY RED BAT painted on SHAW's wall. BRUCE scowls at VICKI: BRUCE -- You work for this rag? (snatching up a paper) Your boss is calling for Gordon's resignation -- unless he brings Batman in for questioning... VICKI nudges BRUCE and points at a STOREFRONT across the street. THEIR POV - SOUVENIR SHOP The owner is in the store window, hastily removing all of his Batman merchandise and setting up new displays devoted to TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES and THE SIMPSONS. A MOTHER drags her squirming TODDLER past the entrance -- the kid smells heavy markdowns on Bat-shit, but Mom clearly doesn't approve... BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND VICKI looking on in dismay. BRUCE crumples the paper in outrage: BRUCE I need a good PR man. NEWS VENDOR Hey, pal -- you buyin' or borrowin'? With a sullen look, BRUCE tosses the paper back on the rack. VICKI pulls him off toward the entrance of the Globe. VICKI That's what happens when you go after the rich and powerful. BRUCE Hey, it wasn't me, remember? I am rich and powerful -- As he's talking, BRUCE glances back at the newsstand. He sees an AD FLYER tacked up on one side -- "LOOKING FOR LOVE? Find it in the GOTHAM GLOBE PERSONALS." Looking for Love. Eyes widening, he digs in his pocket for a quarter and races back to the newsstand. VICKI keeps walking... VICKI Maybe it's almost...good. In a weird way. I mean, Shaw, and Barrett -- if people like that were really scared, maybe they'd -- She suddenly realizes she's talking to herself. She turns around and sees BRUCE back at the newsstand, hurriedly unfolding a copy of the Globe. She marches back and tugs at his sleeve. VICKI (cont.) Hey, I'm late for work. You can read that later. BRUCE Quiet. I'm looking for a personal ad. Her face screws up in confusion as BRUCE frantically scans the page. BRUCE (cont.) "Tall, Dark And Handsome -- You saw me on the roof 12/16. I was in black; you were too." VICKI Is this some kind of bad joke? BRUCE It's her. That cat woman, or whatever she is. (reading aloud) "I jumped a bus into Gotham Park hoping you'd follow, but you were too shy..." VICKI What does she want -- a date? BRUCE She's trying to contact me. Says she's gonna leave me another ad... The two of them exchange a look of utter perplexity. BRUCE's mind is racing; he seems bizarrely aroused -- in a way that makes VICKI just a trifle nervous... INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY VICKI arrives at her desk and sets her portfolio down. She spots a message in the "in" file. She takes one look at it, and her eyes go wide with RAGE. She storms out in a fury... INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - A MINUTE LATER - DAY Barging past a phalanx of SECRETARIES, VICKI bursts into the inner office of HARRISON J. PROVOST, publisher of the Globe. He's just opening his mail. He heaves a weary sigh as VICKI BARKS at him: VICKI WHY DID YOU KILL MY STORY? PROVOST Close the door. (waiting for her to calm down) Your story isn't news. With Shaw dead -- VICKI But the project's still going ahead! If attacking homeless people in the park isn't news, I'd like to know what is -- PROVOST There's a psycho out there in a mask and cape -- killing off Gotham's most prominent citizens! That's news. (beat) I've known Randall Shaw all my life. His family is in mourning. And it just so happens I don't believe in slandering the dead. VICKI FUMES. She turns and stares PROVOST straight in the eye. VICKI Mr. Provost -- how much money do you have tied up in the Park Tower project? PROVOST Vicki...I'm going to forget you made that remark. For the sake of your job, I suggest you do the same. VICKI stalks of -- and PROVOST goes back to his mail. He finds an envelope addressed in a shaky, psychotic scrawl, with the word "CONFIDENTIAL" underlined three times in ink. He tears it open -- -- and HIS FACE TURNS PALE as he stares down at the contents: a small business-sized card, signed with a BAT-EMBLEM... THOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY WALTER BARRETT and his ATTORNEY emerge onto the front steps of the courthouse. BARRETT is instantly mobbed by REPORTERS. REPORTER I Mr. Barrett! Any comment on the arraignment? REPORTER II Is it true bail was set at two million dollars? ATTORNEY Stand back! My client has nothing to say at this time! The ATTORNEY clears a path for BARRETT, who climbs into a waiting CAR, shielding his face. REPORTERS cluster around it... As the car pulls out into traffic, we see a flock of PIGEONS taking wing from their perches on the statues outside the Hall of Justice. OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR PIGEONS fill the frame, swooping down toward the CAR, which is idling at a traffic light far below. INT. BARRETT'S CAR - THAT MOMENT The liveried DRIVER drums his fingers as he waits for the light to change. BARRETT's in the back, speaking into his cellular phone. BARRETT It's time we called an emergency meeting of the Raven Society. Get back to me... Looking troubled, he hangs up. A fat white glob of PIGEON SHIT splatters across the windshield. Seconds later -- another SPLAT. BARRETT (cont.) Damn pigeons. DRIVER Just washed it, too. The DRIVER reaches for the wiper switch. They hear a tiny DINK as a SOLID PELLET bounces off the windshield. BARRETT and the DRIVER exchange a mystified look. A small, blinking CAPSULE has just lodged in the wiper-blade assembly... OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR Just as the light changes, the CAR EXPLODES into a million fragments -- leaving a BLACKENED CRATER in the middle of the intersection. CUT TO: INT. BATCAVE - DAY TIGHT ON A VIDEO MONITOR -- showing FIRE TRUCKS in the intersection we've just left, hosing down the wreckage of BARRETT's car. BRUCE is watching intently when ALFRED appears behind him. ALFRED The Fluegelheim called again, sir. They want to know if you'll be attending the opening of the new Egyptian exhibit. BRUCE, still engrossed in his news broadcast, waves ALFRED off. BRUCE Cancel. ANCHORWOMAN (on TV) -- and, citing new evidence in the so- called string of "millionaire murders," Police Commissioner J.T. Gordon today swore out a warrant for the arrest of Batman. (beat) We go now live to Mike Sekowsky, spokesperson, Order of the Bat. SEKOWSKY Jeez! Talk about gratitude -- !! At the sight of SEKOWSKY's face, BRUCE kills the sound in disgust. ALFRED looks on helplessly as he paces the floor of the Batcave. BRUCE Well, Alfred, it's official. I'm a wanted man. (beat) "New evidence"...I've gotta find that woman. Did you check the personals? As ALFRED shakes his head no, a BUZZER sounds. They've got a visitor. BRUCE hits a switch on a monitor, and sees COMMISSIONER GORDON'S CAR sitting outside the wrought-iron gates of Wayne Manor. He throws a nervous look at ALFRED. ALFRED speaks into a microphone: ALFRED Who's there? GORDON Jim Gordon, Alfred. I've got to see Bruce. A spooky development. Does GORDON suspect? After a moment's hesitation, BRUCE nods to ALFRED -- let him in. ALFRED Mr. Wayne will see you, sir. INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER A curious BRUCE ushers GORDON into the library, gestures toward the liquor cabinet. The Commissioner nods his head no. He's fidgety, ill at ease -- he obviously doesn't want to be here. GORDON Sorry to bother you. Bruce -- I'll get right down to it. You knew Shaw and Barrett -- BRUCE I saw them occasionally. We all sat on the board of the Fluegelheim... GORDON Did you have any...dealings with them, or -- BRUCE No. I never liked the way they did business. GORDON The thing is, Bruce, you're all lumped together in the public mind -- the Five Families of Gotham, that sort of thing -- and, uh... (taking a card from his pocket) Harrison Provost got this in the mail. BRUCE examines the card, -- "THOSE WHO FEED," etc. He stares at GORDON in mock-concern, playing it close to the vest... BRUCE Then Batman is behind all this. GORDON Batman or a damned good imitation. BRUCE Well. He's changed tactics, hasn't he. GORDON (shrugging; at a loss) Shaw, with his high-rises -- Barrett, a druglord, major polluter -- they weren't exactly model citizens. Who knows, it could be some crazy social-conscience kind of thing. BRUCE You mean he's going after...the root of the problem. GORDON shakes his head and gets up to go. BRUCE hands him the card. GORDON Let me know if you get one of these. We'll put all our resources at your disposal. BRUCE nods thoughtfully as ALFRED appears to see the Commissioner out. A moment later, the butler reappears. BRUCE Changed my mind, Alfred. I'll be dropping in on the Fluegelheim after all. CUT TO: INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT It's a party to celebrate the opening of the new Egyptian exhibit, and the Fluegelheim is hopping. BOARD MEMBERS, MUSEUM PATRONS, and SOCIALITES mill about in dinner jackets and evening gowns, making small talk. AN OPEN SARCOPHAGUS has been set up as a wet bar. On a raised concrete platform in the center of the hall, rimmed by a decorative moat, sits an ancient Egyptian SHRINE. The TEMPLE OF BASTET has been moved to Gotham and reconstructed in the Fluegelheim --sandstone walls, fountains, statuary and all. Guarding the entrance is a stately bronze statue of the goddess BASTET -- who has the body of a woman and the head of a pointy-eared CAT. She holds an aegis and a sistrum; four tiny KITTENS romp at her feet. BRUCE, who's just arrived, is taking an intense interest in the cat-goddess... VICKI What is it? BRUCE I just had a weird sense of deja vu. He glances over by the sarcophagus and sees PROVOST, the publisher, huddle with ELIOT TIPTREE III, transit magnate -- the remaining member of Gotham's "Five Families." The two of them are engaged in some urgent conversation which he can't quite make out... TIPTREE Harrison -- we really ought to warn Bruce. We owe him that much. BRUCE detaches himself from VICKI and strolls toward them. PROVOST and TIPTREE force smiles and wave, affecting an air of nonchalance. PROVOST (cont.) The man's a space cadet. Let him look out for himself. (as BRUCE arrives; cheerfully) Why, Bruce! What a delightful surprise. BRUCE Good to see you two. Looks like the Five Families are suddenly down to three. (looking around) In fact, if somebody dropped a bomb on this room right now -- TIPTREE chuckles nervously. PROVOST is even less amused. PROVOST Is that your idea of a joke, Bruce? BRUCE Not at all. Commissioner Gordon seems to think we should all be hiring bodyguards. TIPTREE PROVOST Oh, that's absurd. I already have. The two of them glower at each other. It's like an outtake from The Newlywed Game. BRUCE shrugs it off and makes a vacuous face: BRUCE Thing is, I can't imagine why Batman would be after us. Can you? PROVOST and TIPTREE are about to go into another round of hemming-and-hawing when a NEW FACE joins the party. It's SELINA KYLE -- stunning as ever in an extravagantly revealing dress slit up to the armpits. She's holding two glasses of CHAMPAGNE... SELINA You two look like you need a drink. -- And is this who I think it is? She flashes BRUCE her most winning, seductive, heavy-artillery SMILE. He BLINKS, temporarily speechless. PROVOST Selina Kyle -- Bruce Wayne. SELINA Our absentee board member! I've been wanting to meet you forever. TIPTREE Selina's the new Curator of Antiquities. She brought the Temple over block by block -- SELINA You two won't be terribly upset if I borrow Bruce for a moment, will you? Before he can protest, she's linked an arm around his and dragged him off. A nearby FAT MAN spots SELINA, wiggles his eyebrows and WAVES BRIGHTLY. His tongue is practically hanging out -- he's just dying to write her a check. SELINA SIGHS WEARILY to BRUCE: SELINA (cont.) Major contributor. -- I always seem to wind up in charge of fund-raising... BRUCE I can't imagine why. SELINA Tax year's almost over, you know. I hope we can count on your usual generous donation. (indicating PROVOST and TIPTREE) Someone's got to set an example for those two tightwads. BRUCE They're proccupied. This string of murders -- SELINA I asked them if they'd consider including us in their wills. (chuckling to herself) They didn't seem a bit amused... ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT She's making small talk with a bunch of STUFFED SHIRTS and their overdressed WIVES. She glances across the room at the statue of Bastet, sees SELINA draped all over BRUCE. A frown crosses her face... ANGLE ON BRUCE AND SELINA - THAT MOMENT She's still clinging to his arm as they stare up at the statue. SELINA -- and this is my good friend Bastet, the Egyptian Cat Goddess. BRUCE I think we've already met. -- This is quite an expedition you've put together. SELINA I'm glad you think so. I have to say, Bruce -- you're not at all what I expected. BRUCE Sorry to disappoint you. SELINA Oh, it's not that. Not at all. It's just that I'd always heard you were... BRUCE What? SELINA (coyly) Oh...sort of a... BRUCE (smiling; fascinated) No. Come on. What? BRUCE's state of mounting infatuation is abruptly shattered when VICKI sidles up alongside him and -- territorially -- takes his other arm. The women exchange big, toothy, plastic smiles; stranded in the middle, BRUCE realizes they're waiting for him to introduce them. BRUCE Oh. Selina Kyle -- my friend Vicki Vale. SELINA The photographer. I've seen your pictures in the Gazette. VICKI The Globe. SELINA Oh, that's right. The tabloid one. -- What an original dress! VICKI, still smiling, cocks an eyebrow at BRUCE. He senses trouble coming and tries to head it off at the pass. BRUCE Selina supervised the reconstruction of the temple. Brought it back from Egypt... stone by stone. VICKI Really. She must be awfully tired. (to SELINA) How'd you get to be in charge of a huge project like this? SELINA It was easy. I slept with the Pharoah. She laughs at her own joke. VICKI responds with a dry little chuckle of her own. SELINA gives BRUCE a SHARP YANK on the sleeve. SELINA (cont.) Excuse us, won't you, sweetheart? We have some boring museum business to talk about. VICKI fumes. BRUCE shrugs apologetically as SELINA drags him off out of earshot. SELINA (cont.) I. Short leash. BRUCE Pull in the claws, okay? She's really terrific. SELINA I'm sorry, Bruce. Sometimes I get a little...aggressive, you know? (handing him a card) Look, I need to talk to you. Come by sometime. I'll give you the private tour. BRUCE Wait. Let me explain about Vicki -- SELINA (shushing him) I understand. Anyone who's that protective must have a pretty good reason for it. She shoots him one last smile -- sly, conspiratorial, unmistakably juicy. Then she's off in pursuit of another major funder. BRUCE is thoughtfully turning the card over in his hands when VICKI rejoins him. VICKI How's "business"? BRUCE Relax, okay? I like you better. He scans the room, trying to find PROVOST and TIPTREE. No luck. VICKI If you're looking for your fellow millionaires, they left some time back. CUT TO: INT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT The roof of the Gotham Globe. A STARLING circles overhead for a moment -- then DIVES down an exposed VENTILATION SHAFT. INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT TWO ARMED BODYGUARDS are standing watch outside an office. Brass letters on the door read "J. HARRISON PROVOST, PUBLISHER." INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT PROVOST, agitated, working late. He speaks, sotto voce, into the phone: PROVOST Don't worry about that. I've had the office swept for bugs. No one's listening... INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TIPTREE in his paneled study at home. There's an open bottle on the table and he's been hitting the sauce -- hard. His VOICE QUAVERS: TIPTREE It's just so -- unfair. I mean...it was over a century ago. It's not like we're responsible. (hollow-eyed) How could he know? How could Batman know about the Raven Society?? INT. OFFICE - ON PROVOST - THAT MOMENT PROVOST Who knows and who cares. The point is, it's happened... He hears a CHIRP and looks up. It seems to be coming from a HEATING VENT on the wall. But then it stops, so he resumes his conversation -- PROVOST (cont.) I'm clearing out of the country, and I'm taking the raven with me. I suggest you do the same. INT. HEATING VENT - THAT MOMENT In the metal shaft on the other side of the grate is a tiny BIRD -- the same one we saw flying down the air shaft. Now that we've got a close-up view, we can see the thin BATTERY PACK wired to its underbelly...and the MINIATURE MICROPHONE taped to its leg. PROVOST (O.S.) I'll tell you how to reach me. And don't repeat this to anyone. CUT TO: INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - DAY The PENGUIN stands over his indoor penguin pool. He's wearing rubber gloves, feeding LIVE FISH from an ice chest to his arctic birds. The vents in the windows are open, and the climate in the room is downright icy as SELINA's wrapped in fur, stroking her pet cat: SELINA He's just another rich idiot. (chuckling to herself) The odd thing is, he didn't seem a bit concerned. PENGUIN Then he is an idiot. SELINA He lives in some big sprawling manor. I'll have to get inside, scope it out... see where he's got the raven stashed. PENGUIN How do you plan to do that? SELINA How do you think! A feline smile from SELINA. The PENGUIN chuckles to himself, lobs a FISH out over the pool. A swooping GULL snatches it out of the air before it hits the water. FRICK arrives in the doorway. FRICK It's Mr. Provost, sir. He's planning to embark on an unscheduled Christmas vacation. PENGUIN Good! That should save us a trip to the bank. CUT TO: INT. FLUEGELHEIM - BACK ROOM - DAY A huge open room cluttered with all kinds of junk: archaeologist's tools, restoration equipment, etc., plus a healthy assortment of curios and oddities from all over. This is SELINA's private domain. CAMERA TRACKS past a glass case full of ugly, withered, turdlike specimens... BRUCE What have we got here? SELINA Mummified cats. Bastet's sacred animal. They were buried by the thousands at Bubastis. -- Oh, careful! BRUCE FREEZES with his hand poised over a set of four earthen JARS. Each has a lid carved in the shape of a HEAD: ape, jackal, man, falcon. SELINA (cont.) Canopic jars. In the process of mummification, the internal organs were buried separately. (pointing to each jar in turn) Lungs -- stomach -- liver -- intestine -- BRUCE withdraws his hand with a bemused shudder. BRUCE You're in a gruesome line of work. SELINA Keeps me interested. And that's not easy to do... BRUCE's attention turns to a crumbling statuette of an odd beast: a WINGED LION with the head of a FALCON. BRUCE This one I know. It's a gryphon, right? SELINA Very good. A mythical demon, half-bird, half-lion...sweeping down from the sky to deliver retribution and justice. BRUCE nods. He can dig it. He regards the gryphon for a long moment and CHUCKLES. BRUCE Poor guy. Birds and cats -- you wouldn't think the two halves would cooperate. SELINA Only under certain circumstances. (beat) I'm really glad you came, Bruce. I was afraid I'd given you the wrong impression. Or maybe it was the right impression. BRUCE What was it you wanted to talk to me about? SELINA Your collection. I'd love to see it. I mean, everyone says you've got a fabulous -- She breaks off in midstream and chuckles to herself. She toys demurely with her equipment. She looks up at BRUCE and switches tactics -- going for the direct approach. BRUCE braces himself... SELINA (cont.) Mainly I just wanted an excuse to see you again. Does she know you're here -- Vicki? BRUCE (shrugging) No. SELINA It must be strange. Having all that power, and money -- never really knowing if that's what people are attracted to. BRUCE What are you attracted to? SELINA I think you're a little bit nuts. (beat) I think you're a little -- bored with your life. Having everything you want. No variety, no...danger. And every once in a while you need to take a risk. Shake it all up. BRUCE How? SELINA Maybe by...coming here today. She leans back against a crate, moistens her lips. She's letting him have it with both barrels. SELINA (cont.) That's one thing I can give you, Bruce -- danger -- a little something you can't get at home. BRUCE hesitates -- but the lure is irresistible. He moves forward slowly; SELINA's eyes close; their lips draw slowly closer... ...and he SNEEZES IN HER FACE. She backs off in shock as he covers his face. His eyes are watering and he's WHEEZING. She rushes over -- SELINA Are you okay? BRUCE Is there a cat in here? Right on cue, SELINA's black cat HECATE lets out a loud MEOW -- and STRETCHES against BRUCE's pants leg. He brushes the animal aside and it LEAPS into SELINA's arms. BRUCE sniffles uncontrollably. BRUCE (cont.) Get it away! She drops the cat, which scampers off. BRUCE rubs his eyes. SELINA Poor thing. You're allergic! BRUCE Yeah, cats...ever since I was a kid... (snorting and weeping) Look, I'd better get some fresh air. Maybe another time, okay... He heads for the door before SELINA can stop him. He's gone, but she knows she's left a dent in his armor. She smiles in bemusement as HECATE jumps into her arms and PURRS. EXT. FLUEGELHEIM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY BRUCE stumbles out the museum feeling mildly discombobulated. He marches down the front steps past a NEWSSTAND -- where he stops to buy a copy of the afternoon GLOBE. He opens it to the PERSONAL ADS and finds what he's been waiting for: TALL, DARK, AND HANDSOME -- Christmas is coming. Why don't we trim the tree together? This puzzles him for a moment -- until he looks up the street. In the distance, at the very center of Gotham Square, WORKMEN are stringing lights around an enormous CHRISTMAS TREE, almost fifty feet tall. The LIGHTING CEREMONY is an annual event in Gotham. BRUCE smiles slightly, tucks the paper under one arm and walks to his car. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT SNOW falls on a huge CROWD gathered around the big tree. The tree won't be lit for another twenty minutes or so, and so the ONLOOKERS are singing CHRISTMAS CAROLS from printed lyric sheets. A BAND is playing on a makeshift ORCHESTRA PLATFORM erected in front of the tree, leading the crowd in a spirited rendition of "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen." The Square is rocking with good will toward men. When they get to the part about saving us all from Satan's power -- EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT -- the CAMERA TILTS UPWARD to BATMAN, watching the action from his usual gargoyle's perch. He's scanning the streets and the rooftops, waiting tor the CATWOMAN to make her move -- whatever it is. He glances at the building directly across the square from him. On the roof is a neon sign reading Gotham City Globe in ornate old-English letters -- and above that, a ROTATING METAL SCULPTURE of the world turning. His eyes rove downward along the facade of the building... EXT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT At street level, an ARMORED CAR has pulled up in front of the Globe offices. THREE SECURITY GUARDS with rifles climb out of the ARMORED CAR, followed by a FOURTH -- who has an OBLONG BOX handcuffed to his wrist. Of course, we can't see what's inside, but to those of us in the know the box looks just about the right size for a RAVEN STATUETTE. The GUARDS scan the street and enter the building without incident. As they do, a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN crosses the frame; mounted on its side is an ADVERTISING PLACARD which reads: BATMAN: HERO OR MENACE? Read All About It in the GOTHAM GLOBE! EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN He watches with some curiosity. An armored car: is this some part of the CATWOMAN's scheme? But no...the GUARDS are safely inside the building, and the CAR is leaving. He settles back to wait. INT. NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN - THAT MOMENT The innocuous-looking VAN rounds the corner of the Globe building. FRICK is at the wheel, FRACK is riding shotgun, and the PENGUIN is between them, peering out eagerly through the windshield. They turn into the Globe's BASEMENT GARAGE -- where dozens of similar vans are parked at the LOADING BAYS. Just part of the fleet... INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER The quartet of SECURITY GUARDS arrive at PROVOST's office. The publisher has already packed his suitcases for a speedy getaway. The LEAD GUARD -- the one cuffed to the RAVEN BOX -- sets his precious cargo on a desk and stands discreetly at arm's length while PROVOST unlocks it and checks its contents. Satisfied, he slams it shut. He reaches into his top drawer for an ENVELOPE, which he hands to his PERSONAL SECRETARY. PROVOST Open this in an hour. Phone my wife and tell her where to meet me. (to the GUARDS; edgily) No trouble on the way, I take it? LEAD GUARD No sir, Mr. Provost. We came straight from the bank vault. GUARD II 'Copter should be just touching down. We'll have you safely out of here in no time. EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN "Here Comes Santa Claus" echoes up from the streets. BATMAN watches as a COPTER descends toward the HELIPAD on the roof of the Globe... INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER PROVOST and the LEAD GUARD with the raven box are at an elevator bank. The other GUARDS head for a stairwell. GUARD II We'll check the stairs. See you on the roof. The LEAD GUARD starts to press the UP button, but PROVOST pulls a key from his pocket instead: PROVOST No -- my private elevator. It's safer. INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT shooting DOWN on the car as it rises. The shaft above it is filled with BIRDS -- starlings, crows, pigeons and the like, swooping and gliding among the gears and cables... EXT. ROOF OF GLOBE BUILDING - THAT MOMENT In BG, the helicopter on its pad, idling noisily, the rotors still spinning. In FG, the small dormer-like structure that houses the STAIRWAY. The metal access door opens, and the first of the GUARDS steps warily out, rifle at the ready. He smiles back at his pal. GUARD No way. They don't pay us enough to tangle with Batm-- A black-gloved, CHROME-TALONED HAND snakes around the edge of the dormer and RAKES ACROSS HIS THROAT... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT SWEAT beads up on PROVOST's lip as the GUARD hits the up button and the car begins to rise. Suddenly, the LIGHTS GO OUT. The car stops with a lurch. PROVOST What is it?? What's happening?? Suddenly, there in the darkness, they hear a series of loud POPPING SOUNDS...which could be gunfire... EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - ON CROWD singing "Here Comes Santa Claus" at the top of their lungs. Happy faces beam. No one hears anything unusual over the music... EXT. ROOFTOP - ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN BATMAN straining to listen. We get another faint series of POPS -- barely audible over the CAROLING from below, and the loud PUTT-PUTT-PUTT of the helicopter blades. He can't really be sure he's heard anything at all. He scans the roof of the Globe building, but he can't see what's happening beyond the big steel globe sculpture and the neon sign... EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN lets fly with another burst of automatic fire from the dead GUARD's rifle. The helicopter is still idling, but no one's left to fly it -- the rooftop is littered with stiffs... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT PITCH BLACK. Pre-verbal GROANS and MURMURINGS OF FEAR issue from the darkness. An EERIE RED LIGHT kicks on -- the emergency generators -- and we see PROVOST backed up in a corner of the car, twitching and jumping like a crazed spastic. The GUARD, in a futile effort to placate him, points up at the LIGHT: GUARD There. Mr. Provost. See? The generator's kicked in. It's just an electrical problem. PROVOST is only marginally consoled. They hear a strange TWITTERING NOISE in the shaft above them... PROVOST starts babbling again. The GUARD slaps him across the face. But the TWITTERING has him a bit concerned as well. He stares up at the ceiling of the car as he PUNCHES BUTTONS on the panel; with another LURCH, the car begins to move. GUARD There. See? It's moving. We're fine. PROVOST It's going down. We're going DOWN!!! INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT The BIRDS in the shaft have all ROOSTED on the TOP OF THE CAR. They're patiently riding it down as it descends... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT The car stops again. PROVOST is totally losing it. The exasperated GUARD grabs him and SHAKES HIM. GUARD Okay, Mr. Provost -- I'm gonna have a look through the trap door. But I need you to help me. Okay? You have to help. PROVOST nods and tries to get a grip on himself. The GUARD looks up at the trap door in the ceiling of the car. He can't reach it... He uncuffs the BOX containing PROVOST'S RAVEN from his wrist -- and STANDS on it. Still short. Unholstering his gun and using it as a prod, he can almost reach the trap door. He JUMPS UP and, poking with the gun, manages to dislodge the panel slightly. More TWITTERING. PROVOST and the guard look up through the tiny crack in the ceiling and see nothing but darkness. GUARD Probably just some bird that's gotten in the shaft. Now calm down. You'll have to give me a boost. The GUARD climbs back atop the raven box. PROVOST gives him a boost and he manages to catch hold of the lip of the trap door. GUARD (cont.) Okay, help me out...steady... PROVOST wraps both arms around the GUARD's wriggling LEGS and tries to hoist him upward. INT. SHAFT - ON ROOF OF CAR - THAT MOMENT From a vantage level with the roof of the car, we see the GUARD'S FINGERS, clinging to the lip of the trap door. Now his HEAD rises into view, pushing the panel aside as he pulls himself upward. He peers around. His BROW wrinkles as he sees a bizarre sight -- PASSELS of SQUAWKING BIRDS, walking back and forth in front of him, STRUTTING and PREENING mere inches from his face... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT The bottom half of the GUARD dangles from the ceiling. PROVOST still has his arms wrapped around the GUARD's knees. All at once, the GUARD begins to SCREAM -- his body JERKS and his legs KICK WILDLY. Still PROVOST struggles to hang on -- even as BLOOD spatters across the top of his bald dome... Finally, the GUARD's violent spasms are too much. PROVOST trips over the raven box, stumbles backward and lands on his ass in a corner of the car. The GUARD tumbles in a heap to the elevator floor, his face PECKED and CLAWED beyond recognition, his eyes gone altogether. PROVOST lets out a series of SHRIEKS. He peers at the open trap door, sees the BIRDS staring curiously down at him, and SHRIEKS AGAIN. The EMERGENCY TELEPHONE rings. He stares at it. It rings again. Shielding his eyes and screwing up his courage, PROVOST crawls across the floor and reaches for the receiver. PENGUIN (V.O.; filter) Sixteenth floor. Linens, housewares, ladies' lingerie! PROVOST W-who is this?? INT. GLOBE - BASEMENT LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VANS are parked in neat rows -- all driverless. FRICK is sitting with a boxful of electrical equipment next to a bank of ELEVATORS; all the cars have been LOCKED OPEN here in the basement, except for ONE -- PROVOST's private elevator, the doors to which are still closed. The PENGUIN stands beside it, speaking into a RED PHONE. PENGUIN Mr. Provost? If you want to get out of that car alive, I suggest you follow my instructions to the letter. As he talks, we see various NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES sprawled on the concrete nearby, DEAD. A CORRUGATED METAL DOOR has been lowered over the LOADING BAY, separating the newspaper production staff from the VAN POOL. They're trapped on the other side. BANGING AWAY LOUDLY on the door... PENGUIN (cont.) SHUT UP IN THERE. (calmly; into phone) You should see a cord hanging just behind you. INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT PROVOST looks over his shoulder and sees the aforementioned CORD descending through the trap door. PROVOST Yes -- yes, I see it -- PENGUIN (V.O; filter) Tie the cord to the handle of your box. PROVOST lets the phone drop. He grits his teeth, but hastens to obey. As he's knotting the cord around the handle of the box, a DINKY BIRD flutters down through the trap and sends him into a panic. Practically weeping, he reaches for the phone. PENGUIN (V.O.; filter) When you're done, I want you to give two sharp yanks on the cord. Cowering in terror, PROVOST reaches for the cord and yanks it twice. PROVOST Who are you?? Why are you doing this?? INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN Behind him, FRICK and FRACK are pulling on RED BERETS and BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS -- Order of the Bat gear. FRICK climbs into a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN and starts the engine. PENGUIN Well, Mr. Provost, I guess you could call me an irate reader. And to be perfectly frank -- I'm doing this because I hate Garfield. Chuckling, the PENGUIN holds a SONIC DEVICE up to the mouthpiece of the phone. INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT A SHRILL WHINE emanates from the receiver. All at once, the elevator car is FULL OF BIRDS -- squawking wildly, flinging themselves against the wall, going insane in the tiny confined space. PROVOST is screaming like a madman. The birds are in his hair, his face -- everywhere. He fights his way over to the panel and begins punching buttons in a frenzy... All at once the car PLUNGES DOWNWARD. It's as if the floor has DROPS AWAY beneath PROVOST's feet -- he's in FREE-FALL. INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN PENGUIN Going down! He hangs up the phone and steps a discreet distance back from the ELEVATOR DOORS. INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT The RAVEN BOX dangles from its cord in FG as the CAR rockets uncontrollably downward. A steady stream ot BIRDS are making a quick exit from the trap door in the roof... INT. TOP-FLOOR LANDING - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN's on a landing near the stairwell, just below the dormer that leads to the roof. She pries open a pair of ELEVATOR DOORS... ...and a FLOCK of BIRDS pours out of the empty shaft, making for the open ACCESS DOOR a half-story above. She reaches inside, finds the cord attached to the RAVEN BOX, and reels it in. She rips off the lock and opens the box for a quick look at her trophy. It's there, all right -- another RAVEN just like the first two. An awful CRASH, from twenty-five stories down, RATTLES THE SHAFT... She makes a disgusted face, grabs the RAVEN, and bolts for the roof. EXT. ROOFTOP ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN He watches in puzzlement as a VAST FLOCK OF BIRDS takes flight from the Globe roof across the square. Something weird is definitely going on. He's about to abandon his post -- -- but down below, the CAROLERS have stopped CAROLING. The big tree's about to be lit, and they're counting off the seconds: CROWD Ten! Nine!... EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - CORNER NEWSTAND A ramshackle kiosk at street level. The NEWS VENDOR has stepped out onto the sidewalk to watch the tree festivities. A GLOBE DELIVERY VAN, its side bearing the "BATMAN -- HERO OR MENACE?" advertisement, cruises past and dumps a bundle of papers on the curb. EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE EXCITEMENT is BUILDING as the seconds tick off: CROWD ...Three! Two! One! The CHRISTMAS LIGHTS come on, and the CROWD breaks into CHEERS. The ORCHESTRA strikes up a sprightly version of "JINGLE BELLS." EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON NEWSTAND The NEWS VENDOR is applauding and singing along like everyone else when a second newspaper van rumbles past... NEWS VENDOR Hey! No! I aleady got a -- He spots TWO MASKED MEN in the doorway of the van -- wearing RED BERETS and BAT-SHIRTS. They shove a BODY out the door -- The mutilated corpse of HARRISON PROVOST lands on the sidewalk with a THUD -- right beside a bundle of NEWSPAPERS which read "BATMAN MURDER SPREE BAFFLES POLICE." EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON VAN - MOVING The NEWS VENDOR chases after the VAN, but it's already rounded a corner and is cruising along the periphery of Gotham Square. The CROWD is still singing merrily, unaware of its presence -- -- until the BACK DOORS fly open -- and a swarm of RABID, CHITTERING BATS screech out into the midst of the crowd!! EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE The CAROLERS break into MASS HYSTERIA as HIDEOUS BATS swoop down from above, CLAWING at their heads and shoulders. ORCHESTRA MEMBERS drop their instruments and stagger off the BAND PLATFORM, falling into the branches of the giant Christmas tree. EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON SIDEWALKS CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS are teeming in and out of nearby STORES. They drop their SHOPPING BAGS and race about in utter CHAOS as the bats attack. WOMEN SCREAM. CHILDREN SCREAM. MEN SCREAM TOO. A MAN staggers backward through a GLASS STOREFRONT and lands on his butt in a WINDOW DISPLAY -- a big mechanical SANTA CLAUS on his North-Pole throne, chuckling merrily in a prerecorded voice: "HO HO HO." The MAN STRUGGLES WILDLY as the BATS converge on him. INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - THAT MOMENT HORRIFIED SHOPPERS scatter through the aisles as the BATS pour in through the broken window. WOMEN lined up for a FREE MAKEOVER squeal in panic as BATS arrive to rearrange their hairdos. EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN He stares down stunned at the PANDEMONIUM raging below. He glances across the street...and sees the TINY SILHOUETTE of a WOMAN standing atop the cast-iron GLOBE SCULPTURE, LAUGHING at the chaos, TAUNTING him. EXT. STREETS - OVERHEAD ANGLE - THAT MOMENT A few blocks away from Gotham Square. SIRENS HOWL. There's a steady stream of COP CARS speeding toward the site of the disturbance. One vehicle is moving in the opposite direction, against traffic -- a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN. EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - A MOMENT LATER BATMAN touches down on the roof and stares in horror at the CORPSES strewn across the helipad. A dying GUARD raises a shaky hand... BATMAN crouches beside him. A GURGLE comes up from his throat and a bubble of BLOOD swells on his lips. All at once he hears a WOMAN'S VOICE from the shadows of the GLOBE SCULPTURE... CATWOMAN (O.S.) Some people just can't take discipline. (beat) Go ahead. Finish 'em off... His head jerks up. He can't see anything. A sudden WHOOSHING noise, and now the voice is coming from the other side of the roof. CATWOMAN (O.S.) You might as well. You're going to get blamed for it anyway. He stands. He gets a quick glimpse of a FELINE SHADOW springing past a skylight; she's jumping all around the roof, clinging to exposed pipes and fixtures. He reaches for a Batarang. CATWOMAN (O.S.) Oh, come on, angel. You know you want to. (purring loudly) Besides -- I want to see how you do it! BATMAN Who are you? He's barely gotten it out when she SLAMS INTO HIM from behind, feet first, knocking him to the rooftop. He tries to get up, but she comes at him with a couple of CARTWHEELING KICKS, knocking him back into a cornice. He ducks right just as a SHARP SPIKED HEEL strikes the exposed brick a mere three inches from his throat. He catches her leg, upends her -- but she somersaults away and lands on her feet. Cats always do... CATWOMAN My, aren't we frisky tonight. He flings the BATARANG. It CLANGS into the big NEON SIGN as she SPRINGS up into the darkness, out of reach. GLASS TUBING shatters and SPARKS FLY as she calls down from the shadows -- CATWOMAN I should tell you -- I've got nine lives to play with -- and you've only got one... He turns -- she drops DIRECTLY ONTO HIM -- and locked in a death grip, they STAGGER BACKWARDS across the roof, directly toward the HELICOPTER. The huge ROTOR BLADES are still turning... BATMAN ducks instinctively and the CATWOMAN breaks free -- FALLING BACKWARD onto the roof. It's a strategic move: when he rushes at her, she BRACES HERSELF against the ground and KICKS UPWARD with startling force. This time the spiked heel connects -- LIFTING BATMAN off his feet, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARD into the TAIL of the HELICOPTER. He slumps there, stunned -- and before he knows it, she's on him. She grabs his THROAT with one hand and clamps the other around his CROTCH. He tries to break her grip, but she's just as strong as he is. And she's LIFTING him -- forcing him upward, toward the REAR STABILIZING ROTOR on the tail of the helicopter! The rear ROTOR BLADES WHINE LIKE A BUZZSAW as his head rises perilously closer. At the last possible instant, he grabs a handful of her HAIR -- YANKS IT as hard as he can -- With a YOWL, she releases him. They tumble to the roof and she DIVES ATOP HIM. Her TALONS click into place -- he sees them poised directly above his EYES -- -- but manages to slam an ELBOW under her chin before she can strike. Now they're disentangled; they get up groggily and circle each other... SOMEONE IS BANGING on the metal door that leads up to the roof, trying to break it down. BATMAN turns for an instant -- a sudden CRACK -- -- and he finds himself all wrapped up in the CATWOMAN's CAT- O'-NINE-TAILS...which is also outfitted with a TASER. She sends a PARALYZING ELECTRIC CHARGE through his body and he collapses to the roof in a jittering heap. The BANGING on the door is louder... CATWOMAN Did I tell you I invited company? -- Keep 'em busy, angel, I've gotta scat. She kneels down and plants a BIG WET KISS on his twitching face. Then she scurries to the edge of the roof, DISAPPEARING -- -- just as the DOOR gives way -- and an ARMED SWAT TEAM comes crashing out onto the roof! Just coming around, BATMAN tries to roll out of sight -- but the COPS are swarming the place. They spot the BODIES on the tar and gravel, see BATMAN scuttling for cover, and draw the obvious conclusion. Pulling guns, they OPEN FIRE. BULLETS RICOCHET off the big metal GLOBE. BATMAN, as is customary in these situations, shoots a GRAPPLING HOOK at the roof of the next building over -- which is a couple of stories taller than the Globe -- and REELS HIMSELF UPWARD along the side wall. The SWAT COPS score a couple of dead hits which set him swinging like a pendulum, but his body armor holds and he clings to the line long enough to reach the roof. CUT TO: INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT FRlCK and FRACK, still in their Order-of-the-Bat garb, are in the front seats; the PENGUIN is leaning out the side door. Someone's obviously tipped the COPS about the source of all the ruckus -- -- because a pair of POLICE CARS are on their tail and gaining fast. Still hanging in the doorway, the PENGUIN raises his UMBRELLA, peers down its length like a RIFLE SIGHT, and PULLS A TRIGGER. ANGLE ON SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT A SONIC DART -- one of the PENGUIN'S BIRD MAGNETS -- lodges itself in the GRILLE of the foremost POLICE CAR. INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT The COPS in the car react in astonishment as PIGEONS begin HURLING THEMSELVES at the WINDSHIELDS. A DOZEN KAMIKAZE BIRDS bounce off in rapid succession. CRACKS begin to spread across the glass. The COPS can't see where they're driving. The car SWERVES WILDLY. And still the PIGEONS KEEP COMING -- COVERING THE WINDSHIELD -- TOTALLY OBSCURING THE STREETS FROM VIEW... EXT. STREETS - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT The first car, COMPLETELY COVERED WITH BIRDS, smacks into a LAMPPOST and SKIDS. The second car CRASHES INTO IT. And the pigeons continue to pour down from the heavens, SWARMING onto the immobilized squad cars. INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT The PENGUIN grins with delight as the van speeds off unmolested. PENGUIN Look at that, boys -- they do flock together!! CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT AMBULANCES are pouring into the square as the BAT ATTACK continues. COPS are firing their guns blindly into the skies as they try to evacuate the citizenry. PARAMEDICS drop the stretcher they're carrying when BATS swoop down at their heads... EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT BATMAN is still pursuing the CATWOMAN, who's perched one roof over, in a squat, wiggling a finger for him to follow. The roofs are icy and treacherous, but he matches her step for step, leap for leap, as she vaults from one building to the next, leading him on. Finally she reaches the edge of a building on the corner of the block; there's no place to go but down. She squats on the ledge and smiles, beckoning to him -- CATWOMAN Ooh. Where have you been all my life? He edges closer. Suddenly, she does a BACKFLIP -- DIRECTLY OFF THE EDGE OF THE ROOF. BATMAN hears GLASS SHATTERING. He hesitates a second -- moves closer to the edge of the roof -- PEERS OVER THE ICY CORNICE. BATMAN'S POV - THAT MOMENT Staring down, he sees a narrow LEDGE running around the facade of the building some ten or twelve feet below. The window of a corner apartment has been smashed; the curtains are flapping in the chill wind. EXT. ROOF - ON BATMAN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT She's obviously making her getaway through the apartment. BATMAN climbs up on the slippery cornice and prepares to drop to the ledge below -- cautiously, because it's a long way down. A sudden CRACK -- The CATWOMAN hasn't entered the apartment. Instead, she's followed the ledge around the corner of the building, silently doubling back onto the roof behind BATMAN. He TURNS just as her WHIP wraps itself around his left leg. She gives it a sharp tug -- his feet SKID on the ice -- and HE TOPPLES OVER THE EDGE OF THE ROOF. EXT. FACADE OF BUILDING - ON BATMAN He plunges downward for the briefest of seconds -- then JERKS UP SHORT, SLAMMING INTO THE WALL OF THE BUILDING. The WHIP has coiled itself around his leg, and for now it's holding tight. He's dangling upside down, bat-like; he bounces away from the wall; he SPINS in midair as one loop of the whip UNRAVELS, dropping him another foot or so. He manages to brace his left foot against the wall. It's a massive strain, but he's momentarily safe if he can keep from moving. The alternative is a twelve-story drop, straight down to the pavement... EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT She's wrapped the handle-end of the whip around an exposed pipe on the roof, anchoring BATMAN in place. With a cheshire- cat grin, she removes the RAVEN from her knapsack and holds it on the edge of the cornice. EXT. FACADE - THAT MOMENT BATMAN hanging immobile. Craning his neck, he can just see the RAVEN STATUETTE on the ledge above him -- bouncing slightly, and apparently talking to him... CATWOMAN (O.S.) Nevermore. Nevermore! Now the CATWOMAN appears beside it -- elbows on the cornice, chin propped up on her folded hands, like a chatty girl at a fern bar. CATWOMAN Cute, huh! I think it'll look nice over the fireplace. Maybe you can drop by and see it sometime. (demurely) I hope you won't think I'm too... aggressive or anything, but I find you very attractive. She toys aimlessly with the whipcord, batting at it like a cat with a piece of yarn. BATMAN grimaces. She speaks in a low, soothing, seductive tone -- almost a purr. Behind the bondage mask she bats her eyelashes. CATWOMAN (cont.) It's just so hard to meet interesting men these days. Don't you think so? (sighing) I have trouble with relationships. Men find me intimidating...kind of predatory, you know? Really I'm not. Really I'm just playful... BATMAN huffs and puffs, trying to bend at the waist so he can grab hold of the whip. She frowns and YANKS on it. His foot flies free of the wall, and another loop of the whip uncoils before he can stabilize himself. CATWOMAN (cont.) Don't laugh! I'm trying to open up to you! Angrily, she holds a STEEL CLAW to the whip -- ready to cut him loose. ANGLE ON BATMAN He's palmed the GRAPPLING-HOOK LAUNCHER from his belt. Holding it close to his body, out of view, he works it around into firing position. He'll shoot it right through her if he has to... CATWOMAN (cont.) I always seem to fall for the wrong guys. You know...most men are rats. ANGLE ON CATWOMAN She withdraws her hand from the whip, reverts to her philosphical mode. CATWOMAN Mice, really. It's disgusting -- they beg you to walk all over them and then they whine when you do it. Once you've had your fun there's not much you can do but kill them. (beat) But you seem different. I mean, you obviously understand about dressing up... that saves a lot of explaining. I think people should indulge their fantasies, don't you? BATMAN is sweating profusely. He can't hold his position much longer. And the CATWOMAN is dragging this insane flirtation out endlessly... CATWOMAN So I think I'll let you live. Cute boys like you are hard to find... (standing up) 'Bye, angel. I'll be thinking about you. And just like that, she VANISHES -- moving silently off with her raven, leaving BATMAN to dangle. He hangs there a moment, tries to twist himself around without moving his foot. He braces one hand against the wall; with the other, he lifts his grappling gun and FIRES. The HOOK SNAGS somewhere on the roof. BATMAN yanks the line taut and is laboriously trying to pull himself erect when -- -- the CATWOMAN reappears over the edge of the cornice! CATWOMAN Gee...I'm so fickle. A QUICK SWIPE of her STEEL TALONS, and the whipcord is neatly SEVERED. BATMAN'S FOOT slips out from under him -- but he's still got hold of the GRAPPLING GUN. He DROPS eight or ten feet... EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN watching with amusement as BATMAN's weight causes the hook to DISLODGE. It skitters across the gravel surface of the roof and CATCHES, at the last instant, on the edge of the CORNICE -- -- which promptly CRUMBLES and GIVES WAY. Fascinated, the CATWOMAN leans over the edge of the roof and peers down... ANGLE ON BATMAN - AS HE FALLS He flails wildly, tangled in his cape, as the ground rushes up toward him. He gets a last-ditch inspiration -- finds the GAS CYLINDER on his belt and hits the switch. The rods in his cape begin to INFLATE... Six stories up, his BATWINGS spring erect, slowing his plunge. Five stories up, an UPDRAFT hits him and he suddenly INVERTS. Four stories up, he rights himself. Three stories up, he goes into a downward spiral, out of control, gliding in great wide arcs over the street... ...and a moment later there are no stories left. With an ugly crunch, he smacks into the slush-covered pavement and BOUNCES. Face down, he skids some twenty feet to a halt -- right in the middle of a BUSY INTERSECTION. EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A DELIVERY TRUCK hits the brakes and screeches to a stop, two feet away from BATMAN'S HEAD. He doesn't move. PEDESTRIANS are already gawking and pointing as the DRIVER climbs out and peers down at the inert caped figure lying face-down in the street: DRIVER What the hell is this? CARS are backed up, due to the panic in Gotham Square a few blocks over. HORNS are honking. A TRAFFIC COP marches over -- TRAFFIC COP Awright, what's the problem here? (spotting BATMAN) Jesus. He tries to clear the crowd away. A full-fledged GRIDLOCK is forming around the prostrate BATMAN. The COP blows his whistle, tries to maintain order as two unifonned PATROLMEN rush up to join him. They manage to roll the unconscious BATMAN over on his back. The assembled COPS stare down at the mask, the scuffed body armor. Still waxy, they finger the GUNS in their holsters... PATROLMAN Good God. Cowan -- get to the car -- radio the commissioner!! By now there must be two hundred people in the intersection, all surging forward to get a look. More COPS are arriving to beat them back. TRAFFIC COP Is he dead? What do we do? PATROLMAN The mask. Get the mask off. They hunker down over BATMAN. One of them tugs at his mask -- but the helmet-like cowl doesn't want to give way. He feels around -- TRAFFIC COP Some kinda seam here on the neck... The PATROLMAN nods okay, and the COP tugs at a Velcro-like fastening under BATMAN's chin. The instant it comes open -- -- a BURST of FINE GREEN MIST spews forth from concealed JETS in the gold-and-black BAT-EMBLEM, and the COPS reel backward, shrieking, gasping for breath and clewing at their eyes. Booby-trap -- they've just been Maced. One of the ONLOOKING COPS steps back in horror and confusion. On impulse, he draws his gun and FIRES TWICE at BATMAN. The body JERKS and the bullets RICOCHET OFF -- TRAFFIC COP DON'T SHOOT, you idiot. The crowd -- Before he can finish, a BLACK BOOT kicks the gun out of the ONLOOKING COP's hand. BATMAN is back among the living. SIRENS BLARE as he spins and rolls into a crouch -- lashing out with elbows and knees -- driving the cops back -- Fuck the crowd. TWO MORE COPS pull their guns and open fire in absolute panic. BATMAN slams backward into the delivery truck and crumples to the ground. As he falls, he grabs a couple of SMOKE CAPSULES from his belt and flings them to the pavement. Seconds later, a THICK CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE is spreading through the intersection. BATMAN emerges into the midst of the crowd -- weaving in and out among the stalled vehicles -- EXT. INTERSECTION - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT A MOUNTED COP rides up to the outer fringe of the traffic jam, drawn by all the confusion. He rears the horse back, turns it in a circle; blows his piercing whistle as he tries to reroute the incoming cars... Suddenly a WIRE wraps itself around his chest and arms. He looks down. He sees a BATARANG in the instant before a sudden JERK pulls him cleanly off his mount. BATMAN climbs up on the hood of the nearest car -- vaults over to the next -- and the next -- then hops into the saddle of the MOUNTED COP's waiting HORSE. He digs in his heels, maneuvering through traffic... EXT. POLICE CAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT LT. EDDIE BULLOCK and another plainclothesman are a few blocks off trying to get through the jam. Their siren is on, but the cars blocking their path have no room to pull over. BULLOCK grabs the radio mike: BULLOCK Hell of a mess up here, Commissioner. We'll have to go in on foot... As they wait for a response, they see a HORSE charging past in the opposite direction. On the back of the horse...is BATMAN. Gaping, BULLOCK nudges his partner -- who throws the car immediately into REVERSE. As they watch, BATMAN kicks the horse's flanks and turns right -- toward Gotham Park. INT. GOTHAM PARK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT Two RED BERETS, members of the Order of the Bat, are on night patrol, strolling down a rambling path near the entrance to the park. RED BERET I This is wack, man. Nothing ever happens around here anymore. The other RED BERET lets out a WHOOP OF FEAR and yanks his partner out of the way. They tumble into a snowdrift as BATMAN'S HORSE vaults over the stone wall of the park and gallops past, nearly trampling them in the process. By now, SQUAD CARS are roaring into the park... INT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER SIRENS BLARE and RED LIGHTS FLASH in the distance as the COP CARS spread out along the winding roads that run through the park. BATMAN reins the horse in suddenly as a black-and-white whips past on an access road just ahead of him, no more than twenty yards away. He turns the horse in a circle. MORE RED LIGHTS appear in the distance; another contingent of SQUAD CARS has just entered from the opposite side of the park. It's going to be tough getting out of here... Then: his eyes fall on the statue of his great-grandfather, GENERAL WAYNE -- two Waynes on horseback, not twenty feet apart. He thinks back to his earlier conversation with VICKI and gets an inspiration. He rides past General Wayne to the STONE BRIDGE which spans the little frozen creek. There he finds the DRAINAGE TUNNEL VICKI described, obscured by the wire-mesh grate. This must be where the boy vigilante holes up... He dismounts, ties his CAPE to the pommel of the horse's saddle and sends it off with a slap. He pries the grate loose and crawls inside. INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT A dank, but cozy, hideout; WARM STEAM hisses from a grate in the floor. RUMBLING SOUNDS fill the little chamber as a SUBWAY TRAIN passes directly underneath. A little farther back there's an ACCESS SHAFT, with a Jacob's ladder, leading to the train tracks below. Poking around, he finds a couple of cardboard BOXES -- the boy vigilante's stash. The first contains tins of food, plus various odds and ends. The second's more in line with what he needs -- it's full of OLD CLOTHING. A TRAIN rumbles past underneath. BRUCE removes his COWL and sets about putting together a civilian disguise that'll get him out of the park. A wool hat and a long, moth-eaten topcoat: perfect. As he's pulling them out of the box, he spies something extremely odd -- It's a COSTUME -- a spangled red-and-green GYMNASTS OUTFIT with a little yellow CAPE -- neatly folded and in pristine condition. He removes it carefully from the box and holds it up in front of him. Stitched on the vest is a single initial, "R," in a black circle. He stares at the whole mystifying ensemble in complete befuddlement... The roar of the train subsides, and he hears a SCUFFLING NOISE. Someone's in the tunnel with him. He lowers the costume abruptly -- -- revealing DICK, the boy vigilante, who's crouched in front of him not three feet away. The kid's just crawled up through the ACCESS SHAFT, and he's not at all happy to see an intruder messing with his stuff: DICK It's MINE! He lunges furiously at BRUCE. The two of them tumble back into the grate at the tunnel entrance, KNOCKING IT LOOSE -- EXT. PARK - MOUTH OF TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A POLICE CAR streaks past on the bridge overhead mere seconds before BRUCE and DICK roll out into the snow, still grappling. BRUCE flings the kid into the bridge abutment. DICK lands hard; when he looks up, his EYES WIDEN, and a weird crooked smile comes to his face... Out here in the moonlight he can see his opponent. The body armor -- the gold-and-black emblem on the breastplate -- and above it all, the face of BRUCE WAYNE, exposed to view... As a siren howls nearby, BRUCE flattens himself against the bridge. Like it or not, his fate rests entirely in a strange little boy's hands. The kid sizes up the situation immediately. He nods his head up and down. Then he takes off his own ratty coat and throws it to BRUCE. BRUCE is in no position to look a gift horse in the mouth. He pulls on the coat, gives DICK a nod of acknowledgement, and starts to move off. DICK NO. WAIT! BRUCE turns, uncertainly. DICK throws him his woolen SKI CAP. The KID GIGGLES -- oddly, uncontrollably. Then he sprints off into the woods, dancing, leaping. As he disappears from view, he lets out a shrill, piercing, almost FERAL SHRIEK -- -- which is obviously intended to divert the cops. BRUCE makes haste in the opposite direction. EXT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER BRUCE'S HORSE gallops through the trees, the black bat-cape still attached to its saddle and BILLOWING behind it. INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TWO COPS scanning the park. The CAPED HORSE charges past in front of them and is momentarily silhouetted in the headlights. From a distance, it looks like BATMAN is still in the saddle. The COP at the wheel makes a sudden turn. A moment later, he SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. A MAN has just stepped out onto the road, directly in the squad car's path -- a hunched figure in an old coat and woolen ski cap, obviously one of the homeless. A COP leans on the horn and shouts out the window: COP Dumb son of a bitch!! The MAN -- BRUCE -- steps back out of the squad car's path. The COPS take off -- in hot pursuit of a riderless horse. CUT TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - PRE-DAWN A DOCTOR'S BAG rests on the kitchen table. ALFRED, in robe and slippers, rummages inside it and comes up with an ACE BANDAGE. ALFRED Commissioner Gordon called. He wants to install a full contingent of police guards here at the manor -- in round-the-clock shifts -- to protect you from Batman. BRUCE is sitting erect in a straightbacked chair. His shirt is open and he's holding his arms aloft while ALFRED wraps a full roll of adhesive tape around his battered RIBS. BRUCE Great. What'd you tell him? ALFRED I told him that since you were Batman, you'd require no protection from Batman. BRUCE makes a face: how droll. ALFRED tears off the tape with a brisk YANK -- and BRUCE lets out an involuntary YELP OF PAIN. BRUCE Jesus, Alfred -- !! ALFRED In future, sir...I strongly advise against trying to fly off twenty-story buildings. BRUCE It's just a few bruises. ALFRED One bruise, sir. Which covers your entire body. BRUCE gets up -- stiffly -- and buttons his shirt in gingerly fashion while ALFRED packs his first-aid gear in the doctor's bag. BRUCE I'm getting too old for this line of work. (beat) Cops placed me at the scene of the crime -- that weird kid of Vicki's saw my face -- ALFRED I shouldn't worry overmuch. I doubt the two of you move in the same circles. BRUCE -- and I got the living shit knocked out of me by a woman. ALFRED Sir -- such outmoded sexist attitudes are quite unbecoming. INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY In a lavishly-appointed guest room on Gotham's Upper East Side (or equivalent thereof), we find a pair of PLAINCLOTHES COPS settled in for a stakeout: rumpled topcoats thrown across antique chairs, french-fry bags and GREASY BURGER WRAPPINGS littering the carpet. HIGH-POWERED RIFLES propped against one wall. They peer through venetian blinds at an ELEGANT OLD BROWNSTONE across the street... HIS POV - ROOF OF BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT A UNIFORMED COP, also carrying a walkie-talkie, is keeping watch on the roof of the brownstone. He signals "all clear" to his counterpart watching from the house opposite. INT. UNMARKED CAR - THAT MOMENT TWO MORE PLAINCLOTHESMEN are parked at the end of the block, munching on donuts and watching the same brownstone. They spot a POSTMAN lugging his sack up the tree-lined street on his way to the brownstone. One of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN picks up his RADIO MIKE: PLAINCLOTHESMAN Mailman's coming. EXT. BROWNSTONE - A MINUTE LATER The POSTMAN marches up the front steps of the brownstone, sorting through letters and packages. He hasn't even rung the bell when the door is opened by ANOTHER COP -- who snatches the mail delivery from his hands and SLAMS THE DOOR IN HIS FACE. INT. BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT MORE COPS, at least half a dozen, are milling about inside -- unshaven, ties loosened, shirtsleeves rolled up. They're in for the long haul. The first COP gives a handful of letters to a couple of COLLEAGUES -- then hands over a PARCEL, wrapped in brown paper, to a pair of BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERTS. They carry it gingerly into the kitchen. Into the midst of all this bustling activity strides COMMISSIONER GORDON: GORDON Anything suspicious! In the parlor, where all the shades are drawn, TWO COPS are examining each letter in turn, holding them up to a light bulb, CREASING THEM carefully before slitting them open. COP Nothing yet. Christmas cards and bills. He anxiously watches their progress. A VOICE calls from the kitchen. BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT (V.O.) Commissioner -- ? INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER GORDON enters. The bomb-disposal boys have their equipment scattered all over the kitchen table. They've slit the brown- paper wrapping of the PACKAGE, exposing a ROUND DECORATIVE TIN. BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT It's a fruitcake. He lifts the lid for GORDON to have a look. GORDON ...Have it analyzed. INT. BROWNSTONE - ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT A bleary-eyed ELLIOTT TIPTREE marches down the stairs carrying a pair of OVERSIZED SUITCASES. His WIFE and TWO KIDS are behind him -- all bundled up, preparing to embark on an extended vacation. POLICEMAN Mrs. Tiptree? The car's here. TIPTREE, fighting back tears, embraces his wife for a long wordless moment. Their LITTLE GIRL, aged six, tugs at Mommy's sleeve. LITTLE GIRL I don't wanna go to Grandma's. I wanna stay here with Daddy. MRS. TIPTREE She's got a nice tree just like ours, honey. Daddy'll be up as soon as he can. LITTLE GIRL She's old. She doesn't even have cable. LITTLE BOY What about our presents? He gestures toward the GIFTS piled high around the tree in the parlor. TIPTREE Don't worry. I'll bring 'em up with me. We'll open 'em when I get there. TIPTREE forces a smile for the kids. He CLUTCHES his wife's hand. GORDON Sorry, folks, but we'd better move along. MRS. TIPTREE Kids? Tell your Daddy goodbye... Tearful hugs all around; then a cadre of UNIFORMED COPS escort MRS. TIPTREE and the KIDS to the door. TIPTREE pulls GORDON aside. TIPTREE They'll be safe, won't they? GORDON As safe as we can make 'em. (beat; sternly) It would help if you could give us some small hint what this is all about. TIPTREE I told you. I... TIPTREE shrugs helplessly and stares at his shoes. GORDON is convinced he's holding something back. GORDON You have no idea what was in that box that Provost had delivered from the bank. TIPTREE shakes his head wearily. GORDON glowers as he turns to go. GORDON (cont.) All right, Mr. Tiptree. Merry Christmas. GORDON exits. TIPTREE wanders listlessly into the living room, pulls back the drapes, and WATCHES as his wife and kids ride off in a convoy of POLICE CARS. One of the COPS tries to pull him away from the window, but he refuses to move... ...until a PHONE RINGS. Everyone jumps at once. A TECHNICIAN hits a switch on a loudspeaker-and-tape-recorder assembly, then gestures for TIPTREE to pick up the receiver... TIPTREE Hello...? VOICE ON LOUDSPEAKER Mr. Tiptree? Andy here. Listen -- we've got a chance to grab a good-sized block of Atlantic Teledyne at twenty-six and an eighth -- The COPS heave sighs and turn off their tracing equipment. TIPTREE Not today, Andy. Let's talk after New Year's. TIPTREE hangs up and starts to BAWL right there in the middle of the room. The COPS turn away in sympathetic embarrassment as he goes to a corner wet bar and pours himself a good stiff jolt. INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - DAY Wallowing in despair, TIPTREE sits at an antique secretary composing a LETTER. He takes a long pull on a glass of Scotch, signs his name, and inserts the letter into an envelope. He opens the desk drawer -- takes a long look at a .38 automatic stashed inside -- then finds a stamp and affixes it to the envelope. He addresses it to BRUCE WAYNE. A moment later he hears a noise at the window: TINK TINK TINK. He peers through the blinds and sees a CARRIER PIGEON on the ledge outside -- pecking at the glass, asking to come in. He raises the window and the PIGEON hops fearlessly inside, onto the sill. The bird, well-trained, struggles only slightly as he unties a tiny CAPSULE from its leg and removes a FOLDED NOTE. Scrawled across it is a handwritten message: IF POLICE SEE THIS YOUR FAMILY IS DEAD He opens the note and begins to read as the PIGEON takes wing. CUT TO: INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - DAY BRUCE is at his desk examining the morning editions. A BANNER HEAD-LINE shrieks: BATMAN SOUGHT IN PUBLISHER'S MURDER Bat Attack Panics Gotham Square J. Harrison Provost, 41, Leaves Distinguished Legacy He hears a VISITOR arriving in the entry hall. He gets up... INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT - DAY BRUCE ambles out and sees SELINA, who's just arrived, doing her patetented thing on ALFRED. SELINA English accents are so stimulating. (beat) You have the most beautiful silver hair! ALFRED stammers as she reaches up to STROKE HIS HAIR. He's about to break into a sweat. He's eminently relieved when she turns and sees -- SELINA (cont.) Bruce! BRUCE Selina. What are you doing here? ALFRED affects a look of grandmotherly outrage as SELINA slinks over and takes BRUCE by the arm. She's on him like a barnacle. SELINA I wanted to see your things, remember? And I got tired of waiting for you to call me back. (gesturing toward ALFRED) He's adorable. How long have you had him? INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY BRUCE leads SELINA down a hallway to the armory. He glances back over his shoulder and sees ALFRED peering snoopily around the corner. BRUCE You heard about Harry Provost. SELINA It's incredibly awful. It got me a little worried. (sidling up closer) I hate to think of something happening to you. BRUCE Same here. SELINA It's odd, though. Danger, the thought of suddenly dying -- in a weird way it gets you sort of...aroused. Don't you think? BRUCE cocks an eyebrow at her. Everything gets her sort of aroused. INT. ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER SELINA BEAMS at the fantastic collection of armored gear and exotic weapons. She's like a kid in a toy shop. SELINA Bruce, this is incredible. (indicating a suit of armor) Malaysian -- ? BRUCE Not bad. Sarawak warrior caste. SELINA It's like -- everything in here is another little piece of your mind. I was right about you. (turning to face him) Promise, okay? Promise you'll show me every inch of this place. PAGE 87 MISSING FROM HARD COPY INT. BATCAVE - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER ALFRED is at a PRINTER, scanning page after page of computer printout. He delivers his findings to BRUCE, who's seated at a nearby terminal, scanning data and tapping away at the keyboard. ALFRED The police have no files whatsoever on Selina Kyle. BRUCE (abstractedly) London...Cairo...Belgium... ALFRED What exactly are you -- BRUCE Her credit card records. (looking up) Every major art theft in the last five years -- she's been on the scene or close to it. ALFRED You mean she's some sort of -- collector? A...cat burglar, or -- BRUCE Could be. Museum curator, authenticator -- she's got the perfect cover for it. (beat) What would she want with that stupid raven? ALFRED Raven, sir? BRUCE That's what the Catwoman took from Provost. A little raven statuette, about so big... (shaking his head) But it couldn't have been that valuable. He continues to scan the screen. ALFRED is suddenly lost in thought. ALFRED How very odd. (long pause) I'm sure it's nothing, but -- BRUCE What, Alfred? ALFRED Your father had a raven, sir. A small statue of the very sort you describe. It used to sit on his desk. This piques BRUCE's interest. He swivels around in his chair and stares directly up at ALFRED. BRUCE What happened to it? ALFRED After your father's...demise, Mr. Tiptree came to the house and asked if he could have it. As a keepsake. I saw no harm... (shrugging) That was thirty years ago. BRUCE Wait a minute. Mr. Tiptree? ALFRED George Tiptree. Your friend Elliott's father. CUT TO: INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON TIPTREE has an oversized suitcase open on the bed. It's empty -- except for the BALLED-UP WADS of NEWSPAPER which he's stuffing inside it. His head turns suddenly at the sound of the doorbell... INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE emerges from his bedroom and peers over a bannister into the ENTRYWAY below. Standing there is an unexpected visitor -- BRUCE WAYNE -- holding his arms aloft while a battery of COPS pat him down. BRUCE What are you looking for -- Batarangs? TIPTREE Bruce! Come on up. (to the COPS) I want to talk to Mr. Wayne alone. The COPS look on suspiciously as BRUCE ascends the stairs. INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE lets BRUCE inside and shuts the door behind him. BRUCE hands him a GIFT BOX. BRUCE I brought you a Christmas present. Sorry about the wrapping -- the police made me open it. TIPTREE opens the box and pulls out a diamond-studded TIE CLASP. He looks up at BRUCE with an odd mixture of bewilderment and gratitude. BRUCE nods for him to try it on, and he obliges... TIPTREE ...I'm afraid I don't have anything for you. BRUCE I think you may have something that belonged to my father. TIPTREE -- You know? He stares at BRUCE, astonished. His head sinks into his hands. TIPTREE (cont.) It'll all be over tomorrow. One way or another, it'll all be over. (looking up; despondent) I've decided, Bruce. I'm gonna give him the last two ravens. He's already got the others. BRUCE What are you talking about? Who? TIPTREE Batman. I don't know how he found out, but -- TIPTREE reaches for the bottle on his desk to pour himself a drink, but BRUCE angrily knocks the glass out of his hands. BRUCE It's time you told me what's going on here. TIPTREE Didn't you ever wonder where it came from, Bruce? All the privilege, all the power ...all the money? (beat) The ravens are a...a kind of map, Bruce. The key to an incredibly vast fortune. BRUCE Whose fortune? TIPTREE Gotham City's. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS) The cobblestone streets of 19th-Century Gotham. A massive EXPLOSION blows open one wall of a municipal building, and total CHAOS erupts: fires starting, BYSTANDERS screaming, POLICE rushing to the scene... TIPTREE In 1880 the Gotham City Treasury was looted. It was a fantastic operation -- perfect military precision. The robbers made off with milllons in gold and silver bullion... A HORSE-DRAWN CART weighted down with gold bricks careens around a corner. Atop it are two men in MASKS, firing a GATLING GUN into the crowd. POLICE and ONLOOKERS tumble to the pavement, shot dead, as ANOTHER CART emerges from the wreckage of the treasury and takes off in the opposite direction. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS) CITY OFFICIALS in a boardroom trading papers back and forth, arguing furiously with five calm, distinguished-looking GENTS -- one of whom is the bushy-bearded Civil War hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE. TIPTREE (V.O.) The city was going under. Bankrupt... until five rich men stepped in to bail it out. In exchange they took the land rights, the mineral rights, the service contracts -- BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE BRUCE The Five Families. TIPTREE Our ancestors. They bought Gotham City -- carved it up and ran it into the ground. In five years they were rich beyond imagining. (pause) We've just been following in their footsteps. And in all this time no one's ever suspected -- BRUCE -- that they were the ones behind the robbery? FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS) The FIVE PATRIARCHS in front of a roaring fireplace at Wayne Manor, raising a celebratory toast. CAMERA PANS OVER to a nearby table; on it rest FIVE RAVEN STATUETTES. TIPTREE (O.S.) They had five ravens made. Five ravens which -- combined -- would reveal the location of the treasure they'd stolen. (beat) But they never touched it. They never needed to. It's still there to this day. BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE TIPTREE The ravens, and the secret -- have been passed down through generations. Father to son... (shaking his head) Your father -- died before he could tell you. BRUCE So they stole his piece of the puzzle. TIPTREE Yeah. I've got it, Bruce, and I'm going to hand it over. He's right, you know. We've all been feeding -- feeding on the soul of Gotham... BRUCE stares at him, stony-faced. There's one part of the story that doesn't quite add up. BRUCE (cont.) I don't believe you, Elliott. My father was a decent man -- an honorable man. He would never have taken part in a scheme like this. TIPTREE It wasn't his doing, Bruce. It was -- BRUCE That doesn't matter. If he knew that his fortune was based on a crime -- a crime against the city... (violently) Reputation or not, he would've tried to -- TIPTREE Christ, Bruce! Do you want me to spell it out for you?!? BRUCE backs off. An awful shiver of anticipation runs down his spine. TIPTREE (cont.) He was a decent man. He was an honorable man. That's why they had him killed. CAMERA ZEROES IN ON BRUCE'S HORRIFIED FACE as we get a SERIES OF SHOTS Quick, almost subliminal glimpses of BRUCE's primal trauma: a MUGGER snatching at his mother's necklace. THOMAS WAYNE lunging at him. The young JACK NAPIER firing at THOMAS. PEARLS showering down on the rain-drenched sidewalk. A second bullet felling his MOTHER -- -- and finally, young BRUCE himself, face wracked with PAIN and GRIEF -- BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE -- an expression which perfectly matches the one which the adult BRUCE is wearing as he relives it all thirty years later. Staggered and glassy-eyed, he stares off into space as TIPTREE finishes his tale. TIPTREE They killed him...to protect their secret ...and now the bill's come due. Now the bill's come due. CUT TO: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - TOWARD DUSK The wrought-iron gate outside BRUCE's vast estate -- and beyond it, Wayne Manor itself, rising bold and stately against the setting sun. A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past... INT. WAYNE MANOR - BRUCE'S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT BRUCE lies motionless on his bed. Scattered about him are SCRAPBOOKS, FAMILY PHOTOS and yellowed NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS which describe the murder of his parents. Disoriented, he gazes about aimlessly at his familiar surroundings -- which no longer seem quite so familiar... He folds his arms formally across his chest and stares up at the ceiling, inert, as if the very weight of his heritage is crushing him down. Somewhere, a PHONE RINGS. He makes no move to answer it. INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - DUSK VICKI's at the kitchen table drinking coffee. ALFRED, who's in his apron preparing dinner, picks up the ringing phone. ALFRED Thank you, yes, everything's fine. I'll expect your next call in an hour. (hanging up; to VICKI) The police are becoming an awful nuisance. VICKI I feel so awful for him, Alfred. There must be something we can do. ALFRED I realized long ago -- that there are places in Mr. Wayne's heart which no one will ever penetrate -- or share. (pause) He loves you, Miss Vale. But in certain ways he will always be alone. BRUCE (O.S.) ...Thanks for the testimonial. ALFRED turns and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway, staring at him. He starts to say something, but thinks better of it. He returns to his dinner preparations as BRUCE sits down across from VICKI. She extends a hand and he takes it -- making a visible effort to hold himself together. BRUCE Tiptree's planning some kind of rendezvous with 'Batman.' I think Batman ought to be there when it happens. ALFRED I see, sir. When shall we expect you back? BRUCE Get your cap. You're driving. INT. TIPTREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT It's late, and the house is dark as TIPTREE treeds silently downstairs carrying an OVERSIZED SUITCASE. The lights are on in the kitchen, where the COPS are playing poker and watching TV. INT. PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTS twinkle in the darkness. TIPTREE kneels beside the tree and digs around among the packages. He pulls out an OBLONG GIFT BOX with a tag addressed "TO DADDY -- FROM SANTA." With a glance back at the kitchen, he soundlessly unwraps the package -- and opens it to reveal a matched set of RAVEN STATUETTES. He transfers them to the big suitcase -- then slinks into the hallway... INT. BEDROOM ACROSS STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The two STAKEOUT COPS are chuckling at a Charlie Brown Christmas special on a portable TV. One of them glances out the window and sees a man in a topcoat emerging from the brownstone, SUITCASE in hand... STAKEOUT COP I Shit -- that's Tiptree!! The COP grabs for his WALKIE-TALKIE. EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TIPTREE is halfway down the block when two COPS burst out of the brownstone. COP Mr. Tiptree! What the hell are you -- HEADLIGHTS FLASH ON as the SURVEILLANCE CAR revs its engine. TIPTREE breaks into a RUN -- and the COPS from the brownstone follow suit. At the end of the block he vanishes down a SUBWAY ENTRANCE. INT. SUBWAY STATION - THAT MOMENT A VIOLINIST is panhandling outside the token booth as the COPS come racing down the stairs. The COPS trip over his open violin case, scattering small change across the conrete floor. They flash their badges at the booth and VAULT OVER THE TURNSTILE -- -- just in time to see TIPTREE, with his SUITCASE, scuttling down a stairway which leads to the train platform below. INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE steps onto an EXPRESS TRAIN. The doors slide shut behind him -- and the hapless COPS curse under their breath as he rolls off. COP We've gotta get back to the radio. INT. SUBWAY CAR - A MOMENT LATER - MOVING TIPTREE takes an open seat and looks around apprehensively. Being fabulously rich, be's probably ridden the subway twice in his life -- and at this time of night, EVERY FACE in the sparsely-populated car looks vaguely menacing. Derelicts, prostitutes, teen-gang members -- ALL OF THEM eye this well- heeled stranger with intense curiosity as he clutches his suitcase and stares anxiously at the floor... An ODD, GAUNT FIGURE enters at the end of the car. It's a DEAFMUTE. He shambles down the aisle passing out little white CARDS. One side is a guide to International Sign Language. The other reads: DEAF AND DUMB PLEASE HELP -- $1.00 TWO YOUNG TOUGHS take a card and tear it in half, chuckling, shining the DEAFMUTE on. A HOOKER, the heart-of-gold type, stuffs a buck in his tin cup. He reaches TIPTREE and extends a card; TIPTREE ignores him, refusing to make eye contact -- -- but the DEAFMUTE shoves the card insistently into his face. Now TIPTREE looks up. THIS CARD bears a personalized message: GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION B-TRAIN WEST TO RIVERVIEW TIPTREE's eyes widen. The DEAFMUTE -- who is in fact FRICK -- glowers down and holds out his cup. TIPTREE digs in his pocket; the smallest bill he's got is a twenty, but he hands it over anyway. Smiling at this act of generosity, FRICK moves on to the next car. TIPTREE stares down tremulously at the card. He fidgets with his TIE CLASP -- the one BRUCE gave him earlier... INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT TIGHT on a hand-held ELECTRONIC TRACING DEVICE. A small BLIP moves across a shifting GRID not unlike a radar screen. BRUCE is in the back of the limo, eyeing the tracer intently. ALFRED's up front, at the wheel. BRUCE According to this, he's directly below us. ALFRED The subway, sir? BRUCE Yeah. Take a right. INT. GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION - THAT MOMENT It's slightly more crowded here in the hub of Gotham. TIPTREE emerges onto the platform and spies a squad of TRANSIT COPS thirty or forty feet away -- speaking into WALKIE-TALKIES as they scan the crowd. Sticking close to the tracks, he turns swiftly toward the nearest stairway -- blending in with the crowd, trying to hold the SUITCASE out of view. INT. LOWER PLATFORM - A MINUTE LATER TIPTREE IS RUNNING for the B-train just as the doors begin to close. He manages to thrust the suitcase inside -- but the doors SLIDE SHUT on his hand, and he DROPS IT. He stands there on the platform, his face turning BONE WHITE as the train lurches forward... False alarm. The train stops, and the doors hiss open again. INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE clambers aboard with a severe case of palpitations. As the train pulls out, a couple of rough-looking but helpful STREET TYPES show him to a seat and hand him his precious suitcase. He sits there panting... Moments later, a DEAFMUTE enters the car. TIPTREE does a take: it's the exact same guy who was riding the other line! Of course, he doesn't know about Frick's malignant twin -- FRACK... WIPE TO: INT. LOCAL STOP - TEN MINUTES LATER - NIGHT Having changed trains twice more since we left him, TIPTREE debarks at a deserted local stop. The station is EMPTY except for one other passenger, who's gotten off here as well -- a WOMAN in a long fur coat. TIPTREE WATCHES as she approaches on her way to the stairwell, STILLETO HEELS clicking across the floor. There's something familiar about her -- but she's wearing a big, broad-brimmed hat, and she TILTS IT DOWN as she passes, obscuring her face. It is, of course, SELINA... TIPTREE stands there expectantly with his suitcase, awaiting further instructions. They aren't long in coming. A BLACK MYNAH BIRD swoops out of the tunnel, lands on the platform, and STRUTS in front of him. MYNAH FOLLOW ME. AWWWKK! FOLLOW ME. The bird flutters its wings and takes off again -- INTO THE TUNNEL. TIPTREE stares after it in disbelief. Then the bird CAWS AGAIN -- its shrill voice echoing from the darkness of the tunnel: MYNAH (O.S.) FOLLOW ME. AWWWKK! TIPTREE clambers over the edge of the platform, dropping awkwardly to the tracks below. Suitcase in hand, he begins to walk... INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT ALFRED tearing up the streets as BRUCE consults his tracer. BRUCE He's slowed down. Looks like he's under the park. ALFRED How do you propose to get down there, sir? We can't have Batman strolling up to buy a token. BRUCE I know another way in. (beat) Step on it. They're down there waiting for him. ALFRED turns the limo hard right -- into GOTHAM PARK -- past the statue of GENERAL WAYNE atop his horse... INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT A LOCAL TRAIN roars by, filling the screen. When it passes, we see TIPTREE with his suitcase, walking along the express tracks at the far wall of the tunnel -- more frightened with each step. It's dark and eerie down here in the tunnels; the only illumination comes from dim LANTERNS spaced at fifty-foot intervals. He sees the lights of an EXPRESS TRAIN behind him, and quickly switches to the local tracks. The train rumbles past with a deafening blare, and the car lights briefly illuminate his surroundings. TIPTREE glances over at the inside wall of the tunnel... ...where he sees, huddled in an ALCOVE just off the tracks, a small gathering of HOMELESS PEOPLE. They've set up camp down here in the tunnels, away from the elements. Surrounded by bags full of old clothes, DINING on canned food and cheap wine, they stare curiously at the well-heeled stranger with the suitcase who's invaded their domain. TIPTREE eyes them fearfully and picks up his pace, hastening down the tunnel. The HOMELESS make no move to follow -- with one exception. A KID, thirteen or fourteen, in a ratty topcoat, climbs down onto the tracks and watches inquisitively as TIPTREE vanishes into the shadows. His face is familiar. It's DICK -- the boy vigilante from the park. INT. TUNNEL - FARTHER DOWN TRACKS - A MOMENT LATER In this stretch of the tunnel the LANTERNS don't seem to be working -- and the MYNAH is completely invisible. When he comes to a fork in the tracks, he has to wait for the sound of the bird's shrill voice to guide him: MYNAH AWWRRK! FOLLOW ME. TIPTREE stumbles ahead blindly in the darkness. He trips on the tracks and drops the suitcase. As he's getting to his feet, a FLASHLIGHT shines DIRECTLY IN HIS FACE... VOICE STOP THERE. The MYNAH BIRD flutters through the beam of light and perches on the shoulder of an UNSEEN FIGURE. TIPTREE COWERS and SQUINTS, trying to make him out, but the figure who stands before him is shielding his face with an open UMBRELLA. TIPTREE I've cooperated. I've done everything you said. PENGUIN Open the case. TIPTREE lifts the lid, revealirig TWO RAVENS in the suitcase. A CACKLING LAUGH echoes in the darkness. PENGUIN (cont.) ...Two ravens? TIPTREE The other one is Bruce Wayne's. (trembling) He doesn't know anything about this. You've got what you want. There's no need to -- PENGUIN Thank you, Mr. Tiptree. You may go. TIPTREE stands. He backs away from the suitcase warily. TIPTREE My family. You won't -- PENGUIN We'll certainly take your unexpected generosity into consideration. TIPTREE We -- ?!? (shielding his eyes) You're not Batman. PENGUIN No. I'm his brother-in-law -- Birdman. Now move out. INT. TUNNEL - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT TIPTREE marches slowly down the tracks, TOWARD CAMERA, silhouetted in the flashlight beam. The beam SHIFTS SLIGHTLY as the Penguin moves toward the suitcase and sets the light down -- -- and we catch sight of the CATWOMAN perched on a steel cross-girder above the rails, her CHROME-STEEL TALONS GLINTING as she waits for TIPTREE to pass underneath. INT. TUNNEL - ON TIPTREE looking increasingly twitchy as he approaches the cross- girder. He slips a hand into the pocket of his topcoat, WHIRLS SUDDENLY -- -- and brings up his .38 AUTOMATIC, firing THREE QUICK SHOTS at the PENGUIN. The shots RICOCHET LOUDLY off the umbrella -- which happens to be a bulletproof job. The PENGUIN lifts his brolly; FIRE SPITS out of the shaft -- -- and TIPTREE staggers backward. SHOT IN THE CHEST. He spins into a steel upright and topples, face-forward, onto the ELECTRIFIED THIRD RAIL -- FRYING HIMSELF in a shower of sparks. The smoke is still clearing when the CATWOMAN drops to the tracks. The PENGUIN rushes to her side to check TIPTREE for signs of life. CATWOMAN That idiot. Another six feet -- PENGUIN So sorry to spoil your fun. -- He brought two ravens. We've got a complete set! CATWOMAN What?? PENGUIN Yeah! They're in the suitcase -- An AWFUL RUMBLING fills the tunnel. They see the lights of a TRAIN approaching on the center track -- the same one they're standing on, the one TIPTREE's body is slumped across. The PENGUIN's first impulse is to run back toward the inner track, where the ravens lie, but the CATWOMAN is trying to drag TIPTREE out of the train's path... CATWOMAN GIVE ME A HAND! They pull the corpse onto the outer express track just as the train arrives. They stand against the outer wall, waiting for the train to pass... ...and when it does, they see DICK -- the boy vigilante -- standing on the inner track directly across from them. HOLDING THE SUITCASE. The kid takes off like a shot. The CATWOMAN and the PENGUIN exchange quick looks of utter disbelief -- and BOLT AFTER DICK. INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK The bulky suitcase is slowing his progress. He looks back over his shoulder; although the stubby-legged PENGUIN has fallen well behind, the CATWOMAN is gaining fast. PAGE 101 MISSING FROM HARD COPY INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK watching in the light from the train as the two costumed figures grapple in the distance. He races back toward the scene of the melee... INT. TUNNEL - OUTTER EXPRESS TRACK - THAT MOMENT ...where BATMAN and the CATWOMAN are trading punches, blow for blow. He knocks her off her feet with a vicious right hook, and she sprawls on the track, dazed and bleeding. She lifts a hand: no mas... He looks back toward the suitcase on the center track. Before he can make a move toward it, he spots ANOTHER TRAIN approaching on the outer tracks -- right on the heels of the last one. He crouches to pull the CATWOMAN's limp frame out of its path... ...but as he does so, a HORN BLARES -- and a SECOND TRAIN comes barrelling down the center track from the opposite direction! Now he's got trains approaching on either side, and there's no place to go -- The CATWOMAN is groggily getting to her feet. He LUNGES at her -- THRUSTS HER BACKWARD, toward an ALCOVE in the outer tunnel wall. INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK - THAT MOMENT The OUTER train is already speeding past, obscuring BATMAN and the CATWOMAN from view. The CENTER train is bearing down fast. A split-second before it arrives, DICK'S HAND snatches the suitcase out of its path -- and he TUMBLES TO SAFETY on the innermost LOCAL TRACK. He stands and watches as the two trains pass in opposite directions. He doesn't know if BATMAN is alive or dead... INT. ALCOVE - THAT MOMENT BATMAN and CATWOMAN are flattened in the tiny alcove -- there's not two inches of breathing space between them and the passing TRAIN. She's come around now, and she's FLAILING and CLAWING at him, trying to PUSH HIM OUT. HER HAND closes around his UTILITY BELT. As they struggle, she hits the trigger of a SMALL GAS CYLINDER... It's BRUCE's hydraulic BATWING DEVICE -- the one that saved him when he fell off the roof. But this time the results are altogether different. He GASPS IN HORROR as the WINGS OF HIS CAPE stiffen and inflate -- FORCING HIM AWAY FROM THE WALL OF THE TUNNEL. His OUTER WING strikes the TRAIN -- FLAPPING WILDLY against the passing CARS -- SNAGGING FINALLY on the ralling of the rearmost car -- -- and BATMAN is suddenly RIPPED OUT OF THE ALCOVE -- DRAGGED OFF DOWN THE TRACKS by the passing train! INT. TUNNEL - INNERMOST TRACK - ON DICK He's still there with the suitcase -- waiting apprehensively to see what's become of BATMAN. Finally the center train passes -- -- and he sees CATWOMAN standing ALONE IN THE ALCOVE -- smiling at him -- advancing menacingly. DICK TURNS TO RUN... A GUNSHOT rings out -- and the last thing he sees as he slumps to the tracks is a whiff of SMOKE pluming from the shaft of the PENGUIN'S UMBRELLA. The PENGUIN's panting -- soaked with sweat. The CATWOMAN snatches up the suitcase and rushes over to join him. She peers off into the tunnels after BATMAN, exhilarated... CATWOMAN God. Did you see him? Isn't he hot? PENGUIN Haven't you got anything else to think about? (mopping sweat from his brow) I'm hot. That was exhausting. CATWOMAN No pain, no gain! -- Suck it up. We're not out of here yet. She sprints off down the tracks. SQUAWKING, he waddles along behind her, as fast as his fat little legs will carry him... As they vanish into the darkness, the CAMERA TRACKS back -- past DICK, who lies unconscious on the tracks, bleeding heavily from his shoulder wound -- DEEPER INTO THE MAZE OF TUNNELS -- -- arriving finally on the ragged black figure of BATMAN as he staggers forth from the shadows, dazed and bloody. He scans the tunnel, finding no trace of his enemies -- and then his gaze falls on DICK. He limps over and KNEELS at the boy's side -- cradling his head protectively, staring helplessly into the blackness all around him... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GOTHAM CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT The stark outlines of the city, BATHED IN MOONLIGHT. CAMERA ZEROES IN on the glowing, ornamental DOME of CITY HALL... INT. CITY HALL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A PENTAGONAL BALCONY girds the interior of the dome. We TILT DOWN to ground level -- where TWO AGED SECURITY GUARDS lie sprawled at odd angles on the marble floor, FATALLY SHOT. The PENGUIN closes his gun-umbrella and waddles across the atrium of City Hall, past a statue of blind Justice, to a point directly under the dome. There, encased in a plexiglass case, is a SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM CITY -- circa 1885, when City Hall was erected. He shouts up: PENGUIN LETS DO IT! INT. CITY HALL - BALCONY UNDER DOME - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN, FRICK, and FRACK are already up on the balcony. Lining its periphery are various DISPLAY CASES of historical interest; and positioned along the wall at each point of the pentagon are FIVE ARCHED NICHES -- each one containing a bronze bust. The patriarchs of Gotham's Five Families... The CATWOMAN and co. go to work quickly. She removes the FIVE RAVENS from a gunny sack as FRICK and FRACK work their way around the balcony, YANKING the busts from their recessed bases. She follows along behind them, replacing each bust with a RAVEN. When they're done, the PENGUIN yells up: PENGUIN Now. Give each raven a quarter-turn. His pals in the dome oblige -- TWISTING each raven in its recessed socket, in quick succession... INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN The moment of maximum tension. He stands there frothing at the mouth with anticipation. SECONDS TICK OFF, and nothing happens. CATWOMAN What happens now? PENGUIN I don't know. That's all...! He looks around expectantly as the others peer down at him from above. He really doesn't know what's supposed to happen next. Suspecting the worst, he throws his umbrella to the floor and begins STAMPING ABOUT IN A RAGE, SPUTTERING, flapping his arms like wings. PENGUIN (cont.) We've been TRICKED! It's a HOAX! It's a -- He SHUTS UP suddenly at the sound of a loud CHUNK. Somewhere behind him, ANCIENT GEARS are beginning to grind. He spins and stares at the SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM in its plexiglass case... The city model is TREMBLING slightly. As he watches, the DOME of the miniature CITY HALL -- in the dead center of the model city -- POPS OFF on a hinge. A METAL STRONGBOX rises into view... INT. DOME - ON BALCONY - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN, FRICK and FRACK stare down at the little metal box. The PENGUIN is already clambering atop the plexiglass case of the model, SMASHING AT IT with his umbrella, trying to get at the box. FRICK That's the treasure? CATWOMAN No. It's a map... She affixes a ROPE to the balcony railing and CLIMBS OVER. INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN The plexiglass case finally SHATTERS -- and the PENGUIN falls through, landing atop Gotham City. He snatches at the strongbox and gets to his feet, bestriding the city like a colossus. He's climbing down off the tabletop when the CATWOMAN, on her rope, touches down behind him. He hunkers down on the floor and knocks the rusted padlock off the box. He opens it and stares greedily at the contents -- a MAP and a bunch of old, crumbling PHOTOS. The CATWOMAN creeps over to his side: PENGUIN Bruce Wayne. So he doesn't know a thing about the treasure, eh...? (handing her the map) Look at this. It's right under Wayne Manor. It's been there all along! Now the CATWOMAN snatches at the PHOTOS. They show progressively closer views of ANCIENT GNARLED STALACTITES -- an odd, distinctive SUBTERRANEAN ROCK FORMATION... PENGUIN (cont.) Looks like some kind of cave. FADE THROUGH TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY TIGHT ON THE FACE of DICK. He lies unconscious in a big soft frilly bed A WOMAN'S HAND wipes his feverish brow with a damp cloth; he moans slightly... His eyes snap open suddenly. He sits BOLT UPRIGHT with a yelp. VICKI No, no -- don't try to get up -- you're hurt. He pushes her aside and climbs out of bed anyway. His shoulder is bandaged, his arm in a sling. The pajamas he's wearing are three sizes too large. He paces about, staring at his unfamiliar surroundings. VICKI (cont.) It's all right. You're safe. You can stay here as long as you need to. DICK I don't belong here. You can't keep me here. Vaguely unnerved, he goes to a window, pulls back the shades, looks out at the grounds. VICKI It's "Dick", isn't it? Or do you prefer "Richard"? He stares at her as if she's nuts. VICKI opens a closet door: all of his ratty belongings are hanging inside -- including the red-and-green GYMNAST'S SUIT with the "R" insigne on the breast. VICKI "R" -- for Richard, right? See, all your things are here... (staring at the costume) What is it, some kind of gymnast's outfit? DICK It's none of your business. What is this, some kind of home? VICKI No, not that kind. There's a swimming pool -- tennis court -- you can have anything you want. DICK Tennis court?! -- Lady, you're rich. How the hell would you know what I want? VICKI tries to lay a soothing arm on his shoulder. He bats it away, pushes her aside and turns toward the door in agitation -- DICK I'm not staying. You can't make me -- -- and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway looking at him. BRUCE I can make you. DICK freezes -- as if BRUCE's mere presence has mesmerized him. The hint of a smile plays across his face: ohhhhh. I'm in Batman's house. BRUCE (cont.) Come on. Wanna go at it? (no response) Look, kid -- like it or not, you're my guest -- and long as you're here you might as well enjoy it. ALFRED appears with a tray of hot food and sets it down on a bedside table. DICK edges toward it and sits down. He waits for ALFRED to leave and then TUCKS IN HUNGRILY -- eyeing BRUCE all the while. BRUCE (cont.) Will you two be okay in here? VICKI nods yes. BRUCE backs out of the room. INT. WAYNE MANOR - OUTSIDE GUEST ROOM - DAY BRUCE pulls the door shut. ALFRED follows him down the hall. ALFRED What do you propose to do with him, sir? Keep him in the room for the rest of his life? BRUCE I don't know, Alfred. I've got other stuff to worry about. ALFRED The child is hurt, sir. At the very least we should attempt to locate his parents. BRUCE He hasn't got any parents. ALFRED How do you know that, sir? BRUCE turns and fixes ALFRED with a steely gaze. BRUCE ...I know. The PHONE RINGS as BRUCE starts down the long stairway. ALFRED picks up a hallway extension. He covers the mouthpiece: ALFRED Sir -- it's Miss Kyle. BRUCE rushes back upstairs to take the call. INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - THAT MOMENT - DAY ARCTIC BIRDS chirping all around in the penguin-pool room. A SNOW OWL struts across the PENGUIN's desk as SELINA makes a phone call -- with the PENGUIN, FRICK, and FRACK hovering over her. SELINA Well! Tall, dark and handsome. Are we still on for tonight? INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON BRUCE He covers the receiver and stares intensely at ALFRED. On his look we DISSOLVE TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT Christmas carols playing. VICKI's got DICK helping her trim the tree. INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT BRUCE is getting dressed for his date with SELINA. ALFRED Is this necessary, sir? After all...it is Christmas eve. BRUCE reaches for his UTILITY BELT. He empties the contents of one packet onto a dresser: a dozen tiny, red GLASSINE CAPSULES. He scoops up a handful of the CAPSULES and deposits them in his jacket pocket. BRUCE Stuff'll knock out a moose, much less a cat. ALFRED I don't like to see you going out on a date...unprotected, sir. BRUCE She'll be ready for Batman -- but not for me. (turning to go) It's the only way, Alfred. I've got to take her out tonight. INT. ENTRY HALL - FIVE MINUTES LATER (DICK'S POV) DICK watches from the front parlor as VICKI meets BRUCE at the bottom of the stairs. The two of them exchange a few brief words; he embraces her, strokes her hair gently -- then glumly sets his jaw and moves off toward the front door. VICKI reenters the parlor, trying to force an expression of cheer as DICK turns discreetly away. This is one weird household he's landed in... INT. SELINA'S LOFT - NIGHT SOFT MUSIC plays in the background as SELINA preens in front of a vanity, doing her eye makeup, taking great pleasure in her own reflection. She's looking especially sultry tonight in a glittering low-cut gown. She lowers one shoulder strap and strikes a pose in the mirror: better. She runs a hand through her hair, TOUSLING IT for that recently-ravished look. The DOORBELL rings, and by the time SELINA crosses over to answer it, she's lowered the other strap as well -- which means she has to hold up the top of her dress with one hand. BRUCE finds himsell dumbstruck as she lets him in. She pulls up both straps as she greets him nonchalantly: SELINA You're early. I'm afraid I'm not quite dressed. BRUCE enters and takes a long look around. It's a big open loft, only partly finished, filled with Egyptian artifacts. The walls feature modern paintings with CAT MOTIFS. The finished section is dominated by a huge BED on a raised platform -- three or four CATS are walking around on it, yowling at BRUCE. SELINA CHUCKLES as he scopes it all out. SELINA (cont.) If you're looking for my bondage gear, it's at the cleaners. BRUCE Christmas eve. No tree? SELINA No presents. I've been a bad girl this year. BRUCE takes a seat on the sofa while SELINA goes to a nearby wet bar. BRUCE I'm surprised you kept this date. I thought you would've lost interest by now. SELINA What makes you say that? BRUCE You've got what you want, don't you? SELINA I do now. (smiling) We've had this date for a long, long time. With that, she sets the drinks down on the table and moves in to KISS him -- a long, slow, wet kiss. But BRUCE seems strangely unresponsive. She breaks free and gives him a funny look. BRUCE How much is it going to cost me? SELINA What? BRUCE ...To get the ravens back. He watches her closely for a reaction. SELINA's shocked, but she conceals it well -- chuckling in apparent confusion. SELINA You're the oddest man I've ever met. (moving in on him) Let's talk later, Bruce. I've got kind of a short fuse... BRUCE tenses slightly as she KISSES him again -- leaving a crimson LIPSTICK SMEAR on his cheek. She works her way downward, kissing him around his neck and throat... HIS HAND reaches into his jacket pocket. He withdraws a tiny GLASSINE CAPSULE. But before he can use it -- He JERKS BACK suddenly -- pushes her away. His free hand goes to his neck, where a thin trickle of BLOOD is oozing from between two bright red LIPSTICK LIPS. She's bitten him... Now she SHUSHES him -- reaches over to the tiny wound and massages it gently with one hand. SELINA Did I hurt you? Just relax -- you'll start to enjoy it. BRUCE pulls away again. His eyes are strangely glazed. He tries to speak, but his tongue feels thick and swollen. SELINA (cont.) Bruce, you look faint. It must be the cats. BRUCE stands suddenly. It's as if he's mired in a slo-mo nightmare. His legs give way beneath him and he topples to the floor, INERT. His fingers go slack and the capsule rolls out; he tries to reach into his pocket, but his arm won't seem to work. SELINA's cat, HECATE, strolls across his prostrate form -- purring and stretching... BRUCE'S POV A worm's-eye view -- SELINA looms over him with a predatory smile on her face, shifting in and out of focus. BRUCE What di-- what did you d-- She runs a finger across her lips and holds it up -- bright red. SELINA I guess I've...gotten under your skin. BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE His hand goes to the BITE on his neck -- and he realizes SELINA's lipstick is spiked with a fast-acting PARALYTIC DRUG. He writhes helplessly on the carpet, his whole body gradually going slack. The PENGUIN, FRICK and FRACK stroll through the doorway and stand over him -- ALL LAUGHING... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past the manor, right on schedule. INT. WAYNE MANOR - PARLOR - NIGHT ALFRED on the telephone, checking in with the County Sheriff's boys. ALFRED Everything's fine, thank you. We'll talk in an hour. Behind him, VICKI is waiting up for BRUCE. She's curled up on the sofa, reading a book, throwing the occasional anxious glance at a big grandfather clock -- which strikes eleven o'clock. INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT DICK opens the bedroom door and peeks down the hall. He's got all his belongings tied up in a bundle on the bed; he opens a window and throws the bundle outside. There's a nice strong TREE BRANCH some ten or twelve feet from the window -- just close enough that he should be able to make it. He climbs up onto the windowsill, crouches, and SPRINGS. INT. CAR - OUTSIDE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A car full of trouble: SELINA, wearing a fur coat over her Catwoman garb, at the wheel; the PENGUIN riding shotgun; and FRICK in the back seat -- next to BRUCE, who's semi-conscious and stone limp. The car idles outside the wrought-iron gates of Wayne Manor. PENGUIN Try his mag card. FRICK digs in BRUCE's pockets and finds a bunch of RED CAPSULES. FRICK Look at this. He's a pillhead. Now FRICK finds a mag-striped card and INSERTS IT into an electronic device at the edge of the drive. The gates magically part. There's a large VAN just behind the car -- driven by FRACK, and carrying two random GOONS. Both vehicles pull in before the gates slide shut. INT. WAYNE MANOR - A MOMENT LATER VICKI hears a signal from the security panel in the kitchen announcing what should be BRUCE's arrival. She heaves a huge sigh of relief -- then rushes to the door and flings it open. She sees BRUCE standing there and her face lights up. VICKI Ohh. Am I glad to -- To her horror, BRUCE topples forward -- and lands on the floor, flat as a board. VICKI SHRIEKS as the PENGUIN enters, throwing his arms wide. PENGUIN MER-R-R-RY CHRISTMAS!! EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT DICK has shimmied down to a lower branch. He lets go and drops to the snow, WINCING; his shoulder wound is bleeding again. As he grabs his bundle, he hears RAUCOUS LAUGHTER coming from around the house. He races over to peer around the corner. He sees the two cars out front. He sees the last of the goon squad barging in through the front door. His face full of confusion and conflict, he moves to a window. In the entry hall he sees BRUCE on the floor -- and VICKI surrounded by gun-toting intruders. One of them grabs her and twists her arm behind her back. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT VICKI shrieking and struggling as she stares down at BRUCE. VICKI What did you do to him?? SELINA gives her a catty little smile. SELINA First-time jitters, I guess. Everything was going great, and then...he just went limp as a noodle. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON STAIRWAY Drawn by the commotion, ALFRED rushes down the stairs to the entry hall, pulling a robe around him. He freezes in his tracks when he sees FRICK dragging VICKI into the front parlor, holding a gun to her head. PENGUIN You'd be the butler. Why don't you come on down and attend to your guests? ALFRED hesitates, until the PENGUIN pulls a gun on him. He marches down the stairs slowly, pausing by BRUCE's prostrate form. ALFRED Mr. Wayne. Is he -- ? PENGUIN You know how it is. Some guys just can't hold their egg nog. INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER The PENGUIN marches ALFRED in where the rest of the gang's already assembled. FRICK throws VICKI down roughly on a sofa just next to the Christmas tree while the GOONS drag BRUCE inside. PENGUIN I should explain the occasion of our visit. There's a treasure underneath this house -- and I don't plan to leave until you tell me how to find it. Now who's going to talk -- Miss Vale? VICKI I don't know what you're talking about. PENGUIN The cave. Under the house. How do I get there? The PENGUIN gestures. FRICK holds the gun to her head. VICKI (cont.) I don't know! I swear, I would tell you -- PENGUIN (turning to ALFRED) Then maybe you'd like to tell me. ALFRED You're no more than a common thief. PENGUIN Wrong, you old idiot. I happen to be a very uncommon thief. (beat) Are you going to tell me, or does Miss Vale get an early present this year? FRICK cocks the gun. VICKI stares aghast at ALFRED, who scans the room, weighing his options. Trembling, he shuts his eyes -- ALFRED I...don't...know... PENGUIN Then go ahead, Mr. Frick...decorate the tree. FRICK's finger tightens on the trigger. VICKI winces. ALFRED starts to blurt something out. But a split-second before he can speak -- SELINA Wait! (crossing over to VICKI) We don't know how to get down there yet. We may need her when Bruce wakes up. The PENGUIN sighs and waves FRICK off. ALFRED and VICKI heave simultaneous sighs of relief. He throws her a shamefaced look -- but she gives him a tiny nod of acknowledgement: you made the right play. SELINA (cont.) Besides -- I want this one for myself. So pretty...I'm going to give her a brand new face for Christmas. The PENGUIN throws a look at BRUCE, who's still out cold on the floor. He turns to FRICK and FRACK. PENGUIN Why don't you two tie up our host? ALFRED sits beside VICKI while SELINA wanders off to tour the premises. FRICK and FRACK, meanwhile, drag BRUCE into a back parlor which opens off the room they're in. INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT They dump BRUCE face down on a sofa -- then rip the telephone cords from around the baseboard and use them to bind his hands and feet. INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON MR. BONIFACE Still holding his gun on VICKI and ALFRED, he wanders about the room, admiring the various furnishings and expensive objects. PENGUIN It's all so plush and tasteful, isn't it? Just the sort of setting in which I've always imagined myself. ALFRED, on the sofa, can't resist letting out a snort of disgust. PENGUIN (cont.) I see. You think I'm vulgar. You think I'm...nouveau. ALFRED I think you're a dirty little man with a -- The PENGUIN silences him by sweeping one arm across a tabletop, sending a bunch of PRICELESS CHINA FIGURINES crashing to the floor. He points to ALFRED as FRICK and FRACK reappear. PENGUIN See, boys, that's old money talking. After a while, they actually start to believe they've earned all this. (smirking) I don't mind. Someday I'll be old money too -- when the statute of limitations runs out. SELINA (O.S.) Hey! -- Guess what I just found. Face full of anticipation, he TURNS -- just in time to see SELINA returning from the kitchen with a big silver tray of... SELINA (cont.) Christmas cookies! The PENGUIN is crestfallen, but that doesn't stop him from cramming a handful of cookies down his gullet. SELINA graciously serves VICKI and ALFRED, who munch away with limited enthusiasm. PENGUIN Let's spread out and see what we can find. (to FRICK and FRACK) You two -- keep an eye on our friends here. Give me a yell the minute Wayne comes to. FRICK and FRACK post themselves at the doors to the front parlor as SELINA, the PENGUIN and the GOONS fan out through the house. CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as they move past BRUCE -- -- and in a quick CLOSEUP we see his EYES OPEN -- his hands STRUGGLING against his bonds. SERIES OF SHOTS QUICK GLIMPSES of the intruders enacting their depredations as they search for the entrance to the cave. SELINA and the PENGUIN are flinging open doors, moving clocks, looking for secret panels; as they go, they systematically TEAR THE HOUSE APART -- smashing BRUCE's possessions, ripping paintings out of frames, etc. Meanwhile, the TWO GOONS are outside prowling around the grounds, looking for an exterior entrance -- and back in the parlor, FRICK and FRACK are keeping their guns trained on ALFRED and VICKI. INT. WAYNE MANOR - CORRIDOR OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT CAMERA TRACKS down a long, empty hallway -- arriving at a LOCKED DOOR with curtained-off glass panels. Suddenly, an ELBOW smashes through the glass -- a hand reaches inside and fumbles for the lock -- INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT FRICK and FRACK start at the sound of a SECURITY ALARM blaring from the kitchen. VICKI looks at ALFRED... FRICK Better check it out. FRICK stays behind as FRACK rushes out into the entryway and down a long hall to the kitchen. He tosses a glance back at VICKI and ALFRED, then steps out into the entryway himself. FRICK (cont.) What is it? What's going on?? VICKI and ALFRED look into the back parlor. DICK GRAYSON has sneaked in behind the sofa -- and he's busy sawing away at BRUCE's bonds with a letter opener. Both of them stiffen simultaneously -- if FRICK steps back inside, he'll have a clear view of DICK and BRUCE. INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT FRACK has opened a panel on the kitchen wall, revealing the SECURITY SYSTEM from which the alarm emanates. A RED LIGHT is blinking, indicating DICK's break-in. FRACK throws switches frantically, trying to kill the sound. Finally he succeeds -- and SHOUTS: FRACK Some kind of security system -- INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT DICK's gotten BRUCE free -- but BRUCE, still under the effects of the drug, isn't much use. He tries to get off the sofa and crumples in a heap. DICK Can you move, man? BRUCE Library -- got to get me to the library -- DICK slings an arm around BRUCE and drags him to a door opening onto the hallway. They're just about to step outside when FRACK comes marching back on his way from the kitchen. INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON VICKI AND ALFRED -- faces wracked with utter, desperate tension as they watch the situation develop. INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT FRICK and FRACK conferring, ignoring VICKI and ALFRED for the moment. By now the PENGUIN is waddling in from a hallway: PENGUIN What is that ungodly racket? FRACK A security alarm. It went off in the kitchen. PENGUIN My God! Is someone in here? He struts over to huddle with his cronies. BRUCE and DICK are still poised in the doorway. It looks bad... INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT ALFRED looks at BRUCE and DICK -- then at FRICK and FRACK bickering with the PENGUIN in the entryway. He pats VICKI's knee -- gestures for her to keep her seat -- -- and LUNGES at FRICK, making a play for his gun. A moment of confusion ensues -- giving DICK and BRUCE just enough time to dart out into the hallway, duck around a corner, and vanish -- -- but ALFRED is a frail old gent, and he can't keep it up for long; a blow to the face sends him sprawling to the floor. FRICK instinctively pulls the trigger and SHOOTS HIM at point- blank range. VICKI rushes into the hallway -- screaming, crying. INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT The room's a mess, books all over the floor. The groggy BRUCE props himself up against his desk. He manages to pull the bottom drawer open -- gropes frantically for the secret switch. He's CRYING. BRUCE Alfred... DICK I'll go back. BRUCE I can't...get down there...without you. DICK turns. To his amazement, the sectional bookcase is swinging open -- revealing the secret passage to the BATCAVE. INT. ENTRY HALL/FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT We will all be pleased to know that ALFRED has only suffered a superficial wound to the arm. VICKI is on her knees beside him; the PENGUIN is watching them with utter contempt. PENGUIN What an extraordinarily stupid thing to do. VICKI SHUT UP. Help me with him. The PENGUIN rolls his eyes and orders FRICK and FRACK to give VICKI a hand without him. They carry him into the parlor, lay him out on the sofa. VICKI reaches into her purse for a handkerchief and begins binding his wound as the PENGUIN pulls FRACK aside. PENGUIN You and I had better check the ground floor and see what's going on. Mr. Frick -- do you think you'll be able to manage this pair? FRICK Yes sir. PENGUIN Oh, good. That does relieve my mind -- He turns, glances into the back parlor, and sees a pile of CUT CORDS on the love seat. The blood drains out of his face. PENGUIN (cont.) Where's Wayne??? INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT DICK has just entered another world -- and he's looking around him in pure, unalloyed amazement. BRUCE is fumbling with a packet on a spare UTILITY BELT; he shakes out a fistful of pills and swallows them dry. Then he goes to his bank of monitors and begins flipping switches. They blink on one by one; DICK moves up behind BRUCE and looks on, dazzled. INSERT - MONITOR The screen shows The PENGUIN in a sun room, shouting to his two armed GOONS through a pair of French doors. PENGUIN Check the grounds! The shape he's in, he can't have gotten far. BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE He turns to his main control panel, reaches for a switch, and waits. EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The two GOONS outside, with guns and flashlights, roaming cautiously around the grounds. They turn suddenly -- -- as CORRUGATED-STEEL SECURITY PANELS slam into place over every ground-floor door and window in Wayne Manor! INT. SUN ROOM - THAT MOMENT The PENGUIN sees the same thing happening, only from inside. He listens helplessly as his GOONS pound on the steel panels from outside. It's just occurred to him that he's trapped in here... INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER DICK is up on a catwalk leading back to the library of Wayne Manor. BRUCE shouts up to him from the control console down below. BRUCE -- as soon as he gets to the East wing. Wait for my signal. You know what to do. DICK nods yes and bolts off. INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER VICKI and ALFRED are still sitting at gunpoint. With the commotion going on all around them, FRICK is getting itchy- fingered. Suddenly the STEREO begins blaring at top volwne -- "SANTA BRING MY BABY BACK TO ME." FRICK turns and stares at it in confusion -- goes over to fiddle with the controls -- -- and suddenly BRUCE'S VOICE is coming through the loudspeakers. BRUCE (O.S.; filter) VICKI! RUN! NOW! She's off the sofa like a shot, DIVING for the entry hall. FRICK turns and takes aim -- -- but before he can squeeze the trigger, DICK's come out of nowhere to HIGH-KICK him in the face! The shot goes wild and the two of them tumble into the Christmas tree, knocking it over... INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT VICKI hits the floor of the entry hall. HUGE OAKEN SLIDING DOORS are already slamming shut behind her. The same thing is happening all down the hall -- the East wing of the house is sealing itself off! INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT DICK CARTWHEELS across the carpet -- catching FRICK high on the chest and RAMMING him backward, into the hearth. Before FRICK can regain his balance, DICK's BEANED HIM across the back of the skull with a fireplace poker. He bends and picks up FRICK's gun -- which he tosses to ALFRED, who's been watching all this with some fascination from the sofa. DICK Here. You might need it. ALFRED Thank you, Master Dick. And...bravo. INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT VICKI has made it to the wall phone. She can't seem to get a dial tone -- VOICE FROM BEHIND Do you really think we're that stupid? VICKI turns, and realizes to her horror that the VOICE is SELINA's. SELINA (cont.) I tawt I taw a puddy tat...!! With that she raises a hand -- and her CLAWS pop out. VICKI turns, grabs a carving knife from a wooden block -- but before she can do anything with it, a WHIP cracks and wraps around her wrist, jerking the knife loose. SELINA tugs on the other end, reeling her closer. SELINA You know, I've got a great recipe for Sliced Bitch -- VICKI lunges forward suddenly, causing the whip to slacken and throwing SELINA off-balance into the center island. While they're tangled up, VICKI grabs a MEAT CLEAVER and tries to bring it down on SELINA, but SELINA rolls effortlessly out of the way and returns the favor, SWIPING at VICKI with her claws. VICKI brings a Calphalon skillet up just in time to block the blow: CLANG. VICKI sweeps her arm across the countertop, showering SELINA with knives and appliances. It buys her enough time to make for the door -- but SELINA comes flying after her. Another downswipe with the claws -- but VICKI shoves a BUTCHER'S BLOCK into SELINA's path, and her TALONS wedge a half-inch deep in the wood. VICKI rushes out while she's trying to pry herself loose. INT. DINING HALL - A MOMENT LATER SELINA enters but finds no trace of VICKI. SELINA I love a good old-fashioned catfight -- but this is pissing me off. VICKI charges out from behind a sideboard, pushing a WHEELED COCKTAIL CART before her. It SLAMS full-force into SELINA, who lands on her back on the great long dining table. VICKI is in the doorway to the entry hall by the time she gets up. INT. ENTRY HALL - STAIRWAY - A MOMENT LATER VICKI races up the stairs. She has a good lead, but SELINA makes up the difference in a hurry. She takes the stairway in three giant bounds -- reaches the landing just as VICKI ducks down the hall and into a bedroom, slamming the door behind her and LOCKING IT. SELINA HERE, kitty kitty kitty...HERE, kitty kitty... She KICKS THE DOOR OPEN. INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT SELINA enters and strikes a coy pose as she shuts the door behind her. VICKI has opened a pair of French doors leading to a balcony, but it's too long a drop. She stands there paralyzed as SELINA advances. SELINA So this is where you earn your keep. She GRABS VICKI -- holds her out at arm's length and shoves her roughly back onto the bed. VICKI flails wildly as SELINA kneels atop her... SELINA's CLAWS shred VICKI's blouse, revealing a frilly section of bra -- SELINA Mmm! Frederick's of Gotham? She plants a talon against VICKI's sternum and RAKES IT DOWNWARD, drawing a RED STRIPE on the exposed flesh of VICKI's belly. Now VICKI just loses it. She begins to SHRIEK uncontrollably. SELINA Not so loud, honey! The neighbors'll get the wrong idea. (laughing) Santa's coming. Time for all good girls to go to sleep... She raises her claw-hand and prepares to slash down at VICKI's neck. But an instant before she can strike -- VICKI goes wide-eyed and shuts up. A BLACK SHADOW falls across the moonlit bed. SELINA tenses -- -- as a BLACK-GLOVED HAND grabs a fistful of her hair -- BATMAN Miss me, "Angel"? He yanks her bodily off the bed. Before she knows what's happening, he delivers a POWERHOUSE UPPERCUT. She flies into the door and knocks it cleanly off its hinges. INT. HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - A MOMENT LATER BATMAN steps out after SELINA, who's only now picking herself up. SELINA Okay -- let's do it, huh? You and me... all the way this time. She HISSES and jumps him. They grapple -- a quick flurry of fists -- and he knocks her ass-over-teakettle down the long stairway. She gets to her feet, limping, and darts around a corner. BATMAN marches implacably down the stairs, taking his time... INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER VICKI rushes out of the bedroom. She looks down the hall and sees FRACK flying out of the guest room, UPSIDE DOWN -- slamming into the wall opposite. He slumps to the carpet, out cold. A moment later DICK strolls out. VICKI rushes to his side -- VICKI Come on. We'll be safe in the cave. INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY/ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER BATMAN PAUSES outside the door to the armory, which is slightly ajar. He pushes it in cautiously... ...and a HALBERD smashes through the wood frame -- slicing down mere inches from his face. It's the PENGUIN wielding the ax; he backs off in seeming terror as BATMAN advances on him. But then -- -- SELINA springs down from a perch above the doors -- landing on his back -- and the two of them are going at it again. It's a room full of exotic weaponry, and most of it gets a good workout in the next thirty seconds. BATMAN dodges a LANCE -- which embeds itself into the wall behind him, QUIVERING -- and swings a MACE squarely into SELINA's ribs. It's a crippling blow; she flies backward, knocking over a suit of exotic armor -- which TOPPLES, knocking over another -- and another -- -- until the various suits of armor have all fallen over, domino-style -- the last of them landing squarely atop the cowering PENGUIN. SELINA is badly hurt now. She makes it out of a rear door to the armory. BATMAN pauses to check on the PENGUIN -- he seems to be out for the count -- and sets off in pursuit of SELINA. SEVERAL MOMENTS PASS before the groaning PENGUIN comes around enough to dig himself out. INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER As the PENGUIN stumbles around a corner, he peers into the LIBRARY. VICKI is crouched by BRUCE's desk, reaching into a bottom drawer. A hidden panel in the bookcase pops open... INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT As she helps ALFRED into the secret passageway, VICKI turns to DICK: VICKI Come on. Come with us. DICK No. I can still help... INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER The PENGUIN flattens against the wall as DICK sprints out of the library and heads off in the opposite direction. There's a flabbergasted look on his face -- he recognizes this kid. WIPE TO: INT. BATCAVE - A MINUTE LATER At the monitor bank, watching BATMAN's pursuit of SELINA, are VICKI and ALFRED. They pivot suddenly at the sound of a VOICE: PENGUIN Such primitive entertainment. He's holding a gun on the two of them. He stares about delightedly, taking in the prehistoric splendor of the cave. His eyes light up at the sight of the BATMOBILE, parked on its little plateau. PENGUIN (cont.) So Bruce equals Batman. It seems I've discovered two treasures! (an evil smile) Don't move. I'd be only too happy to shoot you both. He pulls out his packet of photos and begins to scan the cave. He spots the distinctive ROCK FORMATION in an upper vault of the cavern. It's a couple of plateaus over; a long narrow CATWALK runs past it, some ten or twelve feet below. PENGUIN The Gotham City Treasury. It's about to be stolen twice. ALFRED Don't be absurd. You'll never be able to get it out of here. PENGUIN Oh, I'll manage somehow. You two are my guarantee of that. (nudging VICKI with the gun) Let's have a look, shall we? You go first. He shoves her. She starts across the catwalk, his gun at her head. INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT SELINA's made it back upstairs, but she's moving at quarter- speed, favoring one leg and clutching her ribs as she lopes down the hallway. She's just passed the balcony overlooking the entry hall when BATMAN appears dead ahead in her path. He's ready to rumble -- but instead of responding, she packs it in. She stops, slumps against a wall and begins to laugh. SELINA It could've been so nice -- you and me -- if only you weren't so screwed up. BATMAN It's over. I don't want to hurt you any more. SELINA Tell me something -- one thing. If you don't enjoy all this...why do you do it? He just looks at her. He doesn't have an especially good answer. She sighs. SELINA (cont.) I'll never understand men. She SPINS SUDDENLY, delivering a high-kick to BATMAN's throat. As he reels backward, into a wall, she leaps up onto the narrow BANNISTER RAILING some thirty feet above the entry hall floor and goes into a CROUCH -- preparing to SPRING at the enormous crystal CHANDELIER mounted to the ceiling -- -- but just as she launches off, BATMAN rolls -- and brings up a GUN from his belt. He fires a RAZOR-SHARP DISK which sails past her head, cleanly SLICING THROUGH the chain which suspends the chandelier. The chandelier FALLS just as CATWOMAN catches hold of it -- and she finds herself PLUMMETING to the floor of the entry hall. On impact, the chandelier EXPLODES into a thousand fragments; the CATWOMAN lands hard on her back and lies sprawled in the midst of the wreckage, unmoving. BATMAN advances slowly down the stairs. Her arms and legs jut out at unnatural angles; she lets out an eerie, whimpering YOWL OF PAIN -- a cri du chat. He stands over her; she glares up at him. BATMAN Nine lives. CATWOMAN I can't move. I can't move. Her face is cut and bleeding. She tries to lift an arm and can't quite manage it. He crouches down beside her, still cautious... CATWOMAN (cont.) DON'T LOOK AT ME!! (pleading) Do me, baby...do me now...that's what I want. Please? BATMAN looks up. DICK is standing on the balcony overlooking them, highly curious as to what he'll do. BATMAN No. BATMAN slowly rises to his feet. She lets out another gruesome WHINE. CATWOMAN COME ON. Don't stop now. FINISH ME OFF. (almost weeping with pain) Son of a bitch. You're all alike... Her STEEL CLAWS snick into place. With an agonizing effort she lifts her forearm -- bends her wrist. She's trying to slit her own throat. He reaches for his belt, extracts a GLASSINE CAPSULE, and breaks it open with his thumb. He drops it amid the shattered glass around her face. A tiny cloud of GREEN GAS plumes out, and her hand falls limply at her side as she lapses into unconsciousness. BATMAN stands over her for a minute as DICK marches down to join him. DICK You should've done it, man. You should've killed her. BATMAN gives him a long, hard look -- but says nothing. BATMAN There's a radio in the cave. We'll send for help. INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER The PENGUIN and VICKI are on a catwalk just below the ROCK FORMATION. A STONE OUTCROPPING extends toward the catwalk, and he forces her to JUMP FOR IT. Now he has to follow; the prospect makes him nervous, but it's a short hop, and he clears it okay -- finding his footing on the rocky slope. They're cautiously making their way up toward the ROCK FORMATION when BATMAN appears suddenly at the far end of the catwalk -- sizes up the situation and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS. PENGUIN Ah, the illustrious Mr. Wayne. Look at you now. Whatever would your friends say? (smiling) You've been an exceptionally congenial host -- but I must ask you to back off. The PENGUIN grabs hold of VICKI and HOLDS HER CLOSE as they climb the last few feet toward the grotto. BATMAN swings his cape around, concealing his hands from view. He takes a cautious step backward. CLOSEUP - BATMAN'S HAND His free hand closes around a BATARANG -- flicks it open. ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI They've pulled almost even with the rock formation. A LARGE DANK GROTTO is visible through a small gap in the rocks. PENGUIN No sudden moves. It's a long way down. Gun at her head, he peers into the grotto... HIS POV - INSIDE THE GROTTO A VAST FORTUNE in GOLD and SILVER BULLION, undisturbed in all these years. GLINTING in the darkness. Hanging upside-down, above it, like silent guardians, are BATS -- DOZENS of them -- their tiny wet red eyes GLIMMERING at the PENGUIN... He dislodges a rock. It tumbles into the grotto... ...and a startled BAT comes screeching out of the gap in the rocks -- FLYING DIRECTLY AT HIS FACE. ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI He BACKS AWAY IN HORROR as the bat streaks past him. He FIRES HIS GUN wildly. The SOUND OF IT rouses MORE BATS, and they come flying out of the hole -- a VAST, CHITTERING SWARM. VICKI SHRIEKS; the PENGUIN STUMBLES -- and the two of them FALL BACK ONTO THE ROCKS, hanging on for dear life. BATMAN VICKI! An instant later BATMAN lets fly with the BATARANG. Clean hit; the PENGUIN staggers back, and his GUN skitters down across the rocks. With BATS screaming all around her, VICKI takes a deep breath and VAULTS toward the CATWALK. She's a foot short; she grabs hold of the railing and HANGS THERE, over the ABYSS, trying to pull herself up. BATMAN races toward her -- -- but the PENGUIN, clambering down across the rocky outcropping, has managed to grab hold of his GUN. The BATS have begun to swirl up toward the higher recesses of the cavern, and he's able to draw a clean bead on BATMAN. THUNDEROUS ECHOES reverberate through the cave as the first shot strikes BATMAN and knocks him backward. As the second spins him around. As the third sends him TOPPLING OVER THE RAILING. VICKI screams. BATMAN manages to grab the rail with one hand. Now two of them are hanging from the catwalk -- sitting ducks -- and the PENGUIN is determined to empty the clip. The ECHOES are cacophanous. ANCIENT STALACTITES drop from the vaulted roof of the cavern, PLUMMETING DOWNWARD like deadly projectiles, shattering agaist the cave floor. And then -- BATMAN pulls a tiny DEVICE from his utility belt and FLINGS IT. It lands in the rocks at the PENGUIN's feet. He stares down at it, and two beats later -- -- it begins to emit an EERIE ELECTRONIC WHINE. Within moments, EVERY BAT IN THE CAVE is in a FRENZY -- HOMING IN ON THE SIGNAL. The PENGUIN looks up sees them coming. A CHOKED WAIL emits from his throat as he drops the gun and stands there, PARALYZED. He's just been beaten at his own game. He lets out a last awful HOWL as HUNDREDS OF BATS ENGULF HIM -- -- and he PLUNGES DOWN INTO THE PIT -- his hideous scream dwindling to a faint echo, then vanishing altogether... BATMAN manages to drag himself up onto the catwalk. He rushes over to VICKI, pulls her up, drapes his cape around her protectively. Gradually, as the BATS recede to their distant perches, he stands and helps VICKI to her feet. They embrace on the edge of the abyss. On the far plateau, DICK has hooked up with ALFRED. The butler is slumped against a lab table, weary and exhausted, clutching his wounded arm. DICK slings an arm around him and helps him to the stairway. CUT TO: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT SQUAD CARS everywhere. FRICK and FRACK emerge in handcuffs, flanked by COPS. PARAMEDICS carry the still-unconscious SELINA past on a stretcher and load her into the back of an ambulance. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - NIGHT The place is an utter mess. Amid the carnage we find BRUCE conferring with COMMISSIONER GORDON and LT. BULLOCK. In b.g., a POLICE DOCTOR is dressing ALFRED's gunshot wound. GORDON ...and then Batman showed up? BRUCE He saved all our lives, Jim. I can't say for sure, but I'd bet she's the one behind the murders. GORDON God -- I pray you're right. (beat) One thing before we go, Bruce. Who's the kid? BRUCE looks into the front parlor, where VICKI and DICK are righting the fallen Christmas tree. BRUCE Oh, that's Vicki's little cousin. He's in town for the holidays. GORDON Well, he picked a hell of a time to visit. (turning to go) Merry Christmas, Bruce. Good luck cleaning this place up. GORDON and BULLOCK file out, followed by the POLICE DOCTOR. BRUCE smiles wearily to himself and strolls into the front parlor. INT. FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT ALFRED loads 'SILENT NIGHT' on the CD. VICKI ambles up to BRUCE: VICKI What are you going to do with all that gold? BRUCE I dunno. Might be a good start on a place to live -- for some people who don't have one. She hugs him. DICK plugs in the Christmas-tree lights; they blink to life just as the GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes twelve. VICKI It's Christmas. BRUCE Yeah. Maybe you should -- open your present. She runs a hand along his cheek and laughs softly. VICKI Oh, Bruce, presents doesn't matter. None of it matters. We're all safe. We're together. BRUCE ...You might as well. He digs around in his jacket pocket and produces a tiny GIFT BOX, which he hands to VICKI. She unwraps it, opens it slowly -- and sees a DIAMOND RING inside. She gazes up at him, speechless. He gazes back. CAMERA PULLS UP and away until we can see the whole of the devastated room, and all the people in it -- VICKI, falling into BRUCE's arms; DICK, off to one side, watching them; ALFRED, tossing broken furniture into a roaring fireplace. And on the image of this decidedly eccentric family unit, we FADE OUT. THE END

          Keep MOVING CLOSER as SOUND FADES IN.

          The SOUND is at a frantic pitch here-- The sound of CHAOS on
          the streets. People SCREAMING, CAR HORNS BLARING as CARS
          jockey for position, moving eastward among...
          HORDES OF PEOPLE on foot, their PANICKED FACES rushing past.

          Then SUPER: THE DAY BEFORE...
          We are CLOSE ON: SERGEANT MICHAEL NANTZ late 30s, tall,
          battle-hardened, staring forward, listening impatiently.

          1ST SGT. ROY (O.S.)
          Must be some kind of mistake...
          Company 1st SERGEANT JOHN ROY, also late 30s, sits behind his
          desk, holding Nantz' file. Smiles.

          1ST SGT. ROY
          I got paperwork here, with your
          signature, says you're retiring.

          SGT. NANTZ
          No mistake, John.

          1ST SGT. ROY
          My ass. You got a box full a',
          medals, file full a' commendations.

          Mike. You're a marine!
          Nantzsmiles back now.

          SGT. NANTZ
          I appreciate it, John. You know
          that. But, I been to too many
          funerals. Had to visit too many
          moms and dads, tell 'em about what
          happened to their sons...

          BEAT.

          1ST SGT. ROY
          Look. You're on that training
          assignment right now. Why don't
          you just ride it out for a month or
          two. See how you feel...

          SGT. NANTZ
          I did my twenty. I'm done.
          Roy takes this in, nods. He stands, holds his hand out.

          1ST SGT. ROY
          You're gonna miss it.
          Nantz shakes.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Wanna bet?

          Looking out onto ROLLING HILLS and TREES... We hear (O.S.) :

          VOICE #1 (O.S.)
          I don't see it...

          VOICE #2 (O.S.)
          I'm telling you, it's in the trees.

          From the 1st Platoon, 2nd battalion, 5th Marines (the 2/5)..
           Camo uniforms, NIGHT VISION GOGGLES on, stare into the DARK.
          CPL. CORREGGIO, 20, linebacker-big, shakes his head,
          frustrated.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Screw it. I'm gonna launch another
          one...
          The other marines back away quickly as...
          WIDEN to see we're...

          EXT. OFFICER'S GOLF COURSE / CAMP PENDLETON - NIGHT

          Correggio, GOLF CLUB in hand, steps to a golf tee. WHACK.
          He tees off.
          The marines follow the ball as it sails into the darkness.

          CPL. CORREGGIO -
          That's more like it.
          PVT. LENIHAN, 18, baby-faced, looks impressed.

           PVT. LENIHAN
          Sweet.
          PVT. IMLAY, 19, a dense but good-natured country boy, moves
          to the tee.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Don't encourage him. Correggio's
          freakin' ego's big enough already.
          He takes the club from Correggio.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Let an expert show you how it's
          done, bro.
          Imlay TEES OFF, his swing plainly choppy, uncoordinated.

          POV THROUGH IMLAY'S NIGHT VISION GOGGLES
          As he WHACKS THE BALL, visible in the night vision's greenish
          glow. It HOOKS into a sand trap.

          PVT. IMLAY (O.S.)
          Mother fu...

          Then he stops as a LIGHT flashes beyond the trees.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Foot mobiles. 3 O'clock.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Told you they'd come!
          THREE GIRLS, 19-21, signal with a FLASHLIGHT. Then race down
          a small hill onto the golf course.

          EXT. GOLF COURSE - LATER

          The THREE GIRLS sit around a beat-up TAHOE parked near the
          tee, CASE OF BEER on its back gate, sipping beers.
          Corpsman ADUKWU, 20, a tall, thin Nigerian, TEES OFF.

          PVT. IMLAY
          That dog'll hunt! Damn, Daktari,
          you can play!

                         ADUKWU

                         (THICK ACCENT)
          We have courses in Nigeria, Imlay.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Well, how would I know? I mean,
          it's an American game.

          PVT. LENIHAN
          Actually, Imlay, it's Scottish.
          PVT. KERNS, 19, an antsy fireplug of a guy, shakes his head.

          PVT. KERNS
          Lenihan, you as good with an M-16
          as you are with your mouth?

          PVT. IMLAY
          Kerns. Lay off him.

          PVT. KERNS
          What? Just wanna make sure the
          rookie won't fold under fire.
          Correggio shoves a beer into Kerns' hand.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Relax, dude.
          He throws an arm around Kerns' shoulder, smiles at the girls.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          My buddy's jumpy 'cause he got an
          assfull a' shrapnel our last tour.

          PVT. KERNS
          I'm jumpy? You're crawling up your
          own ass 'cause we train with Sgt.
          Nantz tomorrow.
          Correggio eyes Kerns. This was the wrong thing to say.
          One girl, smiling seductively, steps to Correggio, takes the
          golf club.from him.

                         GIRL #1
          If this is the officer's course,
          what happens if they catch you out
          here?
          She readies to take a shot. Correggio snuggles up behind
          her, ostensibly teaching her how to swing.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          We can handle it, baby. We're
          experts at night maneuvers.
          Nearby, the SECOND GIRL chats up Adukwu.

                         GIRL #2
          So you're from where again?
          Imlay pops a beer, interrupting.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Nigeria. Adukwu's our corpsman.
          Like a medic. Saved Kerns' ass.

                         (TO ADUKWU)
          Daktari, tell her about Nigeria.
          Adukwu starts to talk, but Imlay interrupts again:

          PVT. IMLAY
          Adukwu's a green card marine...
          (motions to Lenihan)
          And Lenihan here-- He's just green.
          Mom signed so he could join at 17.
          I'm looking after him since he
          don't know his ass from a hot rock.
          Lenihan suddenly ducks behind the Tahoe, throwing up.

                         GIRL #3
          You're doing a good job.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Yeah. We always take the new meat
          out here to christen 'em...
          Lenihan shuffles back out from behind the Tahoe.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Hey, barfy. Grab your beer.
          toast.
          Everyone holds beers aloft. Lenihan joins in reluctantly.

          PVT. IMLAY
          To Lenihan. Who gets his first
          taste a' those hills tomorrow.
          He points off to the HILLY, DESOLATE TERRAIN near the course.

          PVT. KERNS
          Good luck, rookie.
          The marines chuckle knowingly, about to drink...
          Then they hear the sound of TIRES skidding to a halt. They
          look toward the hillside, see the WHITE HELMETS'of MPs.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          MPs!
          The marines grab the goggles and clubs, pile...

          INTO THE TAHOE
          With the girls. The Tahoe skids away, the beer CRASHING off'
          the back. The first girl eyes Correggio.

                         GIRL #1
          Experts, huh?
          Correggio grins sheepishly. She smiles. sweetly, taking his
          hand, writing her PHONE NUMBER on the back of it as...

          INT. BEDROOM / OFF-BASE APARTMENT - SAN CLEMENTE - MORNING

          A modest working-class two bedroom apartment. A TELEVISION
          on in the b.g.. A NEWS PROGRAM:

          NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
          .what appears to be an
          unprecedented meteor shower,
          falling off the Falkland Islands.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.
          LT. BENNIE MARTINEZ, 25, whose youthful looks and open smile
          contrast with his muscular frame, rolls in bed to see...
          His wife, ANNA, 24, sitting on the edge of the bed next to
          him, turning something over in her hands.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          What are you doing up so early?
          She holds up the object in her hands-- It's Martinez'

          LIEUTENANT BARS.

                         ANNA

                         (OBVIOUSLY PROUD)
          Lieutenant. I still have to get
          used to that.
          She kisses him lightly, stands. Martinez smiles, watching
          her move off.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Yeah, lot of things we gotta get
          used to.
          We see her VERY PREGNANT BELLY now as she smiles back, exits.
          As she does, Martinez turns back to the TELEVISION:
          'METEORS' falling into a distant ocean.

          NEWSCASTER (V.0.)
          This dazzling display is visible
          from Argentina to Southern Chile.

          EXT. DRIVEWAY / OFF-BASE APARTMENT - LATER

          Martinez, in uniform now, exits the ground-floor apartment,
          heads to HIS CAR as Anna exits, watching him go, smiling.

                         ANNA
          Call me later.

          LT. MARTINEZ

                         (SIMULTANEOUS)
          I'll call you later.
          He stops, smiling back at her now. She waves coyly.
          Then Martinez is RUNNING BACK TO THE APARTMENT.
          Moving with the grace of the college football player he was
          just a few years ago.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          We don't go with him. Just observe from a distanceas...
          Martinez arrives at Anna, who laughs as he leans down,
          kissing her stomach now.

          EXT. TRAINING COURSE - MORNING

          The 1st PLATOON of the 2/5, 39 marines, all 18-23 years old,
           sweating as they RUN HILLS in FULL GEAR in the blazing sun.
          Key on the MARINES FROM THE GOLF COURSE, staring forward
          at... Nantz, running up ahead.

          PVT. KERNS
          Heard Nantz put in his papers.
          He's out.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Good. Wish he done it years ago.
          Lenihan, struggling, breathing hard, looks up at this,
          STUMBLING as he does.
          Nantz, looking back at the chatter, sees...
          Imlay grab hold of Lenihan, helping him forward now.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Goddamn it, Imlay, you gonna wipe
          his ass for him, too? Every man
          carries his weight!
          Nantz drops back, runs alongside the struggling Lenihan.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Just quit, Lenihan. Do us all a
          favor. 'Cause the squad's only as
          strong as the weakest man.,..
          Lenihan STUMBLES and FALLS IN THE DIRT.

          SGT. NANTZ
          And right now you're getting us all
          killed. You hear?
          On these words, NANTZ MEETS EYES WITH CORREGGIO, further back
          in the pack. Nantz looks away, sees...
          Imlay, suddenly at Lenihan's side, helping him up. Nantz
          shoves Imlay away, knocking him onto his ass.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

          SGT. NANTZ
          You think you're helping him,
          Imlay!? You think you're making
          him stronger?!
          Nantz puts a boot into Imlay's chest, shoving him flat.
          Correggio stares at this, steaming.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Stay on the goddamn ground, Imlay!
          You've just been gut-shot.

                         (TO LENIHAN)
          Your buddy's down, bleeding to
          death, Lenihan. LZ's at the top of
          this hill. You gonna let this man
          die in the dirt on some stinking
          hill? Or are you marine enough to
          save him?!
          Lenihan stumbles to his feet, wiping dirt from his mouth.

          PVT. LENIHAN
          I'm gonna save him, sir!
          Lenihan bends, strains, somehow heaves Imlay up.
          He begins STUMBLING UP THE HILL, carrying Imlay on his back.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Come on, goddamnit! It's a hot LZ!
          The chopper's gotta move! They're
          gonna leave you BOTH to die!!!
          Lenihan staggers, knees trembling, weaving back and forth.
          Then his foot comes down on a ROCK IN THE TRAIL. His ANKLE
          GIVES WAY. Lenihan falls, yells in pain, grabbing his ankle.

          SGT. NANTZ

          GET UP!!!

          PVT. LENIHAN
          I can't.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Don't you ever tell me you can't!
          Correggio takes a step towards Nantz now. Kerns stops him.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          He's injured, Sergeant.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.
          A moment as they stare at each other. Nantz, voice like ice:

          SGT. NANTZ
          He's not injured. He twisted his
          goddamn ankle.
          Nantz' looks over the men, sweaty, covered with grime.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We are marines. "Can't" is not the
          code we live by. "Can't" gets
          marines killed. Do things the
          right way, the marine way, maybe
          you get to come home... Maybe your
          buddy gets to come home.
          Correggio stares back sullenly on this.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Dying's easy, ladies. Everything
          else takes balls.
          Nantz spits on the ground.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Adukwu. Run a bag of saline into
          Lenihan and tape that ankle. We
          start back in ten minutes.

          INT. FLOWER SHOP DAY

          We recognize two marines from 1st platoon: CPL. DEVREY
          HARRIS, 22, African-American, steely, quick-witted, and CPL.
          NICK STAVROU, 23, a Greek hulk with an easy smile.
          Harris stares at a TELEVISION on a table behind the counter.

          NEWSCASTER (V.0.)
          .meteors are falling off the
          coasts of California, Ireland,
          India, in the Bay of Bengal-- all
          less than ten miles from land...

          CPL. STAVROU
          Man, I thought Lenihan was gonna
          wash out today.

          CPL. HARRIS
          Hey, I remember carrying your fat
          ass up that hill hung over as shit.
          Newbie gets no sympathy from me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          A woman, CHERISE, 22, Harris' fiancee, hurries over.

                         CHERISE
          For three hundred more, she said we
          could have sprays of lilies. I
          know it's a lot, but it'd be so
          beautiful. What d'you think, baby?
          Harris looks pained. But before he can speak up:

          CPL. STAVROU
          Well, I think it's a no-brainer.
          You're only getting married once!
          What, are you gonna worry about
          three hundred bucks?
          Cherise looks expectantly to Harris, who smiles back weakly.

          CPL. HARRIS
          Of course, baby. Whatever you want
          She kisses him, heads to the florist as Harris turns on

                         STAVROU:

          CPL. HARRIS
          Dude, what are you doing?

          CPL. STAVROU
          Busting your balls.

                         CHERISE

                         (CALLS OVER)
          Tomorrow we shop for cake.
          Stavrou throws an arm round Harris' shoulder, smiles.

          CPL. STAVROU
          I love cake.

          INT. CAMP PENDLETON / PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

          A drab, nondescript office. Kerns sits across a desk from
          the BASE PSYCHIATRIST, who's consulting a FILE.

                         PSYCHIATRIST
          Still not sleeping... And the
          nightmares?

          PVT. KERNS
          No. I mean, sometimes. But it's
          no big deal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         PSYCHIATRIST
          You're not drinking, right,
          private? That's just a crutch...

          PVT. KERNS
          Alcohol? No, sir. Definitely not.
          The psychiatrist stares at this. Then WRITES in the file.

          PVT. KERNS
          So... What's my status? Am I
          cleared for combat? I feel good.

                         PSYCHIATRIST

                         (STILL WRITING)
          Let's meet again next week.

          EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - RED BEACH, CAMP PENDLETON

          Two surfers-- CPL. GRAYSTON, 23, looking grizzled beyond his
          years, and PVT. SIMMONS, a spaced-out surfer vibe, sit on
          boards in the water, staring at...
          TWO MPs, on the beach, waving them in.

          PVT. SIMMONS
          I don't know why they always have
          to give us shit. It's not fair.

          CPL. GRAYSTON
          Question is, why does everybody
          think life's supposed to be fair?
          Why do bad guys want to kill us?
          Why can't I have a nipple ring?
          Why is it the more power we get,
          the more we want? Nothing's fair,
          Simmons.

          PVT. SIMMONS

                         (SMILES)
          Whatever, Corporal. I just like to
          blow shit up.
          Suddenly, a SIREN begins WAILING from the base. Grayston and
          Simmons exchange a glance. They start paddling in quickly.

          EXT. TRAINING COURSE - DAY

          Nantz is running with another platoon of MARINES. Everyone
          slows as the SIRENS WAIL from the base.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Hold.
          The squad stops, following Nantz' gaze to...
          An approaching dust cloud, being kicked up by...
          A HUMVEE and TWO FIVE-TON TRUCKS
          Speeding up the dirt road toward the marines.
          Everyone is silent as they watch the HUMVEE and TRUCKS pull
          up... This is not normal.
          1st Sergeant Roy hops from the Humvee, shouting:

          1ST SGT. ROY
          Marines! Into the trucks. Now.
          Proceed to the armory and draw
          weapons.
          The marines exchange glances, heading for the five-tons.
          Roy motions to Nantz, who follows him to the Humvee.

          SGT. NANTZ
          What's going on, John?

          1ST SGT. ROY
          Look, Mike, I know you're burnt
          out, ready to move on... Whatever
          you want to call it. But
          everybody's being deployed right
          now. And the platoon's down a
          sergeant. We need you.

          SGT. NANTZ
          For what? Do I have a choice here?
          They arrive at the Humvee. Roy turns to Nantz.

          1ST SGT. ROY
          No. You don't. It's all hands on
          deck, Mike.
          Nantz nods, resigned. Starts climbing into the Humvee.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Just don't lose my paperwork.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

          INT. HUMVEE - MINUTES LATER

          Roy drives back to base, Nantz next to him. SIRENS are
          wailing, HELICOPTERS TAKING OFF in the distance.

          1ST SGT.. ROY
          Meteor storm's hittin' up and down
          California now... All I know is,
          this is a helluva lot more than
          just some space rocks fallin' out
          to sea...

          SGT. NANTZ
          What d'you mean?
          He turns., stares at Nantz.

          1ST SGT. ROY
          Whole base is being mobilized.
          There's some kinda' bad shit
          hittin' the fan.

          EXT. CAMP PENDLETON - MINUTES LATER

          The Humvee and five-tons swing into the base past a mass of
          activity: TRUCKS being loaded with supplies, TANKS driving
          onto flat cars, MARINES racing about.

          INT. HUMVEE - SAME


          1ST SGT. ROY
          You're assigned to 1st platoon,
          under Lt. Bennie Martinez. His
          platoon sergeant was rushing back
          to base, got in a car accident.

          SGT. NANTZ
          What are the odds?
          As the Humvee pulls to the COMMAND BUILDING, Nantz sees...
          LT. MARTINEZ hurrying to meet them.

          1ST SGT. ROY
          There's the lieutenant. Young,
          been with us three months, straight
          outta basics school. Bright kid,
          but this is his first deployment,
          so keep an eye on him, Mike.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

          INT. DORM ROOM - BACHELOR ENLISTED QUARTERS - SAME

          Lenihan and Imlay, Correggio and Kerns are getting their gear
          together, hurriedly packing.
          Lenihan checks and double checks a LIST with the contents of
          his pack, ticking off 'poncho liner,' 'gore-tex jacket,'
          'socks,' 'vest,' 'first aid kit,' flashlight'...

          PVT. KERNS
          It's probably just a drill, right?

          PVT. IMLAY
          They shifted Nantz into our unit.
          Something must be going on.

          PVT. LENIHAN
          I heard Nantz kicked ass on his
          last tour. Went into a compound by
          himself, killed, like, ten
          insurgents...

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          That what you heard? You don't
          know shit, Lenihan.
          Correggio, pissed, grabs his pack, heads for the door.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Move your asses. They want us in
          the armory.
          And he's gone. Lenihan, confused, looks at Imlay.

          PVT. LENIHAN
          What's his problem?

          PVT. IMLAY
          Nantz lost a lotta guys on that
          tour. Correggio's brother was one
          of 'em.
          Lenihan nods, somber, getting it.

          INT. HALLWAY / BASE COMMAND BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

          Nantz and Martinez walk through quickly. All around them,
          NUMEROUS OFFICERS hurry, all responding to RINGING BEEPERS.
          Nantz peers into VARIOUS OFFICES. Every one is buzzing with
          activity: Clerks bustling, maps spread out, phones ringing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.
          And every office has a TELEVISION on. We hear OVERLAPPING.
          REPORTER'S VOICES from the offices they pass:

          TV REPORTERS (V.0.)
          .cluster of what appears to be
          meteors is tightly packed... hard
          for scientists to predict the size
          or quantity striking the oceans...

          SGT. NANTZ
          They calling us.in because of these
          meteors, Lieutenant?

          LT. MARTINEZ
          I assume so... Maybe an evacuation.
          Whatever it is, it'll be good to
          get out in the field with the men.
          Nantz looks askance at this. Martinez catches it.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Look, Sergeant, let's be clear. I
          know your rep, know what you've
          done... But this is my unit. We're
          not gonna have a problem, are we?

          SGT. NANTZ
          No problem, sir. It's all yours.

          INT. ARMORY - DAY

          At numerous windows,. LINES OF MARINES hand in weapons cards,
          receiving their weapons in return. Among them...
          The marines from 1st Platoon of the 2/5 (Correggio and Kerns,
          Stavrou and Harris, Imlay and Lenihan, Adukwu), all watching:
          MOUNTED TELEVISIONS-- A WOMAN REPORTER, 20s, on a BEACH.
          Behind her, POLICE disperse thin CROWDS of PEOPLE, bullhorns
          blaring. A legend on the TV screen reads 'SANTA MONICA, CA.'
          PVT. MOTTOLA, squad radio man, tall and thin, listening to an
          IPOD, and PVT. GUERRERO, lumbering, eyes on the TV.

          PVT. MOTTOLA
          We never got a chance to finish the
          new mix, man. We were gonna add
          some metal to it...

          PVT. GUERRERO
          We'll have time later.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          The marines stare at the harried reporter on TV.

          REPORTER (ON TV)
          .National Guard troops have flown
          in to evacuate all surrounding
          beach areas...

          PVT. MOTTOLA

                         (TREPIDATION)
          Yeah... Later.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM / CAMP PENDLETON - LATER

          Nantz and Martinez crowd in among other SERGEANTS and
          LIEUTENANTS, the COMPANY CAPTAIN briefing them.

                         CAPTAIN
          These objects were completely
          undetected until they entered our
          atmosphere.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          So... what are they, Captain?

                         CAPTAIN
          We have no idea. But whatever they
          are, they're not hitting the water
          at terminal velocity. They're able
          to slow down before impact.
          Glances exchanged in the room now.

                         CAPTAIN
          This is no meteor shower. Homeland
          Security has bumped the threat
          level to red. Marines, we are the
          first line of defense. All units
          gear up, be ready to move.

          INT. ARMORY - LATER

          The young marines from 1st platoon are still in line for
          their weapons along with many OTHER MARINES. Some are
          nervously bullshitting, others intently watching...

                         THE TELEVISION:
          The REPORTER on the beach looks harried now as THICK SMOKE
          rolls in across the water. POLICE SIRENS wail in the b.g.

                         I

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

          REPORTER (ON TV)
          .some sort of smoke has appeared
          over the ocean now...

          CPL. HARRIS
          Hey, shut up. Shut up!
          Others quiet down now. All focus slowly shifting to...

                         THE TV:
          The reporter on the beach is cupping her earpiece.

          REPORTER (ON TV)
          I'm being told a Coast Guard cutter
          just issued a Mayday...
          The TV SHOT PANS to the WATER...
          The DISTANT CUTTER lists to one side, SINKING below the waves
          as indistinct DARK SHAPES clamber onto it from the water.

                         THE MARINES
          Push forward, scrambling to the TVs.

          PVT. KERNS
          What the hell are those things?!

          ON THE TV:
          The CUTTER DISAPPEARS behind the thick rolling SMOKE.
          The camera PANS back to the REPORTER, silently staring out.

          2/5 PARADE DECK / CAMP PENDLETON - SAME
          Crowded with MARINES, including squad leader Grayston, all
          getting ready. Or they were...
          Right now, ACTIVITY HAS CEASED. Marines silently stare at...

                         TELEVISIONS
          The REPORTER ON THE BEACH staring out, clearly panicked.

          REPORTER (ON TV)
          It appears... the cutter has...
          She stops, seeing the SMOKE reach the WATER'S EDGE. A HUSH
          falls over the CROWD as SMOKE rolls across the beach.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

          INT. HALLWAY / COMMAND BUILDING

          Formerly bustling... Now all OFFICERS and MARINES are frozen,
          crowding around open office doors, staring at...

                         TELEVISIONS
          As the REPORTER reacts to isolated SHOUTS echoing from the
          crowd on the beach. Some are pointing out to the ocean...

          REPORTER (ON TV)
          What is that...? In the water...
          The news cameraman PANS to the WATER as it begins to CHURN.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM / CAMP PENDLETON - SAME

          Nantz and Martinez stand among the other sergeants and
          lieutenants staring, stunned, at...

                         A TELEVISION:
          SCREAMS and panicked voices ring out from those ON THE BEACH
          now as INDISTINCT FIGURES appear from under the waves.
          PEOPLE RACE AWAY, plodding along the sand in hopeless flight
          as these FIGURES charge into the crowd...
          GUNSHOTS ring out, police shooting at the INDISTINCT FIGURES
          that appear, then disappear in the EVER-THICKENING SMOKE.
          MOVE IN ON NANTZ, staring at the TV as...
          The news cameraman RUNS away now, the PICTURE being
          transmitted growing shaky, indistinct, frenzied as...
          A DARK FIGURE appears, overruns the cameraman as...
          The NEWS CAMERA suddenly cuts to BLACK. In black, all we
          hear is SCREAMS echoing from the beach.

          EXT. CAMP PENDLETON AIR FIELD - MINUTES LATER

          All activity has doubled, a frantic energy now. TRUCKS race
          along the perimeter of the air field, massive CH-46
          HELICOPTERS TAKE OFF loaded with MARINE UNITS...
          The 1st platoon stands together, Lt. Martinez addressing them
          as ANOTHER CH-46 HELICOPTER is landing nearby.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          As you probably heard, Sgt. Nantz
          will be taking over for Sgt. Beck.
          We're lucky to have him aboard.
          The CH-46 helicopters TOUCHES DOWN now, its massive,, bay door
          opening for them. Martinez barks:

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Let's move, men!,
          The platoon grabs gear, runs for the helicopter, climbing
          aboard. Nantz hurries them along, grabbing packs, throwing
          them on after the marines.
          Then he grabs Correggio's pack, about to throw the pack on...
          Correggio grabs it back from Nantz.
          Nantz turns, faces off with Correggio.

          SGT. NANTZ
          You got something to get off your
          chest, Corporal?

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          No. It's cool, Sergeant. You got
          a Silver Star and my brother came
          home in a box. I get it.
          Beat.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Get aboard, Corporal.
          Correggio jumps into the chopper.

          INT. CH-46 TRANSPORT HELICOPTER - LATER

          IN FLIGHT. The marines, helmets on, packs between their
          knees, sit facing each other.
          The sound of the CH-46's massive rotors is deafening. Some
          shout over the din, too nervous to remain quiet.

          PVT. GUERRERO
          What the hell you think those
          things are?

          CPL. HARRIS
          Gotta be extraterrestrial.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

          PVT. IMLAY
          You mean, like, from space?!

          CPL. STAVROU
          No, Imlay. From Canada.
          Correggio looks down at his hand... Sees the GIRL'S PHONE
          NUMBER written on it.
          ACROSS THE DECK, Martinez huddles with Nantz, MAP in hand.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Santa Monica airport's our Forward
          Operating Base. We get some Cobras
          and F-18s in the air, we'll have
          plenty of support.
          Nantz nods. They're flying into the unknown and Martinez
          seems as nervous as the younger men.
          Kerns leans in to Nantz, desperately needing reassurance.

          PVT. KERNS
          How many a' them you think there
          are, Sergeant?
          Nantz just stares out, stone-faced.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We'll know soon enough, private.

          INT. CH-46 TRANSPORT HELICOPTER - LATER

          The marines are glued to the windows, shocked by what they're
          seeing as the chopper BANKS toward Venice/Santa Monica:
          FIRES raging from various explosions. In the distance,
          MASSIVE LINES of TRAFFIC moving away from the ocean.
          The STREETS bordering the beach look deserted-- Except for
          the BODIES dotting the landscape.
          Nantz looks at Martinez, who is hunched over, scribbling a
          LETTER. Martinez folds it, then writes the name ANNA on it.
          We realize it's a letter in the event of his death.
          Martinez stares at the letter. Then carefully tucks it away.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

          EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT/FORWARD OPERATING BASE - LATER

          The airport is being quickly transformed into a military
          base: MILITARY VEHICLES line the runway, more being driven
          from a nearby CARGO PLANE.
          The CH-46 LANDS.
          The platoon JUMPS OUT, squad leaders forming the men up as...
          Nantz and Martinez salute a CAPTAIN heading to them as F-18
          JETS take off, screaming overhead.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Lt. Martinez, sir. 1st Platoon of
          the 2/5.

                         CAPTAIN
          Situation is as follows: Most of
          Santa Monica is cleared of
          civilians. We've got a defensive
          line at Lincoln Boulevard a mile
          from the ocean...
          He points out LINCOLN BOULEVARD on a MAP, the OCEAN close by.

                         CAPTAIN
          At 9 p.m., everything from Lincoln
          to the ocean will be bombed.
          Martinez blanches.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          We're... leveling it, Captain?

                         CAPTAIN
          We've got an infestation of god-
          knows-what. It's an enemy ground
          force only, they have no aircraft.
          So our jets'll tear 'em a new
          asshole. We will rule the air.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          But... there must be civilians
          stuck behind the line, sir.

                         CAPTAIN
          That's affirm. We're getting
          distress calls, sending squads out.
          He points to the MAP, to streets running from Lincoln Blvd.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         CAPTAIN
          Your mission, Lieutenant, take your
          1st squad, proceed west from
          Lincoln to a community center
          located here...
          (pointing to map)
          In a park on 10th and Bay Street.
          Police were using it as an
          evacuation point. They got
          overrun. Get there, any civilians
          you find, get 'em back here to the
          FOB for evacuation. You got three
          hours.
          Another CHOPPER is LANDING. Nantz yells over the sound:

          SGT. NANTZ
          What do we know about these things,
          Captain?

                         CAPTAIN
          Not much. But police have shot
          'em. They bleed.
          The captain, hurrying to the next chopper, yells back:

                         CAPTAIN
          It's our job to kill 'em.

          EXT. STREET - LATER

          Nantz and Martinez are double-timing with the 1st squad (Cpl.
          Grayston, Correggio and Kerns, Stavrou and Harris, Imlay and
          Lenihan, Mottola and Guerrero, Simmons and Adukwu).
          As they approach Lincoln, they slow, eyes widening.
          REVERSE to see what they're staring at:
          LINCOLN BOULEVARD. Being fortified into a defensive line.
          MARINES are setting up sand-bagged MACHINE GUN NESTS in a
          parking lot fronting a nail shop and a China Express.
          Other MARINES hunker behind barricades in front of a Goodyear
          Tire Store, firing MORTARS toward the ocean.
          RUBBLE. BURNING BUILDINGS. Smashed-in storefronts. Cars
          CRASHED at intersections, the echoing WAIL of CAR ALARMS.
          Pockets of CIVILIANS are being waved forward by MARINES. A
          LITTLE GIRL with a Smurf backpack is rushed across Lincoln.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.
          Martinez turns, rallies the squad, most of whom look shocked.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Let's go, marines! Clock's
          running. Focus on the mission.
          We're gonna get to that community
          center and get those people safe.
          A COBRA ATTACK HELICOPTER screams overhead, firing into the
          distance. Martinez turns to Nantz, shouting over the din:

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Something to add, Sergeant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          (to the squad)
          Kill anything that's not human.

          EXT. 10TH STREET - LATER

          Nantz and Martinez lead the squad FROM LINCOLN onto 10th St.
          Various STRUCTURE FIRES are visible in the distance.
          The squad passes a FIRE TRUCK crashed against a fence, engine
          idling. FIREMEN lie near their hose lines, dead.
          Suddenly... BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Deep, deafening sounds
          exploding in the distance.
          The ground SHAKES from massive AFTERSHOCKS. Billowing SMOKE
          rumbles from the west. Ash rains,down, the sky turns black.
          The squad hunkers down, panicked looks exchanged.

          PVT. KERNS
          What the hell is that?!

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Keep it together. Watch your
          angles.
          The aftershocks fade. Ominous quiet again.
          The squad continues DOWN THE STREET.

          CPL. HARRIS
          Helluva way to get citizenship, eh,
          Daktari?

                         ADUKWU
          Shit, I'd rather be in Afghanistan.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.
          THICK SMOKE hangs in the air. The lack of visibility is
          clearly adding to the marines' fright.
          Numerous SHAPES become visible in the smoke.
          As the squad approaches slowly, the shapes become clear...
          BODIES splayed in the street.

          CPL. HARRIS
          Cherise and I were supposed to
          register at Bed, Bath & Beyond
          tonight...

          CPL. STAVROU
          Think you're gonna be busy, bro.
          Nantz points his rifle into a CRASHED PICKUP TRUCK. A BODY
          is slumped beneath the wheel.
          Simmons comes up behind Nantz. Peers into the truck:
          Sections of the BODY appear almost dissolved by a white
          phosphorous-like substance.

          PVT. SIMMONS
          What is that shit, Sergeant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          (caustic, dismissive)
          Something bad, private. Now get
          back with your team.

          PVT. KERNS
          Whoa, whoa... Contact! Twelve
          o'clock!
          A SHAPE is moving to them through the smoke.
          The marines aim, about to fire just as the smoke clears...
          A DOG. Standing there, staring mournfully at them.
          Nervous chuckles now. Correggio sidles up to Kerns.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Relax, man.
          Kerns just shoots him a look. The squad moves on.
          As they approach a SIDE STREET that intersects 10th...
          The DOG WHINES. Correggio pets it, trying to comfort it...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.
          But the dog suddenly RACES OFF, disappearing into the smoke.
          The marines spin, rifles up, growing unnerved...

          PVT. IMLAY
          What the hell...?

          CPL. HARRIS
          Something spooked that dog...
          Then Kerns sees the SMOKE SWIRLING DOWN THE SIDE STREET...
          As if something is racing through it.
          Kerns breaks formation, SPRINTS DOWN THE SIDE STREET, FIRING.

          PVT. KERNS
          Contact! Contact!
          Discipline shatters as the squad follows Kerns...

          DOWN THE SIDE STREET.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Marines! Hold your position!
          Kerns stops, spinning, looking. for targets, breath ragged,
          eyes panicked. Correggio races up.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          What'd you see?!
          Suddenly, the INDISTINCT FORM of an ALIEN CREATURE appears
          through the smoke, moving FAST down the side street.
          Kerns is ready, FIRING. The others react, FIRING as well.
          The ALIEN FORM is blasted, DROPPING into the smoke.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
          Everyone stops firing. Nantz gets in Kerns' face.

          SGT. NANTZ
          One enemy runs and you break
          discipline and chase it?!
          (to the others)
          Think, marines. Stay alive.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          The sergeant is right. Stay on
          course. We have a mission...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.
          Suddenly, the SHADOWY ALIEN FORM RISES again, darting off,
          disappearing into the smoke.
          The squad stares back, stunned.

          CPL. STAVROU

                         (QUIETLY)
          Holy shit.

          CPL. HARRIS
          How many rounds it take?

          CPL. STAVROU
          Enough.
          Correggio edges to Kerns, who's looking panicky.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          You okay?

          PVT. KERNS
          They're real, bro. I kept prayin'
          they wouldn't be...

          SGT. NANTZ
          Quiet.
          Nantz, unnerved himself, stares into the smoke...

          LT. MARTINEZ
          What is it, sergeant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          That thing running down the
          street... That was to draw us in...
          Slowly, fading in, we hear what Nantz hears now...
          A RUMBLING SOUND BEHIND THEM. Building. Nantz spins to it.

          SGT. NANTZ
          They're coming. We took the bait,
          now they're cutting us off.

          PVT. KERNS
          I can't see a goddamn thing!
          But the SOUND of their ADVANCE tells us there's many.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Light it up!
          The squad lets loose with a barrage of FIRE as...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.
          TRACER FIRE shoots back at the marines from the smoke.
          Glimpses of INDISTINCT FIGURES moving fast.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Mottola, get on the radio. See if
          we can get some air support.
          Mottola starts working the radio, trying to remain calm as.'..
          PROJECTILES EXPLODE in BRIGHT FLASHES around the marines.

          PVT. SIMMONS
          Contact front! Contact front!
          Correggio, frustrated, peers through the smoke.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          What are we shooting at?!

          PVT. MOTTOLA
          Lieutenant. Command says air power
          is totally committed. Enemy
          contact all over the area...
          Martinez stares back at this ominous news as...
          The MARINES FIRE back into the THICK SMOKE. But the enemy
          attack keeps INCREASING in ferocity.
          One PROJECTILE hits a wall above Lenihan. It EXPLODES, some
          kind of liquid splashing onto him. Lenihan grimaces.

          PVT. LENIHAN
          Ahh, shit! It's burning!
          His HELMET is being eaten away by the liquid. Imlay is
          immediately at Lenihan's side, pulling the helmet off.
          Lenihan's skin is blistering, oozing.

          PVT. LENIHAN

                         (PANICKED)
          My face, man...! How's my face?

          PVT. IMLAY
          Ugly as ever, bro.
          The squad hunkers down, trying to find any cover-available--
          behind cars, trees.
          Martinez drops BEHIND A CAR, pulls out his MAP, checking it
          for escape routes.-

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          Chaos as ENEMY TRACER FIRE increases, exploding around them.
          Martinez looks desperate, forced to FLEE FROM COVER by the
          alien fire.

          LT. MARTINEZ

                         (SHOUTS)
          Fall back! Here!
          He leads them further down the side street.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We can hold this position,
          Lieutenant!

          LT. MARTINEZ
          We're gonna get pinned down!

          SGT. NANTZ
          Sir, these things seem to be
          operating tactically! Don't let
          them dictate your decisions...

          LT. MARTINEZ

                         (SHOUTS)
          Move to live, marines!
          The squad follows Martinez, retreating...

          INTO A 'WALK' STREET.
          JUST A SIDEWALK separates the houses opposite each other.
          A moment. SILENCE. Nantz looks at the heavy FOLIAGE, dense
          SHRUBS and TREES on both sides. He knows:

          SGT. NANTZ
          It's an ambush. This is the kill
          zone!
          Nantz slings his COMBAT SHOTGUN forward.

          SGT. NANTZ

          FIRE!
          On Nantz' order, the SQUAD OPENS FIRE just as...
          ALIEN FIRE EXPLODES from the THICK COVER of bushes and trees.
          Nantz leads the brutal counterattack, PUMPING and FIRING his
          combat SHOTGUN.
          Martinez is shouting orders, directing the men as...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.
          Kerns backs against a fence, overwhelmed by the chaos. ; He
          aims, shoots. Then he freezes.
          Correggio steps in front of Kerns, firing to protect him.,
          Lenihan takes a hit from the enemy tracer fire explodingâ
          around the marines. He's blown back into thick bushes as...
          THE REST OF THE SQUAD battles fiercely.
          An alien PROJECTILE slams into Cpl. Grayston'S ARM. The
          SPRAY OF LIQUID bubbles out from the wound.
          Then something grabs Grayston through the bushes...
          Nantz sticks his SHOTGUN into the bushes, fires. BOOM. And
          Grayston is suddenly free. Nantz drags him into...

          THE FRONT YARD OF A HOUSE.
          The squad follows, Correggio pulling Kerns into the yard.

          THEY BACK TOWARD THE HOUSE.
          Guerrero, Imlay and Simmons lay down an awesome barrage with
          powerful SAWS (Squad Automatic Weapon), covering.the retreat.
          Trees and bushes are shredded, houses are splintered.
          All this mayhem allows the squad to...

          BARGE THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE.
          Pandemonium. The marines are sweaty, bleeding, scared.

          PVT. SIMMONS
          Jesus! Oh my God!

          CPL. STAVROU
          Keep your shit together!

          PVT. SIMMONS
          What the hell are those things?!

          CPL. HARRIS
          They're the goddamn enemy.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Yeah, and there's a million of 'em!

          PVT. SIMMONS
          Where'd they come from?! Why'd
          they come here?!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Everyone... just calm down.

          PVT. SIMMONS
          Calm down?! We keep shooting
          them... Why don't they die?!

          SGT. NANTZ
          Stow that shit, Private.
          (turns, to the others)
          Watch the yard. Secure the back.
          We're not dyin' here today.
          The marines take up firing positions at windows and doors.

          CORREGGIO EYES KERNS.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          You okay?
          Kerns stares back, deer in the headlights. He nods.
          ADUKWU IS WRAPPING GRAYSTON'S ARM as Grayston fumbles for a
          CIGARETTE. Adukwu lights it for him.

          CPL. GRAYSTON
          I know. These things'll kill me.
          Adukwu smiles. Grayston stares at his arm, ironically:

          CPL. GRAYSTON
          Hell, now that just ain't fair.
          Nantz moves to Martinez, who is staring down at the wounded
          Grayston and Guerrero.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Sir, what are your orders?
          Martinez turns, stares at Nantz.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          I led us right into that ambush.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Sir. Your orders.
          Beat. Martinez nods.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Let's figure out how we get out of
          here. We'll medevac the wounded
          from that park.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.
          Nantz nods, turns to Mottola.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Radio the FOB. Get us a medevac at
          that park by the community center.
          As Mottola works the radio, he's startled to see Guerrero,
          who has been SLASHED across both eyes.

          PVT. GUERRERO
          I can't see, Motorola.
          Mottola, horrified, steadies his voice.

          PVT. MOTTOLA
          You'll be okay.
          A slight beat. Then...

          PVT. GUERRERO
          You're one shitty liar, bro.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Hey, where the hell is Lenihan?!
          Everyone stops, stares.

          EXT. BACK YARD OF DIFFERENT HOUSE - SAME

          Lenihan, pressing a hand into his side, BLOOD oozing between
          his fingers, peers INTO THE BACK YARD at...
          A SWIMMING POOL, its water gently lapping. A GARAGE nearby.
          Lenihan, startled by the SOUND of ALIENS RUNNING in the alley
          behind the house, takes cover BY THE GARAGE.
          He struggles to remain calm. Then the sound FADES. He
          waits. Silence. Lenihan starts to edge,out as...
          A BANG rings out on the far side of the garage.
          Lenihan spins back behind cover, eyes desperately searching.

          INT. HOUSE - SAME

          Nantz shoulders his M-16. Martinez eyes him.

          SGT. NANTZ
          I'll go for Lenihan, sir.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          All right. We'll package the
          wounded, then rally on 10th street.

                         (TURNS)
          Mottola, Imlay. Go with the
          sergeant.
          The two quickly step to Nantz.

          PVT. IMLAY
          We got your six, Sergeant.
          Anything you need.

          SGT. NANTZ
          What I need is for you to keep
          quiet. And stay close.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Right. Got it. Quiet.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Starting now, Private.
          As Nantz turns, Mottola slaps Imlay in the helmet.

          INT. BACK YARD OF DIFFERENT HOUSE

          Lenihan creeps around the garage, spies a SIDE DOOR leading
          into it. He grabs the handle. Mercifully, the door opens.

          INT. DARK GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

          Lenihan falls INTO THE DARK GARAGE. Boxes and old furniture.
          Just one dirt-stained WINDOW on an opposite wall.
          Lenihan crouches in the dim light, coughs, spitting up blood.
          He turns on his radio, says into it:

          PVT. LENIHAN
          Motorola? You copy?
          His RADIO buzzes back with Nantz' voice:

          SGT. NANTZ (V.0.)
          Lenihan. This is Sgt. Nantz...

          PVT. LENIHAN
          Sergeant, Jesus, I had to turn the
          radio off..'. These things are
          everywhere!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

          EXT. ALLEY - SAME

          Nantz is MOVING, with Mottola and Imlay. covering.

          SGT. NANTZ

                         (INTO RADIO)
          We're coming for you, Lenihan.
          What's your location?

          INT. GARAGE - SAME

          Lenihan looks across the garage, out of the window...

          PVT. LENIHAN
          I'm in a garage... I can see two
          palm trees right next to it. House
          is white with black shutters...
          Just as something BANGS against the garage.

          SGT. NANTZ (V.0.)
          Is the house a two-story?
          Lenihan stares, his eyes going wide, panicked.

          SGT. NANTZ (V.O.)
          Lenihan, is the house a...?
          Lenihan CLICKS the radio OFF.
          Then waits, very still, listening, M-16 held tightly. His
          breathing turns shallow-- from loss of blood and from fear.
          Lenihan sees the BRANCHES of a bush SWAYING outside the
          window, as if something just brushed past it.

          EXT. STREET - SAME

          Nantz, Mottola and Imlay moving through the thick smoke...
          Nantz still trying to raise Lenihan on the radio.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Lenihan...? Lenihan...?
          Imlay taps Nantz on the shoulder, motions to his ears. He
          hears something...
          The marines freeze, Nantz clicking the radio off as...
          Nearby, they hear SOUNDS of aliens running... Somewhere...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.
          The marines crouch, weapons up, straining to see through the
          smoke. They remain stock still. Then...
          The sound fades into the distance.
          Nantz looks at the men. Motions. They creep forward as...

          INT. GARAGE - SAME

          Lenihan moves TO THE WINDOW, searching the garage floor,
          desperate not to step on anything that would make noise. He
          edges forward to peer through the dirty glass. Then...
          THUD THUD THUD. More NOISES... On the garage roof now.
          Lenihan looks up, panicked as...
          CRASH! The WINDOW suddenly CRASHES IN.
          Lenihan spins, FIRING wildly, lighting up the garage as...
          He stumbles to the door, fumbling for the handle, falling...

          EXT. BACK YARD OF HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          .OUT OF THE GARAGE. Lenihan staggers back, eyes darting
          along the garage roof, gun aimed.
          Nothing there.
          As Lenihan continues backing away, peering through the
          drifting smoke at the garage, he's unaware that BEHIND him...

          A SHADOWY ALIEN FORM IS RISING FROM THE POOL.
          Lenihan doesn't see it, but he senses it. He turns, FIRES...
          A SPLASH as the shadowy alien figure is blasted back INTO THE
          POOL, disappearing under the water.
          Quickly, nervously, he loads another mag, edging to the pool.
          He peers over the pool edge...
          An indiscernible DARK FORM lays on the bottom of the pool.
          Lenihan is transfixed a moment. Then he raises his rifle to
          punch more rounds into the thing as...
          WHOOOM! The creature launches OUT OF THE WATER!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.
          BLISTERING GUNFIRE! As Nantz, Mottola and Imlay burst into
          the yard. They fire, as does Lenihan.
          The fusillade of bullets tears the creature up.
          The marines STOP FIRING as the alien falls to the ground.
          They stare amazed at the 7 ft. tall ALIEN CORPSE... Rigid
          skeleton bursting out of its skin, some strange layer of
          machinery intertwined with its flesh.

          CPL. MOTTOLA
          Oh my God... What the hell are
          these things?

          PVT. IMLAY
          They're butt ugly, that's what they
          are.
          Nantz grabs onto Lenihan, noticing his wound.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We're gonna get you to the medevac,
          Private.

          PVT. LENIHAN
          Thank you, Sergeant. Thanks for
          coming for me.

          SGT. NANTZ
          But Lenihan...

          PVT. LENIHAN
          Yes, Sergeant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          Ever get separated from your unit
          again, I'll find you and shoot you
          myself.

          PVT. LENIHAN
          Yes, Sergeant.
          Imlay slings Lenihan's arm around his shoulder and they're
          instantly moving, RUNNING FROM THE YARD.

          EXT. SIDE STREET - MOMENTS LATER

          The men meet up with the others. Adukwu and Kerns carrying
          Grayston on a litter, Simmons holding onto the blinded
          Guerrero, guiding him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          All right, let's get to the
          community center...
          They head off, Simmons still supporting Guerrero as THWACK!
          An alien projectile slams INTO SIMMONS' THROAT. Choking, he
          CRUMPLES to the ground. Guerrero stands, blind, helpless.
          Panic. The marines spin, searching for targets.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Move! Grab Simmons! Go, go!
          Stavrou hoists Simmons as the marines run off, FIRING to
          cover their retreat, as...
          The SILHOUETTES of DARK ALIEN FORMS are visible on distant
          rooftops, watching the rifle squad disappear down the street.

          EXT. STREET - LATER

          Nantz, Martinez and the rest of the squad hustle silently
          through the street, supporting their wounded. They take
          cover behind cars, peering out to see...
          The PARK in the distance. A wide open FIELD with a COMMUNITY
          CENTER BUILDING on the far side.
          There are distant sounds of warfare, but the area here seems
          strangely quiet.
          Then, out of the smoke, an IMAGE APPEARS... Something MOVING

          AT THEM...
          The marines all shift, aim forward, about to blast away as...
          FOUR MARINES come into view, moving ghost-like.
          Nantz signals with his flashlight. The marines hurry over,
          silently falling behind the cars.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          You guys are 2/5?

                         MARINE
          2nd squad, 3rd platoon...

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Where's the rest of your unit?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         MARINE
          This is it, Lieutenant. Everyone
          else is dead or missing.
          The news hits Martinez hard. He eyes Nantz.

                         MARINE
          We were on the street, like, ten
          minutes and they ambushed us. As
          soon as we radioed for help, it's
          like they were everywhere...

          PVT. MOTTOLA

                         (ON RADIO)
          Medevac's incoming, lieutenant.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          All right. Stay with us.
          And the squad moves out...

          EXT. PARK - MOMENTS LATER

          A large FIELD stretches from the street to a squat BUILDING,
          the COMMUNITY CENTER.
          The specter of LIGHTS is thrown onto the field, an other
          worldly effect until we realize the lights are coming from...

          A MEDEVAC HELICOPTER
          Descending steadily, its thundering rotors whipping the air..

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Load the wounded. Sgt. Nantz, Cpl.
          Harris-- let's find the civilians.
          Martinez, Nantz and Harris run to the community center as...
          The WOUNDED are hustled to the CHOPPER as it TOUCHES DOWN.

          INT. LOBBY OF COMMUNITY CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          The marines burst in, looking around. To the right, a GYM.
          To the left, a HALLWAY with numerous side rooms off of it.

          SGT. NANTZ
          U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines!
          A clattering. The marines immediately move toward it,
          peering down the dark hall...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          Then the DOOR to a side room OPENS to reveal...
          A WOMAN, MICHELE, 28, staring out, looking shell-shocked.

          SGT. NANTZ
          How many of you?
          A MAN, JOE RINCON, 45, jacket and tie, behind her.

                         MICHELE
          There's five of us. Three kids.
          Nantz is immediately moving.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Where? Where are the kids?
          He pushes past the adults, sees TWO GIRLS AND A BOY, 8-10.

          EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD

          The marines run up to the chopper with the wounded. INSIDE
          THE MEDEVAC they see WOUNDED laid across the helicopter's
          cabin. A CREWMAN in the medevac yells over the din:

                         CREWMAN
          You called in with two wounded!

          PVT. IMLAY
          We got four!

                         CREWMAN
          Can't take four! We have no room!

          CPL. STAVROU
          Make goddamn room!
          A beat. The crewman relents in the face of Stavrou's
          impressive bulk, tries to make room.
          Imlay and Stavrou get Simmons and Grayston on.
          Mottola helps Guerrero in, squeezing his hand.

          PVT. GUERRERO
          I'll work on that mix for you.

          PVT. MOTTOLA
          Thanks, dude. Think I'm gonna need
          it.
          Lenihan crawls onto the chopper's deck with Imlay's help.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

          PVT. IMLAY

                         (SMILES)
          You just had to get outta the shit.
          Lenihan smiles back.

                         CREW CHIEF
          Now! We're moving now!
          Imlay bumps fists with Lenihan, backs away as...

          EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz runs out with the BOY. Followed by Martinez and
          Harris, hustling the two GIRLS out.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Wait! Stavrou, hold it! KIDS!
          Stavrou tries to hold the chopper, screaming at it as...

          THE MEDEVAC RISES.
          Nantz, Martinez and Harris run to the chopper with the kids.
          The marines around the medevac are screaming up at it, trying
          to hold it, but to no avail.
          The CHOPPER GAINS ALTITUDE as suddenly...
          BOOM! A SHOCK WAVE OF ENERGY FIRES from the west as...
          The MEDEVAC takes a DIRECT HIT.
          The devastating energy wave blasts it END-OVER-END...
          The massive helicopter CRASHES INTO A HOUSE blocks away,
          exploding, as...
          Nantz turns ominously as an unearthly BUZZING SOUND FADES IN.
          LIGHTS are ADVANCING from a street leading to the field.
          As the SOUND and LIGHTS BUILD, Nantz runs to the other
          marines to get them off that field.
          He pulls on them, urging them to the COMMUNITY CENTER doors.
          They REACH THE COMMUNITY CENTER, fall into it just as...
          Glowing through the heavy cover of smoke... The STROBING
          LIGHTS of some strange ALIEN AIRCRAFT zooming overhead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.
          Speeding toward Lincoln. FIRING PULSING WAVES OF ENERGY,
          lighting up the distant sky.

          INT. COMMUNITY CENTER LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

          The marines and civilians fall into the large entryway. The
          marines are breathing hard, looking stunned.

          PVT. KERNS
          Goddamn flying saucers now...?!

                         ADUKWU
          All those guys on the chopper...

          PVT. IMLAY
          Why'd those bastards have to come
          down here and start this shit?!

          SGT. NANTZ
          That is not relevant, Imlay!
          They're here. They're trying to
          kill us. Kill them first!
          Martinez eyes Nantz on this. Then barks orders:

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Secure the perimeter! Stavrou,
          give me an ammo check. Cpl.
          Correggio, take three men, set up
          an Observation Post on the roof.

          SGT. NANTZ
          You heard the lieutenant. Move!
          The dazed marines begin COVERING doors and hallways. We see
          in their FACES that it's a very different fight now.
          Nantz turns, can see the MEDEVAC ABLAZE out a window. His
          solemn stare hints at a growing desperation.
          Martinez steps up to him, looks out. Quietly:

          LT. MARTINEZ
          They got air power, too... Knocked
          that medevac right out of the sky.
          So much for ruling the air.
          Nantz just keeps staring out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Listen, Sergeant. These men are
          scared. A little compassion would
          go a long way...
          Nantz turns on Martinez now.

          SGT. NANTZ
          How's that gonna help them survive,
          Lieutenant?

                         (BEAT)
          I'll lead these marines. But don't
          ask me to get close to them.
          Nantz walks off.

          INT. COMMUNITY CENTER LOBBY - MINUTES LATER

          Marines on post, watching various windows and doors.
          Imlay kneels by the kids, who look devastated by the day's
          events. Imlay wets a rag with water from his canteen, wiping
          the dust and dirt from the kids' faces.
          The younger girl, KIRSTEN, 8, begins crying. She suddenly
          hugs Imlay.
          Imlay, startled by this, looks uncomfortable at first. Then
          hugs the little girl back, smiling at the older.girl, ANY,
          10, Kirsten's sister.

                         AMY
          You're not gonna leave us, are you?
          A beat. Then Imlay smiles.

          PVT. IMLAY
          No way, sweetheart.
          The woman, Michele McDermott, is clearly rattled, struggling
          for composure, eyes constantly moving to the kids.
          Mr. Rincon, a calm, watchful air about him, stands with his
          son, HECTOR, the kid who Nantz had carried to the chopper.

                         RINCON
          My son and I came here... There
          were only three cops, spread pretty
          thin... Then those things attacked.
          Police couldn't stop them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

          SGT. NANTZ
          What happened to everyone?

                         RINCON
          I don't know. Most people ran. We
          hid in a side room, found Michele
          and the girls... Couldn't see what
          happened. Just heard... Screams.

                         MICHELE
          I have my nieces for the week. My
          sister and her husband are in
          Hawaii for their anniversary... Is
          it safe there? I heard this is
          happening in other places...
          Martinez is at a loss for words.

                         MICHELE
          What do they want from us? Why are
          they here?

          LT. MARTINEZ
          I...don't know. Right now, our job
          is just to get you to safety, okay?
          Harris appears from the hallway.

          CPL. HARRIS
          Lieutenant, something you should
          see...

          EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER / BACK DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

          The door opens. Nantz and Martinez edge out with Harris. As
          they peer into the smoke drifting past the building, an IMAGE
          becomes clear...
          An ALIEN BODY. On the ground nearby. Ripped by bullets.
          They step to it cautiously, realizing... IT'S NOT QUITE DEAD!
          The alien MOVES, turning as if to stare back at them.
          Without a word, Nantz lifts his rifle, shoots it in the head.

          INT. COMMUNITY CENTER LOBBY - SAME

          Hector sits with Kirsten and Amy, digging candy Nerds out of
          his backpack. He turns to the other kids, holding the box
          out. Both kids reflexively accept handfuls of candy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         44
          Then Hector notices Imlay standing nearby.

                         HECTOR
          Want some Nerds?
          Imlay holds his hand out. Hector shakes candy into it as...
          Nantz enters, calling to Adukwu:

          SGT. NANTZ
          Adukwu, bring your kit.
          Adukwu is immediately up, moving to Nantz.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We're gonna cut one of these things
          open. See if we can figure out
          what makes 'em tick.
          Michele overhears, offering:

                         MICHELE
          Maybe I can help, sergeant. I'm a
          vet...

          SGT. NANTZ
          You're a veteran?

                         MICHELE
          (can't help but smile)
          No, a veterinarian.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Oh... Okay. Well, thanks, um...
          Nantz has forgotten her name. She smiles.

                         MICHELE
          Michele.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Right. Michele.
          (smiles, embarrassed))
          Sorry.
          Mottola walks up.

          PVT. MOTTOLA
          Sergeant. Can't raise anybody on
          the radio. We're cut off.
          Off Nantz' look...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

          EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER ROOFTOP

          Kerns, Correggio and TWO 2nd SQUAD MARINES are on watch,
          peering down to the street from opposite sides of the roof.
          All on edge, exhausted, dirty. No one says a word.
          Correggio eyes the other marines. They exchange an 'all-
          clear' sign. Then Correggio pulls up a radio.

          CPL. CORREGGIO

                         (INTO RADIO)
          O.P. reporting. We're clear up
          here.
          Correggio and Kerns look over the destroyed streets, smoke
          and flames rising from buildings in the distance, glimpses of
          white phosphorous raining down. A beat, then...

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          .fucking aliens.
          Kerns looks at Correggio, starts to chuckle at the absurdity
          of it all. Then Correggio laughs. It's infectious. It's
          desperate. Then the laughter slows. Stops.

          PVT. KERNS
          You think those things get scared?
          They're probably just grunts like
          us. Probably dumped into battle,
          told to go fight...
          Kerns looks out... The constant thud and crack of warfare...
          A city crumbling. V

          PVT. KERNS
          I thought I could handle it...

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          You are handling it. Thing I'm
          worried about is Nantz.

          PVT. KERNS
          Sergeant saved our ass at that
          ambush... He knows what he's doing.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Yeah? Tell my brother that.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.6 .

          INT. SIDE ROOM / COMMUNITY CENTER - LATER

          Nantz enters with Michele and Adukwu. Stavrou and Harris are
          in the room with Martinez. They step aside, revealing... The
          ALIEN BODY on the floor.
          Michele stops, stares. She and Adukwu are both taken aback
          at the sight of one of these things up close.

          SGT. NANTZ
          You sure you can do this?

                         MICHELE
          I was more sure two minutes ago.
          She looks to Adukwu. They step to the body together as...
          Nantz approaches Martinez.

          SGT. NANTZ
          What's the plan, Lieutenant?

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Mission is still to get the
          civilians to the Forward Operating
          Base. We've got a battalion there,
          all that firepower... I was
          thinking, I saw a bus couple of
          blocks back on 11th...

          SGT. NANTZ
          Maybe we should stay on foot.
          Martinez looks at Nantz. Then opens a MAP, pointing to
          'Santa Monica Airport' on it.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          The FOB is here, at the airport...
          That's miles to cover with those
          kids... And those bombs are gonna
          drop in a little more than an hour.
          (thinking, deciding)
          We've got to move fast.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We have no radio contact, nothing
          to let us know the best route to
          take... And a bus is a big target.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          I made the call, Sergeant. It's my
          responsibility.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.
          Beat. Then Nantz nods, turns.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Harris, Stavrou, lieutenant needs
          recon on a.bus. It was abandoned
          two blocks south off 11th...

          LT. MARTINEZ
          If it runs, get it back here.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Can you hotwire a bus?

          CPL. HARRIS
          (gestures to Stavrou)
          He's from Jersey, sergeant.
          A nod from Nantz on this.

          EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER ROOFTOP - MINUTES LATER

          Correggio and Kerns are surveying the street. Correggio
          pulls the RADIO up, talks quietly into it:

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Stavrou, Harris...

          INT. EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER - SAME

          Stavrou and Harris peer out an EXTERIOR DOOR as they hear
          Correggio (V.0.) from the RADIO:

           CPL. CORREGGIO (V.0.)
           .you're clear down 11th Street.
          They exchange a quick glance.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Every day a holiday, buddy...

          CPL. HARRIS
          .every meal a feast.
          They slip outside, running off silently.

          EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER ROOFTOP - SAME

          Correggio and Kerns watch Harris and Stavrou run down the
          street, covering them with their M-16s.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

          INT. SIDE ROOM - LATER

          Adukwu and Michele, scalpels in hand, hover over the alien
          body. Its thick leathery skin has been sliced open.
          Martinez and Nantz observe, Imlay on post nearby.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          How's it going?

                         ADUKWU
          Well, Lieutenant, I'm a medic, Dr.
          McDermott's a vet... We weren't
          sure who was most qualified to cut
          this thing open.
          Martinez smiles.

                         ADUKWU
          Look. It's been surgically
          modified...
          He pulls tissue aside, revealing where the alien's 'gun' is
          attached to its arm.

                         ADUKWU
          Part of its arm has been amputated
          to fit this weapon.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Talk about commitment to cause.
          Adukwu examines a VENTED CAP just to the right of where the
          alien's 'heart' would be. Thick, fleshy veins run from it.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          What is that thing?

          PVT. IMLAY
          He's from Nigeria, Lieutenant. Not
          a different solar system.
          Nantz looks over at Imlay.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Thank you, private.
          Adukwu twists the cap. It comes free, revealing...
          A GELATINOUS ORGAN. Slimy, viscous fluid seeping from it..
          Everyone steps back, reacting to the putrid smell.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Whoa, that stinks!
          Everyone steps back except Michele, that is. Unfazed, she
          takes her scalpel, makes an INCISION across the organ.

          PVT. IMLAY
          I'm gonna puke. Swear to God, I'm
          gonna puke!

          SGT. NANTZ
          Whatever you do, do it quietly,
          Imlay.

          EXT. STREET - SAME

          Stavrou forces the door of a METRO BUS open, climbs INTO THE
          BUS, ducking below the steering wheel as...
          Harris covers, staring off to the FAR STREET. Tree branches
          there cast LONG SHADOWS which sway with the breeze. Then...
          The indistinct FORM of an ALIEN scout appears in the shadows.

          CPL. HARRIS
          Hey, Stavs...

          CPL. STAVROU
          Relax. First thing I wired was a
          school bus. Trying to impress this
          Betty. She had a huge rack...

          CPL. HARRIS
          Enemy scout. Move your ass.
          Stavrou doesn't look up. Just works diligently.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Don't rush genius.

          EXT. ROOF - SAME

          Correggio and Kerns remain still, peering into the distance.

          PVT. KERNS
          Shit. You seeing what I'm seeing?
          Correggio pulls BINOCULARS...
          POV THROUGH BINOCULARS: A SIDE STREET, TREES overhanging it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.
          Movement. ALIEN SHAPES massing on the side street.
          Appearing and disappearing through the smoke and trees.
          Then the POV THROUGH BINOCULARS PANS to pick-up...
          The BUS. Nearby. In the path of the alien movement.
          Correggio grabs the RADIO. Says:

          CPL. CORREGGIO

                         (INTO RADIO)
          Harris. Movement, 1500 meters up
          11th.
          Suddenly, a loud BANG rings out below them.

          PVT. KERNS
          What the hell was that?!
          They exchange glances with the other marines across the roof.
          All four move quickly, converging on one side of the
          building, look down the side of it...
          An EXTERIOR DOOR leading into the center is BROKEN OPEN.

          INT. COMMUNITY CENTER SIDE ROOM - SAME

          Michele finishes her incision, carefully PEELS A SECTION OF

          THE ORGAN BACK.
          Something vaguely METALLIC is revealed within it.
          As Michele touches her scalpel to it, it SPARKS.
          Then starts rhythmically GLOWING.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Looks like it's receiving a
          signal...
          Suddenly, the ORGAN CONVULSES rapidly. Expanding,
          contracting.
          Nantz sees the ALIEN'S GUN VIBRATING now, the whole arm
          TWITCHING, spreading through the alien's body like a seizure.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          This thing's still alive!
          Nantz pulls his KA-BAR FIGHTING KNIFE, thrusting it DEEP INTO
          THE ORGAN, twisting viciously.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.
          The organ stops vibrating. The glow fades. The body slumps.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Not so hard to kill when you know
          where to aim.
          Mottola appears in the room, a sense of controlled panic.

          PVT. MOTTOLA
          Lieutenant. There's a breach.

          INT. HALLWAY / COMMUNITY CENTER - SECONDS LATER

          The marines step from the side room with Michele. They peer
          up and down the dark hallway, listening...
          OTHER DOORS along the hall take on an ominous presence now.

          SGT. NANTZ

                         (LOW)
          They in the building?

          PVT. MOTTOLA
          No clue, Sergeant. An exterior
          door was broken open.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Lieutenant. Maybe we should gather
          the civilians in the gym.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Good idea, Sergeant.

          INT. / EXT. BUS - SAME

          Stavrou, still beneath the wheel. Harris, eyes on the street
          as the RADIO crackles with Correggio's VOICE:

          CPL. CORREGGIO (V.0.)
          Harris, hostiles advancing right at
          you. Approximately two hundred
          meters and closing...

          CPL. STAVROU
          Done!
          Stavrou hops into the driver's seat, tries to start the bus.
          It doesn't turn over.
          Harris and Stavrou exchange a quick glance. Stavrou drops
          below the wheel again...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

          INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

          More ominous BANGS ring out from down the long hallway,
          BUILDING in intensity.
          Nantz stands, staring DOWN THE DARK HALL with his M-16,
          surprised as Martinez steps up next to him.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          We're in it together, Sergeant.
          Martinez slams a grenade into his launcher now.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          C'mon, Mottola. Get that bus here!
          Mottola is on the radio, frantic:

          PVT. MOTTOLA
          Where the hell is that bus?!

          INT. BUS - SAME

          Stavrou is still underneath the wheel. Harris looks out to
          see ALIENS rounding the corner in the distance.

          CPL. HARRIS
          Get this thing started.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Hey, why didn't I think a' that?

          INT. COMMUNITY CENTER LOBBY - SAME

          CRACK! Down the hall, the sound of a door splintering...

          SGT. NANTZ
          We're out of time!
          Martinez looks INTO THE GYM, sees the kids staring back.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Go! Get 'em out!
          Imlay swings the GYM DOOR OPEN, moving the civilians out.

          IN THE LOBBY
          Nantz and Martinez stand together, aiming at the hall as...
          A final BANG... We hear a door being BURST OPEN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.
          Nantz, in the front, exchanges a glance with Martinez at the
          ominous sight of...
          A PLUME OF BLACK SMOKE rising in the distance.

          THEY SPIN ONTO LINCOLN BOULEVARD.
          Screech to a halt at the obstacle course of BATTLE WRECKAGE
          strewn across the street.
          Noxious BLACK SMOKE is rising from BURNING HUMVEES and
          TRUCKS. Smoking CRATERS pothole the street.

          LT. MARTINEZ

                         (SHOCKED)
          Jesus Christ. Those alien ships
          took the whole line out.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We've got forty minutes 'til they
          level this area.

          LT. MARTINEZ

                         (TO STAVROU)
          Get us to the Forward Operating
          Base. Fast.
          Stavrou lays on the gas, speeding away as, in the back, the
          other marines stare out. Mottola peers into the sky...'

          PVT. MOTTOLA
          Where the hell are all our jets?

          EXT. BUS (MOVING) - SIDE STREETS, SANTA MONICA

          The bus snakes through jammed streets, abandoned cars, bombed
          out buildings.

          INT. BUS -SAME

          Martinez is in the front with Stavrou, Nantz in the middle of
          the bus, hovering near the civilians sitting on the floor.
          Rincon holds Hector, Michele with her arms around both girls.
          Marines on the seats above, weapons ready.
          Nantz hears Imlay whispering to Harris:

          PVT. IMLAY
          Why the hell'd the lieutenant wanna
          take a bus? We're sittin' ducks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

          SGT. NANTZ
          (low, hard)
          The call's been made, private. You
          so eager to decide the fate of all
          these people?
          Imlay is stone silent.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Didn't think so.
          Then Nantz looks up, meeting eyes with Martinez as...
          A NOISE in the distance now. A low VIBRATION, building.
          Nantz moves to Martinez. They peer out of the front.
          LIGHTS fill the sky, heading east. As they approach...
          The VIBRATION gets louder and louder, shaking the bus now.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Everybody get down, weapons inside
          the bus. Make no noise.
          The men pull their guns in from the windows, crouching as low
          as possible, straining to see, hear...
          The vibrations grow louder, LOUDER! Suddenly... WHOOSH!
          An ALIEN AIRCRAFT rips overhead.
          Then another, and another, and another... All heading east.
          The image of their speed, their power, their other-
          worldliness is overwhelming, devastating.
          Nantz stares, relief flooding his face, as the armada flies
          on. Leaving them behind. Until...
          Suddenly, Mottola's RADIO BLARES!

                         COMMAND

                         (FROM RADIO)
          All stations this net, urgent
          traffic. Multiple enemy aircraft
          moving east...
          As the transmission rings out, Nantz looks up to see...
          One ALIEN SHIP split from the armada, TURN BACK TO THE BUS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          It's coming back...!
          The children scream, marines agitated... all hear a low
          vibration, echoing off buildings, heading their way.

          SGT. NANTZ
          (staring at the radio,

                         REALIZING)
          Kill that radio!
          Mottola turns off the radio.
          The alien aircraft STOPS. Hovers a moment.

          SGT. NANTZ
          They're tracking our signals! All
          radios, cell phones-- keep
          everything off!
          Everyone stares silently, tensely. Then...
          A single BEAM OF LIGHT suddenly shines from the alien craft.
          Then the alien aircraft MOVES FORWARD again. Slowly. But
          still heading their way.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          It's still coming... It's
          searching...
          Nantz grabs a PORTABLE RADIO.
          He looks around the bus, sees the little girl, Kirsten,
          ponytail in her hair. He leans down to her.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Hi. Could I have your, uh, hair
          thing?
          She stares, wide-eyed, at this fearsome, sweating marine.

                         KIRSTEN
          My... pony holder?
          Nantz nods. She pulls the PONY TAIL HOLDER from her hair,
          hands it to Nantz. He smiles. Briefly. Heads to the front.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Anything happens, Lieutenant, get
          the SAWS up front and take off with
          these kids.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Sergeant...

          BUT NANTZ IS OUT OF THE BUS.

          EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz runs down the street with the radio under his arm.
          Heading toward a GAS STATION.
          Nantz glances back, sees... The ALIEN AIRCRAFT SEARCHING the
          street below, getting closer and closer to the bus as...

          INT. BUS (STOPPED) - CONTINUOUS

          Amy and Kirsten pressed under seats, Michele covering them
          up... Hector closing his eyes in his dad's arms...
          The marines duck low, gripping their weapons.
          They hear the aircraft coming closer, almost above them.
          LIGHT starts shining through the windows as...

          EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz, almost to the gas station, wraps the pony tail holder
          around the radio, looks back to see.
          The ALIEN AIRCRAFT STOP, HOVERING OVER THE BUS!
          Shining lights into it, scanning, scanning...

          INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

          Hector's eyes widen, staring up at the light. Michele pulls
          the girls in closer, trying to calm them, herself.

                         MICHELE

                         (WHISPERING)
          It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be
          okay, it's all gonna be okay.
          Everyone freezes as the BEAM reflects off the walls, filling
          the space with a horrible bright light, exposing them as...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

          EXT. STREET BY GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz presses the "Push to Talk" button on the radio as...
          The alien craft suddenly TURNS in NANTZ' DIRECTION.
          Nantz wraps the pony tail holder around the radio, keeping
          the button on it depressed so it's SENDING A CONSTANT SIGNAL.
          He slides the radio toward one of the GAS PUMPS...
          Keeps moving, diving BEHIND A VAN across the street.
          Nantz peers around it, sees...
          The alien aircraft HEADING FOR THE GAS STATION, descending.
          Nantz slams a grenade into the launcher on his M-16.
          The alien aircraft zooms at the gas pumps, its unearthly hum
          growing louder and louder as...

          NANTZ FIRES THE GRENADE.
          The GAS PUMP EXPLODES! A MASSIVE FIREBALL HITS THE ALIEN

          CRAFT!
          Nantz flattens himself to the street as...
          The ALIEN AIRCRAFT, trailing smoke and flames, thunders out
          of control RIGHT OVER HIM...
          Then CRASHES into a building... BLOWING APART!

          INT. BUS (STOPPED) - CONTINUOUS

          Marines ducking, civilians screaming as...
          DEBRIS from the alien ship BLOWS OVER THE BUS, burning pieces
          falling to the ground...

          EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz runs out from behind the van, checks the remains of the
          burning alien aircraft, rifle raised.
          NO ALIEN inside. The ship is a DRONE.
          Nantz takes this in, then starts back for the bus.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

          INT. BUS (STOPPED) - SAME

          Nantz runs back onto the bus as Stavrou pulls swiftly away.

          SGT. NANTZ

                         (TO MARTINEZ)
          That ship was an unmanned drone,
          lieutenant. And that alien we cut
          open had something in it receiving
          signals... They must have one
          helluva command and control center.
          Martinez pulls his map out, eyes Nantz.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          That was some real John Wayne shit,
          Sergeant.
          Nantz tries to shrug it away. But Martinez nails him.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Don't do it again. We work as a
          team, Sergeant. We clear?
          Beat. Nantz nods.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We're clear, Lieutenant.
          Nearby, Imlay whispers to Mottola:

          PVT. IMLAY
          Who's John Wayne?
          Martinez looks up from the map, turns to Stavrou.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Take the freeway, Corporal. Cuts
          half the distance off our drive.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Sir. We get on that freeway, we'll
          be exposed...

          LT. MARTINEZ
          It doesn't seem like we're much
          safer out here. We've got two
          shitty options-- I'm choosing the
          one that gets us there fastest.
          (then, quietly)
          We don't want to be in this area
          when the bombs start to fall.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

          EXT. STREET BY FREEWAY - MINUTES LATER

          The bus bangs past a few stalled cars, cruising up a ramp,
          onto the freeway.

          INT. BUS (MOVING) - 10 FREEWAY - SAME

          Martinez and Nantz crouch near the front, keeping watch.
          From this elevated vantage point on the freeway, the big
          picture emerges IN THE DISTANCE:
          The BATTLE FRONT is moving east... A DEFENSIVE LINE of TANKS
          is visible, blasting away at aliens.
          SWARMS of DRONE AIRCRAFT engage F-18 JETS flying at them.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Jesus...

                         (TO STAVROU)
          Double time, Corporal.
          The bus barrels forward, careening BETWEEN CARS, knocking
          some out of the way.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Take the next exit. Head south.
          We're two clicks from the FOB.
          The bus drives onto the shoulder, past the sea of abandoned
          cars, heading to the off-ramp.
          Nantz appears uneasy. They are exposed on this freeway and
          he doesn't like it.
          He MOVES TO THE BACK, peering out windows, checking angles.
          Michele looks up as he passes, sees a GASH on Nantz' head.

                         MICHELE
          Your head, Sergeant. You're
          bleeding.
          Nantz touches his head, looks at the blood. He wipes it on
          his pants. Michele smiles at him softly.

                         MICHELE
          Bet when you woke up this morning,
          you didn't think your day would end
          up like this.

          SGT. NANTZ
          That's a pretty safe bet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Hostiles. Back up. Now, go!
          Stavrou guns the BUS BACKWARDS, knocking abandoned cars out
          of the way...

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Guess you were right, Sergeant.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Incoming! Down! Down! Down!
          A projectile EXPLODES next to the bus! Sending CARS FLYING!
          SHRAPNEL TEARS A GIANT HOLE through the side of the bus.
          TWO 2nd SQUAD MARINES are instantly killed, blown clear out
          of the hole. Civilians screaming...
          Stavrou hits the gas, BACKING THE BUS UP the best he can.
          An ILLUMINATION heading toward them... BOOM!
          Another projectile DESTROYS AN OVERPASS behind the bus!
          Trapped. And ALIENS are STREAMING AT THEM in the distance.
          Stavrou works the shift, grinding gears, gunning the bus...
          BEHIND A CONCRETE DIVIDER close by the COLLAPSED OFF-RAMP.
          The off-ramp now dangles precariously: a 15-foot cliff-face
          of missile-scarred concrete and re-bar.
          Martinez looks over to Nantz, not sure what to do...

          SGT. NANTZ
          (to Martinez, low)
          Let's dismount, set up a perimeter,
          get the civilians down to the
          street.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Stavrou, get down that ramp, secure
          the street! Kerns, Adukwu, help
          get the civilians off the freeway.
          Stavrou starts off the bus for the broken off-ramp.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Harris, Imlay, give us overwatch up
          on the roof. The rest of you push
          out 20 meters, set up a perimeter.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

          SGT. NANTZ
          And don't forget, aim chest, right!
          Imlay joins Harris, SMASHING THE SKYLIGHT out of the bus
          roof, CLIMBING OUT, taking position on the bus' roof.
          The rest of the marines EXIT THE BUS. Nantz grabs Adukwu.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Stay here with the civilians. As
          soon as Stavrou gives the sign, get
          them down to the street!
          Adukwu nods. Nantz starts off the bus.

                         HECTOR
          (looks up at Nantz)
          Are we gonna die?
          Nantz turns back to Hector. Manages a smile.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Course not, kid, we're the good
          guys.
          And Nantz is off the bus.

          EXT. BUS ROOF

          Imlay and Harris, prone, propped on their elbows, Imlay
          scanning through binoculars, sees...
          30-40 ALIEN FIGHTERS coming their way.

          PVT. IMLAY
          I got about three dozen hostiles,
          twelve o'clock. 300 meters now.
          Coming fast.

          EXT. 10 FREEWAY - SAME

          Nantz stands with Martinez at the concrete barrier. Nantz'
          scans the marines' positions.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Prepare to repel. Fix bayonets!
          This might get up-close and
          personal!
          Just a low CLATTERING now, the battle-rattle of Nantz and his
          men fixing BAYONETS to their rifles. Nantz-yells out:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Cpl. Harris!

          CPL. HARRIS
          Sir!

          SGT. NANTZ
          Being vastly outnumbered provides a
          marine rifleman with what?

          CPL. HARRIS
          A target rich environment, sir!

          SGT. NANTZ
          Marines. We stand here. Let these
          bastards know who they're fucking
          with.

          PVT. IMLAY

          2/5!
          Sporadic FIRE now, as the marines fire on the advancing
          aliens, still at a distance.

          EXT. OFF-RAMP - 10 FREEWAY

          Stavrou descends down the collapsed off-ramp, negotiating the
          fractured, angled slab of roadway.
          Kerns covers him above, from the freeway.
          Stavrou hits the ground, securing the area. He looks up at
          Kerns and gives him the "All Clear" sign. Kerns takes off...

          INT. / EXT. BUS - 10 FREEWAY

          Adukwu stands in.the bus, looking out to see Kerns running
          back to them, signalling. Adukwu turns to the civilians
          crowded behind him.

                         ADUKWU
          Okay, it's clear. We're gonna go.
          Amy and Kirsten, terrified, look up at Michele. She hurries
          the girls to the door of the bus as Kern runs up.

                         MICHELE
          It's okay. I'll be right behind
          you.
          Adukwu picks up Amy. Kerns picks up Kirsten.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

          PVT. KERNS
          (takes a breath, telling
          them, himself)
          It's gonna be scary but we can do
          it, okay?
          An alien round flies through the bus, shattering the back
          window! The girls scream.
          Kerns and Adukwu race away, running with the girls... Rincon
          grabs Hector. He and Michele follow...

          RUNNING ACROSS THE FREEWAY...
          To the off-ramp. It seems like a long way off. They run
          past Correggio, rocking a SAW full auto. The FIRE is
          deafening.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Come on!! Come on!! Get some!
          Rincon and Michele, breathing ragged, feet pounding, look
          up... They're getting closer and closer to the off-ramp as...
          Alien rounds blow chunks of concrete off the roadway...
          UP AHEAD, Kerns and Adukwu rush the girls to the EDGE OF THE
          RAMP, hurrying to get them down as...
          Rincon and Michele REACH THE OFF-RAMP now.
          Kerns grabs Hector, HELPING HIM ANGLE DOWN THE OFF-RAMP,
          getting the boy safely handed down to awaiting Stavrou as...

          ON THE FREEWAY

          BANG! MOTTOLA TAKES A ROUND TO THE SIDE.
          Rincon spins, sees the marine drop, SCREAMING.
          Rincon looks back at Adukwu, who is busy getting Michele down
          the off-ramp now.
          Then Rincon looks back to the freeway, sees Mottola writhing
          in agony.
          Rincon runs to Mottola, kneeling next to him.
          Mottola looks up at Rincon, fear in his eyes.

                         RINCON
          It's okay, son. I got you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.
          Rincon starts to PULL Mottola TOWARD THE OFF-RAMP...
          Struggling to get him to safety.
          Mottola's body starts to convulse. Rincon stops, tries to
          control him. Sees Mottola's eyes rolling back in his head.
          Then Rincon is horrified when he looks up to see...
          ALIENS RACING FORWARD... Heading his way!
          Moving in and out of the sea of abandoned cars.
          Rincon redoubles his efforts, pulling on the injured Mottola.
          As he does, he looks back up to see...
          The ALIENS ARE ALMOST ON TOP OF HIM now as...
          BANG! The first alien is shot by...
          Nantz, suddenly there, M-16 poised.
          Rincon looks from Nantz to... MORE ALIENS coming at them!
          No choice-- Rincon PICKS UP the injured Mottola's RIFLE.
          Scared, but resolute. He looks at Nantz.

                         RINCON
          What do I need to know?
          The slightest beat, then...

          SGT. NANTZ
          It's set to fire in three round
          bursts. We're low, so don't waste
          your shots.
          Rincon holds the M-16 against his shoulder, aiming.

                         RINCON
          Just sight down the barrel...?

          SGT. NANTZ
          And give 'em hell.
          Rincon sights down the barrel of his rifle at ONE ALIEN in
          the distance. He squeezes the trigger...

          BY THE FREEWAY OFF-RAMP
          Adukwu sees Rincon and the wounded Mottola now. He runs to
          them, incoming rounds WHIZZ by as...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          Adukwu bends over Mottola, seeing that he's dead. Adukwu
          closes Mottola's eyes as...
          An ALIEN APPEARS from behind a car, AIMING STRAIGHT AT
          ADUKWU. It is about to FIRE as...
          BAM! BAM! BAM! Rincon FIRES, blowing the alien away.
          Adukwu looks up, realizing Rincon just saved him.
          He,meets eyes with Rincon, who stares back, stunned a moment
          by his own actions. Adukwu immediately shouts a. warning.:

          PVT. ADUKWU
          Keep fighting!
          Rincon snaps back, turns to fire... A moment too late as...
          THUMP! Rincon is HIT. He falls.
          Adukwu grabs Rincon, sees the pain and fear in the civilian's
          eyes. Adukwu rips open packages of QuickClot, begins
          spreading the fast-clotting powder on Rincon's wounds as...,

          EXT. BUS ROOF

          Harris and Imlay firing... From this height, they can see the
          full expanse of freeway:
          More WAVES OF ALIENS coming, using abandoned cars as cover...

          CPL. HARRIS
          Shit, Lieutenant, we're gonna be
          overrun !

          BY THE BUS / ON FREEWAY
          Nantz and Martinez exchange a desperate glance on this. Then
          Nantz. looks around, assessing the situation.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Gimme two of your smoke cannisters!
          Martinez pops two canisters off, hands them to Nantz.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Take someone to cover you!.
          Nantz turns, sees Correggio. Then he turns the other way,
          sees Kerns.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Kerns! Come on!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

          PVT. KERNS
          Me, Sergeant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          I'm not worried about fightin' next
          to you, Kerns. Now let's go.
          A slight smile from Kerns on this as he follows Nantz...
          Who sprints low, scurrying between cars... 10... 20... 30
          yards closer to the enemy.
          Nantz and Kerns arrive at a large SUV.
          Kerns ducks low, covering Nantz. Nantz crouches, opens the
          gas tank...
          Unscrews the fuse from the smoke grenade body, tossing the
          canister aside... pulls the pin... flips the 'spoon' off...

          SGT. NANTZ
          Get ready to move on my word.
          Nantz holds the fuse over the open gas cap.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Now!
          Nantz drops the fuse into the gas tank.
          They go RUNNING BACK TOWARD THE BUS as...
          B0000M! The SUV EXPLODES in a ball of flames!
          Nantz and Kerns dive BEHIND ANOTHER VEHICLE, Kerns crouching,
          laying cover fire. Nantz pulls a fuse.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Again! Ready?!

          PVT. KERNS
          (pops up, fires)
          Ready!
          Nantz drops the fuse, they run... The CAR EXPLODES in flames!
          Nantz runs to ANOTHER CAR, making sure Kerns is with him.

          EXT. BUS ROOF

          Harris and Imlay see what Nantz is doing...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.
          He's creating a WALL OF FLAME... Funneling the enemy into
          one NARROW CORRIDOR!
          Forcing them through the OPENING between the CARS ON FIRE...

          PVT. IMLAY
          Damn, Sergeant sure as shit's
          ninja. He just gave us a kill
          zone, didn't he, Corporal?

          CPL. HARRIS
          Soon as they come through, blow 'em
          back to hell!
          The first alien appears THROUGH THE BURNING CORRIDOR. Imlay
          blows it away! Harris blows away the next... It's working!;.

          EXT. FREEWAY BY BUS

          Nantz and Kerns fall back BEHIND THE BUS, next to Martinez,
          Correggio and a 2nd squad marine.
          Along with Harris and Imlay on the bus roof, they are the
          only ones left holding the aliens off. All FIRE forward as...
          More and more aliens begin pouring through, braving the
          flames... Into the line of fire...
          Many aliens go down. But because of their sheer numbers,
          few start to make it through, FIRING BACK at the marines.
          Martinez sees the 2nd SQUAD MARINE go down in front of him.
          Martinez rushes to his side... HE'S DEAD.
          Martinez rises to shoot and...THWUMMP. Martinez is hit.
          He looks down, blood running over his belt. Shock on his
          face. He's been shot in the stomach.
          Martinez looks around...
          The remaining aliens now only cars apart from them.
          Two forces taking cover behind spraying glass and punctured
          metal, firing directly into the faces of their enemy.
          Martinez pulls himself together, struggling over to Nantz.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Pull the men back... Pull 'em all
          back now, Sergeant. I'm gonna stay
          and cover.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.
          Nantz looks at Martinez about to say something. Sees the
          blood draining from his stomach, down his legs.
          Nantz grabs Martinez, pulling him up.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Lieutenant. We gotta get you outta
          here. No way we're leavin' you...

          LT. MARTINEZ
          I said I got it...

          SGT. NANTZ
          I'm not leaving you here to die.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          That's not your call, Sergeant.
          Now get your men outta here...
          He pushes Nantz away, looks around, the chaos slowing down
          for him. He reaches into his vest...
          Martinez hands the LETTER we saw earlier to Nantz. A moment
          between them.
          Nantz nods, then spins, moving, yelling to the men.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We're pulling back. Head to the
          lower street, now! NOW!
          Nantz runs toward the edge of the destroyed off-ramp, laying
          cover as the men head down.
          Harris and Imlay slide down off the roof of the bus, joining
          the others running to the off-ramp. Correggio sees...
          MARTINEZ STAYING BEHIND, shooting at the aliens, drawing
          their fire.

          CPL. CORREGGIO

                         (TO NANTZ)
          What about the lieutenant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          Keep movin', corporal! Go!
          All the men climb DOWN THE OFF-RAMP. Nantz turns to go back
          to get the Lieutenant himself, sees...
          Martinez hauling himself toward the rear of the bus.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

          EXT. BUS

          Martinez, behind the back of the bus, struggles to breath,
          still drawing fire. Grabs his radio.

          LT. MARTINEZ

                         (TRANSMITTING)
          This is Lieutenant Bennie Martinez',
          U.S. Marine Corps!
          Aliens converge toward the back of the bus.
          Ten... Fifteen... Twenty ALIENS heading for the signal...
          Heading for Martinez.

          LT. MARTINEZ

                         (TRANSMITTING)
          1st Platoon, 2nd Battalion, 5th
          Marines!
          He turns, sees Nantz coming back for him...
          Martinez pulls a smoke canister from his vest... Holds it up
          for Nantz to see...
          Then unscrews the fuse, pops open the gas cap of the bus...

          ALIENS CLOSE IN ON MARTINEZ...
          Nantz turns, dives for cover as...
          Martinez drops the fuse into the gas tank...
          A flash of fear across his face as... Aliens are on him as...

          KABOOOOOOOOOOOOM! THE BUS EXPLODES IN FLAMES!
          Massive fire ball shooting 300 feet into the sky'!
          Nantz raises his head, debris raining down, sees...

          ALL THE ALIENS DEAD.
          His eyes wide at Martinez's sacrifice, the burden now on him,
          he's in charge of the men, the civilians...
          Nantz gets to his feet. Runs for the off-ramp.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

          EXT. OFF-RAMP. LOWER STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz drops down the destroyed off-ramp... Runs to the
          marines and civilians BEHIND THE ABANDONED VAN. He sees
          Adukwu working on Rincon, Hector crying in Michele's arms.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Package Mr. Rincon for transport.
          We've got to move...

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Sergeant. Did you just leave Lt.
          Martinez back there?

          SGT. NANTZ
          Lt. Martinez stayed behind. He
          knew he was dying...

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          So you left him? Is that how it is
          with you?

          SGT. NANTZ
          He sacrificed himself to save our
          asses.
          (steps to Correggio)
          Now you get your head straight,
          Corporal. This is my unit now.
          Nantz looks at the men, who stare back, shaken.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Let's move. We need shelter...
          Those bombs are gonna drop!

          EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

          A frantic dash through the street, rubble and fires all over.
          Marines carry the kids. HECTOR, in Harris' arms, head
          swiveling, eyes searching for his dad, sees... Imlay and
          Adukwu CARRYING rINCON, who appears lifeless.

          INT. BIG 5 SPORTING GOODS STORE - CONTINUOUS

          A dark, empty store. The marines burst in, aiming rifles.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Tighten this place down. See if we
          can establish communications. Hard
          line only! Nothing wireless.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.
          The marines move into position, covering windows and doors.
          Nantz turns to Michele, huddling with the kids.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Listen, we're out of the bomb
          zone... But when they fall, we will
          definitely be rocked. Make sure
          the kids are prepared for that.
          Hector suddenly breaks free, rushing forward.as Imlay and
          Adukwu enter with Rincon, setting him down.
          Nantz pulls blankets from a nearby rack, covering Rincon. As
          he does, we see a glimpse of Rincon's BLOOD-SOAKED CLOTHING.
          He is very pale. Blood flecks his lips.
          Hector stares into his father's face, eyes filling. Rincon
          touches Hector's face lightly.

          SGT. NANTZ
          It'll be okay. We'll get your dad
          fixed up.
          But when Hector looks to Nantz on this, he can't meet the
          boy's gaze. Hector can see this isn't the truth.

                         RINCON
          Listen to me, son. I'm not going
          to make it.
          (a slight beat)
          But you will.

                         HECTOR
          I don't want to go without you.

                         RINCON
          I know. But you have to. Now wait
          with Michele a minute. Let me talk
          to the sergeant.
          Reluctantly, Hector allows Michele to lead him away.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Mr. Rincon, we can take you and...
          Rincon turns to Nantz, steel-eyed.

          MR. RINCON
          Don't waste time, sergeant. You
          and I both know what's going on
          here.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

          SGT. NANTZ
          I can't leave you...

                         RINCON
          No. You can't take me.
          Nantz is silent, at a loss.

          ACROSS THE STORE
          Imlay stares at a CLOCK on the wall, calls out:

          PVT. IMLAY
          Four minutes and those bombs drop,
          Sergeant.
          NANTZ looks over at this. But his expression is blank.
          He turns back to Rincon, who's staring straight into him.

                         RINCON
          I keep playing it over in my
          head... If I'd done things
          differently... Maybe I could have
          gotten Hector out earlier.

          SGT. NANTZ
          You can't look back. You make the
          best decision you can...
          A beat.

                         RINCON
          Just promise you'll get my son out
          of here, Sergeant.
          Nantz looks like he has the weight of the world on him.

          SGT. NANTZ
          I promise.
          Rincon holds out his hand. Nantz takes it, meeting his gaze.

                         RINCON
          I'm trusting you with the only
          thing I have in this world.
          Nantz stares, nods.

          CPL. HARRIS
          Sergeant! Hard wire connection!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.
          Nantz turns to see Harris behind a COUNTER, at a COMPUTER--
          an INTERNET CONNECTION on its screen.
          The marines crowd around, reading the ominous HEADLINE...
          "GLOBAL INVASION -- Alien 'Creatures' Attack From Oceans"
          PICTURES of ALIENS racing through urban streets, swarming
          over cars stuck in massive lines,of traffic...
          Underneath these pictures we see CAPTIONS, a litany-of doom:
          Battle: Tokyo... Battle: Cape Town... Battle: Los Angeles...
          Then a BUDDY LIST pops up on the screen, an INSTANT MESSAGE:
          'baby, is that you?'

          CPL. HARRIS
          Damn, that's Cherise...
          Harris quickly types back a response: 'you ok?'
          The message comes back: no, real scared.'
          Harris responds: 'where are you?'
          He hits SEND. But the message doesn't go through. He clicks
          the mouse. But the computer has frozen.
          Then 'Internet Connection Lost' pops up on screen.
          Everyone stares. Harris stands, walks from the computer.
          Stavrou watches him go as...

          ACROSS THE BIG 5 FLOOR
          HECTOR steps back to his dad's side. Rincon's eyes open
          slowly. He looks at Hector. Manages a small smile. Reaches
          out, wipes a tear from his son's face.

                         RINCON
          I'm very proud of you, son. You're
          being so brave...
          Hector throws his arms around his father, hugging him
          tightly.

                         RINCON
          I love you, Hector.
          Mr. Rincon smiles. His face peaceful. Hector is silent,
          tears rolling down his face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Thirty seconds!

          CPL. STAVROU
          Get away from the windows! Get
          those kids behind cover!
          The marines back away from the windows into the center of the
          store, hunkering down with the civilians. Everyone stares at
          the CLOCK on the wall as it ticks...

          PVT. KERNS
          C'mon. Fry those bastards...

          PVT. IMLAY
          Those bombs drop, then everything's
          gonna change. Get to the FOB, get
          some goddamn ammo...

          PVT. KERNS
          Some goddamn food...

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Some goddamn tanks.
          Beat. Everyone stares as... The CLOCK ticks to NINE...

          AND NOTHING HAPPENS.
          They wait. Fear grows on everyone's faces.

          PVT. KERNS
          They shoulda' dropped, right? We'd
          feel it from here, wouldn't we?

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          That much ordinance? They'd feel
          it in Nevada. Something's wrong...

          PVT. IMLAY
          Maybe it's good... Maybe we turned
          the tide...

          CPL. STAVROU
          Yeah, right, Imlay... 'Cause we
          were kickin' ass out there.

                         MICHELE
          What's happening, Sergeant? What's
          that mean?

          SGT. NANTZ
          I don't know.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.
          Adukwu quietly approaches Nantz now, voice low.

          PVT. ADUKWU
          Sergeant... Mr. Rincon is dead.
          Nantz turns, staring off at Hector, sitting by his father.
          It's all too much...

          SGT. NANTZ
          Jesus...
          Nantz takes a deep breath, his mind racing, the world closing
          in on him. He turns to Michele.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Listen, our Forward Operating Base
          is about a mile away. We have to
          go on foot. I'll need your help
          with Hector now.
          Michele nods. Watches as Nantz slowly walks to Hector.
          Nantz kneels by the boy.

          SGT. NANTZ
          I'm sorry Hector. Your dad...
          didn't make it. You understand?
          Hector, sobbing, overwhelmed by grief and fear, looks up at
          Nantz.

                         HECTOR
          I don't wanna be here. I want my
          dad back. I want it all to go back
          to the way it was before...

          AT. THE FRONT OF THE STORE.
          Stavrou, eyes on the still street, sees...
          TWO ALIEN SCOUTS appear. They crouch by a car.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Sergeant, we got hostiles in front.
          All the marines stiffen, the clatter of rifles being raised.
          But Nantz, tearing up himself, just stays focused on Hector.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Me too, Hector. I wish it could go
          back, too...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

          STAVROU LOOKS OUT TO THE STREET
          MORE ALIENS appear now, moving TOWARD THE STORE.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Out of time, sergeant.

                         NANTZ
          Tries to lead Hector away. Hector struggles.

          SGT. NANTZ

                         (URGENTLY NOW)
          We have to go, Hector.

                         HECTOR

                         (CRYING)
          No! No! I want my dad!!!
          Nantz lifts Hector. We see Hector's face, stricken, staring
          back at his father as he's carried off.
          The other marines gather up Michele and the girls...
          And everyone is moving silently THROUGH THE STORE as...

          AT THE FRONT OF THE STORE
          CRASH! The plate glass window is SHATTERED as...
          An ALIEN smashes through it.
          The alien is very still, peering around. Then it begins to
          creep forward as...
          A SECOND ALIEN, then a third, a FOURTH follows, leaping into
          the store with sinewy power.

          AT THE REAR OF THE STORE
          Nantz peers out a BACK DOOR. It's clear. They MOVE OUT just
          as...
          MORE ALIENS leap in. They move in formation THROUGH THE
          STORE as...
          THE BACK DOOR silently shuts.

          QUICK CUT TO:

          EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

          As Nantz and the others slip out of the back...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80..

          SGT. NANTZ
          Stavrou, Harris.

          CPL. HARRIS
          Yes, Sergeant.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Blow something up.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Yes, Sergeant.
          As the others RACE AWAY down the alley...
          Stavrou takes his rifle butt, SMASHES the WINDOW of a nearby
          CAR. Reaches in... Jams the car's gear into.neutral.
          As the massive Stavrou pushes the car AGAINST THE STORE'S

          BACK DOOR...
          Harris pulls his KA-BAR FIGHTING KNIFE.
          Harris.slides UNDER THE CAR... Punctures the GAS TANK.
          As Harris rolls away from the FLOW OF GASOLINE...
          Stavrou LIGHTS it. Both men RUN DOWN THE ALLEY.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Don't think they'll be comin' out
          that way...
          As... BOOM! The car, blocking the door, goes up in FLAMES.

          DOWN THE ALLEY
          Stavrou and Harris FALL BEHIND A BUILDING with the others.
          NANTZ, still holding Hector, looks off to a SIDE STREET..He
          signals to Kerns and Correggio.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Check it out.
          The two marines run down the alley to the SIDE STREET.
          Nantz sets Hector down. Looks the boy in the face.

          SGT. NANTZ
          This is the hardest thing you'll
          ever have to do...
          Michele, arms around Kirsten and Amy, watches Nantz.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.1.

          SGT. NANTZ
          But we'll get through it together.
          I promise, Hector.
          Hector nods, still crying. Nantz exchanges a glance with
          Michele, who moves to Hector, comforting him.
          Nantz steps away as Kerns and Correggio run up, reporting:

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Looks good, both directions.
          Out of earshot of the civilians, Nantz spins to his men with
          fiery intensity.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We are not losing one more of these
          civilians. Period. Am I making
          myself clear?

                         (BEAT)
          Let's move.
          The group jogs silently DOWN THE ALLEY.

          EXT. STREET - LATER

          Nantz leads the group down the residential street, tidy
          bungalows on either side.

          CPL. STAVROU
          You okay, bro?

          CPL. HARRIS
          I hadn't a pushed Cherise to get
          married, she'd still be in Chicago.
          Suddenly, Nantz stops, fist raised. The squad halts as...
          A SOUND fades in, a deep RUMBLING.
          The marines FALL BEHIND CARS now, pulling the civilians down
          with them as the RUMBLING continues to BUILD.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Under the cars! Now!
          The marines frantically shed their packs, squirming UNDER THE
          CARS with the civilians, pulling the kids under as...

          A GIANT HOST OF ALIENS

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.
          Rounds the corner in the distance, THOUSANDS'OF THEM, filling
          the street from sidewalk to sidewalk. An army on the move.
          NANTZ DRAGS HECTOR UNDER ONE CAR with him,' pulls the boy in
          close, gets his legs under the car, under cover, just as...
          The mass of aliens SWARM PAST, the ground shaking, RUMBLING.
          The humans HUDDLE UNDER THE CARS, peering out to see the legs
          and arms of the aliens flying by. Some bound OVER THE CARS,
          which bounce up and down, BANGING with the aliens' weight.
          The RUMBLING EBBS as the aliens disappear into the distance.

          EXT. STREET - LATER

          The squad moves in formation, surrounding the civilians.
          Little Kirsten comes up behind Correggio. He's surprised as
          she slips her hand into his. Correggio looks down, seeing
          how scared she is. He smiles, grips her hand tightly.
          Up ahead, Nantz leads, MAP in hand.

          PVT. IMLAY
          How far, sergeant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          One block over.
          Imlay smiles at Kerns.

          PVT. IMLAY
          We'.re gonna make it! Dude, we're
          gonna make it...
          But as they approach a CORNER... Nantz stops, exchanges a
          glance with his corporals.

                         MICHELE
          What's the matter?

          SGT. NANTZ
          The smell.
          An ominous beat. The squad moves down the dark street as...
          ASH FLOATS DOWN here from the sky... Like a beautiful early
          winter snow...

          THEN THEY TURN THE CORNER

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.
          We slowly MOVE IN TIGHTER and TIGHTER on Nantz.
          Until we are CLOSE ON NANTZ' FACE.
          A REDDISH GLOW is reflected there. Nantz stops, looking
          horrified. We REVERSE to see...
          A DEEP BLACK COLUMN OF SMOKE rising into the night sky from
          NUMEROUS FIRES that rage within the fence line of...

          SANTA MONICA AIRPORT.
          As they approach the Forward Operating Base, the devastation
          is slowly revealed:
          CRASHED F-18 JETS and COBRA HELICOPTERS line the runways.
          BODIES and SMOLDERING MARINE VEHICLES litter the airfield.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Jesus... They wiped our Forward
          Operating Base right off the map.

          PVT. KERNS
          Now we know why those bombs never
          dropped. They took our jets out.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          This was a dug-in marine Corps
          position that had armor, air and
          ground. Maybe we got nothing left
          to fight with...
          Michele MEETS EYES WITH NANTZ. His look tells us everything--

          THEY'RE LOSING THIS WAR.
          Nantz turns, spies an AIRPORT FIRE STATION by the runways.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Let's get under cover. Now.

          INT. DESERTED FIRE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

          The marines enter cautiously, rifles up. Then they hustle
          the civilians inside when it appears safe.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Lock this place down.
          The marines fan out, securing doors, checking windows as...
          Nantz kneels by Hector, tries to comfort him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

          SGT. NANTZ
          You're a brave kid. When this is
          over, you're going to be a hero.

                         HECTOR
          People always say that. "He's a
          hero."

                         (BEAT)
          No one even knows what a hero is.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Your dad was a hero.
          Hector just stares back.

          SGT. NANTZ
          He saved Pvt. Adukwu up on that
          freeway.
          Hector exchanges a glance with Adukwu. Something passes
          between them... One man died so another could live...

          SGT. NANTZ
          You save a marine under fire, you
          get a medal, y'know.
          Nantz pulls out a MEDALLION, the CREST of the 2/5 on it.

          SGT. NANTZ
          This is our medallion. It's yours.
          For your dad.

                         (SMILES)
          You're 2/5 now, Hector.
          Hector takes the heavy medallion, looks it over, pointing to
          the 2/5 MOTTO on it:

                         HECTOR
          What's that mean, "retreat hell?"

          SGT. NANTZ
          During World War I, an officer from
          our regiment was ordered to
          retreat. He said, "Retreat? Hell,
          we just got here!"
          Nantz is happy to see a slow smile from Hector now.
          Harris calls out:

          CPL. HARRIS
          We're secure, sergeant.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.
          Nantz stands on this, addresses the marines:

          SGT. NANTZ
          Listen up. We need ammo. Kerns,
          Adukwu stay with the civilians.
          The rest of us, let's move.
          Nantz puts a hand on Hector's shoulder.

          SGT. NANTZ
          I'll be right back.

          EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT RUNWAY - MINUTES LATER

          Black plumes of SMOKE fill the night sky as Nantz and his men
          head silently toward the bodies of dead marines and aliens.
          The tarmac is a smoldering WASTELAND: Empty, bombed-out
          buildings on its outskirts, burning aircraft and vehicles
          litter the runways. Fires crackle.
          As they go, the marines rifle the pockets and pouches of
          their fallen comrades, pulling out any available ammo.
          IMLAY whispers a low, heartfelt refrain to the dead marines
          he searches.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Sorry, bro.
          He moves on to another fallen marine, searching.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Sorry, bro.
          Across the runway, Nantz pulls ammo from the pouch of a dead
          marine. Then looking up, he sees...

          A LAV-25 ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER. INTACT.
          Nantz moves to it. Then turns. A LOW WHISTLE from him and
          the marines look up. They hustle to Nantz. Everyone gives
          the LAV an excited once-over.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Looks like it just rolled off the
          goddamn assembly line!

          PVT. IMLAY
          Good job, Sergeant!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

          SGT. NANTZ

                         (TO STAVROU)
          Can you drive this thing?

          CPL. STAVROU
          Hell, if it's got an engine,
          sergeant, I can drive it.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Good. Get it running.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Seems like vehicles are targets...

          SGT. NANTZ
          A minivan's a target, Correggio. A
          LAV with a Bushmaster chaingun...
          That's an asset.
          Imlay grins. Nantz motions to him, starting off.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Come on.

          PVT. IMLAY

                         (FOLLOWING)
          Me? Where, sergeant?
          Nantz points to the CONTROL TOWER, its windows blown out.

          SGT. NANTZ
          High ground. We need to see the
          big picture.

          INT. FIRE STATION - SAME

          Kerns has a tub of ice cream, scooping bowls for the kids.

          PVT. KERNS
          My dad's a fireman. They love
          their ice cream. Used to visit the
          firehouse with my little brother,
          they always had tons of it...
          (re. the kids)
          My brother's not much older than
          these guys.

                         MICHELE
          You don't look much older, either.
          She gazes at the kids, pain and anger washing over her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         MICHELE
          Is this day ever going to end?

          PVT. KERNS
          Maybe the Sergeant'll find a way
          outta here.

                         MICHELE

                         (SMILES)
          What's with you guys anyway?
          Doesn't anybody have a first name?

                         ADUKWU
          Emmanuel. Manny.

          PVT. KERNS
          Pete. You married? Family?

                         MICHELE
          I'm single. Lots of family back in
          Nebraska, though... Hopefully
          they're safe...
          She shakes the thought away.

                         MICHELE
          What about you guys?

          PVT. KERNS
          Little Rock.

                         ADUKWU
          Nigeria. I came here to be a
          doctor.

                         MICHELE
          You should be a surgeon, the way
          you cut into that thing...
          Adukwu smiles. Then his smile fades as he looks around.

                         ADUKWU
          Yeah. Maybe...

          INT. CONTROL TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

          Nantz enters with Imlay. They look around...
          The WINDOWS have been BLOWN OPEN. The wind rustles papers
          through the ghostly space, blowing them out into the night.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          On one desk, a COMPUTER is flashing a SLIDESHOW: Happy
          PICTURES of someone's family vacation.
          From this, high vantage point, they can see for miles...
          Nantz looks out one end of the control tower, sees all the
          way to the ocean...
          Then he turns, looks the other way, dead east...
          A vista of EXPLOSIONS, spreading-into the distance. ALIEN
          DRONE AIRCRAFT engage F-18s. One jet is blown up, spiralling
          to the ground.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Look how far east they've gotten.
          That's almost the whole city...
          Nantz looks out through BINOCULARS:
          Sees the HOLLYWOOD SIGN ablaze in the hills...
          Then pans to a mid-city area. Stops when he sees one
          quadrant of the city, blocks wide, SHIMMERING an INKY BLACK.
          Some kind of DARK ENERGY WAVE emanating from the ground.

          SGT. NANTZ
          What the hell's that?
          Imlay peers out.

          SGT. NANTZ
          There's zero activity there.
          And the area does seem completely devoid of activity-- No
          alien or human aircraft above it. Like a DEAD ZONE.

          PVT. IMLAY
          What are we gonna do, Sergeant?
          Nantz, panning with the binoculars, sees a CHOPPER TAKING OFF
          in the distance now.
          Nantz grabs a MAP on the desk, eyes roaming over it. Then
          looks back to where he saw the chopper.

          SGT. NANTZ
          That must be the alternate
          extraction site. Maybe we can
          evacuate the civilians there...
          He turns to Imlay.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Get them in the LAV. I'll radio
          for an evac helicopter... When I
          do, they'll be coming, so we have
          to move fast.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Think we can make it, Sergeant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          We're gonna give it one helluva
          try, Imlay.
          He reassures the young marine with each-word:

          SGT. NANTZ
          We're not dying here.

          INT. FIREHOUSE - LATER

          The marines, absent Nantz, surround the civilians
          protectively as they hustle them into the LAV.

          CONTROL TOWER - SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - MINUTES LATER
          Nantz standing alone with a RADIO PACK looking out into the
          black night, wind blowing through the tower.
          The LAV WAITS ON THE TARMAC below, engine running.
          Nantz takes a deep breath. Presses the button on the RADIO.

                         NANTZ

                         (TRANSMITTING)
          Any station, this is Foxtrot 2
          November. I have four civilians
          and seven marines, we're heading to
          Alternate Extraction Point Charlie.
          Requesting evacuation. I say
          again, this is Foxtrot 2 November
          heading to Alternate Extraction
          Point Charlie. Out.
          Nantz turns immediately, hurrying out.

          EXT. CONTROL TOWER - SECONDS LATER

          Nantz runs from the tower and climbs into the LAV.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

          INT. LAV - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz sees the civilians and marines crammed together in the
          back amid gear and guns.
          He turns to Stavrou behind the wheel.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Use the thermal sight. No lights.
          Stavrou drives, spins away as Nantz climbs...

          INTO THE TURRET
          He mans the M-240 MACHINE GUN. Imlay beside him on the 25MM

          BUSHMASTER CHAIN GUN.
          Headlights off, running dark, Stavrou drives, peering through
          the THERMAL SIGHT.

          STAVROU'S POV THROUGH THERMAL
          Washed green, the city a war zone, massive destruction..
          An ALIEN DRONE winging toward the airport as...

          EXT. STREET, NEAR SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - LATE NIGHT

          The LAV moves fast in total darkness down a car-strewn
          street. Santa Monica Airport fading behind them, suddenly...
          BOOOOOOM-! Bright burst of light!
          And the Control Tower explodes in a ball of fire.

          INT. LAV - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz watches the alien drone fly off into the night.

          EXT. STREET - LATER - NIGHT

          Miles away, the LAV drives through a CITY STREET, surrounded
          by TALL BUILDINGS, the area a desolate wasteland now.

          INT. LAV - SAME

          Stavrou drives, hands gripping the wheel as he maneuvers
          carefully through wrecked abandoned cars.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

          IN THE TURRET
          Nantz eyes a nervous Imlay.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Extract site's only a couple more
          miles, Imlay.
          Imlay nods back. Nantz peers down to...

          STAVROU, BEHIND THE WHEEL...
          Eyes focusing tensely through the thermal sight scope.

          THERMAL SIGHT POV
          Green wash of the city passing by. Tall, empty buildings all
          around... Suddenly, a big DARK OBJECT in the street!
          Stavrou SLAMS THE BRAKES. Civilians and marines in the tight
          passenger compartment are thrown around.
          Right in front of the LAV...
          A massive CRATER. The street's impassable.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We gotta go around.
          The LAV backs up, Nantz scanning the sky, gripping the M-240
          machine gun, trying to see out into the darkness...
          Then they TURN A CORNER... And a VIEW BETWEEN TWO TALL
          BUILDINGS is harrowing...
          FOUR ALIEN DRONE AIRCRAFT hovering... Then turning. Flying
          toward them.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Get ready, Imlay. Here they come.
          Stavrou looks out to see... A HELICOPTER in the distance.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Think I see our ride, sergeant!

                         SGT NANTZ
          Get us there. Cause we're about to
          get lit up.
          The alien drone ships are winging at them. They are only 200
          meters out when...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

          SGT. NANTZ
          See what that Bushmaster can do,
          Imlay!
          Imlay OPENS UP on the 25MM BUSHMASTER CHAIN GUN.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Come on, you martian bastards!
          The Bushmaster is a rapid-firing CANNON spewing 200 rounds a
          minute, each capable of destroying a light tank.
          For once, the aliens are overmatched. The ALIEN SHIPS take
          HEAVY FIRE from the Bushmaster...
          One goes down IN FLAMES, the others PEEL OFF, flying behind
          buildings.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Where'd they go? Where'd they go?
          Nantz is scanning the sky, then...

          SGT. NANTZ
          Imlay, on your six!
          Imlay spins in the turret, picking up...
          The three remaining ALIEN AIRCRAFT coming back around.
          The lead alien ship FIRES!
          A ,CAR EXPLODES next to the LAV. Imlay rocks in the turret.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Son of a...
          Imlay targets, fires the Bushmaster...
          The lead alien ship is HIT, winging out of control INTO A
          SECOND SHIP. The TWO SHIPS EXPLODE into a building as...
          The FINAL ALIEN AIRCRAFT dodges the FIREBALL, flying straight
          at the LAV...

          SGT. NANTZ
          Getting close, Imlay...

          PVT. IMLAY
          I got it.
          Imlay FIRES a burst. The last aircraft is hit...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.
          It PINWHEELS TO THE GROUND, exploding into FLAMING WRECKAGE
          which hurtles RIGHT AT THE LAV.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Stand on it, Stavrou!
          Stavrou pushes it, TRYING TO OUTRUN the burning wreckage...
          Which is almost on top of the LAV as...
          Stavrou spins AROUND A CORNER, escaping.
          The wreckage explodes into a building behind them as...
          THUMP - THUMP - THUMP! The sound of a UH-1'Medevac ECHOES.

          PVT. IMLAY
          The chopper!
          Nantz looks out, sees the CHOPPER LANDING in the street.
          The LAV screeches up amid the RUBBLE and SMOKE.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Last stop!

          SGT. NANTZ
          Everybody out!
          The marines rush the civilians OUT OF THE LAV... Nantz and
          Imlay scrambling out last.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Pretty decent shooting, Imlay.

          PVT. IMLAY

                         (GRINNING)
          Goddamn, you did it, sergeant!
          We're gonna get these people out!

          EVERYONE RUNS TO THE CHOPPER.
          The marines begin loading the civilians in, the old-school
          CREW CHIEF hopping off to help the kids in.

                         CREW CHIEF
          You are in the middle of the shit,
          Sergeant! Everything's been pulled
          back.

          SGT. NANTZ
          What are you talking about?!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         CREW CHIEF
          We've lost most of our air assets.
          We're abandoning Los Angeles. This
          city's done...!
          (to the pilot)
          Let's go!
          The chopper powers up, Nantz SCRAMBLES ON with the others.

          INT. EVAC HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

          The CHOPPER BEGINS TO LIFT OFF. As it rises, Nantz gazes out
          at the CITYSCAPE. He sees fires, wreckage everywhere. Then
          he looks off to see...

          THE BLACK DEAD ZONE SHIMMERING NEARBY
          Nantz watches the HELICOPTER BANK TOWARD THE BLACK ZONE. But
          as it gets closer...
          The HELICOPTER DIPS precipitously, suddenly losing altitude.
          The kids SCREAM. The marines hang on.
          Nantz sees the PILOT STRUGGLING with the controls. The
          HELICOPTER'S GAUGES are going crazy.
          The pilot BANKS HARD AWAY from the area, reversing course.
          And the helicopter STABILIZES.

          SGT. NANTZ
          What the hell happened?!

                         CREW CHIEF
          Something there was playing hell
          with our power!
          Nantz stares at this. Then notices Hector watching. him.
          He sees the 2/5 MEDALLION clutched tightly in Hector's hand.
          Sees the words "Retreat Hell."
          Nantz looks back at the MYSTERIOUS BLACK PATCH of cityscape.
          Then he turns to the crew chief.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Set us back down!

                         CREW CHIEF
          What?!
          The other marines in Nantz' unit look over, alarmed now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We need to recon that area!

                         CREW CHIEF
          We can't land! May not have power
          to take off again...
          Nantz looks out. Spies a BUILDING with a FLAT OPEN ROOF. He
          points to it.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Then we'll rope down!

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          What the hell, sergeant? What's
          going on?

          SGT. NANTZ
          There's something over there... We
          could be the only ones left here to
          figure out what it is.
          (to the others)
          Let's go, marines.
          The marines look frightened, confused. They start to pull
          themselves up. ROPES are dropped from the chopper as it
          hovers over the building...

          SGT. NANTZ
          NOW! Go! Go!
          The marines start to RAPPEL DOWN, one after another as...
          Nantz exchanges a glance with Michele.

          SGT. NANTZ
          They'll get you safe.
          He smiles at the girls. Then turns, nods at Hector. Puts a
          hand on his shoulder. A BEAT.

          SGT. NANTZ
          See you soon, buddy.

                         HECTOR
          What are you gonna do?

          SGT. NANTZ
          We're gonna fight.
          Nantz turns, grabs a ROPE, drops out of the chopper.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

          EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

          As the chopper hovers, Nantz drops to the roof, hunkers down
          with the other marines. Nantz watches the evac helicopter
          fly off to safety.
          Then he turns to the marines, who stare back hopelessly,
          clearly at their lowest point.

          PVT. KERNS
          Why'd we get off the chopper,
          Sergeant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          'Cause we have a job to do.

          PVT. IMLAY
          But we were getting out...!

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          You have some hunch and now we're
          stuck out here in the shit?!

          SGT. NANTZ
          That's right. This fight's not
          over.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Sergeant's gonna get us killed!
          Just like my brother.
          A beat. Nantz eyes Correggio. It's laid open now.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Believe me, Correggio, I grieved
          for every marine I ever lost...
          Nantz looks around now, from marine to marine.

          SGT. NANTZ
          But we are in the fight of our
          lives right now. And our duty is
          to keep moving forward. Keep
          fighting. That's how we honor men
          like your brother, Correggio. And
          Lt. Martinez. And Hector's father,
          who saved Adukwu's life. He wasn't
          trained for that. He just picked
          up a rifle and did what needed to
          be done. If a civilian can do
          that...

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          SGT. NANTZ (cont'd)
          Well then I better square my shit
          away and do whatever I have to do
          to defeat this enemy. But I can't
          do it alone.
          Nantz stares. The tension is palpable.

          SGT. NANTZ
          I need you men. And maybe we'll
          die fighting today. Not because
          we're heroes. But because we're
          goddamn United States marines, and
          always will be.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm willing to give my full measure
          for you. I'm hoping you'll do the
          same for me.
          A BEAT, glances exchanged. THEN ALL THE MARINES RISE AS ONE.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Sergeant. We'll follow you to hell
          and back.
          Nantz smiles, nods.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Good. 'Cause that's where we're
          going.

          EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

          The squad is moving in unison, covering all around,
          approaching the LAV. They jump in.

          INT. LAV - CONTINUOUS

          Stavrou fires it up, drives off as... Nantz eyes the jumble
          of gear. He grabs his COMBAT SHOTGUN, a portable RADIO,
          which he makes sure is OFF...
          Then an olive case marked: GLTD. He stuffs it in his pack.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Laser target, sir?

          SGT. NANTZ
          Might have to get some cruise
          missiles in here.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Shit, yes, Sergeant.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

          CPL. STAVROU

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Hostiles. Twelve o'clock.
          Nantz looks up to see...
          ALIEN SOLDIERS appearing on the street now.
          Nantz goes back to stuffing his pack.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Just hit the gas, Corporal. We got
          plenty of armor.
          Everyone looks up at this. Then looks out to see...
          The aliens attacking, FIRING on the LAV as...
          Stavrou floors it, ALIEN FIRE pinging off the LAV's armor
          as... SPLAT!!!

          STAVROU MOWS THROUGH THE ENEMY LINE.
          Nantz looks out the back to see some ALIENS STAGGERING AWAY.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Reverse, Corporal.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Aye, aye, Sergeant.
          As he BACKS UP, mowing back over the remaining aliens... The
          marines cheer.

          EXT. STREET - LATER

          The LAV cruises slowly. Nantz stares forward.
          The BLACK DEAD ZONE looms ahead... As they get closer, it
          seems like the whole area is absent of light. A black hole.
          Nantz stares out, about to answer when the LAV LURCHES, then
          lurches again. Stavrou REVS the engine.

          SGT. NANTZ
          What's going on?

          CPL. STAVROU
          Losing power, Sergeant. Gauges are
          dropping... losing voltage...
          The LAV slows. The engine skips. Then the LAV DIES.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Stavrou?

          CPL. STAVROU
          She's dead, Sergeant.
          Nantz looks around, warily. The streets are quiet, deserted.

          SGT. NANTZ
          All right, dismount. Grab anything
          you think we can use.
          The men nod, and move OUT OF THE LAV to...

          EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Correggio and Kerns on one side of the street, Stavrou and
          Harris on the other. Imlay with Adukwu. Nantz watches his
          men move forward, covering each other's advance. Scanning'
          the buildings, searching for targets...
          Then Nantz halts them. They crouch together, peering at...
          The middle of the DEAD ZONE just ahead of them. It is very
          dark. No lights are visible from any source. The men SWEAT.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Hot as hell here.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          No lights.

          PVT. ADUKWU
          My watch stopped.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Something's generating heat.
          Messing with our electronics.
          Sucking up all the power...
          Nantz scans the street. The sweat dripping into his eyes.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Where would you put a critical
          asset if you wanted to protect it?
          Or hide it?

          CPL. HARRIS
          Underground.
          Nantz points to A SUBWAY ENTRANCE AHEAD.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

          INT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER

          The squad runs to the subway entrance, stopping just inside.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Harris, Adukwu, stay here, watch
          the street.
          Harris and Adukwu nod. Taking position at the entrance.
          Nantz motions to the others.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Let's go.
          Nantz leads Stavrou, Correggio, Kerns and Imlay down the
          stopped escalator to the SUBWAY PLATFORM.
          Nantz stands, gazing around at the empty subway platform.
          Silent. Spooky. A train is stopped. Doors open. It is
          dark, the only light bleeding in from the street above.
          He motions Stavrou to guard against anything coming from
          above. Then he moves forward with the others.
          A huge number of BIRDS line the dark cavity above the train
          tracks, taking cover themselves, roosting quietly.
          Nantz sees a DOOR in the tunnel wall, heads to it.
          He pulls his KA-BAR KNIFE out, sticks the blade into the door
          jam, pops the DOOR OPEN. Nantz turns to Correggio and Kerns.

          SGT. NANTZ

                         (QUIETLY)
          You two stay here, watch our backs.

                         (TO IMLAY)
          Imlay, come with me.
          Nantz and Imlay slip through the doorway.

          INT. UNDERGROUND SERVICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz and Imlay stand very still, peering down the long, dark
          hall, looking for movement. Nantz motions and they move
          forward silently, guns ready.
          They turn a corner and stop. It is PITCH BLACK here.
          Nantz clicks on his flashlight. They move forward. After
          only a few feet, the FLASHLIGHT DIMS AND DIES.
          Imlay clicks on his flashlight.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

          SGT. NANTZ

                         (WHISPERING)
          No. Save it. Something is killing
          anything electronic we use.
          Imlay clicks his flashlight OFF. But now we see...
          A dim light ahead. Nantz and Imlay creep forward, very
          slowly. Turn a corner, see...
          A STRANGE LIGHT at the end of the hallway. THE LIGHT GLOWS
          fiercely, as if it's shining through the floor.
          Nantz, silhouetted by the light, signals Imlay to stay put.
          Nantz steps forward, toward the strange glow of light. As he
          approaches, he realizes it's coming through...
          An IRON GRATE in the floor.
          Nantz moves to the grate, kneels, PEERING DOWN INTO...

          A MASSIVE SUBWAY TUNNEL
          Fifty feet wide, the dim tunnel has been further EXCAVATED.
          It is a huge CAVERN now, extending off into the distance
          further than Nantz can see.
          The huge space is illuminated by MASSES OF ALIEN MACHINERY.
          An ELECTRIC HUM FILLS THE AIR.
          Tending the machinery: DOZENS OF ALIENS, bigger than the
          others.
          One of the ALIENS TURNS, focusing up, right at Nantz.
          Nantz spins, runs back into the darkness. Calling to Imlay:

          SGT. NANTZ
          Run, Imlay! Run!
          BANG. The iron GRATE FLIES into the air.

          INT. DIFFERENT PART OF UNDERGROUND SERVICE TUNNEL

          Nantz and Imlay, race along in the dark. They hear POUNDING
          FOOTSTEPS of the alien pursuing him.
          A glimmer of LIGHT ahead. Along the floor. It is, a DOOR.
          They burst through a DOOR, into...

          A DIM STAIRWELL.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.
          Nantz follows Imlay UP THE STAIRS as...
          The STAIRWELL DOOR below is SMASHED OPEN.
          Nantz spins, swinging his shotgun. HE FIRES.
          BOOM! The blast ILLUMINATES the huge ALIEN, filling the
          stairwell with its horrible bulk.
          Nantz backs up the stairs, pumping the shotgun, firing...
          Each blast ILLUMINATES THE ALIEN in a STROBE EFFECT. The
          alien moves up the stares. Nantz KEEPS FIRING.
          The NOISE IS DEAFENING in the enclosed space.
          Then the SHOTGUN RUNS DRY. And we're left IN DARKNESS.
          Imlay clicks on his FLASHLIGHT, revealing...
          The ALIEN at Nantz' feet, its strange "hand" on his boot.
          Nantz, terrified, aims at the alien, waiting to see if it
          will move. It doesn't.

          INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - MOMENTS LATER

          Nantz and Imlay re-enter, running up to join the others.
          Up the stairs, by street-level, Harris and Adukwu keep watch.
          Harris motions: "ENEMY TROOPS".
          Nantz nods. Signals for all the marines to head down the
          stairs. The marines gather around Nantz. To Harris:

          SGT. NANTZ
          How many?

          CPL. HARRIS
          Hard to tell. A lot.

          SGT. NANTZ
          I think I got their attention.
          Nantz kneels. He opens his pack, pulls out the radio and the
          case marked GLTD.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Look. There's something big down
          in the tunnels. It's sucking up a
          lot of power, could be a major
          Command &.Control asset.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          Nantz stares at his men.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We need to destroy it.

          PVT. KERNS
          But we got no jets left, right,
          Sergeant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          Hopefully, they can still fire
          cruise missiles from Pendleton or
          Vandenburg... I'll radio in a
          strike, paint the target from the
          street. You know what that means.
          The man nod solemnly.

          PVT. IMLAY
          We gotta hold 'em off long enough
          to paint the target.

          CPL. STAVROU
          If we can get a transmission out
          before the radio dies...

          CPL. HARRIS
          And the targeting laser lasts long
          enough for command to get a lock on
          the target.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Hell, dying's easy, ladies.
          Everything else takes balls, right?
          They all laugh softly.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Let's do it.
          He takes a deep breath, raises the radio, and TRANSMITS:

          SGT. NANTZ

                         (TRANSMITTING)
          Any station, this is Foxtrot 2
          November. Priority Fire Mission. I
          have identified a major enemy
          command and control asset-- located
          grid 459083. 1 WILL BE LASING.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

          COMMAND (V.0.)
          Foxtrot 2. You have visual
          confirmation of this C&C asset? We
          can't waste resources.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Affirmative. They're building a
          huge complex underground... I think
          it's the head of the snake.
          Repeat. I will be...

          THE RADIO GOES DEAD.
          Alien fire EXPLODES now, rocking the station.
          BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Nantz and the marines cover their heads
          as the station starts to come apart, chunks of concrete fall.
          The walls crack. Dust fills the air.
          Nantz SCREAMS as a chunk of concrete FALLS ACROSS HIS ANKLE.
          Then, it's over. All is silent. Nantz, GRIMACING in PAIN,
          strains to lift the concrete chunk off his ankle. He GROANS.
          The marines rise. Pale, sweating, Nantz hobbles to his feet.
          He slings his rifle, and carrying the GLTD, hurries on his
          bad ankle to the stairs.
          Nantz looks up. Rubble nearly fills the stairway. There is
          only a small opening of daylight near the ceiling.
          The men all unclip their web gear, begin climbing.

          EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES STREET - MOMENTS LATER

          A chunk of rubble falls from the pile at the subway entrance,
          and Nantz emerges, rolling down the pile to the street.
          The other marines follow, set up a perimeter as..,.
          Nantz takes cover behind a berm of rubble, DROPPING down,
          flattening himself to the ground.
          He sets the GLTD (LASER DESIGNATOR) up on top of the pile.
          Nantz removes his flack jacket and places it over the laser
          designator.

          SGT. NANTZ

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Here we go...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.
          Nantz switches on the TARGETING LASER.
          A RED BEAM OF LIGHT shoots from the designator to a fixed
          point in the center of the street.
          Nantz looks up to see...
          The street fill with ALIEN SOLDIERS rushing out now.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Here they come!
          The marines FORM A PERIMETER AROUND THE LASER, OPENING UP on
          the aliens as...
          The mass of aliens surges forward like a wave.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Hold them back! We have to keep
          the laser on target!
          Nantz FIRES. An alien goes down. He picks another target
          and FIRES. The alien staggers, keeps coming. Three more
          rounds and the alien goes down.
          But the rest KEEP COMING... closing in...

          FOLLOWING THE BEAM OF THE LASER BACK TO NANTZ.
          Nantz is picking his targets. AIMING, FIRING... Turning,
          finding targets, reloading, the aliens getting closer...
          Then his rifle runs dry.
          NANTZ pulls his sidearm. He aim, FIRES, shooting a closing
          alien in its 'heart.' It drops.
          Rounds impact around Nantz as he shoots another alien...
          Then the next. The next. Then his sidearm is out of bullets
          as... An EXPLOSION rips near Nantz.
          Knocking the laser away.
          Nantz struggles...TO THE LASER. RE-AIMING it as...

          MORE ALIENS POUR INTO THE STREET.
          The marines are pushed into a SMALL CIRCLE around the laser.
          Fighting nearly back to back.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.
          Kerns is HIT. He is thrown to the ground, but is back up,
          arm bleeding, firing.
          An alien RUSHES AT CORREGGIO who spins just in time, FIRING
          repeatedly until the alien goes down.
          Stavrou swings his rifle butt, SMASHING another alien. It
          staggers back. Stavrou puts numerous rounds into it.
          An alien reaches ADUKWU, knocking him to the ground, about to
          blast him...
          Harris runs the alien through with his bayonet, twisting and
          firing his rifle at the same time. The alien falls.
          The marines are FIGHTING AS ONE.
          All focused on SURROUNDING NANTZ. THEN THE LASER DIES.
          Imlay notices the laser beam is gone.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Did we get a lock!?

          SGT. NANTZ
          I don't know!
          Then... An ear-splitting NOISE. The marines look up, see...

          A CRUISE MISSILE COMING STRAIGHT DOWN THE STREET!
          Nantz looks up at his men, yelling:

          SGT. NANTZ
          INCOMING! Fall back! This way!
          Nantz and his men begin BACKING AWAY. Firing as they do,
          trying to hold off the aliens.
          Nantz, limping on his injured ankle, GOES DOWN. Correggio is
          there to help him up.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Think you just twisted your ankle,.
          sir.
          And through it all, Nantz still smiles at this.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Don't stop!! We're too close to
          the impact point!!
          The marines start running as...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

          MORE CRUISE MISSILES APPEAR, RIPPING TOWARD THE GROUND...
          BOOOOOM! The first missile strikes!
          Then another...and another ...BOOOOM! BOOOOM!
          A piercing WHISTLE sounds. Nantz looks into the sky as...
          Suddenly KABOOOM!!! A 2000 pound laser-guided ARTILLERY
          SHELL explodes INTO THE GROUND...
          THE GROUND HEAVES UP. A MASSIVE EXPLOSION of fire and smoke
          erupting from beneath the surface.

          A SHOCK WAVE BURSTS OUT FROM THE IMPACT POINT.

          THE MARINES ARE ENVELOPED... DISAPPEARING as...
          Buildings shatter, cars are tossed, flames erupt.
          Then SILENCE descends a moment. Only the crackle of flames,
          falling glass. The dust and ash settles in a grey haze.
          Nothing could have survived this. BEAT. Then...
          A FIGURE RISES UP out of the grey destruction.

          SGT. NANTZ

          MARINES!
          AS ONE, the men rise out of the ash, standing tall.

          SGT. NANTZ

          ON ME!
          The marines fall in. A PHALANX with Nantz at its center.

          SGT. NANTZ

          FIRE!
          They move forward. Precise. Deadly. FIGHTING AS ONE.
          The seven remaining marines POUR FIRE on the mass of aliens.
          The Drone Ships fall from the sky, EXPLODING on the ground.
          The aliens, in disarray, are mowed down. The rest FLEE.
          And as the smoke drifts away, there is silence again.
          Nantz looks up to see...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.
          HIS MEN. His warriors. Standing with smoking weapons, ready
          for more. Correggio staggers up, covered in dust, bloody.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          You know what, Sergeant? My
          brother said you were a bad ass.

                         (SMILES)
          I had no idea...

          SGT. NANTZ
          Your brother was one helluva
          marine, Correggio.

                         (SMILES BACK)
          So are you.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. MEDEVAC HELICOPTER

          Nantz sits in the rumbling chopper. Surrounded by his
          marines. Imlay stares out at the city below.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Man, it's quiet.

          CHOPPER PILOT (V.0.)
          They're in full retreat throughout
          Los Angeles, heading back into the
          ocean. Units are mopping up.
          On this, Nantz turns to his SQUAD. Beat.

          SGT. NANTZ
          This has been a hell of a battle.
          Plenty of other battles to go.
          Everybody good with that?
          The marines don't hesitate.

                         MARINES
          Yes, Sergeant!

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Well, uh, actually, Sergeant...
          there's this girl I was supposed to
          meet up with tonight...

          SGT. NANTZ

                         (SMILES)
          I'm sure she'll understand.
          Nantz looks at his marines.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.

                         NANTZ
          I think you men earned the right to
          call yourselves marines today. I'm
          damn proud of every one of you.
          Retreat!?

                         MARINES

          HELL!

                         ALL

          2/5!!!



                         THE END

                                             November 1987






	A BLACK SCREEN:

	Various voices:	  "Big six"... "That's six the hard way"...
			  "Seven or eleven"... "Play two"...

	FADE IN:

	EXT.  UPPER EAST SIDE - NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

	One of the pristine blocks of brownstones where even the
	garbage seems gift wrapped.  The VOICES continue over as
	we move in on a particular building where a DOORMAN is
	holding open the door for a dowager and her poodle.

	The voices continue:  "Hit me"... "Double down"... "Let it
	ride"... "Hit me"... "Anymore for the come out"...
	"Card"...

	In contrast to the outside of this sedate, quiet
	brownstone, we go inside to find...


	INT.  BROWNSTONE APARTMENT

	... a miniature Las Vegas, complete with music, drinks,
	tuxedoed dealers and croupiers:  roulette, craps, Black
	Jack.  Wall to wall people.  The fact that casino gambling
	happens to be illegal in New York doesn't stop these
	Connecticut slummers, hollow-cheek nightlifers, and junior
	wiseguys from having a good time.

	AT THE CARD TABLE

	NICK CONKLIN, holding a dollar cigar, is trying to pull a
	winning hand.  In his late thirties, Nick has the sort of
	quiet good looks that takes an extra glance to appreciate.
	His Moe Ginsburg rent-a-tux is too tight, his ruffled
	shirt, out of date; Nick could care less.

	Two other players are still in the game.  One of them is a
	lithe DEBUTANTE surrounded by an entourage of giggling
	friends and tuxedoed men.  The pot is huge.

	Nick flips two one hundred dollar chips onto the pot.

					NICK
			One, and one on top.

					DEALER
			House sees.

					PLAYER ONE
				(hesitates)
			I'm out.

	Disgusted, he throws down his cards.

	It's down to Nick and the debutante.  The cocky deb gives
	Nick a long look, confident she can win.

					DEBUTANTE
				(her eyes still on
				 Nick)
			I see the deuce, and one to chase
			them home.

	She throws her chips on the pot.  Nick hesitates, then
	decides to match it.

					NICK
			Call.

					DEBUTANTE
				(showing her hand)
			Ladies, aces wired.  Sorry sport.

	Nick turns over his cards, Jacks and tens, not good enough
	to win.  Elated, the deb gets up from the table and joins
	her giggling friends.  Nick walks over to her.

					NICK
			Very nice, Barbie.
				(pointing toward her
				 boyfriend)
			Now, I'd take Ken over there and go
			home.

					DEBUTANTE
			Why's that?

					NICK
			It's time.  That's all.

					BOYFRIEND
			The lady wants to play.  Someone
			should teach you to be a better
			loser, loser.

					NICK
			Listen, Ken --

					BOYFRIEND
			My name is not Ken --

					NICK
			-- I'm offering you the benefit of
			my experience.

					DEBUTANTE
			Looks like you have a lot of
			experience in places like this.  It
			was nice of them to relax the dress
			code for you.

	That draws a laugh from her friends.  The entourage heads
	for the bar.

	CHARLIE SKLOARIS, twenty-three, steps in front of the
	debutante, blocking her path.

	She steps to the side.  Charlie steps with her.  Charlie's
	pushing it, he's always pushing it.  She's not amused.
	Finally, Charlie lets her pass.  He comes up to Nick.

					CHARLIE
			Typical New York woman, big
			attitude, small apartment, no tits.

	Only two things count to Charlie:  his job and his women,
	but not necessarily in that order.

					CHARLIE
			I think she got to you, pappy.

					NICK
				(checking his watch)
			You want a popsicle, go to Good
			Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'

					CHARLIE
				(glancing at the
				 door)
			Still, you gotta wonder how she'd
			look in handcuffs.

	Nick, wary, eyes this kid.  Charlie shrugs, spreads his
	arms defensively.  The SOUND of pounding on the front
	door.

	THE DOOR

	splinters.  The bouncer steps back as four helmeted
	emergency service officers -- the first members of the
	raiding party -- rush in.

	Pandemonium.  People rush for the exit -- any exit.

	AT THE BAR

	Nick and Charlie hold up their glasses.

					NICK
				(calmly)
			Alley oop.

	They down their drinks, then set them down.

	Charlie pulls out the Binaca, offering Nick a spritz, but
	Nick is already pulling out his POLICE BADGE and hanging
	it around his neck.  Charlie quickly follows suit.

	A HALF DOZEN COPS

	line the patrons up against the wall.  The Asst. D.A.,
	PATTY ZACHARA, climbs onto the crap table.  A petite,
	nervous woman, Patty has dressed in a Channel suit for the
	occasion.

					ZACHARA
			Settle down.  Hey, quiet... Please.

	Not a prayer.

					NICK
			SHUT THE HELL UP, GODDAMNIT!

	That quiets them.

					NICK
			My name is Conklin.  Let's do this
			fast so I can go home.

	Zachara, annoyed, looks at Nick.

					NICK
				(softer)
			It's all yours.

					ZACHARA
				(reads)
			Under section 216 of the New York
			State Penal code, I serve notice
			that this premise and it's
			occupants...

	NICK

	catches the Debutante's eye across the room.  She smiles
	at him, he was right.  He shrugs, spreads his hands.
	That's life.

	A well groomed middle aged man, who we'll come to know as
	CAVELLO, suddenly bolts from the crowd lined up against
	the wall.

	Charlie spins around to stop him --

					CHARLIE
			Whoa -- where do you think you're
			going, hotdog.

	Cavello butts him with his head, sending Charlie to the
	floor.  Then, crosses his arms in front of his face and
	plunges through the WINDOW.

	Nick, not missing a beat, gives a small sigh as he
	follows.

					NICK
				(sighs)
			Fabulous...

	He takes off after him.


	EXT.  STREET UPPER EAST SIDE - NIGHT

	Nick, short of breath, chases Cavello down the residential
	street, past the dog-walkers, past the doormen, past the
	fur-coated women climbing out of taxies... Unfortunately,
	Cavello has a good half block on him.

	From nowhere, Charlie blasts past leaving Nick a half
	block behind, silently cursing his age.

	AT THE CORNER

	a limo jerks to a halt, and Cavello jumps in.  The limo
	streaks away.

	CHARLIE

	turns to see Nick, hands on knees, gasping for air.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  LOCKER ROOM - TWO EIGHT PRECINCT - NIGHT

	Now in their street clothes, Charlie and Nick stand in
	front of the mirrors.  Charlie is working his brush and
	hair dryer as if his life depended on it.  Nick, in
	contrast, shoves his hair back with his fingers and
	glowers at himself in the mirror.

					CHARLIE
				(over the dryer)
			... It's not like you were slow or
			anything... I think you did just
			fine.  I think you did great.

					NICK
			Thanks.

	Nick turns to leave.

					CHARLIE
			Hey, hey, where you goin'?

					NICK
			Home.


	EXT.  POLICE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	Nick strides out the door.  Charlie hurries after him.

					CHARLIE
			Wait up.  You know the guy who did
			the Weismuller through the window --

					NICK
			-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.

	Charlie trails Nick to his motorcycle:  a Harley hog
	complete with wide gleaming fenders and twin tanks.  The
	bike is held together with tape and baling wire.

					CHARLIE
			You know him?

	Nick tries to kick-start this behemoth, but it's not easy.

					NICK
			He works for Frank Abolofia.
			Atlantic City.  Casinos.

					CHARLIE
			So why dive through the glass for a
			nickel and dime bust?

	Charlie puts his foot up on Nick's fender to tie his shoe.
	Nick, spotting an ankle holster peeking from Charlie's
	sock, grabs Charlie's foot.  Charlie teeters.

					NICK
			What's this?

					CHARLIE
			Let go...

	Nick pulls out a Beretta 32.

					CHARLIE
			Back-up.

					NICK
			Get rid of it.

					CHARLIE
			Why?

					NICK
			It's not regulation.  And the only
			way you're gonna stop anybody with
			it is to show it to him, and while
			he's laughing, you can shove it down
			his throat.

					CHARLIE
				(looking at Nick's
				 bike)
			I'll get rid of it when you get rid
			of the egg-beater.

	The Harley comes to life spitting a cloud of blue smoke.
	Nick puts on his paint-flecked helmet, slides down some
	ski goggles.

					CHARLIE
			Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag
			Cavello.

					NICK
			Charlie...

	Nick pops the bike into gear.

					NICK
			... You still got shaving cream on
			your ear.

	Nick rolls out and disappears in a haze of blue smoke.


	EXT.  BELT PARKWAY - VERRAZANO BRIDGE - NIGHT

	WE FIND Nick, a lonely, solitary figure bobbing in and out
	of the lights and shadows.  The SOUND of wind whips
	through his helmet; cold air stings his cheeks... The tail
	lights of Nick's bike disappear into the night.


	EXT.  SUBURBAN STREET - STATEN ISLAND - NIGHT

	Civil service heaven.  Nick hits the cut switch and glides
	past the manicured lawns and well kept houses of this
	development.  A basketball net in every driveway, a Buick
	or Chrysler in every garage.

	One house sticks out.  The lawn is brown, paint is peeling
	off the garage door and newspapers are scattered on the
	driveway.  Nick glides once around the cul de sac looking
	at the house.  His house.  It's as inviting as an open
	grave.  He shoots away.


	INT.  EL GRECO DINER - STATEN ISLAND - NIGHT

	A hanger sized roadhouse, wall to wall red velvet.

	Nick's the sole figure at the counter, coffee and the
	Daily News in front of him.  A NURSE walks in and sits
	down a half dozen seats away.  Nick look up.

					NICK
			Short shift?

					CONNIE
			Yeah... I came to save you.  If
			you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  CONNIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Nick and Connie are in bed.  They're both looking up at
	the ceiling.  They've just made love.

					CONNIE
			It's getting too cold even for me,
			Nick.

					NICK
			Connie...

					CONNIE
			All right, how's the new partner?

					NICK
			High spirits, desire, commitment.

					CONNIE
			You'll take care of that.

					NICK
			Give me a break, would you?

					CONNIE
			If you give me one.

	Nick kisses her.  The first suggestion of real affection.
	The SOUND of someone KNOCKING on the door.  Reluctantly,
	they stop.  Connie gets up and puts on her robe.

					NICK
			Are you expecting anyone?

					CONNIE
			I wasn't expecting you.

	She disappears down the hallway.  We HEAR the door open,
	then telling someone to wait.

					CONNIE
				(poking her head in
				 the room)
			Imagine a small, greasy Boy Scout.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  CONNIE'S APARTMENT

	Nick, wearing only his pants, is doing a slow burn.
	Charlie is holding his hands up defensively.

					CHARLIE
			... I found the goombah... Cavello.
			He's --

					NICK
			-- I should tear your head off.

					CHARLIE
			Whoa, I knew you were going to say
			that.  I absolutely anticipated
			that, Nick.  But I said to myself,
			Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on
			this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll
			be pissed for a moment, but then
			it'll dawn on him --

					NICK
			-- Hey, I got a better chance of
			being hit by a bus then moving up.

	Charlie looks away momentarily, letting it slide.  He
	knows he's on sensitive ground.

					CHARLIE
			... Look... they told me at the
			Greek's you were here.  I'm sorry, I
			never imagined...

					CHARLIE
				(buddy buddy)
			I like her.  She's nice.
				(lowering his voice)
			For her age.

	The bedroom door opens.  Connie enters, dumps Nick's
	clothes on the couch, tosses his gun on top of the pile.
	Without a word, she goes back inside and slams the door
	behind her.

	Nick, pissed, slowly turns to face Charlie.  Charlie
	shrugs.  Nick's got nothing better to do than go.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  LIME HOUSE - CHINATOWN - NIGHT

	The Lime House is a little piece of Italy in the heart of
	Chinatown, and tonight, it's packed.  Any selection on the
	jukebox that isn't Frank Sinatra is Jerry Vale.  Behind
	the bar are two fat BROTHERS.  One pours drinks, the other
	dishes out Scungilli.  It's three a.m.  It's always three
	a.m. at the Lime House.

	AT THE BACK TABLE

	Our man CAVELLO is unloading steaming Scungilli onto an
	already heaping plate in front of an imperious looking
	JAPANESE MAN.  The Japanese Man, in his mid-fifties, wears
	a gray suit, and not a strand of his jet black hair is out
	of place.

	A Japanese TRANSLATOR, doing his best to translate
	Cavello's heavily accented English, sits between them.

	AT THE BAR

	Charlie is looking straight ahead, afraid Cavello might
	peg him.  Nick is at ease.

					CHARLIE
			What are they doing now?

					NICK
			Eating Scungilli, just like the last
			time you asked.

					CHARLIE
			Who do you think the Jap is?

					NICK
			Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru.
			How would I know?

					CHARLIE
			I don't blame you for being sore.
			It'll pass when we bag him.

	Charlie, trying to relax, gestures toward his foot.

					CHARLIE
			Whatdaya think?  'Bostonians'.
			Eighty-five bucks.
				(lowering his voice)
			Girls go for shoes.  Second place
			they look.
				(off Nick's
				 reaction)
			Hey, I read it in a magazine.

	Nick's attention is drawn to a trio walking in the door.

					NICK
				(dead serious)
			Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise
			me?

					CHARLIE
			What?

	WHAT THEY SEE:  TWO BODYGUARDS are making a quick sweep of
	the bar.  FRANK ABOLOFIA, s stocky man with silver grey
	hair, sweeps in behind them.  Abolofia has mitts like a
	meat packer and a fifty dollar manicure.  A heavyweight
	Mafioso.

					NICK
			Frank Abolofia.

					CHARLIE
			The Wolf?

	Abolofia walks to Cavello's table.  All rise and shake
	hands.  The two hitters take seats at the bar.  The two
	brothers scramble to serve their distinguished guests.

					NICK
				(in a whisper)
			Some party.

					CHARLIE
			Maybe we should do something?

					NICK
			Charlie, take your gum, stick it
			under your ass and keep it warm.

	Nick turns away, resumes his drink.

	NICK'S POV IN THE MIRROR BEHIND THE BAR:  two new Japanese
	men step in the door.  Early twenties, spiky hair, dark
	Versace suits.

	NUMBER ONE

	wears tortoise shell shades.  He coolly checks out the
	room then nods to --

	NUMBER TWO

	who pulls a Spas 12, automatic shotgun from under his
	coat, and spits out three rounds.  A window shatters.
	Everyone hits the floor.

	NUMBER ONE

	slowly walks toward Cavello's table.

	NUMBER TWO

	covers the floor.  Abolofia's bodyguards show their empty
	hands.

	NICK AND CHARLIE

	on the floor.  They don't have the artillery for this guy
	either.

	AT THE TABLE

	Our Japanese businessman knows these people.  He eyes them
	contemptuously.

	Abolofia has put enough people in this situation to be
	philosophical about it.  He stops chewing.  A tiny
	hand motion to his bodyguards is enough to stop any
	precipitous action.

					NUMBER ONE
				(in Japanese)
			Give it to me.

	The Japanese businessman looking straight ahead.  A long,
	silent pause... Then, still not facing him:

					BUSINESSMAN
				(in Japanese)
			Go to hell.

	Number One slips his fingers beneath his shades, massaging
	his eyes.  IN A FLASH, he pulls a shuto from under his
	coat.  The 18 inch blade gleams like a neon tube.

	He presses the tip of the blade against the businessman's
	throat.

	CHARLIE

	his hand close around the grip of the Beretta.  He unsnaps
	the ankle holster.  The SNAP can be heard across the room.
	Nick's hand closes around Charlie's and squeezes till the
	knuckles turn white.

					CHARLIE
				(in a whisper)
			What are you doing?

					NICK
			Saving your life.

	NUMBER TWO

	levels the scattergun at Nick and Charlie.

	AT THE TABLE - NUMBER ONE

	calmly holds the blade at the man's throat as he reaches
	into the man's jacket and removes a small, rectangular,
	plastic-wrapped parcel.

	He feels its weight, then flips it to NUMBER TWO.

	Abolofia, realizing that whatever is going on doesn't
	affect him or his, resumes eating.

					ABOLOFIA
			You people are wild... Wild.

	NUMBER ONE backs the blade off.  The man raises his napkin
	to the small wound.  A droplet of blood has stained his
	shirt collar.  NUMBER ONE turns around as if to leave.

	What happens next could be a whim, an after thought.
	Number One spins around and THRUSTS the blade deep into
	the man's chest.  He withdraws it with a half twist, and
	in the same motion fatally slashes the translator's throat
	before the old man's body hits the floor.

	Blood pours from the businessman's mouth onto his
	Scungilli, spreading across the white cloth and onto the
	floor.

	CAVELLO

	reaches for a gun under his coat.  But NUMBER TWO pumps
	two rounds into his face.  At this range, there's not much
	left.

	The killers slowly back out the door, covering the room
	with the scattergun.  The minute the door shuts, Nick
	leaps up, pulling his shield and revolver.

					NICK
				(shouting)
			Police officers.  Everybody stay
			put.
				(to Charlie)
			Get back up.

	Abolofia's eyebrows rise at this development.

	Nick bolts out the door leaving Charlie in charge.  He's
	never been in charge before.

					CHARLIE
				(nervously showing
				 shield)
			Police.


	EXT.  THE LIME HOUSE - NIGHT

	A Lincoln tears around the corner to pick the killers up.

	Nick flies out the Lime House door and hits the ground.

	Number Two pumps out shells as fast as he can squeeze the
	trigger.  He's wild.  The front windows of the Lime House
	shatter.

	The LIMO DRIVER jerks to a halt.  Number Two tosses the
	package to him.

	Nick empties his revolver.  Number Two goes down.

	The driver floors the accelerator, leaving Number One to
	take off on foot.  Nick follows, reloading as he runs.


	INT.  THE LIME HOUSE

	Everyone's frozen on the floor.

					CHARLIE
			Call 911.  Tell them an officer
			needs assistance.  Say ten thirteen.

	Nothing from the owner who looks at Abolofia.  Charlie
	grabs the owner by his collar and shoves him toward the
	phone.

					CHARLIE
			Do it, you dumb bastard!

	Suddenly Charlie feels something wet at his feet.  He
	looks down to see that he's standing in a pool of blood
	from the massacre.  So much for his new shoes.

	He wheels around, then quickly backs out the door.


	EXT.  STREET - DOWN THE BLOCK FROM THE LIME HOUSE

	Deserted.  The wail of police sirens in the distance.
	Charlie has his gun out.  He's drenched in sweat.  Where
	is his partner?

					CHARLIE
			NICK...!  Shit... SHIT!!

								 CUT TO:

	ANOTHER STREET - ALLEY - NIGHT

	Nick, gun drawn, slowly rounds the corner to the alley:
	it's the ad hoc drugstore for the night.  Drugs going up
	and down in pails, two dozen junkies buying, shooting,
	slumped on the ground.  Everyone scatters -- the one's
	that can.

	AN ABANDONED PAIL

	swings slowly back and forth from three stories up.  Nick
	cautiously moves down the alley, holding the gun in both
	hands.  A Junkie steps out of a doorway, Nick swings his
	gun and nearly blows him away.

	NUMBER ONE

	We see his eyes first as he steps out of the darkness at
	the back of the alley.  From now on we'll call him KOBO.
	His sunglasses are on his forehead; his hands dropped
	casually at his side.  A very cool character.

	Kobo slowly raises his hand, and making a gun with his
	finger, slowly points and "shoots" at Nick... He lowers
	his hand.

					NICK
			On the ground, man.  NOW!!

	Kobo cups his hands around his ear.  He doesn't understand
	English.  Nick, keeping his gun fixed, comes up to him and
	kicks out his legs.

	Kobo falls flat on his chest.

	Nick pulls out his cuffs.  But Kobo lunges for Nick's
	ankle and yanks it toward him.  Nick stumbles backward;
	Kobo's on his feet.  Before Nick can stand, Kobo lands a
	brutal kick to the side of Nick's head.

	Nick gets up, barrels into him.  Kobo knees Nick in the
	solar plexus, then lands two more well placed kicks in
	Nick's back.  It's not that Nick's a bad fighter, it's
	that this kid is so damn fast.

	Nick slowly gets to his feet.  KOBO lands two more brutal
	shots to the side of Nick's head.  He's a bloody mess.

	TWO POLICE CARS

	stop at the end of the alley.  FOUR OFFICERS climb out.

	CHARLIE

	joins the cops as they run down the alley to find Nick
	getting pummeled.

	Charlie shoots at Kobo.  Misses.  Kobo turns to see the
	five cops, guns drawn.

	Nick, on one knee, spits out blood and a few teeth.

	Kobo calmly slips the shuto out of his coat pocket and
	drops it next to Nick.  The blade gleams in the light.
	That was next.  Nick got lucky.

	Kobo towers imperiously above Nick.  Their eyes lock.  We
	hold then...

								 FADE TO BLACK.

	FADE IN:

	NICK'S LIVING ROOM - STATEN ISLAND - MORNING

	There isn't a stick of furniture, but that's not the half
	of it.  In the middle of the room is a motorcycle on a
	centerstand.  A drop cloth is spread around it, tools
	neatly aligned.  It's a Harley -- but this one is in
	perfect condition.

	A phone RINGS insistently from off screen, then stops.

					NICK (O.S.)
			Yeah... sure, sure I'll be down.

	Nick walks in, naked.  Every muscle aches.  One side of
	his face is completely swollen.  He has a band-aid over
	his right eye; some blood caked on his earlobe.  He stops
	to twist a spark plug in with a ratchet, but it snaps.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  EIGHT - THREE PRECINCT - DAY

	CAPT. OLIVER, early forties, walks between Charlie and
	Nick as they head toward the Medical Examiner's room.
	Oliver doesn't face Nick as he speaks; no love lost
	between these two.

					OLIVER
			How big a package we talking about?

					NICK
				(holding up his
				 hands)
			This by this...

					OLIVER
			Dope?

					NICK
			Not in that company.

					OLIVER
			The old man was a Japanese paper
			manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental
			car were full of it.

					CHARLIE
			Full of what?

					OLIVER
				(annoyed)
			Art and stationary paper.  Cavello
			had five hundred thousand in his
			attache case.

	Nick rubs the back of his neck in obvious pain.

					OLIVER
			One guy do all the damage?

					NICK
			Yeah.

					OLIVER
			Thought you knew your way around
			dark alleys, detective.

	Oliver goes through the swinging doors into the Examiner's
	room.  Charlie shoots Nick a look.  Nick let's it slide.


	INT.  MEDICAL EXAMINATION ROOM

	A TECHIE is showing the night's harvest to Charlie, Nick
	and Oliver.  They're standing over the body of the middle-
	aged Japanese man.

					TECHIE
			... The old man's suit was Japanese.
			The hitter's was Saville row.  No
			I.D.  We're doing a peel now.

	AT ANOTHER TABLE

	Another techie is carefully removing the skin from Number
	Two's fingertips.

	Charlie shuts his eyes and turns away, trying not to throw
	up.

					TECHIE
			There's something you got to see.

	He whips back the sheet, the body is nude.  A towel covers
	the genitals.  Except for the feet, hands, neck, and face,
	the body is covered with elaborate tattoos:  flowers and
	blood, dragons and snakes.

					TECHIE
			What's wrong with this picture?

					CHARLIE
				(nervously)
			I got a tattoo.  Birdie on the ball.
			We all got them when we finished
			basic at Camp Lejune.

					NICK
			Charlie.

					TECHIE
			I thought you guys were trained
			observers?

	They look up surprised.  The techie picks up a hand.  The
	third and forth fingers have been neatly amputated.

					TECHIE
			Eight fingers.
				(ironically)
			Hey, it was a trick question.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

	ABOLOFIA is seated in chair next to his LAWYER.  Nick,
	Oliver, and a third detective are grilling him.

					ABOLOFIA
			He was with a friend, sure.  I shake
			hands with the guy and a minute
			later he's bleeding all over my
			socks.

					ATTORNEY
			Will that do officers?  My client
			has had a terrible shock.

					NICK
			Yeah, he's not used to seeing other
			people do the killing.

					ATTORNEY
			I won't tolerate harassment!

					OLIVER
			What about the package?

					ATTORNEY
			We know nothing about it.

	Silence.  Abolofia looks at Nick, then at Oliver.

					ABOLOFIA
			Hard to believe a trained police
			officer could let this kind of thing
			happen right in front of his face.

					NICK
			I did make a mistake.  I let the
			wrong guy get hit.

	Abolofia doesn't blink an eye, goes for the jugular.

					ABOLOFIA
			Cheer up, Nick.  I'm sure it's
			easier to pick a dead man's pocket.

	Nick springs from his feet.  Oliver grabs Nick before he
	can get close to Abolofia.

					ATTORNEY
			That's it, we're through!

								 CUT TO:

	KOBO

	the Japanese killer who smashed in Nick's face last night.
	He's sitting in an interrogation room an hour later with a
	DETECTIVE and a JAPANESE TRANSLATOR.  He won't talk.

	OBSERVATION ROOM

	Nick and Oliver watching through the glass.

					OLIVER
			Doesn't speak a word of English.
			And he won't speak Japanese either.
			No papers.  The Japanese embassy is
			very interested.

					NICK
			Why?

					OLIVER
			He's wanted in Japan.  They want him
			first.  Then we can have him.

					NICK
			What?

	Oliver nods.  That's the way it is.

	ON KOBO

	he turns and looks at Nick.  He can't possibly see him
	through the one way glass but he knows Nick's there.

	ON NICK

	looking at him.

	ON KOBO

	making a cutting mark across his forehead, right where
	Nick's bandage is.  It's uncanny.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  OLIVER'S OFFICE - LATER

	Nick is sitting in front of Oliver's desk.  The sunlight
	makes him wince; wincing makes his face hurt.

					OLIVER
			Japanese embassy talks to state
			department.  State talks to police
			plaza.  They to me and me to you.
			Shit rolls down hill.

	Oliver drops a file folder on the desk.  Nick opens it:
	petty cash, vouchers and plane tickets.

					OLIVER
			You and Charlie are taking the Jap
			home, tonight.

					NICK
			What...?  What if I say no?

					OLIVER
			Check your gun before you leave.
			They're not allowed in Japan.  It's
			a nice, safe country.

					NICK
			Why me?

					OLIVER
			They said send a detective if I
			could spare one.
				(then)
			I can always spare you.

	Nick bridles at the insult.  Oliver's had a hard-on for
	Nick for years, and Nick's tired of it.

					NICK
				(soft)
			You got something to say to me,
			Captain?

	Oliver doesn't want to get into it.

					OLIVER
			Yeah.  Have a wonderful flight.

								 CUT TO:

	THE ORANGE SUN

	on the tail of a Japan Airlines 747.  A driving rain
	storm.  The plane taxies down the runway and disappears
	into the black rain.


	INT.  AIRLINER

	Kobo, handcuffed and shackled, is in the center seat.
	Nick and Charlie sit on either side.  Charlie is holding
	"Bachelors Japan" in one hand.  Nick's in a sour mood.

					CHARLIE
			... Nick, you're the one that's
			always saying you never go anywhere.

					NICK
			I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie.
			Maybe Vegas.

					CHARLIE
			What are you missing?  Riding your
			motorcycle to the nurse's house.
			That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.

					NICK
			Beats forty hours on a plane.

					CHARLIE
			They say we got to turn around and
			come right back.  That's what they
			say.  I got a plan.

	The last thing Nick wants to hear -- too late.

					CHARLIE
			I call, right?  I say I got the
			dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits
			from some raw clam and we stretch it
			into three days.  You and I become a
			driving force on the local Geisha
			scene.

					NICK
			Not a prayer.

					CHARLIE
				(grinning)
			Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop
			from New York.  You're gonna be the
			biggest thing to hit town since
			Godzilla.

	Nick can't help but smile at this kid.  Charlie looks down
	at the guide book.

					CHARLIE
			Says here, it's very impolite to
			touch someone while you're talking
			to them...
				(nudges Kobo)
			Guess that means you can't talk and
			screw at the same time, huh, hotdog?
			What's the matter, no -- speaky-the-
			language?  Understand this:  You
			will never ever fuck with my partner
			again.

	Nothing from Kobo who is looking straight ahead.  He
	doesn't understand.

					NICK
			Shut-up, Charlie.

	A beat, then Charlie reads a Japanese phrase from the
	book.  A slight facial response from Kobo.  Charlie tries
	it again.  This time Kobo laughs openly.

					NICK
			What'd you say?

					CHARLIE
			Where is the subway station, please.

	Kobo keeps laughing; it's obviously not what Charlie said.

					NICK
			Get a new book.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  AIRLINER - LATER

	The cabin is now darkened.  Kobo and Nick are asleep.  Not
	Charlie, he's still at his book, and listening to U2 on
	his Walkman.  Nick rolls over and opens his eyes to see
	Charlie watching him.  He shuts them hoping to avoid talk.
	Too late.

					CHARLIE
			Nick... You up?

					NICK
			No.

	Charlie removes his headphones.

					CHARLIE
			Nick, have I been a good partner?

					NICK
			Number five with a bullet.

	Nick shuts his eyes.

					CHARLIE
			I just want you to know... I mean
			anybody who says you ever took has
			got to deal with me.

					NICK
			Go to sleep, Charlie.

					CHARLIE
			You didn't take, did you...?  You
			hear things.

	Nick opens his eyes.

					NICK
			I worked the three nine in Queens,
			Charlie.

					CHARLIE
				(surprised)
			I didn't know.

					NICK
			The lieutenant was on the pad along
			with the rest of the squad.  I was
			new, didn't know shit.  When the
			feathers flew, I got called in front
			of the special prosecutor.  It's on
			the top of my personnel file.  They
			think I'm dirty or I cut a deal.
			Doesn't leave you with a lot of
			friends either way.

	Nick shuts his eyes.

					NICK
			I might as well have done something.
			I've been paying for it every
			goddamn day since I got
			transferred...

	HOLD on Nick then...

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  NARITA AIRPORT - JAPAN - DAY

	Nick and Charlie, with Kobo between them, are a strange
	sight in a sea of Japanese faces.  Kobo's hands are cuffed
	behind his back.  Nick also has Kobo cuffed to his wrist.
	The cops are rumpled, exhausted, showing two days of
	stubble.  Kobo looks sharp and wide awake.

	A pair of attractive teenage girls walks past them.

					CHARLIE
			Whoa.  Nick, we're in paradise.

	A PAIR

	of white gloved hands belonging to a Tokyo police officer
	holds up a small, hand letter sign that says:
	CONKLIN/SKLOARIS.  The man holding the sign is NAGASHIMA.
	Two other police officers in spotless tan uniforms stand
	at his side.

	Nick, holding Kobo by his arm, steps up to the police and
	show his I.D.  Nagashima bows.

					NAGASHIMA
			Officers Conklin and -- and...
				(he can't say
				 Charlie's name)
			... gentlemen, welcome.  I am
			assistant inspector Nagashima.

	They show their I.D.

					NICK
			You going to take this crap off our
			hands?

					NAGASHIMA
				(confused)
			Crap...?  Oh, the prisoner.  Yes.

	He barks some orders to the officers who immediately take
	Kobo by the arms and put cuffs on him.  Nick unfastens
	his cuff when they're through.

	In contrast to Nagashima's gentility, the cops are rough
	with the prisoner.

					CHARLIE
				(extends his hand)
			Charlie.  Kon-ich-iwa.

	Nagashima shakes his hand.  Bows.  Charlie bows back.
	Nick wouldn't bow if his life depended on it.  Nagashima
	hands Nick an official looking document.

					NAGASHIMA
			If you will please give this to the
			customs inspector he will expidate
			-- expedite you.  We have a car and
			a driver outside.

					NICK
			Right.

					CHARLIE
				(bows)
			Arigato.

	Nick grabs Charlie by the arm and starts for the customs
	line.

			Givin' you a book is like givin' a

			Hey, when in Rome --

					NICK
			In Rome, I'll bow.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  CUSTOMS BOOTH - DAY

	NICK and CHARLIE make their way through the crowd toward
	the head of a long line.  They dump their bags on the
	counter.  The INSPECTOR, furious that they have taken cuts
	in line, barks at them in Japanese.

					NICK
			Inspector Nagashima told me to give
			you this.

	He hands the Inspector the official looking document.  The
	Inspector scans the paper.  Hands it back to them.

					INSPECTOR
				(broken English)
			You must get in line behind the
			rest.

					NICK
			We're cops.  Pol-ice-men.

	The Inspector signals a nearby POLICEMAN.  The Inspector
	says something in Japanese.  Hands the policeman the
	document.  The policeman shakes his head, amused, points
	to the end of the line.

					NICK
			Fellas, get serious.

	From off screen someone CALLS OUT:

					MAN (O.S.)
			Nick!

	Nick and Charlie turn to see KOBO, their prisoner,
	standing on the other side of the thick plastic divider.
	The handcuffs are off.  The three alleged 'policemen' are
	heading out the door behind him.  It was a set-up:  Nick
	and Charlie have been had.

					KOBO
				(perfect English)
			Thanks for the ride, detective.

	He slowly backs away from the glass as if he had all the
	time in the world, finally disappearing in the crowd.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK AND CHARLIE

	trying to shove past the customs inspectors who are
	wrestling them aside.

					NICK
			Cops!  He's our prisoner!

	Two more policemen arrive.  Nick and Charlie are thrown up
	against the wall.  Out come the cuffs.  SNAP!

					NICK
			What's going on?  We're the good

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  TOKYO POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	Fifty identical desks.  Fifty identical phones.  Fifty
	identically dressed men in white shirts and ties working
	under the fluorescent lights of this large open room.

	We GLIDE PAST the rows of desk to find INSPECTOR OHASHI,
	mid forties, sitting behind a perfectly arranged desk.
	Ohashi prides himself on order.

	Nick and Charlie are standing in front of him.

					NICK
			Get me something like an Identi-Kit
			and I'll give you a description.

	Ohashi remains poker faced.  He continues to arrange
	papers and apply his hanko (personal seal) to the bottom
	of a stack of official papers.

					CHARLIE
			There must be some witnesses from
			the airport?

	Still nothing from the good inspector.

					NICK
			What is it, tea time?

	Still nothing from Ohashi.  Finally:

					OHASHI
				(quiet rage)
			You lost a man we wanted for some
			time.  It was very incompetent on
			your part, officer.

					NICK
			Incompetent is letting people waltz
			through a secure area wearing your
			uniforms, carrying official
			documents.

	Ohashi bows slightly, we're not sure why.

					NICK
			I want a gun.

					OHASHI
			It is not allowed.

					NICK
			We're police officers.

					OHASHI
			You're foreigners.

					NICK
			Work with me.  I want your best
			detective.

	Pause.  Ohashi returns to his papers.  Nick can't believe
	it.

					NICK
			Hey, inspector, I don't intend to
			take the rap for this.

					OHASHI
				(not looking up)
			Do you know what this is?

	Ohashi holds up the document that was handed to Nick at
	the airport.

					OHASHI
			It's a laundry list.  Go home,
			detective.

	Nick studies him for a beat, then turns away.  To Charlie:

					NICK
			Let's go.

					CHARLIE
			Nick, we can't just --

					NICK
			I said let's go, Charlie.

	Reluctantly they head towards the door, passing long rows
	of bureaucrats, telephones ringing off the hook.  Nick
	stops at the door, spots a fuse box nearby.  He glances
	back to make sure no one is looking.

	Nick pulls out his handcuffs.  Charlie can't figure out
	what the hell he's doing.  Nick attaches one cuff to the
	main lever then yanks it down.

	The lights go out.  The fan's stop; so do the typewriters;
	so does the air conditioning.  Dead silence.

	Nick attaches the other cuff to a pipe, snaps it shut.
	Now it's impossible to left the main lever.

	From the far end of the room:

					OHASHI
			What are you doing?!

	Nick drops the key down the water fountain drain.

					NICK
			Your best detective, Ohashi.

	EXT.  POLICE STATION - DAY

	Nick and Charlie cross the street.  Charlie's trying to
	read the name from the piece of paper Ohashi has given
	them.

			... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto.
			Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our
			side.

					NICK
			Let's grab some food.

					CHARLIE
			First decent idea you've had.

	Charlie pulls out his 'Footloose in Tokyo" book, flips
	through the pages.

					CHARLIE
			Food... Food, here we go.  Tokyo
			offers a wide variety of food.  It's
			best to sample the local
			specialties, including sashaimi,
			soba, and world renown Kobe beef...

	Nick goes into a restaurant.  Charlie drops the book,
	disgusted with Nick's choice.  Charlie reluctantly follows
	him in.  REVEAL it's a Shakey's Pizza restaurant.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  HOUSING PROJECT - SHIN OKUBO - DAY

	Rows of post-modern buildings of odd shaped windows and
	brightly painted concrete walls.  Nick and Charlie are
	searching for the Japanese cop's building.  They can't
	speak the language; they can't read the signs; and half
	the buildings don't have numbers.  It's a nightmare.

					CHARLIE
			This should be it...

					NICK
			You said that in the last two
			places.

	Charlie holds out the paper to a passing man.

					CHARLIE
			Kore?  Doku?  Kore doku?

	The man gestures toward the building Charlie was pointing
	to.

					NICK
			Okay, you were right.

	Charlie grins, satisfied.


	INT.  HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - CORRIDOR - DAY

	The boys are knocking on a door.  Nick turns the handle.
	It's unlocked.

	THE APARTMENT

	A four tatami room.  An unholy mess:  Food packages, beer
	bottles, stacks of papers and file folders.  Framed
	pictures of long dead relatives hang on the wall.

					CHARLIE
			This the right place?

					NICK
			I hope not.

	A WOMAN now appears at the door.  Middle aged, wizened
	face, in a full traditional Kimono.

					CHARLIE
			Konichiwa.  Ichiro Matsumoto?

	The woman babbles bird-like in rapid Japanese.  She bows.
	They're in the right place.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  SIDE STREET - MINIMAI MURAMATSU - NIGHT

	The jammed streets are barely wide enough to get a

	poorest in Tokyo.

	We spot the small kimono clad WOMAN, clip-clopping on
	wooden geta, leading Nick and Charlie through this
	labyrinth.

					CHARLIE
				(looking around)
			Getting very weird.

					NICK
			I'd feel better if we had some heat.

					CHARLIE
			Maybe we should bail?

	Seeing they've stopped, the woman gestures for them to
	hurry up, then disappears around the corner.

					NICK
				(looking at the maze
				 of streets)
			Think we could find our way back?

								 CUT TO:

	A GARISH PINK SIGN - PINK SARON BAR

	A poor man's idea of a bar.  The woman points inside,
	chirps away in Japanese, bows, then hurries off leaving
	Nick and Charlie on their own.

	INSIDE PINK SARON

	Nick and Charlie disappear into darkness as the woven
	flaps shut behind them.  A vintage wurlitzer juke box
	glows across the room.  An Enka plays.  (Haunting Japanese
	blues.)

					MAN'S VOICE (FROM THE DARKNESS)
			Big shots from New York.  I like
			your style!

	ICHIRO MATSUMOTO steps into a pool of light just inches
	from them.  He is a short overweight man looking every
	minute of his fifty-five years.  His white short sleeve
	shirt is too tight; his narrow tie spotted in the middle;
	his collar soaked in sweat.  He's not drunk yet, but he's
	been at it a while.  Call him Ich.

					ICH
				(bowing)
			Detective Ichiro Matsumoto.  I'm the
			man you're looking for.

	This is Ohashi's best man?  Well, at least he speaks
	English.

					ICH
			The man you are looking for, Kobo,
			was a member of the Samaguchi-gummi.
			A Yakuza.

	Ich nods, offers them what's left of his Sapphoro beer.
	They shake their heads.  Ich finishes it.

					NICK
			Where do we start looking for this
			guy?

					ICH
			Where would you look for the mafia?

					CHARLIE
			The back room at Lombardi's after
			the Columbus Day Parade.  Under the
			bed.  In the mayor's office.
			Everywhere.

	Ich heads for the door without saying a word.

					NICK
			Where're you going, Ichiro?

					ICH
				(stops, faces them)
			The mayor's office, under the bed,
			the back room at Lombardi's.
				(tucking in his
				 shirt tail)
			And call me Ich.

	INT.  ICHIBANKAN BAR BUILDING - KABUKI CHO - NIGHT

	Imagine an ultra modern indoor shopping mall, except there

	automated doormen.


	INT.  LAS VEGAS WELCOME CLUB

	Hip, younger Japanese are wedged together at the long
	chrome bar.  The GUYS sport leather jackets and Raybans.
	The GIRLS are decked out in fifties American party dresses

			To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.

			No, this is the place for the young
			Yakuza.

					NICK
			That's what you said in the last
			three piss pots.

	Ich sets down his drink, pours more sake for Nick and
	Charlie then for himself.  He's having a great time.

					ICH
			I love you people.  The music, the
			clothes, the movies... Japanese
			respect only what is Japanese.

	Nick glances at Charlie.

					NICK
			It's incredible.  Hit him or
			something.

					CHARLIE
			I don't think he'd feel it.

					ICH
				(beginning to slur
				 his words)
			Americans change everything.  When I
			was young the city was wood and
			paper... I was ten when the bombers
			came.  I lived underground for three
			days.  When I came up, the city was
			gone... A ball of fire.

	Nick gets to his feet.  Ich grabs him by the arm, stopping
	him.

					ICH
			It began to rain, Nick.  You know
			what color the rain was?

	Ich doesn't give him a chance to answer.

					ICH
			Black... It was black from the ash.
			Very impressive.  You Americans, you
			could make black rain.

	Ich polishes off his drink.  An awkward silence.  Charlie,
	wanting to lighten the mood --

					CHARLIE
				(leaning close)
			Say Ich, between friends, where can
			I grab some squish around here?

	Nick sighs, digs in his pocket for some yen for the bill.

					ICH
			Squid?

					CHARLIE
			Pussy, ass, soft personnel.

	Ich looks up to see a picturesque, blood-haired American
	WOMEN in a tight silk blouse and skirt.  She works here
	and has obviously heard Charlie.

					ICH
			Ah, Joyce...
				(in Japanese)
			How are you tonight?

					JOYCE
				(in Japanese)
			Hello, Ich.  Johnny Walker?

	Ich nods.  Joyce's Japanese is impeccable.  She's a part-
	time bartender, translator, model.  One of Japan's western
	wanderers.  She's sliding past thirty, but only her weary
	eyes give it away.  She is about to pour Ich another
	drink.

					NICK
			Don't give him any more.

					JOYCE
			He gets as much as he wants.

	Charlie extends his hand to Joyce.  She ignores it.

					CHARLIE
			Hello hello, Charlie Skloaris.  New
			York City.

	She refills Ich's glass.

					CHARLIE
			My partner and I are cops.
				(lowering his voice)
			We're on a very big assignment here.
				(nothing from Joyce)
			When do you get off?

					JOYCE
			Right when you're being tucked into
			bed.

	Cold.

					ICH
			You should be nicer to my American
			friends, Joyce.

					JOYCE
			They wouldn't appreciate it, Ich.
			Trust me.

	She says something in Japanese to Ich as she eyes the
	cops.  Then, she walks off.

					ICH
			Joyce can be nice.

					CHARLIE
				(brightening)
			What'd she say?

					ICH
				(big smile)
			That I should let you pay for the
			drinks.

					NICK
				(frustrated, to a

			What's the problem here?

	The cabbie ignores them.

					WOMAN (O.S.)
			You don't speak the language.  I'll

	They turn to see Joyce standing behind them.

					ICH
			Ah, Joyce...

	The rest is slurred Japanese.  Joyce speaks to a cabbie in
	Japanese.  The rear door swings open.  She helps Ich in.
	Joyce climbs in.

					ICH
				(out the window)
			See you tomorrow!

	The taxi pulls away.  Nick and Charlie watch it go.

			Not a prayer.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  STREET - FOUR A.M.

	An early morning wind jostles the red paper lantern and

	sidestreet on the way back to their hotel.

					CHARLIE
			... He's a sorry old guy, but I like

					NICK
			He couldn't find his ass with both

	A brand new Kawasaki 1000 motorcycle with windshield and

				(muttering)
			Sure, a rice burning crotch

					CHARLIE
			Nick, how we gonna bag this guy
			without any help?  Maybe I should

	Nick glances over at his partner, smiles.  But before he
	can respond --

	The DULL ROAR of a half dozen motorcycles in the distance
	breaks the pre-dawn stillness.

	TWENTY BOSOZOKU (BIKERS)

	on their multi-cylinder high tech street bombers, creep
	around the corner and slowly ride toward Nick and Charlie.

	We get a better look at them:  turbo punk Elvis-samurai
	hybrids -- some wearing a slipper under their headbands,
	courtesy of their girlfriends; some in leopard skin pants.
	And tattoos...

	They head straight for Nick and Charlie, then, at the last
	moment, split and float away IN SLOW MOTION, as if the
	cops didn't exist.

	Suddenly, the street is empty again.  Silent except for
	the SOUND of the wind beating against paper lanterns,
	rustling the wind chimes...

	Hold on Nick and Charlie standing in the middle of the
	street, realizing just how far away from home they are.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  HOTEL - THE NEXT MORNING

	A rocket shaped building:  a mixture of Dutch Gable and
	Japanese Minka roof.  The mid-day sun beats down on a

	INT.  HOTEL ROOM

	Nick and Charlie are sacked out.  They never bothered to

			Give us a break...

					ICH (O.S.)
			It's Ichiro.  Ich.

					NICK
			Leave the rice cake outside and go

	The murder scene.  NO SOUND.

	A SERIES OF SHOTS:

	A BODY FROM THE WAIST DOWN in the claws of six foot
	working robotic.  The tattooed covered legs swing back and
	forth like a pendulum.

	THE TORSO is wedged in between two enormous printing
	rollers.

	THE HEAD is resting in the middle of a conveyer belt.
	It's been drenched in black printer's ink which has begun
	to congeal.

	WE SLOWLY TRACK PAST Ich, Charlie, and Nick, watching.
	Charlie has the dry heaves.

	REAL SOUND as we reveal the full crime scene.  Instead of
	the usual cigar smoke, camera flashes and radio chatter,
	there is order and quiet.  A slow underwater dance.

	INSPECTOR OHASHI

	quietly gives an order.  Someone turns off the robotic.
	The severed legs stop swinging.

	Nick, Charlie and Ich walk over to Ohashi.  Ich bows
	deeply.  Ohashi doesn't acknowledge any of them, talks to
	a man holding a tape measurer.

					NICK
			Could you fill me in?

					OHASHI
			Why don't you ask your chief
			detective?

	Ich looks down at the floor.

					NICK
			Because I want you to tell me.

					OHASHI
			The young are eating the old,
			something that usually doesn't
			happen here.

					NICK
			Can we skip the poetry, inspector?

	Ohashi pauses.  Ich looks at Nick as if to warn him he
	can't speak to Ohashi that way.

					OHASHI
			There's a war, detective, between
			two rival groups.  The man who
			escaped, Kobo, leads the younger
			group.  They did this.

					ICH
			Kobo's a wild boy.  He was a
			lieutenant in the Sammaguchi-gummi.

					OHASHI
				(in Japanese)
			Excellent, Officer Matsumoto.  How
			is your investigation going?

					ICH
				(in Japanese)
			Well, sir.  Thank you for giving me
			the opportunity to work with these
			distinguished gentlemen.

	He bows.  It's pathetic.

					POLICE LIEUTENANT
			Looking for clues in the bottom of a
			sake bottle, Matsumoto?

	Laughter all around.

					OHASHI
			He's an officer of great
			distinction.

	Another sarcastic dig.  Ich stoically stands and takes it.

					CHARLIE
			Hey, Ich has been helpful.

					OHASHI
				(ignoring him, to
				 Nick)
			Have you changed your mind and
			decided to go home, detective?

					NICK
			Not until one of us bags Kobo.
				(looking at the
				 corpse)
			And it doesn't look like you're
			doing so hot.

	Ohashi coolly flicks the ashes of his cigarette and we --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  PRINTING PLANT - DAY

	Ich, Nick, and Charlie are threading their way through the
	crowd toward the subway entrance.

	TWO BIKERS, their hair slicked back, watch the trio from
	the top of two different subway entrances.

	As soon as Ich, Nick and Charlie go down the steps, they
	climb off their bikes and follow.


	INT.  SUBWAY STATION

	Nick, Ich and Charlie are riding the people mover that
	stretches the length of this endless tunnel.  They're
	sandwiched between the legions of SALARYMEN (white collar
	workers) who all wear identical blue suits and white
	shirts.

	Nick looks over at Ich, who is still suffering in silence
	from the recent humiliation.

					NICK
			You know, Inspector, you take shit
			once, you take shit forever.

					ICH
				(beat)
			I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.

					NICK
			Why the hell not?

					ICH
			I don't, that's all.

	Ich looks away, obviously uncomfortable.

					CHARLIE
			You cool, Ich?

					ICH
			Cool?

					CHARLIE
			You all right?  You okay?

	Ich nods.

					CHARLIE
			What does Ichiro mean, anyway?

					ICH
				(smiling)
			What does Charlie mean?

					CHARLIE
			Hey, all right.

	Charlie slaps Ich on the back.

	NICK smiles at Charlie's remark.  He can't help but like
	this wide-eyed goofy kid.

	Something makes Nick's smile fade.

	NICK'S POV

	KOBO, their escaped prisoner, hurrying in the opposite
	direction.  His Kamali suit looks like it just came from
	the cleaners.

					NICK
			Charlie!

	Charlie spots him.  In a flash, the two men jump the
	railing and charge after him, leaving Ich in their wake.

	Ich can't possibly make it over the side.  He furiously
	shoves his way through the Salarymen, trying to get to the
	end of the walkway.

	CHASE SEQUENCE

	-- Nick barreling through the mass of faceless Salarymen.

	-- Kobo, hurrying ahead, occasionally glancing back.

	-- Charlie catching up to Nick.  They've lost him.  They
	   spin around.  A half dozen tunnels spin out in all
	   directions.

	-- Nick and Charlie spotting Kobo.  He's waiting for them
	   near the turnstile.

	Nick suddenly realizes it's a set-up.  Before he can say
	anything, Charlie sprints ahead, recklessly shoving
	people out of the way.

					NICK
				(calling after him)
			It's a set-up...!  Charlie!

	Charlie hasn't heard him.

	AT THE TURNSTILE

	Kobo hands a ticket to the turnstile guard and disappears
	onto the platform.  Charlie doesn't have a ticket.  The
	guard points to the automatic ticket machine.  Screw it.
	Charlie leaps over the turnstile.

	The GUARD blows his shrill whistle to signal the subway
	police.

	THE PLATFORM

	Charlie pushes through the crowd -- a wall of blank faces.
	Kobo is gone.

	NICK

	shoving through the crowd.  He spots Charlie.  Shouts at
	him to wait.  Charlie can't hear his partner.

	THE SUBWAY

	pulls in.  An immaculately uniformed CONDUCTOR blows his
	whistle and waves his white-gloved hands to keep the crowd
	back.

	A LEATHER JACKETED BOY shoves Charlie from behind; he
	stumbles forward toward the track.  Someone catches him at
	the last moment.  Charlie turns around to see it's Kobo.

	Kobo smiles, it's all a big joke.

	What follows happens in a flash:

	ON NICK

					NICK
			Charlie!

	Nick is close enough to see, too far to do anything.  He's
	blocked by TWO MORE LEATHER BOYS.  He tries to shove past,
	but they grab him.

	KOBO

	holding Charlie by his coat lapels.  An express train
	tears into the station.  Kobo casually glances at

	NICK

	trying to struggle free.

	KOBO

	his eyes still on Nick, drops Charlie in front of the
	speeding express as if he were a sack of laundry.

	NICK

					NICK
			NO!!

	A woman SCREAMS.

	The train barrels through the station.

	Kobo starts toward Nick.  He's next.

	A pair of SUBWAY POLICEMEN burst through the crowd
	searching for Charlie because he vaulted the turnstile.

	NICK

	manages to break free of the leatherboys holding him.
	They flee into the crowd as the police close in.

	ACROSS THE PLATFORM - KOBO

	slips into the wave of commuters being shoved into a
	train by white-gloved MEN.  It's their job to shove
	commuters into the already packed cars.

	Nick goes for Kobo, but the crowd closes in front of him.
	He can't get through.

	THE SUBWAY DOORS

	slam shut.  The train pulls out leaving Nick standing on
	the empty platform.

	THE LAST CAR

	streaks past him.  Kobo stands in the rear window, getting
	smaller and smaller until the train disappears down the
	tracks.

					ICH
			Nick!

	Ich, out of breath, is standing on the platform.  Nick
	looks at him with disgust -- where the hell was he.

	STAY on Nick, his head bowed, being surrounded by the sea
	of blue-suited commuters.

								 FADE TO WHITE.

	FADE IN:

	NICK'S FACE against a white wall.  That's all we see.
	Ohashi's voice OFF SCREEN.

					OHASHI (O.S.)
			... You ignored me.  I don't care
			about what you want.  Get on a
			plane, detective Conklin.  Go home.

	We HEAR a door open and SLAM shut off screen.  Hold on
	Nick, frozen in place, then:

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  CENTRAL SECTION - TOKYO POLICE H.Q. - DAY

	Again, the fifty desks, fifty faceless men working.
	Typewriters CLACKING, phones RINGING.  We MOVE down the
	rows to find Nick sitting behind one of the desks.  He's
	on the phone to New York.

					OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
			It's not your job.

					NICK
			He was my partner.

					OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
			They're blaming it on you.  Christ,
			Conklin, you didn't even tell me you
			lost the prisoner!

					NICK
			I planned on catching him, Captain.

					OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
			How?  You don't know the place.  You
			don't know the language.  Get on the
			plane.

					NICK
			He killed a police officer.

					OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
			Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it.
			That's orders.  Period.

	Oliver hangs up.  A moment of long distance hum cross
	talk.  Nick doesn't move.  Pull back through the rows of
	cops busily working... SOUND FADES.

	Charlie Parker's alto sax FADE UP as we --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  SHINJUKU - NIGHT

	The MUSIC continues.  The sax screams as the melody is
	abandoned.

	Nick is drunk.  Roaring angry drunk.  He doesn't know
	where he is.  He doesn't care.  He plows down the street,
	occasionally grabbing a passerby, then letting them go.

	Nick begins to laugh.  A couple is staring at him, Nick
	yells at them, but we DON'T HEAR HIM.  He stumbles on...
	drop back to find.

	ICH

	following in his wake.  He bows and apologizes to the
	offended.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  LAS VEGAS WELCOME BAR - NIGHT

	Nick is thrown onto the street.  He tries to reenter and
	is thrown out again.  We spot JOYCE inside watching; she
	turns back to her customers.


	EXT.  GINZA - NIGHT

	Nick is hassling a news vendor who pointedly ignores him
	and continues selling his papers.  Ich appears and
	apologizes to the news vendor.


	EXT.  STREET - TWO A.M.

	Nick's sitting on the curb, his head in his hands.  People
	step around him.

	Across the street, out of Nick's sight, Ich is watching
	his partner, feeling every barb of Nick's shame.

	Charlie Parker continues over the slow...

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	NICK --

	asleep, the futon tangled around him.  He opens his eyes.
	A woman is making tea in the kitchenette.  This is the
	kimonoed woman who led Nick and Charlie to Ich the other
	night.

	A RADIO is on softly in the background.  The Charlie
	Parker tune we've been listening to over the previous cuts
	ends, and the announcer comes on:

					RADIO
			... That was the Bird, from the Blue
			Note years.  1230 hours and 72
			degrees in central Osaka.  This is
			specialist Doug Dale, Tapestries in
			Jazz, on the Far East Network, armed
			forces radio...

	Nick slowly sits up to see

	ICH

	seated at a low table looking at him from across the room.

	Nick spots his clothes and luggage stacked in the corner.
	Nick now realizes he's in Ich's apartment.  It's spotless.
	Everything is now in its proper place.

					NICK
			What happened?

					ICH
			They made you leave your hotel...
				(looks away)
			... you caused a disturbance.

	Nick's eyes fall on Charlie's things:  his sports clothes,
	his tour book, his shoes which Ich has stacked on the
	table.

					ICH
			It may be too soon to talk about it.
			When someone we care for dies we...
				(beat)
			... keep something of their's.  A
			tie, a pen.

					NICK
			Why weren't you at the platform?

					ICH
			I couldn't keep up.  My shame is
			complete.

	Nick slowly shuts his eyes, his head pounding.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  PUBLIC BATH - DAY

	The neighborhood bathhouse.  Thick with steam and
	neighborhood kids.

	Nick walks toward the huge pool of water.  Ich is beside
	him.  Nick's about to climb in when Ich stops him, hands
	him a pail and a washcloth and points to the faucets along
	the wall where a dozen men squat on small stools as they
	wash themselves.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK

	as he pours a pail of water over his head, it runs down
	his face in slow motion.

								 CUT TO:

	THE POOL

	Nick soaking, on one side.  Ich is soaking nearby.

					ICH
			You must leave?

					NICK
			Yeah...

					ICH
			I'll get him for you, Nick.

	Nick looks at this thick bellied, alcoholic cop.  Not a
	very reassuring thought.

	TWO MEN carrying plastic pails cross in front of the tub.
	Young, muscular Yakuza, their bodies covered with
	exquisite tattoos.  They stare openly at Nick.  One makes
	a joke.  Both laugh obscenely as they slip into the hot
	tub.

					NICK
			Yakuza?

	Ich nods.  Nick eyes them for a long beat, then climbs out
	of the tub.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK

	Nick tossing two bags into a taxi in front of Ich's
	apartment building.

	ICH

	Ich watching Nick through the window from inside his
	apartment.  He glances back and sees Charlie's "Members
	Only" coat hanging on a hook.

	When he turns back, Nick's taxi has disappeared.


	EXT.  NARITA AIRPORT

	The brightest object in the frame is a yellow forklift
	carrying a jostling aluminum coffin toward the open belly
	of the cargo plane.  Nick watches it from the edge of the
	tarmac.

	AIRPORT CHECK IN GATE

	Nick hands the clerk his ticket.

					NICK
			... Smoking.

					CLERK
			Aisle or window?

	Nick spots a folded newspaper someone has left on the
	counter.  He can't read it, of course, but there's a
	picture of the subway platform where Charlie was killed,
	swarming with police.  Nick continues to stare at the
	paper.

					CLERK
			Aisle or window, sir?

					NICK
				(looks up)
			I want to cash it in.  Yen.

								 CUT TO:

	ICH'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Nick steps in, drops the two suitcases.

					NICK
			Ichiro?

	The woman steps out of the kitchen, babbles something in
	Japanese.  Nick doesn't have a clue.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  LAS VEGAS WELCOME BAR - AFTERNOON

	Only a handful of patrons.  Joyce is straightening bottles
	behind the bar.

					NICK (O.S.)
			What's tricks?

	She looks up, surprised to see Nick standing in front of
	her.

					JOYCE
			Ich said you left.

					NICK
			There was a change in plans.

	Beat.

					JOYCE
			I'm sorry about your friend.

	Nick's surprised at how fast she heard.

					JOYCE
			Dead gaiijin's are big news.

					NICK
			Gaiijin?

					JOYCE
			An outside person.  A foreigner.  A
			barbarian.  You, me.
				(beat)
			More you.

					NICK
			I could use some help.  Show me
			around.  I'll pay you for your time.

					JOYCE
			I don't give tours.

	Nick smiles.

					NICK
			You can count on the truth from
			people who don't like you.

					JOYCE
			You have a helluva way of asking for
			help.

					NICK
			You have a helluva way of answering.

	Draw.

					JOYCE
			Look, you need Ich.  I've been here
			five years and I still can't read
			all the street signs.

					NICK
			Maybe I'm a quicker learner.

					JOYCE
			I don't think so.

	From OFF SCREEN:

					ICH (O.S.)
			Nicklaus-san.

	Nick turns to see Ich, leaning against the door frame.
	He's already had a few drinks too many.  He's delighted to
	see Nick.

					ICH
			I've continued working on the case!

					NICK
			I can see that.

	Ich ambles into the room, slips down into a chair.  He
	spills the contents of the large manila envelope he's been
	carrying onto the table:  a wallet, a set of keys, playing
	cards, etc.

					ICH
				(signaling to Joyce)
			Joyce... A drink please.
				(to Nick)
			Kobo has disappeared.  My superiors
			don't trust me.

	Nick walks over to the table and looks at the items.

					ICH
			Kobo's.  Taken off him when he was
			arrested in New York.

	Nick sits down.  Joyce gives Ich his scotch.

					ICH
			I knew you'd come back.  You feel
			you have a debt you can never pay.
			But you will, even if it costs you
			your life.  Giri.  Honor.

	Nick picks up various items off the table.

					NICK
			How'd you get this?

					ICH
			I stole them.

	Ich drapes his arm over Nick's shoulder.

					ICH
			Partners, Nicklaus-san?

	Ich reaches for his drink.  Nick gets there first.  He
	holds it up as if he were proposing a toast, then
	purposefully spills his drink out.

					NICK
			Partners.

	Ich has just had his last drink on duty.

								 CUT TO:

	THE TABLE - LATER

	All the contents of the envelope are spread out on the
	table:  credit cards, matchbooks from New York City,
	choice clipping from Screw magazine, sugarless gum, cuff
	links...

	Nick's holding up a series of photos.

	CLOSE ON PHOTO

	of a naked women and Kobo screwing on a Tatami mat.
	Another photo.  Then another.  Each photo is more
	pornographic than the next.

	Joyce picks them up as Nick sets them down.

					JOYCE
			Busy man.

	Nick holds out several of the same girl in various poses.

					NICK
			Know her?

					ICH
				(shaking his head)
			We can ask someone I used to work
			with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay
			money to...

					NICK
			A snitch?

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  PACHINKO PARLOR - DAY

	The largest in Tokyo.  Endless rows of men sitting in
	front of the machines (horizontal pinball games) furiously
	punching the flippers.  The NOISE from the metal balls is
	deafening.

	A MAN

	in a Hawaiian shirt, his arms covered with tattoos, is
	starting a new game.

	Ich moves up to the vacant machine beside him, puts in his
	change.  Ich doesn't face the man as they speak in
	Japanese.  The man in the Hawaiian shirt walks off.

	ON NICK

	as the man in the Hawaiian shirt walks past him.  This is
	the snitch.  Nick glances back at Ich.  Ich nods --
	they're in business.

								 CUT TO:

	A CRAMPED ROOM - REAR OF PACHINKO PARLOR

	We HEAR the clattering of the machines outside.  The man
	in the Hawaiian shirt, mid-fifties and badly in need of a
	shower, is sitting on the floor studying the photos.  Ich
	and Nick tower above him.

	The man says something to Nick in Japanese, then continues
	to study the photos.

					NICK
			What's he saying?

					ICH
				(looking up)
			He says they're very nice.  He wants
			to know if you have anymore.

	Nick sighs.

					ICH
			I'll ask him again.

	Ich asks in Japanese.  The man shrugs.

					NICK
			My turn.

	He grabs the man by his shirt collar and shoves him
	against the wall.  The photos spill to the floor.

					NICK
			Who is she?

	He bangs the man's head back against the wall.  The man
	starts babbling in Japanese.

	Ich, horrified, tries to pull Nick off him.

					ICH
			Nick, stop.

	Nick bangs the snitches head against the wall again.  Ich
	gets Nick away.  The man is terrified.

					ICH
			This man must be treated with
			respect.

	Ich bows to the man, apologizes in Japanese.

					NICK
			Aw, for Christ's sake.

	They continue speaking in Japanese.  They bow to one
	another again.  Ich gives the man a glass of water, then
	motions for him to sit down.

	Nick, impatient, starts for the guy again.  Ich stops him.
	The snitch holds up one of the photos, and starts
	babbling.

					NICK
				(to Ich)
			Now we're making progress.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  SEIBU DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

	CLOSE ON A SALESGIRL behind the cosmetic counter.  She is
	wearing the store uniform:  blue and white dress and white
	gloves.  A doll.  We shouldn't recognize her at first.
	Then --

	INSERT A PHOTO

	one of Kobo's porno pics.  It's the same face.

	REVEAL NICK

	holding the photo, standing in the crowded store.  Ich is
	beside him.

					NICK
			That's Kobo's girl?  He's sure?

	Ich glances back at the man in the Hawaiian shirt standing
	by the door.  The man nods.

					ICH
			He's sure.

	They watch the girl help a customer choose an eyeliner.

					ICH
			Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three
			days.  He might not even be in
			Tokyo.

					NICK
			Only one way to find out... Get her
			up in the morning and put her to bed
			at night.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  SOBA RESTAURANT - DAY

	NICK

	is struggling with his chopsticks and bowl of noodles.
	From O.S. A LOUD SLURPING SOUND.  The sound stops, then
	starts again.  Nick can't eat.  He sets his bowl down and
	looks over at

	ICH

	slurping his noodles.  It is considered polite to slurp
	soba noodles as loud as possible.

	Ich stops.  Looks at Nick, then resumes his slurping.

					NICK
			Think you could keep it to a dull
			roar?

	They're sitting by the window across from the Seibu
	department store watching the entrance.

					ICH
			It's good manners.

	Nick nods.  Picks up his bowl.  Again the LOUD slurping
	off screen.  Nick starts to eat the noodles.  He can't
	continue with Ich slurping.  He sets the bowl down.

	Ich grins, resumes slurping and we --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - SIX P.M.

	The SALESGIRLS are lined up at the door bowing and
	thanking the last customers for shopping in their store.
	Standard practice.

	The GIRL whom Nick and Ich have been watching comes out
	wearing her uniform and heads down the street.

	NICK AND ICH

	waiting in the restaurant, get up to follow.

								 CUT TO:

	THE GIRL

	stepping out of the laundry carrying her wash.  She walks
	past a doorway where...

	NICK is standing.

	ICH now walks past his partner picking up the tail.  No
	acknowledgement between them.


	EXT.  STREET CAR STATION

	There are dozens of street cars waiting to pull out.  The
	girl is on one of them.  Ich has lost her.  Nick and Ich
	hurry from car to car.

					ICH
			You said you could keep up with her!
			'No problem, Nick-san.'

					NICK
				(cutting Ich off)
			No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do
			anything, and for Christ's sake,
			don't apologize!

					ICH
			Nick...

	Nick hurries toward another car to check it out.

					NICK
			What'd I tell you?

					ICH
			There she is!

	They spot the girl sitting in the window of one of the
	street cars, about to turn onto the main street.

	The two cops race for the car.  Nick leaps on.  Ich is a
	few steps behind.  Nick sticks out his hand, pulls Ich up.
	They stand looking at one another, both breathing hard,
	both out of shape.

								 CUT TO:

	NIGHTCLUB DISTRICT - NIGHT

	Narrow streets with exploding neon ideograph signs as far
	as the eye can see.

	We spot our girl hurrying down the street.  Nick, a half
	block behind, is bumping into people, trying not to lose
	her.

	She crosses the street and Ich picks her up.  Nick drops
	off.

	ON A SIDE STREET

	around the corner the girl disappears into a three story
	apartment building above an electronics store.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  GIRL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

	We're watching our girl inside her apartment.  She flips
	off the TV and climbs into bed.

								 CUT TO:

	A STOREROOM - NIGHT

	We've been watching the girl from a window across the
	street.  It's a storeroom full of shipping crates, not
	much else.  Ich is sitting on the floor, legs crossed,
	back erect, watching Nick.  Nick glances over.  Ich
	continues to watch him.  Nick returns to the window.

					ICH
			You dislike me.

	Nick keeps looking out the window.

					NICK
			Did I say that?

					ICH
			You toler -- yes, tolerate me.   

					NICK
			Are we getting married?

	Pause.

					ICH
			I'm a joke.  They sent you to me to
			make a fool of you.

	Nick looks over at Ich.  Ich is looking away.  Nick looks
	out the window, then back at his partner.

					NICK
			You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop
			it, okay?

					ICH
			Sure.

	The girl switches off her light across the street.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	THE STOREROOM - MORNING

	Ich is sleeping on his back looking like a grounded whale.

	Nick, exhausted, is sitting by the window his head resting
	against the sill.

	NICK'S POV OF THE STREET

	as the girl, dressed in her store uniform, comes out of
	the apartment and heads for work.

	NICK

	nudges the sleeping Ich with his foot.  Ich opens his
	eyes.

					NICK
			Let's book.

	Ich is groggy, nonplused.

					NICK
			Let's go.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  HALLWAY - GIRL'S APARTMENT BUILDING

	Ich, tucking in his shirt, comes down the hall to see --

	Nick, on his knees, examining the lock on the girl's
	apartment door.  He slides his NYPD card into the jam and
	lightly raps the knob plate.

					ICH
			You can't do this.

	Nick uses his sleeve to wipe prints off the knob and jam.

					NICK
			Call a cop.

	The door swings open.  Nick walks in.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  GIRL'S APARTMENT

	A cheesebox with a few vintage pieces of American deco
	furniture.

	Ich, very uptight, stands at the door while Nick goes over
	the place.

	Nick opens the closet.  It's packed with expensive
	dresses, pants, sweaters...

					ICH
			Nick...

					NICK
				(facing him)
			If you're gonna give me a hard time,
			wait outside.

	Nick goes through her chest of drawers:  on the top, a lot
	of high quality lingerie.

	INSERT PHOTO:  The girl and Kobo posing in a vintage
	Corvette.

	Nick replaces the picture, and carefully rearranges the
	drawer so it appears untouched.  He pulls open another
	drawer.  Then another.  Under the jeans and Mickey Mouse
	T-shirts, he finds:

	A BANK STACK OF U.S. CURRENCY

	in hundreds.  The bottom of the drawer is lined with
	stacks.  Nick holds them up for Ich to see.

					NICK
			Not too shabby for a perfume pusher.

	Ich, shocked, tries to play it cool.

					ICH
			Too bad it's not in yen.

	Nick shoves the drawer shut.

								 CUT TO:

	THE GIRL - DUSK - TWO DAYS LATER

	The GIRL buys fruit from a stand as NICK watches from one
	end of the block; ICH, listening to his transistor radio,
	waits at the other.

	THE GIRL

	suddenly turns and finds herself facing

	NICK

	a few yards away.   Nick smiles, then walks into the
	store, hoping he hasn't been made.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  GIRL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Rain pours down.


	INT.  STOREROOM - NIGHT

	Nick, leaning against the wall, watches the girl's
	apartment across the street.  The girl walks in, turns on
	her light, then disappears into the bathroom.

	Ich walks in, exhausted, soaked to the skin.  He tosses
	his cap in the corner.  Struck out again.

					ICH
			Work, lunch, groceries, laundry...
			Fabulous...

					NICK
				(looking back out
				 the window)
			Four goddamn days.  This is going
			nowhere...

	A KNOCK at the door.

					JOYCE (O.S.)
			It's me.

	Ich opens the door.  Joyce, dressed for work, is carrying
	two odons (box dinners).  Joyce and Ich exchange greetings
	in Japanese.

					JOYCE
			What's the latest?

	Nick shrugs.

					ICH
			We'll get him, Joyce.

	Joyce peeks out the window.  The girl is getting
	undressed.

					JOYCE
			She ever pull down her shades?

					NICK
				(right back at her)
			Sure, but then I just pull out the
			photos.

	Ich opens one of the box dinners and sets it on the ledge
	in front of Nick.

					ICH
				(enthusiastically)
			Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku,
			Ganmodoki --

					NICK
			Ichiro --

					ICH
				(realizing)
			Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll,
			soybean curd, devils tongue --

					NICK
			Smells like Bayonne at low tide.

	Joyce hands Ich a flask of hot sake in tinfoil.

					NICK
			Whoa whoa...

	Nick grabs the flask.  Dumps it out the window.

					JOYCE
			Don't be an ass.

					NICK
			He's on duty.

					JOYCE
			I paid for that.

	Nick tosses a few thousand yen on the table.  Then,
	spotting something out the window.

					NICK
			Alley oop!

	Nick grabs his coat and goes out the door.  Joyce slips
	Ich another flask of sake.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  STREET - GINZA DISTRICT - NIGHT

	It's our GIRL standing alone on the corner of the street
	but you wouldn't know it at first.  She's wearing tight
	leather pants, red leather jacket, earrings, bright red
	lipstick, and she's dumped the pony-tail, allowing her
	hair to fall to her waist.

	NICK AND ICH

	watching in a doorway down the block.  Nick's shivering,
	his hands thrust in his army surplus jacket.  Ich doesn't
	mind the cold.  He's had his sake.

	THREE BOSOZOKU

	riding their bikes come around the corner drive past her,
	then circle back.

	One of the RIDERS stops to talk to her, then drives off.
	She hurries off in the opposite direction.

					ICH
			Yakuza.

					NICK
			Good.  Very good...

								 CUT TO:

	A SUBWAY STATION

	The girl waits until the last minute, then after glancing
	back, steps in the car.  The train pulls out.  The cars
	race past until we see --

	Nick and Ich standing inside of the last car.  It
	disappears into the tunnel.

								 CUT TO:

	THE SHINZOA DISTRICT - NIGHT

	The girl, on the move, pushing through the crowd.  Drop
	back to find Ich twenty yards behind.  She crosses the
	street.  Nick, pretending to be looking in a store window,
	picks her up.

	AROUND THE CORNER

	Nick has lost her.  It's a cul de sac with a dozen
	buildings.  He's standing in the middle of the street.
	Ich catches up to him.

					NICK
			She disappeared... shit!

					ICH
			You were too far behind.

	Nick does a double-take.

					ICH
				(recalling Nick's
				 words)
			Don't say anything more.  Don't do
			anything.  And, for Christ's sake,
			don't apologize!

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  STREET - SHINZOA DISTRICT - NIGHT - LATER

	NICK

	dropping another cigarette butt to the ground.  There's a
	small pile at his feet.  He's leaning against the wall
	watching one end of the block.  TRACK over to reveal Ich,
	his back to Nick's, watching the other end.

	Ich glances back at Nick.  Nick ignores him.  Ich turns
	back.

					ICH
			Nicklaus-san!

	Nick turns to see the GIRL walk out of a bath house.
	She's wearing her ponytail again, with a black dress.  She
	climbs into a taxi.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  PINK SARON HOSTESS CLUB - NIGHT

	The girl climbs out of the taxi and goes inside.

	Nick and Ich are watching from across the street.


	INT.  HOSTESS CLUB

	Packed with Salarymen from the nearby brewery and
	hostesses in silk dresses selling cheap champagne at
	expensive prices.

	NICK AND ICH

	Walk in.  Everything seems normal.

	The BOUNCER in a white tux, stops them.  This is not a
	place frequented by Gaiijin.

	Ich beseeches the Bouncer to let his good friend in,
	promising that his friend will spend lots of money.

	Nick, thinking he's in, takes a step forward.  The Bouncer
	shoves him back.

					NICK
			Hey, no hands, huh?

	He bats his hands away.  Ich grabs Nick by the shoulders,
	preventing a fight.

					ICH
			You can't come in.  They don't
			want --

					NICK
			Gaiijin.

					ICH
			I'll check it out.

	Nick, unsure, turns to go, but before he does:

					NICK
			If I smell one drop of Scotch on
			your breath, my friend --

					ICH
			You can trust me.

	Nick hesitates, he's not so sure, then shoves the door
	open.


	EXT.  HOSTESS CLUB

	Nick waiting under the pink neon sign.


	INT.  HOSTESS CLUB - LATER

	Ich is sitting at the crowded bar.  A HOSTESS has her arm
	around his neck.  He checks out the room, searching for
	the girl.  He notices two THUGS standing outside a sliding
	door.  Ich finishes his drink.

					ICH
				(in Japanese)
			Let me up.

					HOSTESS
				(shoving him down)
			Sit, sweetie.
				(to bartender)
			Another Seagrams!

	Ich relents.  Then, spotting something across the room:

	WHAT HE SEES:  A rice paper door slides open, momentarily
	revealing a DOZEN men with close cropped hair sitting on
	tatami mats, playing poker.  Some have their coats off,
	revealing arms covered with tattoos.  Yakuza.

	A hostess, serving drinks, steps but leaving the door
	partially open.

	The hostess slides the door open to the adjacent room, but
	Ich CANNOT see inside.  She slides it shut.

	Ich's hostess wants him to buy another drink, but Ich
	shakes his head, gets to his feet, and pretending to be
	drunk, stumbles toward the sliding doors.

	Ich bumps into a table; slaps a stranger on the shoulder;
	then starts singing along with Frank Sinatra on the
	stereo.  He's a little too loud, a little off key.

	The bodyguards eye Ich suspiciously.  He stumbles past
	them, then grabs the sliding door and yanks it open.

	INSIDE THE ROOM

	A low table.  Kobo is at one end.  An older,
	distinguished, sliver-haired man in his seventies whom we
	will come to know as SUGAI is at the other.  Ich can't
	believe his eyes:  Sugai is the head of the largest Yakuza
	syndicate in Japan.

	A half dozen LIEUTENANTS sit on either side of the table.
	Half are older, dressed in conservative suits; the other
	half are younger wearing $700 Issy Miyake jackets.

	SUGAI AND KOBO

	are having a heated discussion.  The GIRL Ich and Nick
	have been following walks over to Kobo and sits beside
	him.  This makes Sugai even more irate.  He's on his feet,
	red faced and screaming.

	FOUR GUARDS

	seeing Ich, pull out their Beretta's.  Two more grab him
	and fling him head first against the wall.

					ICH
				(drunken, in Japanese)
			I have to piss, gentlemen... I'm so
			sorry but I have to --

	The bodyguards hurry him towards the door.


	EXT.  HOSTESS CLUB

	Nick checks his watch, it's been an hour - where the hell
	is Ich?

	Ich comes stumbling up the steps, still affecting his
	drunken, pigeon-toed walk.  Nick, of course, thinks Ich
	has gotten drunk again.  Two of the bodyguards are
	watching from inside.

					NICK
			I don't believe it...
				(grabs him)
			Son-of-a-bitch --   

	Ich, knowing they're being watched, grabs Nick by the
	sleeve and drags him off still pretending to be drunk.

					ICH
				(under his breath)
			I'm not drunk...

					NICK
			We're through.  I mean it.  This is
			the end of the line, Matsumoto.

					ICH
			Nick --

					NICK
			Shut-up.

	No longer fearing he's being watched, Ich abruptly stops
	his affected walk, and sounding very sober --

					ICH
			You shut-up!
				(then)
			Kobo is inside.  He's with Sugai,
			the head of the Summaguchi-clan.

	ACROSS THE STREET

	Ich is dialing on the police call box as he fills Nick in
	on Sugai.

					ICH
			... A Godfather.  His man was killed
			at the printing plant.

					NICK
			I want to yank Kobo.

					ICH
			Not without a small army, Nicklaus-
			san.

	Ich quickly speaks on the police phone, then hangs up,
	pleased with himself.

					NICK
			Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus,
			not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san.
			Nick.

					ICH
			San is an honorable title.

	Ich realizes it's better to drop it.

								 CUT TO:

	THE HOSTESS CLUB - MINUTES LATER

	Drunken Salarymen spill out the door.

	ICH AND NICK

	are standing across the street waiting for the cops to
	arrive.

	Nick freezes.

	THE GIRL

	they've been following steps out and lights a cigarette.
	TIME SLOWS.  She looks up and spots the two men through
	the traffic.  Nick turns away, afraid he's been made.
	When he looks back, she's gone back inside.

					NICK
			Shit...

	Nick races across the street toward the club.  Horns
	BLARE.

					ICH
				(doesn't understand)
			Nick?!

	IN FRONT OF THE CLUB

	Nick reaches the curb just as the front doors to the club
	BURST OPEN.  He's too late.  Three bodyguards burst out,
	checking the street.  A red and white Debonnaire pulls up.

	Sugai, surrounded by a half-dozen additional bodyguards,
	comes out and slips into the car.  It tears off down the
	street.

	SIRENS AND POLICE CARS

	from either end of the street peel around the corner.
	It's a madhouse.  The remaining lieutenants and bodyguards
	fan out, trying to elude arrest.

	Nick hurries down the steps.

	INSIDE THE CLUB

	The patrons are still in place, but the two side rooms are
	empty.

	Nick spots KOBO going out the rear entrance.  He starts
	after him but is confronted by the bouncer who stopped him
	earlier.  Nick connects to the guy's jaw before his
	adversary can raise his hands.  The bouncer staggers back.
	Nick flies out the rear door.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  FRONT OF CLUB - NIGHT

	Several lieutenants and bodyguards toss their guns --
	possession is a felony in Japan -- as the police close in.


	INT.  HOSTESS CLUB - NIGHT

	Ich hurries in, but Nick's long gone.


	EXT.  REAR OF HOSTESS CLUB - NEARBY STREETS - NIGHT

	SILENCE.  The narrow streets are deserted.  Nick slowly
	makes his way down the street.  The SOUND of a GUNSHOT.
	Nick ducks for cover -- it's a car BACKFIRING.  He
	continues on.

	Nick's POV of a woman giving a man a blow-job in a narrow
	alley.  The man's face is hidden by the shadow.

	Nick continues on.

					JAPANESE MAN (FROM THE DARKNESS)
			People like Charlie are a dime a
			dozen.

	Nick turns back to see Kobo as he steps into the light.

	Kobo tosses a handful of change at Nick.

					KOBO
			Keep the change.

					NICK
			I'm taking you back.

	The girl takes off down the block.

					KOBO
			Here I am.

	From across the street, a dozen bodyguards appear from
	various doorways and alleys.

					KOBO
			Charlie was a rookie...

	Kobo traces his finger across the spot where he cut Nick
	in New York.

					KOBO
			... But you can take care of
			yourself.  You're 'the biggest thing
			to hit this town since Godzilla.'

	Nick glances at the guards, then back at Kobo.  He is
	unarmed.  To make a move would be suicide.  More POLICE
	SIRENS in the b.g. closing in.

					KOBO
			What's the matter.  I'm right in
			front of you, Nick.
				(takes a step closer)
			But I was right in front of you when
			you let Charlie die.

	Kobo takes a step forward.  His face is inches from
	Nick's.

					KOBO
			Walk away again.  Maybe you'll get
			used to it.

	Nick doesn't budge.

	A LONG BEAT, then... Nick turns and slowly walk off.
	After a dozen yards Nick looks back.

	The street is empty, except for a street sweeper pushing
	his wet broom down the block.


	EXT.  HOSTESS CLUB - NIGHT

	A half dozen bodyguards are being frisked, then shoved
	into police cars.

	Ohashi is talking to the enraged nightclub owner.  Nick
	steps up to him.  Ich hurries over.

					ICH
			Nick!

					NICK
				(to Ohashi)
			A few minutes faster, we might've
			nailed him.

	Ohashi doesn't say a word, hands Nick a document.

					NICK
			What's this?

					OHASHI
			Your visa has expired.  Be on a
			plane in twenty-four hours or you
			will be deported.

					NICK
			While you were hanging out at the
			visa office, we found the son-of-a-
			bitch.

					OHASHI
			Look.

	Ohashi directs Nick's attention across the street where a
	SURVEILLANCE VAN is parked.  The rear doors are open
	revealing a van full of surveillance equipment and cops.

					OHASHI
			You ruined an on-going investigation
			that could have gotten us more than
			one runner.
				(to Ich, in Japanese)
			I want a full report in the morning,
			officer.

	Ich bows as Ohashi walks off.

					NICK
			Maybe if you'd work with us --

	Ohashi ignores him, continues walking toward his waiting
	car.

					NICK
				(shouting)
			Hey...!
				(Ohashi keeps
				 walking)
			HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!

					OHASHI
				(his back toward
				 Nick)
			Twenty-four hours, detective.

	Ohashi slips into his car.  Nick storms up to the car and
	slams his fist on the window.

					NICK
			Ohashi!

	Ohashi faces straight ahead, ignoring Nick.  Nick takes
	the extradition paper and spikes it on the car antenna.

	Ich grabs Nick by his arm, pulling him back from the car.
	The car pulls away.

					ICH
			Nick, stop!

	Nick whirls, and before he realizes what he's doing,
	punches Ich below his left eye.  Ich stumbles back over
	the curb and lands on his ass.

					NICK
			Damnit, Ichiro, I'm tired of people
			telling me what I can and can't do.
			No one ever solved anything sitting
			on their ass.

	Nick, beside himself with frustration, watches Ohashi's
	car disappear down the block.

	ON ICH

	looking up at

	NICK

	who walks off without looking back at his partner.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  ICH'S BATHROOM - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

	Nick, standing beside the tub, dumps a pail of hot water
	over his head, rinsing himself off.  He grabs a towel and
	walks out of the room.


	INT.  ICH'S APARTMENT

	Ich, holding an ice pack to his face, is lying on a tatami
	mat against the wall looking up at the ceiling.  An open
	bottle of Seagrams beside him.

	Nick stretches out on another tatami on the opposite side
	of the room and looks up at the ceiling, too.

					NICK
			The ice help?

	Nothing from Ich.

					NICK
			Where does this Sugai live?

					ICH
				(cold)
			A resort city, Beppu.

					NICK
			I want to go talk to him.

					ICH
			What...?  Why?

					NICK
			Because he knows how to get to our
			man.

					ICH
			He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.

					NICK
			I'll be a nice Gaiijin.

	Nick gets up and goes to the closet.  He slides open the
	door.  All of his and Charlie's clothes have been neatly
	hung up.

	He shoves Charlie's jacket aside.  Something's wrong with
	the way it hangs.  He pulls the jacket out, runs his hand
	over the coat, feeling something heavy in the lining.

	Nick rips the lining open.  Charlie's .32 Beretta and a
	spare clip tumble out.

					NICK
			The little bastard.  God bless him.

	Ich takes a drink from his bottle.

					ICH
			It's very small.

					NICK
			Big enough.

					ICH
			It's illegal, Nick.

					NICK
			It's a new deal.
				(putting it in his
				 waist band)
			... coming with me tomorrow?

					ICH
			Sugai's not going to be impressed
			with your gun, Nick.
				(beat)
			No.  I won't put myself in danger
			for you anymore.

	Nick picks up the liquor cap which rolled across the
	floor.  He tosses it to Ich.  Ich reaches for it, but
	misses.

					NICK
			Sure, pal.  You've got better things
			to do.

	Nick walks out shutting the door behind him.  Stay on Ich
	watching the door, then --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  LAS VEGAS BAR - CLOSING TIME

	The last customers find their way to the street, some with
	a little encouragement from a BOUNCER.

	Joyce steps out.  Nick comes up to her.

					NICK
			You know where I can get a decent
			cup of coffee this time of night?
			I'm buying.

					JOYCE
			Somebody must be suffering
			somewhere, you're being so nice.

	Joyce takes off down the street.  Nick watches her for a
	beat.

					NICK
			I need your help, Joyce.

					JOYCE
			Where's Ich?

					NICK
			Unavailable.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

	On the stage, a young professional looking man is singing
	along to "SUMMERTIME" blasting from the stereo.  The
	Japanese way of letting it all hang out.

	We find Joyce and Nick at a corner table having a drink.

					JOYCE
			I've heard of Sugai.  I've also
			heard of the emperor.  They're both
			national treasures.  One's a hood.

					NICK
			I need someone to translate for me.

					JOYCE
			My Japanese isn't that hot...
			Besides, you'll never get in.

					NICK
			It's my last shot.  I have to be on
			a plane home tomorrow night.

					JOYCE
			And I'm supposed to care?

					NICK
			You could fake it.

	Joyce finishes her drink, sets it down.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

	The neon flickers on the rain slicked pavement.  Nick and
	Joyce walk down the deserted street.  She's carrying an
	umbrella.

					JOYCE
			You're wrong to sell Ich short.

					NICK
			He drinks.

					JOYCE
			He's got a reason.

	Nick shrugs, everyone's got a reason.

					JOYCE
			His son hooked up with some bikers.
			Yakuza kids.  A cop shot him running
			from a robbery.

	Nick looks over for the first time.

					JOYCE
			A father doesn't out live that kind
			of thing here, much less a police
			officer...

	Pause.

					NICK
			Where's the wife?

					JOYCE
			You met her.

	Nick looks surprised.

					JOYCE
			The woman in the apartment.  She
			won't speak to him.  But she won't
			leave either.  Japan... Nice, huh?

	Before Nick can respond, something catches his eye:  What
	he sees --

	A MAN

	partially shadowed, standing in the alley.

	Nick grabs his gun.  The man steps out zipping up his
	trousers.  It's a drunken Salaryman.  Nick lowers his gun.
	The Salaryman staggers down the street singing to himself.

					JOYCE
			Not wound too tight...

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  JOYCE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

	A three story modern building on a quiet street.  She's
	searching for her keys.

					JOYCE
			I'd invite you up but I know you'd
			hate the incense.
				(as if to explain)
			I chant.

					NICK
			What do you chant?

					JOYCE
			'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think
			it's dumb of course.

					NICK
			Not if it works.
				(holding the door
				 open for her)
			I'll meet you at the train?

					JOYCE
			I don't remember saying yes.

					NICK
			I don't remember you saying no.

	Joyce smiles, heads inside.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  ICH'S APARTMENT - DAWN

	Ich is sleeping.

	Nick slips into his leather motorcycle jacket.  He drops
	Charlie's gun into his pocket.  He glances down at Ich,
	seeing if he's awake.  He's not.  Nick walks out.

	Ich opens his eyes.  He's been awake the whole time.

								 CUT TO:

	THE YANAKA CEMETERY - DAY

	Ich, wearing a blue suit, is pouring water over a simple
	stone with a wooden dipper.  Next, he places incense in a
	holder and folds his hands in prayer.

	The photo on the stone is of a young man wearing a school
	uniform.  Ich's son.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	A BULLET TRAIN - DAY

	It's bull's-eye nose cone scuds across the endless rice
	paddies west of Tokyo.  Women in straw hats stand in the
	knee deep water pruning the rice by hand.  Old Japan
	rubbing shoulders with the new.


	INT.  TRAIN - DAY

	CLOSE ON NICK looking out the window as the countryside
	shoots past at 140 mph.  From O.S. several children
	chanting:  "Harrow, Harrow."

	Nick looks over to see three uniformed school children
	thrusting their notebooks and pens at him.

	JOYCE

	is sitting across from Nick.

					JOYCE
			They want your autograph.

					NICK
			Who am I supposed to be?

					JOYCE
			This little guy thinks you're Robert
			Redford... the other one thinks
			you're Charles Bronson...

					NICK
			Tell them I'm not.

	She does, but the kids insist.

					JOYCE
			They'll never go away.

	Nick, reluctantly signs.  Joyce takes one of the kid's
	notebooks before passing it back.

					JOYCE
			Mick Jagger?

	Joyce smiles, surprised at his choice.  Then, she looks up
	shocked to see --

	ICH

	carrying a gift wrapped package under his arm.  He's
	wearing his hat, blue suit and tie.

	Ich sits ACROSS the aisle from Nick and Joyce.  He doesn't
	say a word.  Faces straight ahead.

	Nick looks at Joyce, then back at Ich.

					NICK
			I'm sorry, Ichiro.  I lost it last
			night.  I shouldn't have hit you.

	Still nothing from Ich.

					NICK
			What's in the box?

					ICH
				(still not facing
				 him)
			For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese,
			ham... If you come to apologize for
			interrupting his meeting, Sugai may
			feel obligated to see you.

					NICK
			So I bring some cheese?

					JOYCE
			Gifts are expected here.

	Nick nods, looks back out the window.  He'll never
	understand this country.  He looks back to see --

	Joyce looking annoyed at him.  Nick gets the message.

					NICK
			Hey, Ich... Thanks.  I'm glad you're
			here.  I mean it.

	Ich still won't acknowledge Nick.


	EXT.  BULLET TRAIN

	The Bullet Train disappearing into the foothills.


	EXT.  BEPPU - DAWN

	Plumes of white steam spindle skyward from every street
	corner.  If you didn't know it was steam, you'd think the
	city was on fire.  Beppu is a resort famous for it's
	geothermal baths.


	EXT.  SUGAI'S HOUSE

	The only traditional house we'll see in our story.  It's
	surrounded by a pool of blood red steaming water from the
	hot springs.

	AT THE GATE

	CLOSE ON A 1000 yen bill as it is dropped on the ground.
	A pair of dice rolls over it.  A handful of GUARDS wearing
	suits and ties are playing craps.

	OUTSIDE THE GATE

	Ich is sitting on the ground leaning against the wall,
	sound asleep.  Nick is standing nearby.  He checks his
	watch.  Tired of waiting, he walks over to --

	JOYCE

	reading the Manichi Daily.

					NICK
				(impatiently)
			They took the gift an hour ago.

	The phone rings inside the gate.  A guard picks it up.

					JOYCE
				(certain it's bad
				 news)
			All's not lost.  There's a famous
			temple here.  We could chant.

	The guard hangs up, calls out to Joyce.  Joyce responds in
	Japanese.  The guard opens the gate.

					NICK
			We're in?

					JOYCE
			The cheese...


	INT.  A ROOM IN SUGAI'S HOUSE

	A vast, austere, traditional room with sliding rice paper
	doors and tatami mats on the floor.

	Ich and Joyce, drinking tea, are sitting with their feet
	beneath them in the traditional manor.

	Nick, smoking, is in a semi-sprawl; using his tea cup as
	an ashtray.

	A LIEUTENANT enters.  He says something and beckons.  They
	all rise.  He says something else.

					JOYCE
				(to Nick)
			Just you.


	INT.  ANOTHER ROOM - SUGAI'S HOUSE

	Nick enters, ducking his head in the low doorway.  the
	shoji slides shut behind him.

	The furnishings are minimal but elegant.  There's a
	butsudan, a tokonoma, and a low, long table in the middle
	of the room.  No chairs.  Nick sits on the floor.

	A door slides open at the far end of the room.  Sugai,
	wearing a kimono over western style suit, walks in.  Nick
	stands up to shake his hand.  Sugai ignores it, and sits
	in the traditional position:  feet tucked beneath him.

					SUGAI
			I'll spare you the ritual.

	He tosses him a palm sized bundle.  Nick catches it.
	Inside, are brand new greenbacks:  hundreds.

					NICK
			This supposed to impress me?

	He sets it down.

					SUGAI
			Pick it up.  Look at it.

	Nick hesitates, then picks it up again.  He runs his
	fingers over the face of the bill and snaps the paper.

					SUGAI
			Seven years work by the finest
			engraver.  Mass produced,
			sequentially numbered.  The best
			there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.

					NICK
			I'm impressed.  But let's use the
			short form.  I'm looking for --

					SUGAI
			-- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of
			my partners.  One in New York, one
			at the printing plant.

	Sugai fills a cup of tea for Nick and hands it to him.

					NICK
			I don't drink tea.

	Sugai hands it to him anyway.

					SUGAI
			I took Kobo from the street.  I gave
			him a home, a future... But my ways
			were too slow for him... I served
			seven years in prison for my boss
			when I was a young man.  Kobo
			wouldn't serve seven minutes for his
			Oyabun.
				(sipping his tea)
			He was supposed to take over this
			syndicate when I retired.

					NICK
			I want him.

					SUGAI
			He'll be dealt with.

	Sugai sets a plastic wrapped object on a table before
	Nick.  Nick recognizes it from the restaurant massacre in
	New York.

	CLOSE UP:  Nick's fingers tear at the plastic.  A block of
	black iridescent polymer.  The negative image of a $100.00
	bill.  A printing plate.

					SUGAI
			Our associates in New York were
			close to closing a deal with us.

					NICK
			The families who control the
			casinos?

					SUGAI
			Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your
			criminals don't understand the words
			'honor' and 'duty'... We can't
			afford not to deal with them.

	Sugai takes the plate back.

					SUGAI
			Imagine if your families could pay
			their gambling and drug debts with
			perfect counterfeit bought for cents
			on the dollar.

					NICK
			The Feds would be onto you in a
			month.

					SUGAI
			Not with these bills.  And even if
			it only took them six months, do you
			know what our profit margin would
			be?

	Nick looks at a child playing near one of the hot pools in
	Sugai's garden.

					NICK
			Why tell me this?

					SUGAI
			The other plate is currently in New
			York, in the hands of Kobo's man.
			Find it for me.

					NICK
			You trust me?

					SUGAI
			I'll pay you.

	Nick laughs at Sugai's audaciousness.

					NICK
				(indicating the
				 counterfeit bills)
			With these?

					SUGAI
			Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion.
			Whatever you want.  You know the
			city and the police.

					NICK
			If I say no?

					SUGAI
			You're smarter than Kobo.  You know
			the price of deceit.  Think about
			it.

					NICK
			I don't have to.

	Sugai cools.  Without a word he gets to his feet and
	starts toward the door.

					NICK
			I have ten hours to grab my man.

	ON SUGAI

	still walking with his back to Nick.

					NICK (O.S.)
			You won't get hurt.

	Sugai turns to see Nick, across the room, pointing the
	Beretta at his head.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  ROOM - SUGAI'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	The room where Ich and Joyce are waiting.  Sugai enters.
	Their surprise turns to shock when they see Nick behind
	him holding a gun to the old man's head.

					ICH
			No...

					NICK
			Let's go.  Him first.

					ICH
			Nick, you can't do this.

					NICK
			It's done.
				(to Joyce)
			You don't have to come.

	She hasn't moved a muscle.


	INT SUGAI'S HOUSE - ENTRANCE WAY

	Sugai watches calmly as Nick, Ich, and Joyce put their
	shoes on.  Nick keeps the gun on him.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  SUGAI'S COURTYARD

	Nick steps out of the house.  He now has one end of a wire
	coat hanger loosely wrapped around Sugai's neck, the other
	end around his wrist.  His gun is pressed just beneath
	Sugai's ear.  If nick gets shot, so does Sugai.

	A handful of guards stand in the courtyard, one is
	polishing Sugai's Debonnaire car.  They spot Nick and
	Sugai coming, and immediately pull their guns.

					NICK
			Explain to them.  They shoot me,
			they kill you.
				(Sugai hesitates)
			DO IT!

	Sugai explains to his lieutenants.  They stand helpless as
	Nick walks Sugai toward the car.

					NICK
			Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.

					ICH
			No.

					NICK
			Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work
			with me.

	Ich takes the keys from the man polishing the car.  He
	gets inside.  Joyce hurries in bedside him.

					ICH
			You don't know what you're doing.

	Nick slides Sugai in the back seat, carefully reaches over
	and shuts the door.

					NICK
			Start it.

					ICH
				(terrified)
			I can't...

					JOYCE
			Slide over.

	Joyce, furious at Nick, starts the car, gets behind the
	wheel.  Ich gets in on the other side.

	She spins the car around.  The gate opens.  They tear off.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  STREET - BEPPU - DAY

	The car bursts through the funnels of steam from the hot-
	springs beneath the street.  It tears down the narrow
	block dodging traffic.  Joyce is concentrating hard on the
	road.

					NICK
				(to Ich)
			Where's somewhere safe?

	Nothing from Ich.  He's still apoplectic.

					JOYCE
				(angrily)
			You came up with the first part.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  KUDAN LOVE HOTEL - BEPPU

	A four story concrete hotel, strictly for making love.
	"Love Hotels" exist all over Japan.  Each have various
	themes:  western, fifties drive in, Star Wars, etc., each
	complete with music and lighting effects.


	INT.  HOTEL ROOM

	Western style.  Plastic five foot cacti in front of the
	western vista on the walls.  A hitching post at the head
	of the bed.  Cowboy hats and boots at the other end.

	Sugai hangs up the phone and turns to Nick and Joyce who
	are sitting nearby.  Ich hangs up the extension.

					SUGAI
			Kobo will meet me here tomorrow.
			Ten a.m.

	Ich nods, confirming that what Sugai says is true.

					NICK
			Good.

					SUGAI
			He'll find out you took me.  I'm
			unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of
			us.  You don't stand a chance.

	Ich, knowing Sugai is right, looks at Nick.  Nick flips
	Ich the gun.

					NICK
			Not if we're careful.

	Ich checks to make sure the gun is loaded, then watches as
	Nick escorts Joyce out of the room.

								 CUT TO:

	A HOTEL ROOM ACROSS THE HALL

	Fifties theme.  The front end of a pink chevy curves
	around the bed.  A "Drive-In" movie screen along one wall.

	Nick is dropping change into the vintage Wurlitzer.  Joyce
	steps in, leaving the door open.

					JOYCE
			You're out of your mind.  I'm
			leaving.

	Nick doesn't respond.

					JOYCE
			You'll get Ich killed.

					NICK
			No one's keeping him here.

					JOYCE
			Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me
			this is all just about Charlie.
			It's not.

					NICK
			Why would you care?

	That pushes her over the line.

					JOYCE
			Bastard...

	She moves toward him, enraged.  Nick grabs her arm.

					JOYCE
			Let go.

	He won't.

					JOYCE
			You're out of your mind.

	He grips her tighter.

								 CUT TO:

	THE ROOM - LATER

	Nick and Joyce, only partially undressed, are making love
	on the floor.  The Drifters singing "Under The Boardwalk"
	can be heard on the Wurlitzer.  The fifties decor, the
	music, it's all pretty incongruous.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  LOVE HOTEL - DAWN

	Nick is putting Joyce in a taxi.  He shuts the door.

					JOYCE
			I still think you're a bastard.

					NICK
			What if I chant?

					JOYCE
			Wouldn't help.
				(beat)
			Watch out for Ich.

	He nods.  The cab drives off.  Nick watches her taxi until
	it is out of sight, around a corner, then heads inside.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK - LATER

	walking into Sugai's room.  Sugai's asleep on the bed.
	Ich is vigilantly sitting awake in the corner, the gun
	resting on the table in front of him.

					NICK
			Better wake him up.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  LOVE HOTEL - LATER

	Quiet.  The wind twirls a discarded newspaper in the
	parking lot.

	INSIDE THE LOVE HOTEL - HALLWAY

	A YOUNG GIGGLING COUPLE step out of a door, arm in arm,
	and disappear down the hall.  STAR WARS MUSIC from one
	room.  HAWAIIAN MUSIC from another.

	THE CAMERA FINDS the closed elevator door.  It opens, Kobo
	steps out, followed by a half-dozen more men all carrying
	Sig-Saur assault rifles -- very heavy artillery.

								 CUT TO:

	SUGAI

	wearing his hat and coat is sitting on the couch, his back
	to us, facing out the window.

	Drop down to --

	THE ROOM BENEATH HIM

	A couple are making love in the Hawaiian theme room.

	The door burst open.  Two men, cradling Sig-Saur rifles in
	their arms, step in.  They aim at the ceiling, blasting
	into Sugai's room above.

	THE GIRL

	starts screaming.  The men ignore her and continue to pump
	bullets into the ceiling.

	KOBO AND HIS MEN

	stop in front of every door long enough to blast into the
	room.  They make their way down the hall.

	A naked man steps into the hallway and is matter-of-factly
	gunned down.

	Kobo and his men stop in front of Sugai's room.


	INT.  SUGAI'S ROOM

	Sugai, wearing his hat, is slumped down on the couch which
	has been splintered by the bullets from below.

	OUTSIDE THE ROOM

	Kobo signals the men.  All six open-up through the door.

	INSIDE THE ROOM

	The door, what's left of it, is kicked open.  The six men
	step in, shooting in all directions:  into the bathroom
	door, into the closet... Windows shatter, mirrors fall,
	total destruction.  They stop.  SILENCE.

	Kobo walks up to Sugai who is slumped on the couch.  He
	lifts up his hat.  It's a cowboy mannequin wearing Sugai's
	clothes.

	THE ELEVATOR DOOR

	opens.  A DOZEN of Sugai's men carrying machine pistols
	come out.

	THE OUTSIDE BALCONY

	Nick and Ich lie on their bellies, guns out.

	INSIDE THE ROOM

	Kobo's men turn.  Sugai's men open-up.  Three of Kobo's
	hitters go down.  The others try to flee into the
	adjoining room.

	Kobo goes for the balcony.

	THE BALCONY

	as Kobo steps out.  He steps right into --

	NICK

	who slams the side of Kobo's head with the butt of his
	gun.

	THE ROOM   

	Nick and Ich drag Kobo in by his jacket collar.  Sugai,
	very much alive, walks in from the hallway.  Nothing is
	said.  Sugai looks at Kobo for a long beat, then walks
	out.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  SUGAI'S HOUSE - DAY

	KOBO

	standing alone in the middle of a tatami room.  His face
	is badly beaten.  His hands are bound.  Two guards stand
	near the wall.  Nick and Ich stand across the room.

	SUGAI

	wearing a western suit, is asking Kobo questions in
	Japanese.  Sugai barks at him again.  Kobo refuses to
	answer.  Sugai pulls up a shuto -- an 18 inch knife --
	from it's scabbard.

					SUGAI
				(in Japanese)
			Contact your associate in New York
			and tell him to hand my plate over
			to Abolofia.

	Nothing from Kobo.

					SUGAI
			You have betrayed the syndicate and
			personally dishonored me.  I would
			rather the deal fell through than...

	The guards walk over and turn Kobo around.  His back is to
	Sugai.  Sugai runs the sword across the nape of Kobo's
	neck drawing blood.  The guards tighten their grip on
	Kobo's arms.

	NICK

	can't believe Sugai's going to kill him.  Nick starts to
	get up, Ich stops him.

	Kobo realizes Sugai isn't just threatening him.

					KOBO
			No... I'll arrange it.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	THE ROOM - LATER

	Kobo is led back into the room by two guards.  The guards
	shove him down to the floor.  His hands are still bound.

	Nick walks over and stands above him.  He doesn't say a
	word.  Just stands above him.  Then, Nick pulls spare
	change from his pocket and slowly drops the coins, one by
	one, in front of Kobo's face, like Kobo did to him.  He
	walks away.

	Sugai steps in.

					SUGAI
			Abolofia's person has received the
			plate.  It's done.

	A door opens at the far end of the room.  It's Kobo's
	girlfriend, the one Nick and Ich had been following.

	She starts toward Kobo; a lieutenant intercepts her.

					SUGAI
				(in Japanese)
			I wanted you to see him like this.

					GIRL
				(in Japanese)
			Let him go, father.

	ON ICH

	realizing she's Sugai's daughter.

					GIRL
				(in Japanese)
			You're too old...

					SUGAI
				(in Japanese)
			That's enough.

	Sugai turns away and picks up the sword.  The guards
	clutch Kobo.  Sugai's going to kill Kobo after all.

	The girl screams at him to stop.  Sugai's oblivious.

					NICK (O.S.)
			That wasn't our deal.

					SUGAI
			You want him dead too.

					NICK
			After a court convicts him.  He
			belongs to me.

	There's a long pause.  Then, something unusual happens.
	Sugai tells the lieutenant to unfasten Kobo's wrist.  When
	he does, Sugai hands Kobo the sword and demands that he
	cut off his finger.

	This is Yubitsume:  the ritual act within the Yakuza of
	slicing the joint of the little finger to atone for a
	mistake.

	Kobo, not believing in this ancient tradition, refuses.
	Sugai nods to a guard who places Kobo's finger on the
	table.

	KOBO

	stares defiantly at Sugai.  He doesn't even wince as the
	blade slices off his finger.  The guard hands Sugai the
	finger in a handkerchief.

					SUGAI
				(looking at Nick)
			If anything happens to Abolofia or
			my plate, detective...

	HOLD on Nick then --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  TRAIN - DAY

	as it bursts out of a tunnel on it's way to Tokyo.


	INT.  TRAIN - DAY

	Kobo is sitting by the window, his hands cuffed in front
	of him.  Another pair of cuffs chain him to the arm rest.

	Nick pours a drink from an airline-sized bottle of Scotch.
	He holds it out to... Ich.  It's his first drink in a
	week.

					NICK
			Just one, compadre... Kampai.

					ICH
			Kampai.

	They clink glasses.  Ich drinks it down.

					NICK
			It took 12 years to make it, you
			could take five minutes to drink it.

	Ich slows down.

					NICK
			You did great, Ichiro.

					ICH
			I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.
				(smiling)
			I like him waiting.

	Ich gets up.

					ICH
			Needs ice.

	He heads for the bar car, leaving Kobo and Nick alone.

	Kobo looks out the window at the people working the rice
	paddies, then back down the aisle at the Salarymen in
	their identical suits, then at the women separated from
	them.

					KOBO
			Ugly... A couple of thousand years
			they've been bound by these little
			rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid.
			Ugly little lives...

					NICK
			Save it, I already took the tour.

					KOBO
			You are a lucky man.  Where you come
			from a man can stand out.  It's
			expected.  Here a man is made to
			look a fool for standing out.

	Nick isn't paying much attention.

					KOBO
			I like your friend, Joyce.  You're
			lucky.

					NICK
			Guess I'm on a roll.

					KOBO
			She's such a long way home for you.

					NICK
			Time, I've got plenty of.

	A raucous SALARYMAN comes down the aisle, singing an Enka,
	swaying with the train, bumping into seats.  A common
	enough sight and ignored by the rest of the passengers.
	The Salaryman stumbles and falls across Nick's lap.

					NICK
				(helping him up)
			Hey, hey, come on, blow...

	The Salaryman bows deep.  Nick ignores it.  The man moves
	on.  Kobo looks out the window, the train begins to SLOW
	as it approaches the next station.

					KOBO
				(matter-of-factly)
			This is my stop.

					NICK
			I'm amused.

					KOBO
			Don't be.

	Nick looks up to see Kobo calmly fingering a lock of blond
	hair tied with black ribbon.  Joyce's ribbon.  Joyce's
	hair.

					KOBO
			I have her.

	Nick looks down the car.  The drunk Salaryman who stumbled
	over Nick is quite sober.  He made the hand-off to Kobo.
	Kobo holds out his wrists.  Nick hesitates.

					KOBO
				(matter-of-factly)
			I'll kill her.

	Nick, reluctantly, unlocks both sets of cuffs.  The train
	pulls into the station.

					KOBO
			I want the plate from your pal,
			Sugai.  When you get it, you get
			her.

	Kobo gets up, starts down the aisle.

					NICK
			Sugai won't give it to me, you know
			that.

					KOBO
			Then take it from him.

	Kobo gets off the train.

	NICK

	follows him to the door.

	THE STATION

	Kobo get into a waiting Jaguar.  Four guards nearby.

	INSIDE THE TRAIN

	Nick runs down the length of the car trying to keep the
	Jaguar in sight as the train pulls out... the car is gone.

	NICK

	bursts into the packed bar car.

					NICK
			Ichiro?!

	Everyone turns around.  No Ich.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  TRAIN - TRAIN STATION - TOKYO

	It slows into the station.


	INT.  TRAIN

	Nick shoves past the passengers lined up in the vestibule,
	ignoring a conductor's angry shouts.


	INT.  TERMINAL - MOMENTS LATER

	The train stops.  Nick flies out and starts running,
	dodging the crowd.

	Three uniformed policemen, including Ohashi's assistant,
	hurry toward him; they're dismayed to find that Kobo is
	gone.

					NICK
			Where's Ohashi?

	Instead of offering him help, the policemen grab him and
	slap a pair of handcuffs on Nick's wrists.

					NICK
			What the hell are you doing?!

								 CUT TO:

	HOLDING CELL - TOKYO POLICE STATION

	Nick, waiting alone in the cell.  It's been hours.  A door
	at the end of the hall opens.

	Ohashi stops in front of his cell.

					OHASHI
			Your plane leaves at six.  Two
			officers will escort you.

					NICK
			For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your
			help.  Let me out of here!

					OHASHI
			You had my help, detective.

					NICK
			If anything happens to her while I'm
			here --

					OHASHI
			-- Do you know where she is,
			detective?  Do you know how to find
			her?  Even where to start?  We will
			find them.

					NICK
			I have to get to Sugai.

					OHASHI
			Goodbye, officer.

	Ohashi keeps walking.

					NICK
			OHASHI!

	The LOUD clank of metal on metal.  Ohashi's gone.

					NICK
				(yelling at the top
				 of his lungs)
			OHASHI!!

	HOLD on Nick, his fingers squeezing the bars in rage,
	then --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  ROAD - DAY

	Flood rice paddies stretch to the distance on either side
	of the road.  We PAN over to Kobo at a phone kiosk outside
	a gas station.

					KOBO
				(in Japanese)
			Yes.  Do it.


	INT.  SUGAI'S HOUSE - AT THAT MOMENT

	Kobo's girl, Sugai's daughter, hangs up the phone.  She's
	been on the other end of the line.


	INT.  SUGAI'S ROOM

	The door swings open.  Sugai is sitting on the floor.  The
	girl is carrying a tray of tea.  Beneath the tray, we spot
	something else -- the butt of a short-bladed tanto.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  NARITA AIRPORT - TOKYO - DAY

	A police car rolls through the service gate.  We see Nick
	inside the car along with two police guards.


	INT.  HOLDING ROOM - NARITA AIRPORT

	A white room.  No chairs.  Jet engines can be HEARD
	through the walls.  Nick is sitting on the floor,
	defeated.  He doesn't look up when he hears someone enter.

					ICH (O.S.)
			I'll tell you one thing.  You can't
			solve a thing sitting on your ass.

	Nick looks up.  Ich is in uniform.  A revolver and batton
	hang from his white web gear.  His undershirt bulges
	through his khaki shirt.  He looks ridiculous.  Nick has
	never seen a more beautiful sight.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  POLICE CAR

	Ich is driving.  Nick is seated behind a cage in the back
	seat.  His hands are cuffed.  Ich is driving through the
	freight area towards a perimeter guard.

					NICK
			I was ready to have your ass for
			taking off on me.

					ICH
			I followed them.  An hour from the
			train station.

					NICK
			How many men?

					ICH
			I couldn't tell.

					NICK
			Joyce?

					ICH
			I don't know.

					NICK
			We need the plate to negotiate with.

	Ich nods.


	EXT.  AT THE GATE - TOKYO AIRPORT

	The car slows.  Ich speaks rapidly to the guard showing
	him his papers.  The guard takes a good hard look at Nick.
	Time stands still... He waves them through.  Nick can
	breath again.

					NICK
			You know, Ichiro, you just burned
			your bridges.

	Ich is silent for a moment.  He hands Nick's Beretta back
	through the partition.  So it goes.

					ICH
			Rest.

	Nick looks for Ich's eyes in the rearview mirror.  The
	little cop keeps driving, his eyes on the road.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  STREET - BEPUKU - DAY

	Nick and Ich are standing outside their car.  The Police
	radio crackles from inside.

	WHAT THEY SEE:

	A large crowd gathered outside of Sugai's estate.  Police
	have cordoned off the area.  An empty ambulance is parked
	out front with various other cars:  Debonnaire's,
	Cadillac's... A boy in shorts is endlessly bouncing a ball
	against the compound wall.  Whatever happened is long
	over.

	Ich flips off the radio.

					ICH
			Someone attacked him.

					NICK
			Now we've got nothing to negotiate
			with.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  ROAD - DUSK

	The police car streaks across endless fields.

	INSIDE THE CAR

	Nick is at the wheel.  He rubs the sleep from his eyes.
	Ich is slumped down in the seat watching the road.

	Ich pulls out a cigarette.  Nick lights it for him.

					NICK
			Joyce told me about your family.
			It's tough...

	Ich looks up surprised.

					ICH
			Thank you.
				(beat)
			You have one?

					NICK
			A wife.  She left.

					ICH
			I'm sorry.

					NICK
			Me too.

	Ich glances over at Nick, then back at the road.

	Nicks rubs out his cigarette and presses down on the
	accelerator.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  KOBO'S HIDEOUT - DAWN

	A small, contemporary house perched on a dry piece of
	land.  A paved road, lined with dense foliage runs on a
	berm between the flooded rice paddies.

	ON NICK AND ICH

	sitting in the car watching from a hillside turnoff.
	There's no easy way in.

					NICK
			Let's go.

	Ich hands Charlie his shuto -- an 18 inch long knife.

					NICK
			What's that for?

					ICH
			Luck.

	Nick tucks the shuto inside his jacket.

					NICK
			Thanks.

	Nick opens up his door and climbs out.

					ICH
			You know, Nick, we can't lose.

					NICK
				(stopping)
			Why's that?

					ICH
			Because we're the biggest things to
			hit this town since Godzilla.

								 CUT TO:

	THE DIRT ROAD

	leading to the house lined with foliage.  The rice paddies
	on either side.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK AND ICH

	making their way through the waist high water.

	TWO WORKERS

	with their hoes make their way into the water.  They don't
	see our cops.

	OUR COPS

	making their way along the edge of the road.  The SOUND of
	a motorcycle coming.

	THE MOTORCYCLE RIDER

	slows and drops a gear as he turns off the main road and
	onto the dirt berm toward the house.  He's one of Kobo's
	Bosozoku -- a long way from the streets of Tokyo.

	The rider comes around the bend to see --

	A COP

	standing in a uniform.  Ich.  For a moment he doesn't know
	what to do.  Then, he draws a pistol from his belt and
	accelerates toward Ich.

	ICH

	stands his ground as the bike closes in.  The biker takes
	aim.

	Ich drops off to the side as --

	NICK

	rises from a ditch and swings a hoe at the rider as he
	passes, catching the man across the face.  The rider drops
	like a swatted fly.  The biker's momentum carries it a few
	yards before it falls and skids to a halt.

	Nick hurries to the bike.

	Ich drags the biker off the road, then catches up to his
	partner.

	NICK AND ICH

	raise the heavy bike.  Nick mounts.  He takes the riders
	helmet and goggles from Ich, and puts them on.

					ICH
			What are you going to do?

	Nick doesn't know exactly.  He taps the bike into gear, it
	torques like a mule.  There's a lot more juice here
	than he's used to.

	Nick fishtails for a minute, then gets the hang of it.

	Ich heads off taking another route.


	INT.  HOUSE

	KOBO AND SUGAI'S DAUGHTER

	are putting the last of their belongings into a suitcase.
	She hands him the plate -- Sugai's plate.

	Kobo kisses her as he slips it into his breast pocket.
	The SOUND of a motorcycle approaching from outside.


	EXT.  THE HOUSE

	Kobo steps out, and not recognizing Nick, raises his hand
	to greet what he thinks is one of his men.

	ON NICK

	bearing down on Kobo.

	ON KOBO

	as Nick keeps coming.  He is unable to see clearly until
	Nick is almost on top of him.

	NICK

	dumps the bike at the foot of the stairs and leaps on
	Kobo.

	Nick and Kobo roll off the narrow porch.  Nick breaks
	free.  He isn't fighting fair this time.  He slams his
	foot into Kobo's face and ribs.  Kobo tries to get up, but
	Nick knees him in the chin.

	A woman cries out in Japanese.  Nick turns to see

	JOYCE

	standing at the top of the steps.  A biker is pressing the
	muzzle of a Sig-Saur assault rifle on her.  Kobo's girl is
	beside them holding a small pistol.

	KOBO

	gets to his feet.  The biker tosses Kobo the rifle.  Kobo
	works the charging lever and holds the weapon at his side.
	He has all the time in the world.

	Kobo whirls and kicks Nick in the groin.  Nick falls to
	his knees in agony.

	Kobo towers above Nick as he did in the alley in New York.

					KOBO
			Still on your knees, Nick?

	Kobo walks off, his back to Nick.

					KOBO
			There's nothing you can do for me
			anymore.  I have the plate.  Sugai's
			dead.  No there is something.

	He walks up to the steps to Joyce.

					KOBO
			You can tell me who I should shoot
			first.

	Nick struggles to get to his feet.  Kobo turns and faces
	Nick at the foot of the steps.

	ICH

	appears behind Kobo and takes him down with an amazing
	display of baton work that shows a lifetime of training.

	He grabs the gun.  A biker bursts out of the door.  Ich
	fires, hitting him in the thigh.  He drops his gun.

	SUGAI'S DAUGHTER

	grabs the gun.

	NICK

	tackles her, and wrestles the gun away.  She grabs for it.
	Nick slugs her.

	A GUN BLAST

	Ich is hit in the back of his shoulder, falls onto the
	porch.

	KOBO

	the shooter, is holding a pistol -- a Glock 17 automatic.
	He fires at

	NICK AND JOYCE

	who scramble for cover.

	KOBO

	continues firing as he climbs onto a motorcycle.  He pops
	the clutch and flies off down the road.  Nick fires after
	him, but Kobo's gone.

					NICK
				(to Ich)
			You all right?

					ICH
			Yes...

					NICK
				(to Joyce)
			Call for help.

	Nick mounts the other bike, and puts the turbo charged
	rocket into gear.

	THE ROAD

	Rain pours down as Kobo turns onto the main road.  He
	opens up the throttle, and in less than a second, he's a
	screaming dot in the distance.

	NICK

	comes around the same corner.  His bike fishtails and
	slides out from under him.

	FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD

	Kobo tears past a police car.  The police car takes off
	after him.

	THE FOOTHILLS

	A series of steep switchbacks traverse the steep, densely
	forested hills.

	Kobo's bike flies up the road.  The police car can't keep
	up, begins losing ground.

	THE POLICE CAR

	going flat out, falling further and further behind.
	Kobo's going to escape.

	SUDDENLY

	Nick, bent low, shoots past the cop car.  His left arm is
	scraped and bloody.

	ON KOBO

	glancing back, to see Nick gaining on him.  Kobo's
	pleased.  He gives it more gas.

	NICK

	pulling eight-five... ninety... one hundred.  The rain
	stings his face.  It's hard to keep his eye open.

	THE FOOTHILLS

	Kobo leaning into one of the steep turns, climbing higher
	and higher toward the clouds clinging to the top of the
	peak.

	NICK

	is gaining on him.  He HEARS something coming up behind
	him.

	A BOSOZOKU

	the one Ich shot in the leg, is closing fast on his tail.

	ON NICK

	as the biker draws even.

	THE BIKER

	pulls out his long knife and slashes at Nick's shoulder.

	Nick drops back causing him to miss.  The biker drops
	back.  Nick tries to speed up, but the biker sticks with
	him.  He's a good rider, this boy.  Very, very good.

	The biker moves in again, blade drawn.

	NICK SEES

	something the biker doesn't.

	A TRUCK

	coming around the corner.

	NICK

	swerves to avoid it at the last moment.  The biker reacts
	too late and runs --

	INTO THE GLEAMING

	radiator of the two ton truck, and disappears beneath its
	wheels.

	ON KOBO

	around the bend, glancing back.  Empty road.  He eases up
	on the throttle -- a free man... He circles back only to
	see

	NICK

	burst around the corner charging toward him at a hundred-
	and-twenty miles per hour, in the driving rain.

	KOBO

	waits and waits.  Nick draws closer.  Then, Kobo tears off
	back down the mountain, shooting past Nick.

	Nick brakes... He slows down, and starts to turn, but the
	wheels whirl on the gravel and the bike goes into a skid,
	heading right for the edge of the road.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK'S MOTORCYCLE

	flying over the edge of the road, and down the cliff.

								 CUT TO:

	THE EDGE OF THE ROAD

	Nick, lying on his stomach at the edge of the cliff, his
	arm is probably broken.

	He tries to get up with a one arm push up.  It's hopeless.
	His head falls into a puddle of water.

	The WHINE of an approaching motorcycle.  Kobo has come
	back for him.

	Nick, in excruciating pain, struggles for his gun.

	KOBO

	bearing down on Nick.

	NICK

	struggling to get his gun.  Finally he does.  But it's
	caked in mud.  If the barrel is stuffed it will explode.
	Nick has to take the chance.

	ON KOBO

	Closer and closer.

	NICK

	aims as best he can and fires.  The mud caked gun explodes
	in his hand.  Nick screams in agony.

	KOBO

	pulls his bike up inches in front of Nick's head.  Nick
	seems to be bleeding everywhere:  his hand, his nose, his
	mouth, the side of his head...

	Kobo's face and neck is caked in blood from when Nick beat
	him.

	The rain pours down.

	He picks up the gun.  Points it at Nick, squeezes the
	trigger.

					KOBO
				(slowly)
			Bang... bang...

	He tosses the gun in front of Nick's face.

					KOBO
			... You're dead.

	The sound of approaching Police SIRENS.

	Kobo swings the bike around, goes a hundred yards down the
	road, then swings back.

	Kobo guns the engine.  He gain speed... thirty, thirty-
	five.

	NICK

	struggles to get up.  He can't.

	KOBO

	opening the throttle.

	NICK

	crawling a few inches, that's it.

	KOBO

	twenty yards away.

	NICK

	reaches into his coat and pulls Ich's 18 inch shuto out.

	He rolls away at the last moment, slashing Kobo's ankle as
	he races past.

	KOBO

	screams in pain.  He tries to stop too suddenly.  The bike
	flips over.  Kobo flies into the air then hits the
	pavement on his side and rolls a few yards down the road.
	He stops on his back.  It's lucky he's alive.

	The SOUND of fast approaching police SIRENS.

	THE PLATE

	has fallen out of Kobo's jacket.  It rests in the road,
	halfway between the two men.

	KOBO

	crawls toward it on his belly.

	NICK

	mustering all his strength, struggles across the road on
	all fours.

	KOBO

	crawling snake-like.

	NICK

	still moving, his arms and legs feel like lead.

	KOBO'S FINGERS

	as they reach for the plate.

	NICK

	grabs Kobo's wrist forcing him to drop the plate.  Nick
	picks up a rock.  It looks as if he's going to smash
	Kobo's head.  Instead, he brings it down on the plate,
	shattering it in a half-dozen pieces.

	Nick tosses the pieces in front of Kobo's face.

					NICK
			Keep the change.

	Nick, exhausted, slowly falls onto his back.  He looks
	over at Kobo, their faces are inches apart.  Nick makes a
	slashing mark with his index finger above his eyebrows.
	The same gesture Kobo made to Nick through the two-way
	mirror in New York.

	Nick passes out.  His eyes shut... the screen...

								FADES TO BLACK.

	BLACK SCREEN

	The SOUND of three police cars screeching to a halt.  The
	SOUNDS of the police SIRENS winding down.

	The SIRENS get softer mixing with the SOUND of RINGING
	phones, CLACKING typewriters, VOICES...


	FADE IN:

	INT.  TOKYO POLICE HEADQUARTERS

	Fifty identical desks.  Fifty identically dressed men in
	white shirts and ties work under fluorescent lights.

	OHASHI

	is at his desk studying a report.

	Suddenly, the lights go out.  The fan's stop, so do the
	electric typewriters.

	Ohashi looks up to see --

	ICH

	walking toward him down the long aisle, his left arm is
	bandaged, his right hand handcuffed to Kobo on crutches.

	Ich silently leads the captured man down the long aisle to
	Ohashi's desk.

	ICH

	stops in front of the desk and snaps to attention.

					ICH
			Constable Ichiro Matsumoto presents
			captured prisoner Kobo, Chief
			Inspector Ohashi.

	Ich salutes.

					OHASHI
			Inspector Ohashi will take charge of
			the prisoner.

	Ich uncuffs Kobo and steps aside to reveal --

	NICK

	standing at the far end of the room by the fuse box.  He's
	also bandaged and on crutches.

	Nick looks at Ohashi without saying a word, then flips the
	main switch up.  The lights and fans start working.

	He turns and walks out the door.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  POLICE COURTYARD - A FEW DAYS LATER

	A small decoration ceremony.

	ON ICHIRO

	getting two golden suns pinned to the lapel of his dress
	uniform.

	In the far corner

	NICK, JOYCE AND

	Ichiro's wife, dressed in a formal kimono, watch the
	ceremony.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  JAPANESE RESTAURANT - TOKYO - DAY

	Joyce and Nick are sitting alone at a table.  Nick's left
	arm in in a sling.

					NICK
			Can't make you change your mind?

					JOYCE
			Last time you asked me to come along
			I nearly got a hole in my head.

					NICK
			Might be different in New York.

					JOYCE
			Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find
			out.

					NICK
			I'd like that.

	Ich sits down with two fresh bowls of soba noodles.  Nick
	hesitates.

					ICH
			You can do it.

	Nick picks up his chopsticks with his good hand.  He
	begins to slurp the noodles.

					ICH
			Louder, pal, louder.

					NICK
			Joyce, give the assistant Chief
			Inspector a drink, would you?

	As Joyce refills all their cups we...

								 SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  EIGHT THREE PRECINCT - NEW YORK CITY - DAY

	It's raining.  A sun shower.


	INT.  POLICE STATION

	Capt. Oliver is standing by the window watching the rain
	pour down.

					OLIVER
			... Remember, counterfeiting is the
			Feds.  They'll be all over
			Abolofia's place.  Stick tight.
			You I.D. the other plate, he does
			real time.

					NICK
			Right.

	Reveal Nick sitting in front of Oliver's desk, his one arm
	is still in a sling.  Nick gets to his feet.

					OLIVER
				(still not facing
				 him)
			You know, Nick, if you'd held on to
			that plate, you could've been a very
			rich man.

	Oliver turns to face Nick.  Nick just looks at him, then:

					NICK
			Never crossed my mind.

	Oliver nods; he believes him.

					OLIVER
			Be careful on the run.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  SQUAD BAY - NIGHT

	In contrast to the Japanese police station -- it's chaos.
	Cops are in every imaginable kind of dress, trash cans
	over flow, a handcuffed prisoner screams abuse to anyone
	who will listen.

	THE RAIDING PARTY

	a dozen men in all, are donning flak jackets and
	windbreakers with POLICE and TREASURY stenciled on the
	back.

	NICK

	walks in with two heavy bullet proof vests slung over his
	shoulder.  He squeezes past the raiding party to find

	ICH

	sitting at a desk, thumbing through a Frommer's guide to
	New York City.  Nick drops one of the vests on the desk.
	It lands like a ton of bricks.  Ich continues to read.

	A Sergeant walks in.

					SERGEANT
			Saddle up.  Hard team in the first
			unit.  Conklin, your RMP awaits.

	The cops and treasury men, grabbing their gear, head for
	the door.

	Nick is struggling to get into his vest using one arm.

					NICK
			Sure you want to come?  Probably
			better than the Greyline Tour.

	Ich stands up, shoves the guidebook in his back pocket.
	He helps Nick fasten the strap in back.

					ICH
			You wouldn't make it without me.

	Nick smiles, takes the Frommer's out of Ich's pocket and
	tosses it into the trash.

	Nick hands him a shotgun, takes another one off the rack
	for himself.

	We watch from behind as the two men head down the long
	hallway toward the exit.

					ICH
			Think we'll get him, Nick?

					NICK
			We can't lose.

					ICH
			How can you be so sure?

	Nick opens the door at the far end of the hallway.  They
	step out into the sunlit rain.

					NICK
			Cause you're the biggest thing to
			hit this town since...

	Before Nick can finish his line, the door SLAMS SHUT
	behind them.

								 FADE TO BLACK.

					THE END
BLACK RAIN

                                             November 1987






	A BLACK SCREEN:

	Various voices:	  "Big six"... "That's six the hard way"...
			  "Seven or eleven"... "Play two"...

	FADE IN:

	EXT.  UPPER EAST SIDE - NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

	One of the pristine blocks of brownstones where even the
	garbage seems gift wrapped.  The VOICES continue over as
	we move in on a particular building where a DOORMAN is
	holding open the door for a dowager and her poodle.

	The voices continue:  "Hit me"... "Double down"... "Let it
	ride"... "Hit me"... "Anymore for the come out"...
	"Card"...

	In contrast to the outside of this sedate, quiet
	brownstone, we go inside to find...


	INT.  BROWNSTONE APARTMENT

	... a miniature Las Vegas, complete with music, drinks,
	tuxedoed dealers and croupiers:  roulette, craps, Black
	Jack.  Wall to wall people.  The fact that casino gambling
	happens to be illegal in New York doesn't stop these
	Connecticut slummers, hollow-cheek nightlifers, and junior
	wiseguys from having a good time.

	AT THE CARD TABLE

	NICK CONKLIN, holding a dollar cigar, is trying to pull a
	winning hand.  In his late thirties, Nick has the sort of
	quiet good looks that takes an extra glance to appreciate.
	His Moe Ginsburg rent-a-tux is too tight, his ruffled
	shirt, out of date; Nick could care less.

	Two other players are still in the game.  One of them is a
	lithe DEBUTANTE surrounded by an entourage of giggling
	friends and tuxedoed men.  The pot is huge.

	Nick flips two one hundred dollar chips onto the pot.

					NICK
			One, and one on top.

					DEALER
			House sees.

					PLAYER ONE
				(hesitates)
			I'm out.

	Disgusted, he throws down his cards.

	It's down to Nick and the debutante.  The cocky deb gives
	Nick a long look, confident she can win.

					DEBUTANTE
				(her eyes still on
				 Nick)
			I see the deuce, and one to chase
			them home.

	She throws her chips on the pot.  Nick hesitates, then
	decides to match it.

					NICK
			Call.

					DEBUTANTE
				(showing her hand)
			Ladies, aces wired.  Sorry sport.

	Nick turns over his cards, Jacks and tens, not good enough
	to win.  Elated, the deb gets up from the table and joins
	her giggling friends.  Nick walks over to her.

					NICK
			Very nice, Barbie.
				(pointing toward her
				 boyfriend)
			Now, I'd take Ken over there and go
			home.

					DEBUTANTE
			Why's that?

					NICK
			It's time.  That's all.

					BOYFRIEND
			The lady wants to play.  Someone
			should teach you to be a better
			loser, loser.

					NICK
			Listen, Ken --

					BOYFRIEND
			My name is not Ken --

					NICK
			-- I'm offering you the benefit of
			my experience.

					DEBUTANTE
			Looks like you have a lot of
			experience in places like this.  It
			was nice of them to relax the dress
			code for you.

	That draws a laugh from her friends.  The entourage heads
	for the bar.

	CHARLIE SKLOARIS, twenty-three, steps in front of the
	debutante, blocking her path.

	She steps to the side.  Charlie steps with her.  Charlie's
	pushing it, he's always pushing it.  She's not amused.
	Finally, Charlie lets her pass.  He comes up to Nick.

					CHARLIE
			Typical New York woman, big
			attitude, small apartment, no tits.

	Only two things count to Charlie:  his job and his women,
	but not necessarily in that order.

					CHARLIE
			I think she got to you, pappy.

					NICK
				(checking his watch)
			You want a popsicle, go to Good
			Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'

					CHARLIE
				(glancing at the
				 door)
			Still, you gotta wonder how she'd
			look in handcuffs.

	Nick, wary, eyes this kid.  Charlie shrugs, spreads his
	arms defensively.  The SOUND of pounding on the front
	door.

	THE DOOR

	splinters.  The bouncer steps back as four helmeted
	emergency service officers -- the first members of the
	raiding party -- rush in.

	Pandemonium.  People rush for the exit -- any exit.

	AT THE BAR

	Nick and Charlie hold up their glasses.

					NICK
				(calmly)
			Alley oop.

	They down their drinks, then set them down.

	Charlie pulls out the Binaca, offering Nick a spritz, but
	Nick is already pulling out his POLICE BADGE and hanging
	it around his neck.  Charlie quickly follows suit.

	A HALF DOZEN COPS

	line the patrons up against the wall.  The Asst. D.A.,
	PATTY ZACHARA, climbs onto the crap table.  A petite,
	nervous woman, Patty has dressed in a Channel suit for the
	occasion.

					ZACHARA
			Settle down.  Hey, quiet... Please.

	Not a prayer.

					NICK
			SHUT THE HELL UP, GODDAMNIT!

	That quiets them.

					NICK
			My name is Conklin.  Let's do this
			fast so I can go home.

	Zachara, annoyed, looks at Nick.

					NICK
				(softer)
			It's all yours.

					ZACHARA
				(reads)
			Under section 216 of the New York
			State Penal code, I serve notice
			that this premise and it's
			occupants...

	NICK

	catches the Debutante's eye across the room.  She smiles
	at him, he was right.  He shrugs, spreads his hands.
	That's life.

	A well groomed middle aged man, who we'll come to know as
	CAVELLO, suddenly bolts from the crowd lined up against
	the wall.

	Charlie spins around to stop him --

					CHARLIE
			Whoa -- where do you think you're
			going, hotdog.

	Cavello butts him with his head, sending Charlie to the
	floor.  Then, crosses his arms in front of his face and
	plunges through the WINDOW.

	Nick, not missing a beat, gives a small sigh as he
	follows.

					NICK
				(sighs)
			Fabulous...

	He takes off after him.


	EXT.  STREET UPPER EAST SIDE - NIGHT

	Nick, short of breath, chases Cavello down the residential
	street, past the dog-walkers, past the doormen, past the
	fur-coated women climbing out of taxies... Unfortunately,
	Cavello has a good half block on him.

	From nowhere, Charlie blasts past leaving Nick a half
	block behind, silently cursing his age.

	AT THE CORNER

	a limo jerks to a halt, and Cavello jumps in.  The limo
	streaks away.

	CHARLIE

	turns to see Nick, hands on knees, gasping for air.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  LOCKER ROOM - TWO EIGHT PRECINCT - NIGHT

	Now in their street clothes, Charlie and Nick stand in
	front of the mirrors.  Charlie is working his brush and
	hair dryer as if his life depended on it.  Nick, in
	contrast, shoves his hair back with his fingers and
	glowers at himself in the mirror.

					CHARLIE
				(over the dryer)
			... It's not like you were slow or
			anything... I think you did just
			fine.  I think you did great.

					NICK
			Thanks.

	Nick turns to leave.

					CHARLIE
			Hey, hey, where you goin'?

					NICK
			Home.


	EXT.  POLICE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	Nick strides out the door.  Charlie hurries after him.

					CHARLIE
			Wait up.  You know the guy who did
			the Weismuller through the window --

					NICK
			-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.

	Charlie trails Nick to his motorcycle:  a Harley hog
	complete with wide gleaming fenders and twin tanks.  The
	bike is held together with tape and baling wire.

					CHARLIE
			You know him?

	Nick tries to kick-start this behemoth, but it's not easy.

					NICK
			He works for Frank Abolofia.
			Atlantic City.  Casinos.

					CHARLIE
			So why dive through the glass for a
			nickel and dime bust?

	Charlie puts his foot up on Nick's fender to tie his shoe.
	Nick, spotting an ankle holster peeking from Charlie's
	sock, grabs Charlie's foot.  Charlie teeters.

					NICK
			What's this?

					CHARLIE
			Let go...

	Nick pulls out a Beretta 32.

					CHARLIE
			Back-up.

					NICK
			Get rid of it.

					CHARLIE
			Why?

					NICK
			It's not regulation.  And the only
			way you're gonna stop anybody with
			it is to show it to him, and while
			he's laughing, you can shove it down
			his throat.

					CHARLIE
				(looking at Nick's
				 bike)
			I'll get rid of it when you get rid
			of the egg-beater.

	The Harley comes to life spitting a cloud of blue smoke.
	Nick puts on his paint-flecked helmet, slides down some
	ski goggles.

					CHARLIE
			Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag
			Cavello.

					NICK
			Charlie...

	Nick pops the bike into gear.

					NICK
			... You still got shaving cream on
			your ear.

	Nick rolls out and disappears in a haze of blue smoke.


	EXT.  BELT PARKWAY - VERRAZANO BRIDGE - NIGHT

	WE FIND Nick, a lonely, solitary figure bobbing in and out
	of the lights and shadows.  The SOUND of wind whips
	through his helmet; cold air stings his cheeks... The tail
	lights of Nick's bike disappear into the night.


	EXT.  SUBURBAN STREET - STATEN ISLAND - NIGHT

	Civil service heaven.  Nick hits the cut switch and glides
	past the manicured lawns and well kept houses of this
	development.  A basketball net in every driveway, a Buick
	or Chrysler in every garage.

	One house sticks out.  The lawn is brown, paint is peeling
	off the garage door and newspapers are scattered on the
	driveway.  Nick glides once around the cul de sac looking
	at the house.  His house.  It's as inviting as an open
	grave.  He shoots away.


	INT.  EL GRECO DINER - STATEN ISLAND - NIGHT

	A hanger sized roadhouse, wall to wall red velvet.

	Nick's the sole figure at the counter, coffee and the
	Daily News in front of him.  A NURSE walks in and sits
	down a half dozen seats away.  Nick look up.

					NICK
			Short shift?

					CONNIE
			Yeah... I came to save you.  If
			you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  CONNIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Nick and Connie are in bed.  They're both looking up at
	the ceiling.  They've just made love.

					CONNIE
			It's getting too cold even for me,
			Nick.

					NICK
			Connie...

					CONNIE
			All right, how's the new partner?

					NICK
			High spirits, desire, commitment.

					CONNIE
			You'll take care of that.

					NICK
			Give me a break, would you?

					CONNIE
			If you give me one.

	Nick kisses her.  The first suggestion of real affection.
	The SOUND of someone KNOCKING on the door.  Reluctantly,
	they stop.  Connie gets up and puts on her robe.

					NICK
			Are you expecting anyone?

					CONNIE
			I wasn't expecting you.

	She disappears down the hallway.  We HEAR the door open,
	then telling someone to wait.

					CONNIE
				(poking her head in
				 the room)
			Imagine a small, greasy Boy Scout.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  CONNIE'S APARTMENT

	Nick, wearing only his pants, is doing a slow burn.
	Charlie is holding his hands up defensively.

					CHARLIE
			... I found the goombah... Cavello.
			He's --

					NICK
			-- I should tear your head off.

					CHARLIE
			Whoa, I knew you were going to say
			that.  I absolutely anticipated
			that, Nick.  But I said to myself,
			Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on
			this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll
			be pissed for a moment, but then
			it'll dawn on him --

					NICK
			-- Hey, I got a better chance of
			being hit by a bus then moving up.

	Charlie looks away momentarily, letting it slide.  He
	knows he's on sensitive ground.

					CHARLIE
			... Look... they told me at the
			Greek's you were here.  I'm sorry, I
			never imagined...

					CHARLIE
				(buddy buddy)
			I like her.  She's nice.
				(lowering his voice)
			For her age.

	The bedroom door opens.  Connie enters, dumps Nick's
	clothes on the couch, tosses his gun on top of the pile.
	Without a word, she goes back inside and slams the door
	behind her.

	Nick, pissed, slowly turns to face Charlie.  Charlie
	shrugs.  Nick's got nothing better to do than go.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  LIME HOUSE - CHINATOWN - NIGHT

	The Lime House is a little piece of Italy in the heart of
	Chinatown, and tonight, it's packed.  Any selection on the
	jukebox that isn't Frank Sinatra is Jerry Vale.  Behind
	the bar are two fat BROTHERS.  One pours drinks, the other
	dishes out Scungilli.  It's three a.m.  It's always three
	a.m. at the Lime House.

	AT THE BACK TABLE

	Our man CAVELLO is unloading steaming Scungilli onto an
	already heaping plate in front of an imperious looking
	JAPANESE MAN.  The Japanese Man, in his mid-fifties, wears
	a gray suit, and not a strand of his jet black hair is out
	of place.

	A Japanese TRANSLATOR, doing his best to translate
	Cavello's heavily accented English, sits between them.

	AT THE BAR

	Charlie is looking straight ahead, afraid Cavello might
	peg him.  Nick is at ease.

					CHARLIE
			What are they doing now?

					NICK
			Eating Scungilli, just like the last
			time you asked.

					CHARLIE
			Who do you think the Jap is?

					NICK
			Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru.
			How would I know?

					CHARLIE
			I don't blame you for being sore.
			It'll pass when we bag him.

	Charlie, trying to relax, gestures toward his foot.

					CHARLIE
			Whatdaya think?  'Bostonians'.
			Eighty-five bucks.
				(lowering his voice)
			Girls go for shoes.  Second place
			they look.
				(off Nick's
				 reaction)
			Hey, I read it in a magazine.

	Nick's attention is drawn to a trio walking in the door.

					NICK
				(dead serious)
			Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise
			me?

					CHARLIE
			What?

	WHAT THEY SEE:  TWO BODYGUARDS are making a quick sweep of
	the bar.  FRANK ABOLOFIA, s stocky man with silver grey
	hair, sweeps in behind them.  Abolofia has mitts like a
	meat packer and a fifty dollar manicure.  A heavyweight
	Mafioso.

					NICK
			Frank Abolofia.

					CHARLIE
			The Wolf?

	Abolofia walks to Cavello's table.  All rise and shake
	hands.  The two hitters take seats at the bar.  The two
	brothers scramble to serve their distinguished guests.

					NICK
				(in a whisper)
			Some party.

					CHARLIE
			Maybe we should do something?

					NICK
			Charlie, take your gum, stick it
			under your ass and keep it warm.

	Nick turns away, resumes his drink.

	NICK'S POV IN THE MIRROR BEHIND THE BAR:  two new Japanese
	men step in the door.  Early twenties, spiky hair, dark
	Versace suits.

	NUMBER ONE

	wears tortoise shell shades.  He coolly checks out the
	room then nods to --

	NUMBER TWO

	who pulls a Spas 12, automatic shotgun from under his
	coat, and spits out three rounds.  A window shatters.
	Everyone hits the floor.

	NUMBER ONE

	slowly walks toward Cavello's table.

	NUMBER TWO

	covers the floor.  Abolofia's bodyguards show their empty
	hands.

	NICK AND CHARLIE

	on the floor.  They don't have the artillery for this guy
	either.

	AT THE TABLE

	Our Japanese businessman knows these people.  He eyes them
	contemptuously.

	Abolofia has put enough people in this situation to be
	philosophical about it.  He stops chewing.  A tiny
	hand motion to his bodyguards is enough to stop any
	precipitous action.

					NUMBER ONE
				(in Japanese)
			Give it to me.

	The Japanese businessman looking straight ahead.  A long,
	silent pause... Then, still not facing him:

					BUSINESSMAN
				(in Japanese)
			Go to hell.

	Number One slips his fingers beneath his shades, massaging
	his eyes.  IN A FLASH, he pulls a shuto from under his
	coat.  The 18 inch blade gleams like a neon tube.

	He presses the tip of the blade against the businessman's
	throat.

	CHARLIE

	his hand close around the grip of the Beretta.  He unsnaps
	the ankle holster.  The SNAP can be heard across the room.
	Nick's hand closes around Charlie's and squeezes till the
	knuckles turn white.

					CHARLIE
				(in a whisper)
			What are you doing?

					NICK
			Saving your life.

	NUMBER TWO

	levels the scattergun at Nick and Charlie.

	AT THE TABLE - NUMBER ONE

	calmly holds the blade at the man's throat as he reaches
	into the man's jacket and removes a small, rectangular,
	plastic-wrapped parcel.

	He feels its weight, then flips it to NUMBER TWO.

	Abolofia, realizing that whatever is going on doesn't
	affect him or his, resumes eating.

					ABOLOFIA
			You people are wild... Wild.

	NUMBER ONE backs the blade off.  The man raises his napkin
	to the small wound.  A droplet of blood has stained his
	shirt collar.  NUMBER ONE turns around as if to leave.

	What happens next could be a whim, an after thought.
	Number One spins around and THRUSTS the blade deep into
	the man's chest.  He withdraws it with a half twist, and
	in the same motion fatally slashes the translator's throat
	before the old man's body hits the floor.

	Blood pours from the businessman's mouth onto his
	Scungilli, spreading across the white cloth and onto the
	floor.

	CAVELLO

	reaches for a gun under his coat.  But NUMBER TWO pumps
	two rounds into his face.  At this range, there's not much
	left.

	The killers slowly back out the door, covering the room
	with the scattergun.  The minute the door shuts, Nick
	leaps up, pulling his shield and revolver.

					NICK
				(shouting)
			Police officers.  Everybody stay
			put.
				(to Charlie)
			Get back up.

	Abolofia's eyebrows rise at this development.

	Nick bolts out the door leaving Charlie in charge.  He's
	never been in charge before.

					CHARLIE
				(nervously showing
				 shield)
			Police.


	EXT.  THE LIME HOUSE - NIGHT

	A Lincoln tears around the corner to pick the killers up.

	Nick flies out the Lime House door and hits the ground.

	Number Two pumps out shells as fast as he can squeeze the
	trigger.  He's wild.  The front windows of the Lime House
	shatter.

	The LIMO DRIVER jerks to a halt.  Number Two tosses the
	package to him.

	Nick empties his revolver.  Number Two goes down.

	The driver floors the accelerator, leaving Number One to
	take off on foot.  Nick follows, reloading as he runs.


	INT.  THE LIME HOUSE

	Everyone's frozen on the floor.

					CHARLIE
			Call 911.  Tell them an officer
			needs assistance.  Say ten thirteen.

	Nothing from the owner who looks at Abolofia.  Charlie
	grabs the owner by his collar and shoves him toward the
	phone.

					CHARLIE
			Do it, you dumb bastard!

	Suddenly Charlie feels something wet at his feet.  He
	looks down to see that he's standing in a pool of blood
	from the massacre.  So much for his new shoes.

	He wheels around, then quickly backs out the door.


	EXT.  STREET - DOWN THE BLOCK FROM THE LIME HOUSE

	Deserted.  The wail of police sirens in the distance.
	Charlie has his gun out.  He's drenched in sweat.  Where
	is his partner?

					CHARLIE
			NICK...!  Shit... SHIT!!

								 CUT TO:

	ANOTHER STREET - ALLEY - NIGHT

	Nick, gun drawn, slowly rounds the corner to the alley:
	it's the ad hoc drugstore for the night.  Drugs going up
	and down in pails, two dozen junkies buying, shooting,
	slumped on the ground.  Everyone scatters -- the one's
	that can.

	AN ABANDONED PAIL

	swings slowly back and forth from three stories up.  Nick
	cautiously moves down the alley, holding the gun in both
	hands.  A Junkie steps out of a doorway, Nick swings his
	gun and nearly blows him away.

	NUMBER ONE

	We see his eyes first as he steps out of the darkness at
	the back of the alley.  From now on we'll call him KOBO.
	His sunglasses are on his forehead; his hands dropped
	casually at his side.  A very cool character.

	Kobo slowly raises his hand, and making a gun with his
	finger, slowly points and "shoots" at Nick... He lowers
	his hand.

					NICK
			On the ground, man.  NOW!!

	Kobo cups his hands around his ear.  He doesn't understand
	English.  Nick, keeping his gun fixed, comes up to him and
	kicks out his legs.

	Kobo falls flat on his chest.

	Nick pulls out his cuffs.  But Kobo lunges for Nick's
	ankle and yanks it toward him.  Nick stumbles backward;
	Kobo's on his feet.  Before Nick can stand, Kobo lands a
	brutal kick to the side of Nick's head.

	Nick gets up, barrels into him.  Kobo knees Nick in the
	solar plexus, then lands two more well placed kicks in
	Nick's back.  It's not that Nick's a bad fighter, it's
	that this kid is so damn fast.

	Nick slowly gets to his feet.  KOBO lands two more brutal
	shots to the side of Nick's head.  He's a bloody mess.

	TWO POLICE CARS

	stop at the end of the alley.  FOUR OFFICERS climb out.

	CHARLIE

	joins the cops as they run down the alley to find Nick
	getting pummeled.

	Charlie shoots at Kobo.  Misses.  Kobo turns to see the
	five cops, guns drawn.

	Nick, on one knee, spits out blood and a few teeth.

	Kobo calmly slips the shuto out of his coat pocket and
	drops it next to Nick.  The blade gleams in the light.
	That was next.  Nick got lucky.

	Kobo towers imperiously above Nick.  Their eyes lock.  We
	hold then...

								 FADE TO BLACK.

	FADE IN:

	NICK'S LIVING ROOM - STATEN ISLAND - MORNING

	There isn't a stick of furniture, but that's not the half
	of it.  In the middle of the room is a motorcycle on a
	centerstand.  A drop cloth is spread around it, tools
	neatly aligned.  It's a Harley -- but this one is in
	perfect condition.

	A phone RINGS insistently from off screen, then stops.

					NICK (O.S.)
			Yeah... sure, sure I'll be down.

	Nick walks in, naked.  Every muscle aches.  One side of
	his face is completely swollen.  He has a band-aid over
	his right eye; some blood caked on his earlobe.  He stops
	to twist a spark plug in with a ratchet, but it snaps.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  EIGHT - THREE PRECINCT - DAY

	CAPT. OLIVER, early forties, walks between Charlie and
	Nick as they head toward the Medical Examiner's room.
	Oliver doesn't face Nick as he speaks; no love lost
	between these two.

					OLIVER
			How big a package we talking about?

					NICK
				(holding up his
				 hands)
			This by this...

					OLIVER
			Dope?

					NICK
			Not in that company.

					OLIVER
			The old man was a Japanese paper
			manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental
			car were full of it.

					CHARLIE
			Full of what?

					OLIVER
				(annoyed)
			Art and stationary paper.  Cavello
			had five hundred thousand in his
			attache case.

	Nick rubs the back of his neck in obvious pain.

					OLIVER
			One guy do all the damage?

					NICK
			Yeah.

					OLIVER
			Thought you knew your way around
			dark alleys, detective.

	Oliver goes through the swinging doors into the Examiner's
	room.  Charlie shoots Nick a look.  Nick let's it slide.


	INT.  MEDICAL EXAMINATION ROOM

	A TECHIE is showing the night's harvest to Charlie, Nick
	and Oliver.  They're standing over the body of the middle-
	aged Japanese man.

					TECHIE
			... The old man's suit was Japanese.
			The hitter's was Saville row.  No
			I.D.  We're doing a peel now.

	AT ANOTHER TABLE

	Another techie is carefully removing the skin from Number
	Two's fingertips.

	Charlie shuts his eyes and turns away, trying not to throw
	up.

					TECHIE
			There's something you got to see.

	He whips back the sheet, the body is nude.  A towel covers
	the genitals.  Except for the feet, hands, neck, and face,
	the body is covered with elaborate tattoos:  flowers and
	blood, dragons and snakes.

					TECHIE
			What's wrong with this picture?

					CHARLIE
				(nervously)
			I got a tattoo.  Birdie on the ball.
			We all got them when we finished
			basic at Camp Lejune.

					NICK
			Charlie.

					TECHIE
			I thought you guys were trained
			observers?

	They look up surprised.  The techie picks up a hand.  The
	third and forth fingers have been neatly amputated.

					TECHIE
			Eight fingers.
				(ironically)
			Hey, it was a trick question.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

	ABOLOFIA is seated in chair next to his LAWYER.  Nick,
	Oliver, and a third detective are grilling him.

					ABOLOFIA
			He was with a friend, sure.  I shake
			hands with the guy and a minute
			later he's bleeding all over my
			socks.

					ATTORNEY
			Will that do officers?  My client
			has had a terrible shock.

					NICK
			Yeah, he's not used to seeing other
			people do the killing.

					ATTORNEY
			I won't tolerate harassment!

					OLIVER
			What about the package?

					ATTORNEY
			We know nothing about it.

	Silence.  Abolofia looks at Nick, then at Oliver.

					ABOLOFIA
			Hard to believe a trained police
			officer could let this kind of thing
			happen right in front of his face.

					NICK
			I did make a mistake.  I let the
			wrong guy get hit.

	Abolofia doesn't blink an eye, goes for the jugular.

					ABOLOFIA
			Cheer up, Nick.  I'm sure it's
			easier to pick a dead man's pocket.

	Nick springs from his feet.  Oliver grabs Nick before he
	can get close to Abolofia.

					ATTORNEY
			That's it, we're through!

								 CUT TO:

	KOBO

	the Japanese killer who smashed in Nick's face last night.
	He's sitting in an interrogation room an hour later with a
	DETECTIVE and a JAPANESE TRANSLATOR.  He won't talk.

	OBSERVATION ROOM

	Nick and Oliver watching through the glass.

					OLIVER
			Doesn't speak a word of English.
			And he won't speak Japanese either.
			No papers.  The Japanese embassy is
			very interested.

					NICK
			Why?

					OLIVER
			He's wanted in Japan.  They want him
			first.  Then we can have him.

					NICK
			What?

	Oliver nods.  That's the way it is.

	ON KOBO

	he turns and looks at Nick.  He can't possibly see him
	through the one way glass but he knows Nick's there.

	ON NICK

	looking at him.

	ON KOBO

	making a cutting mark across his forehead, right where
	Nick's bandage is.  It's uncanny.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  OLIVER'S OFFICE - LATER

	Nick is sitting in front of Oliver's desk.  The sunlight
	makes him wince; wincing makes his face hurt.

					OLIVER
			Japanese embassy talks to state
			department.  State talks to police
			plaza.  They to me and me to you.
			Shit rolls down hill.

	Oliver drops a file folder on the desk.  Nick opens it:
	petty cash, vouchers and plane tickets.

					OLIVER
			You and Charlie are taking the Jap
			home, tonight.

					NICK
			What...?  What if I say no?

					OLIVER
			Check your gun before you leave.
			They're not allowed in Japan.  It's
			a nice, safe country.

					NICK
			Why me?

					OLIVER
			They said send a detective if I
			could spare one.
				(then)
			I can always spare you.

	Nick bridles at the insult.  Oliver's had a hard-on for
	Nick for years, and Nick's tired of it.

					NICK
				(soft)
			You got something to say to me,
			Captain?

	Oliver doesn't want to get into it.

					OLIVER
			Yeah.  Have a wonderful flight.

								 CUT TO:

	THE ORANGE SUN

	on the tail of a Japan Airlines 747.  A driving rain
	storm.  The plane taxies down the runway and disappears
	into the black rain.


	INT.  AIRLINER

	Kobo, handcuffed and shackled, is in the center seat.
	Nick and Charlie sit on either side.  Charlie is holding
	"Bachelors Japan" in one hand.  Nick's in a sour mood.

					CHARLIE
			... Nick, you're the one that's
			always saying you never go anywhere.

					NICK
			I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie.
			Maybe Vegas.

					CHARLIE
			What are you missing?  Riding your
			motorcycle to the nurse's house.
			That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.

					NICK
			Beats forty hours on a plane.

					CHARLIE
			They say we got to turn around and
			come right back.  That's what they
			say.  I got a plan.

	The last thing Nick wants to hear -- too late.

					CHARLIE
			I call, right?  I say I got the
			dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits
			from some raw clam and we stretch it
			into three days.  You and I become a
			driving force on the local Geisha
			scene.

					NICK
			Not a prayer.

					CHARLIE
				(grinning)
			Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop
			from New York.  You're gonna be the
			biggest thing to hit town since
			Godzilla.

	Nick can't help but smile at this kid.  Charlie looks down
	at the guide book.

					CHARLIE
			Says here, it's very impolite to
			touch someone while you're talking
			to them...
				(nudges Kobo)
			Guess that means you can't talk and
			screw at the same time, huh, hotdog?
			What's the matter, no -- speaky-the-
			language?  Understand this:  You
			will never ever fuck with my partner
			again.

	Nothing from Kobo who is looking straight ahead.  He
	doesn't understand.

					NICK
			Shut-up, Charlie.

	A beat, then Charlie reads a Japanese phrase from the
	book.  A slight facial response from Kobo.  Charlie tries
	it again.  This time Kobo laughs openly.

					NICK
			What'd you say?

					CHARLIE
			Where is the subway station, please.

	Kobo keeps laughing; it's obviously not what Charlie said.

					NICK
			Get a new book.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  AIRLINER - LATER

	The cabin is now darkened.  Kobo and Nick are asleep.  Not
	Charlie, he's still at his book, and listening to U2 on
	his Walkman.  Nick rolls over and opens his eyes to see
	Charlie watching him.  He shuts them hoping to avoid talk.
	Too late.

					CHARLIE
			Nick... You up?

					NICK
			No.

	Charlie removes his headphones.

					CHARLIE
			Nick, have I been a good partner?

					NICK
			Number five with a bullet.

	Nick shuts his eyes.

					CHARLIE
			I just want you to know... I mean
			anybody who says you ever took has
			got to deal with me.

					NICK
			Go to sleep, Charlie.

					CHARLIE
			You didn't take, did you...?  You
			hear things.

	Nick opens his eyes.

					NICK
			I worked the three nine in Queens,
			Charlie.

					CHARLIE
				(surprised)
			I didn't know.

					NICK
			The lieutenant was on the pad along
			with the rest of the squad.  I was
			new, didn't know shit.  When the
			feathers flew, I got called in front
			of the special prosecutor.  It's on
			the top of my personnel file.  They
			think I'm dirty or I cut a deal.
			Doesn't leave you with a lot of
			friends either way.

	Nick shuts his eyes.

					NICK
			I might as well have done something.
			I've been paying for it every
			goddamn day since I got
			transferred...

	HOLD on Nick then...

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  NARITA AIRPORT - JAPAN - DAY

	Nick and Charlie, with Kobo between them, are a strange
	sight in a sea of Japanese faces.  Kobo's hands are cuffed
	behind his back.  Nick also has Kobo cuffed to his wrist.
	The cops are rumpled, exhausted, showing two days of
	stubble.  Kobo looks sharp and wide awake.

	A pair of attractive teenage girls walks past them.

					CHARLIE
			Whoa.  Nick, we're in paradise.

	A PAIR

	of white gloved hands belonging to a Tokyo police officer
	holds up a small, hand letter sign that says:
	CONKLIN/SKLOARIS.  The man holding the sign is NAGASHIMA.
	Two other police officers in spotless tan uniforms stand
	at his side.

	Nick, holding Kobo by his arm, steps up to the police and
	show his I.D.  Nagashima bows.

					NAGASHIMA
			Officers Conklin and -- and...
				(he can't say
				 Charlie's name)
			... gentlemen, welcome.  I am
			assistant inspector Nagashima.

	They show their I.D.

					NICK
			You going to take this crap off our
			hands?

					NAGASHIMA
				(confused)
			Crap...?  Oh, the prisoner.  Yes.

	He barks some orders to the officers who immediately take
	Kobo by the arms and put cuffs on him.  Nick unfastens
	his cuff when they're through.

	In contrast to Nagashima's gentility, the cops are rough
	with the prisoner.

					CHARLIE
				(extends his hand)
			Charlie.  Kon-ich-iwa.

	Nagashima shakes his hand.  Bows.  Charlie bows back.
	Nick wouldn't bow if his life depended on it.  Nagashima
	hands Nick an official looking document.

					NAGASHIMA
			If you will please give this to the
			customs inspector he will expidate
			-- expedite you.  We have a car and
			a driver outside.

					NICK
			Right.

					CHARLIE
				(bows)
			Arigato.

	Nick grabs Charlie by the arm and starts for the customs
	line.

			Hey, when in Rome --

					NICK
			In Rome, I'll bow.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  CUSTOMS BOOTH - DAY

	NICK and CHARLIE make their way through the crowd toward
	the head of a long line.  They dump their bags on the
	counter.  The INSPECTOR, furious that they have taken cuts
	in line, barks at them in Japanese.

					NICK
			Inspector Nagashima told me to give
			you this.

	He hands the Inspector the official looking document.  The
	Inspector scans the paper.  Hands it back to them.

					INSPECTOR
				(broken English)
			You must get in line behind the
			rest.

					NICK
			We're cops.  Pol-ice-men.

	The Inspector signals a nearby POLICEMAN.  The Inspector
	says something in Japanese.  Hands the policeman the
	document.  The policeman shakes his head, amused, points
	to the end of the line.

					NICK
			Fellas, get serious.

	From off screen someone CALLS OUT:

					MAN (O.S.)
			Nick!

	Nick and Charlie turn to see KOBO, their prisoner,
	standing on the other side of the thick plastic divider.
	The handcuffs are off.  The three alleged 'policemen' are
	heading out the door behind him.  It was a set-up:  Nick
	and Charlie have been had.

					KOBO
				(perfect English)
			Thanks for the ride, detective.

	He slowly backs away from the glass as if he had all the
	time in the world, finally disappearing in the crowd.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  TOKYO POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	Fifty identical desks.  Fifty identical phones.  Fifty
	identically dressed men in white shirts and ties working

	Ohashi prides himself on order.

	Nick and Charlie are standing in front of him.

					NICK
			Get me something like an Identi-Kit

	Ohashi remains poker faced.  He continues to arrange

	of a stack of official papers.

					CHARLIE
			There must be some witnesses from

	Still nothing from the good inspector.

					NICK
			What is it, tea time?

	Still nothing from Ohashi.  Finally:

					OHASHI
				(quiet rage)
			You lost a man we wanted for some

					NICK
			Incompetent is letting people waltz
			through a secure area wearing your
			uniforms, carrying official
			documents.

	Ohashi bows slightly, we're not sure why.

					NICK
			I want a gun.

					OHASHI
			It is not allowed.

					NICK
			We're police officers.

					OHASHI
			You're foreigners.

					NICK
			Work with me.  I want your best
			detective.

	Pause.  Ohashi returns to his papers.  Nick can't believe
	it.

					NICK
			Hey, inspector, I don't intend to
			take the rap for this.

					OHASHI
				(not looking up)
			Do you know what this is?

	Ohashi holds up the document that was handed to Nick at
	the airport.

					OHASHI
			It's a laundry list.  Go home,
			detective.

	Nick studies him for a beat, then turns away.  To Charlie:

					NICK
			Let's go.

					CHARLIE
			Nick, we can't just --

					NICK
			I said let's go, Charlie.

	Reluctantly they head towards the door, passing long rows
	of bureaucrats, telephones ringing off the hook.  Nick
	stops at the door, spots a fuse box nearby.  He glances
	back to make sure no one is looking.

	Nick pulls out his handcuffs.  Charlie can't figure out
	what the hell he's doing.  Nick attaches one cuff to the
	main lever then yanks it down.

	The lights go out.  The fan's stop; so do the typewriters;
	so does the air conditioning.  Dead silence.

	Nick attaches the other cuff to a pipe, snaps it shut.
	Now it's impossible to left the main lever.

	From the far end of the room:

					OHASHI
			What are you doing?!

	Nick drops the key down the water fountain drain.

					NICK
			Your best detective, Ohashi.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  POLICE STATION - DAY

	Nick and Charlie cross the street.  Charlie's trying to
	read the name from the piece of paper Ohashi has given
	them.

					CHARLIE
			... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto.
			Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our
			side.

					NICK
			Let's grab some food.

					CHARLIE
			First decent idea you've had.

	Charlie pulls out his 'Footloose in Tokyo" book, flips
	through the pages.

					CHARLIE
			Food... Food, here we go.  Tokyo
			offers a wide variety of food.  It's
			best to sample the local
			specialties, including sashaimi,
			soba, and world renown Kobe beef...

	Nick goes into a restaurant.  Charlie drops the book,
	disgusted with Nick's choice.  Charlie reluctantly follows
	him in.  REVEAL it's a Shakey's Pizza restaurant.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  HOUSING PROJECT - SHIN OKUBO - DAY

	Rows of post-modern buildings of odd shaped windows and
	brightly painted concrete walls.  Nick and Charlie are
	searching for the Japanese cop's building.  They can't
	speak the language; they can't read the signs; and half
	the buildings don't have numbers.  It's a nightmare.

					CHARLIE
			This should be it...

					NICK
			You said that in the last two
			places.

	Charlie holds out the paper to a passing man.

					CHARLIE
			Kore?  Doku?  Kore doku?

	The man gestures toward the building Charlie was pointing
	to.

					NICK
			Okay, you were right.

	Charlie grins, satisfied.


	INT.  HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - CORRIDOR - DAY

	The boys are knocking on a door.  Nick turns the handle.
	It's unlocked.

	THE APARTMENT

	A four tatami room.  An unholy mess:  Food packages, beer
	bottles, stacks of papers and file folders.  Framed
	pictures of long dead relatives hang on the wall.

					CHARLIE
			This the right place?

					NICK
			I hope not.

	A WOMAN now appears at the door.  Middle aged, wizened
	face, in a full traditional Kimono.

					CHARLIE
			Konichiwa.  Ichiro Matsumoto?

	The woman babbles bird-like in rapid Japanese.  She bows.
	They're in the right place.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  SIDE STREET - MINIMAI MURAMATSU - NIGHT

	The jammed streets are barely wide enough to get a
	motorcycle down.  It's a bad neighborhood, one of the
	poorest in Tokyo.

	We spot the small kimono clad WOMAN, clip-clopping on
	wooden geta, leading Nick and Charlie through this
	labyrinth.

					CHARLIE
				(looking around)
			Getting very weird.

					NICK
			I'd feel better if we had some heat.

					CHARLIE
			Maybe we should bail?

	Seeing they've stopped, the woman gestures for them to
	hurry up, then disappears around the corner.

					NICK
				(looking at the maze
				 of streets)
			Think we could find our way back?

								 CUT TO:

	A GARISH PINK SIGN - PINK SARON BAR

	A poor man's idea of a bar.  The woman points inside,
	chirps away in Japanese, bows, then hurries off leaving
	Nick and Charlie on their own.

	INSIDE PINK SARON

	Nick and Charlie disappear into darkness as the woven
	flaps shut behind them.  A vintage wurlitzer juke box
	glows across the room.  An Enka plays.  (Haunting Japanese
	blues.)

					MAN'S VOICE (FROM THE DARKNESS)
			Big shots from New York.  I like
			your style!

	ICHIRO MATSUMOTO steps into a pool of light just inches
	from them.  He is a short overweight man looking every
	minute of his fifty-five years.  His white short sleeve
	shirt is too tight; his narrow tie spotted in the middle;
	his collar soaked in sweat.  He's not drunk yet, but he's
	been at it a while.  Call him Ich.

					ICH
				(bowing)
			Detective Ichiro Matsumoto.  I'm the
			man you're looking for.

	This is Ohashi's best man?  Well, at least he speaks
	English.

					ICH
			The man you are looking for, Kobo,
			was a member of the Samaguchi-gummi.
			A Yakuza.

	Ich nods, offers them what's left of his Sapphoro beer.
	They shake their heads.  Ich finishes it.

					NICK
			Where do we start looking for this
			guy?

					ICH
			Where would you look for the mafia?

					CHARLIE
			The back room at Lombardi's after
			the Columbus Day Parade.  Under the
			bed.  In the mayor's office.
			Everywhere.

	Ich heads for the door without saying a word.

					NICK
			Where're you going, Ichiro?

					ICH
				(stops, faces them)
			The mayor's office, under the bed,
			the back room at Lombardi's.
				(tucking in his
				 shirt tail)
			And call me Ich.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  ICHIBANKAN BAR BUILDING - KABUKI CHO - NIGHT

	Imagine an ultra modern indoor shopping mall, except there
	aren't any stores.  The only product sold here is
	pleasure:  Bars, hostess clubs, Turkish baths.  A post-
	modern red light district with music piped in and
	automated doormen.


	INT.  LAS VEGAS WELCOME CLUB

	Hip, younger Japanese are wedged together at the long
	chrome bar.  The GUYS sport leather jackets and Raybans.
	The GIRLS are decked out in fifties American party dresses
	and short cropped hair.  Jerry Lee Lewis wails in the
	background.

	Nick, Ich and Charlie are at one end of the long bar.  Ich
	is drinking them both under the table.

					ICH
				(singing)
			"Goodness, gracious, great balls of
			fire."
				(raising glass for
				 toast)
			To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.

					NICK
				(checking his watch)
			Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo
			And The Don't's.  Let's book,
			Charlie.  If he starts on Motown,
			we'll be here all night.

					ICH
			No, this is the place for the young
			Yakuza.

					NICK
			That's what you said in the last
			three piss pots.

	Ich sets down his drink, pours more sake for Nick and
	Charlie then for himself.  He's having a great time.

					ICH
			I love you people.  The music, the
			clothes, the movies... Japanese
			respect only what is Japanese.

	Nick glances at Charlie.

					NICK
			It's incredible.  Hit him or
			something.

					CHARLIE
			I don't think he'd feel it.

					ICH
				(beginning to slur
				 his words)
			Americans change everything.  When I
			was young the city was wood and
			paper... I was ten when the bombers
			came.  I lived underground for three
			days.  When I came up, the city was
			gone... A ball of fire.

	Nick gets to his feet.  Ich grabs him by the arm, stopping
	him.

					ICH
			It began to rain, Nick.  You know
			what color the rain was?

	Ich doesn't give him a chance to answer.

					ICH
			Black... It was black from the ash.
			Very impressive.  You Americans, you
			could make black rain.

	Ich polishes off his drink.  An awkward silence.  Charlie,
	wanting to lighten the mood --

					CHARLIE
				(leaning close)
			Say Ich, between friends, where can
			I grab some squish around here?

	Nick sighs, digs in his pocket for some yen for the bill.

					ICH
			Squid?

					CHARLIE
			Pussy, ass, soft personnel.

	Ich looks up to see a picturesque, blood-haired American
	WOMEN in a tight silk blouse and skirt.  She works here
	and has obviously heard Charlie.

					ICH
			Ah, Joyce...
				(in Japanese)
			How are you tonight?

					JOYCE
				(in Japanese)
			Hello, Ich.  Johnny Walker?

	Ich nods.  Joyce's Japanese is impeccable.  She's a part-
	time bartender, translator, model.  One of Japan's western
	wanderers.  She's sliding past thirty, but only her weary
	eyes give it away.  She is about to pour Ich another
	drink.

					NICK
			Don't give him any more.

					JOYCE
			He gets as much as he wants.

	Charlie extends his hand to Joyce.  She ignores it.

					CHARLIE
			Hello hello, Charlie Skloaris.  New
			York City.

	She refills Ich's glass.

					CHARLIE
			My partner and I are cops.
				(lowering his voice)
			We're on a very big assignment here.
				(nothing from Joyce)
			When do you get off?

					JOYCE
			Right when you're being tucked into
			bed.

	Cold.

					ICH
			You should be nicer to my American
			friends, Joyce.

					JOYCE
			They wouldn't appreciate it, Ich.
			Trust me.

	She says something in Japanese to Ich as she eyes the
	cops.  Then, she walks off.

					ICH
			Joyce can be nice.

					CHARLIE
				(brightening)
			What'd she say?

					ICH
				(big smile)
			That I should let you pay for the
			drinks.
				(raising his glass)
			Kampai.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  ICHIBANKAN BAR BUILDING - NIGHT

	Charlie and Nick are trying to help a besotted Ich find a
	taxi, but no one will take him.  Ich is shouting half
	English, half Japanese phrases.

					ICH
			... We got to keep looking.  Track
			him down!  Great balls of fire!

					NICK
				(frustrated, to a
				 cabbie)
			What's the problem here?

	The cabbie ignores them.

					WOMAN (O.S.)
			You don't speak the language.  I'll
			drop him off.

	They turn to see Joyce standing behind them.

					ICH
			Ah, Joyce...

	The rest is slurred Japanese.  Joyce speaks to a cabbie in
	Japanese.  The rear door swings open.  She helps Ich in.
	Joyce climbs in.

					ICH
				(out the window)
			See you tomorrow!

	The taxi pulls away.  Nick and Charlie watch it go.

					NICK
			Not a prayer.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  STREET - FOUR A.M.

	An early morning wind jostles the red paper lantern and
	plucks at the tails of dragon-like banners hanging outside
	the shops.  Nick and Charlie are walking down this narrow
	sidestreet on the way back to their hotel.

					CHARLIE
			... He's a sorry old guy, but I like
			him.

					NICK
			He couldn't find his ass with both
			hands.

	A brand new Kawasaki 1000 motorcycle with windshield and
	full farings gleams under a street light.

					CHARLIE
			Now that's the kind of motorcycle I
			want to see you on.

					NICK
				(muttering)
			Sure, a rice burning crotch
			rocket...

					CHARLIE
			Nick, how we gonna bag this guy
			without any help?  Maybe I should
			work on that girl Joyce, she speaks
			the language.

	Nick glances over at his partner, smiles.  But before he
	can respond --

	The DULL ROAR of a half dozen motorcycles in the distance
	breaks the pre-dawn stillness.

	TWENTY BOSOZOKU (BIKERS)

	on their multi-cylinder high tech street bombers, creep
	around the corner and slowly ride toward Nick and Charlie.

	We get a better look at them:  turbo punk Elvis-samurai
	hybrids -- some wearing a slipper under their headbands,
	courtesy of their girlfriends; some in leopard skin pants.
	And tattoos...

	They head straight for Nick and Charlie, then, at the last
	moment, split and float away IN SLOW MOTION, as if the
	cops didn't exist.

	Suddenly, the street is empty again.  Silent except for
	the SOUND of the wind beating against paper lanterns,
	rustling the wind chimes...

	Hold on Nick and Charlie standing in the middle of the
	street, realizing just how far away from home they are.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  HOTEL - THE NEXT MORNING

	A rocket shaped building:  a mixture of Dutch Gable and
	Japanese Minka roof.  The mid-day sun beats down on a
	particular room.


	INT.  HOTEL ROOM

	Nick and Charlie are sacked out.  They never bothered to
	pull the curtains.  THE SOUND OF KNOCKING at the door.

					ICH (O.S.)
			Nick!

					NICK
			Give us a break...

					ICH (O.S.)
			It's Ichiro.  Ich.

					NICK
			Leave the rice cake outside and go
			home!

	But Ich persists.

	AT THE DOOR

	As Nick opens up.  Ich bows.  He's now clean shaven and
	has put on a clean shirt.

					ICH
			There's been a murder.  Yakuza.  You
			should come.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  PRINTING PLANT - DAY

	The murder scene.  NO SOUND.

	A SERIES OF SHOTS:

	A BODY FROM THE WAIST DOWN in the claws of six foot
	working robotic.  The tattooed covered legs swing back and
	forth like a pendulum.

	THE TORSO is wedged in between two enormous printing
	rollers.

	THE HEAD is resting in the middle of a conveyer belt.
	It's been drenched in black printer's ink which has begun
	to congeal.

	WE SLOWLY TRACK PAST Ich, Charlie, and Nick, watching.
	Charlie has the dry heaves.

	REAL SOUND as we reveal the full crime scene.  Instead of
	the usual cigar smoke, camera flashes and radio chatter,
	there is order and quiet.  A slow underwater dance.

	INSPECTOR OHASHI

	quietly gives an order.  Someone turns off the robotic.
	The severed legs stop swinging.

	Nick, Charlie and Ich walk over to Ohashi.  Ich bows
	deeply.  Ohashi doesn't acknowledge any of them, talks to
	a man holding a tape measurer.

					NICK
			Could you fill me in?

					OHASHI
			Why don't you ask your chief
			detective?

	Ich looks down at the floor.

					NICK
			Because I want you to tell me.

					OHASHI
			The young are eating the old,
			something that usually doesn't
			happen here.

					NICK
			Can we skip the poetry, inspector?

	Ohashi pauses.  Ich looks at Nick as if to warn him he
	can't speak to Ohashi that way.

					OHASHI
			There's a war, detective, between
			two rival groups.  The man who
			escaped, Kobo, leads the younger
			group.  They did this.

					ICH
			Kobo's a wild boy.  He was a
			lieutenant in the Sammaguchi-gummi.

					OHASHI
				(in Japanese)
			Excellent, Officer Matsumoto.  How
			is your investigation going?

					ICH
				(in Japanese)
			Well, sir.  Thank you for giving me
			the opportunity to work with these
			distinguished gentlemen.

	He bows.  It's pathetic.

					POLICE LIEUTENANT
			Looking for clues in the bottom of a
			sake bottle, Matsumoto?

	Laughter all around.

					OHASHI
			He's an officer of great
			distinction.

	Another sarcastic dig.  Ich stoically stands and takes it.

					CHARLIE
			Hey, Ich has been helpful.

					OHASHI
				(ignoring him, to
				 Nick)
			Have you changed your mind and
			decided to go home, detective?

					NICK
			Not until one of us bags Kobo.
				(looking at the
				 corpse)
			And it doesn't look like you're
			doing so hot.

	Ohashi coolly flicks the ashes of his cigarette and we --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  PRINTING PLANT - DAY

	Ich, Nick, and Charlie are threading their way through the
	crowd toward the subway entrance.

	TWO BIKERS, their hair slicked back, watch the trio from
	the top of two different subway entrances.

	As soon as Ich, Nick and Charlie go down the steps, they
	climb off their bikes and follow.


	INT.  SUBWAY STATION

	Nick, Ich and Charlie are riding the people mover that
	stretches the length of this endless tunnel.  They're
	sandwiched between the legions of SALARYMEN (white collar
	workers) who all wear identical blue suits and white
	shirts.

	Nick looks over at Ich, who is still suffering in silence
	from the recent humiliation.

					NICK
			You know, Inspector, you take shit
			once, you take shit forever.

					ICH
				(beat)
			I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.

					NICK
			Why the hell not?

					ICH
			I don't, that's all.

	Ich looks away, obviously uncomfortable.

					CHARLIE
			You cool, Ich?

					ICH
			Cool?

					CHARLIE
			You all right?  You okay?

	Ich nods.

					CHARLIE
			What does Ichiro mean, anyway?

					ICH
				(smiling)
			What does Charlie mean?

					CHARLIE
			Hey, all right.

	Charlie slaps Ich on the back.

	NICK smiles at Charlie's remark.  He can't help but like
	this wide-eyed goofy kid.

	Something makes Nick's smile fade.

	NICK'S POV

	KOBO, their escaped prisoner, hurrying in the opposite
	direction.  His Kamali suit looks like it just came from
	the cleaners.

					NICK
			Charlie!

	Charlie spots him.  In a flash, the two men jump the
	railing and charge after him, leaving Ich in their wake.

	Ich can't possibly make it over the side.  He furiously
	shoves his way through the Salarymen, trying to get to the
	end of the walkway.

	CHASE SEQUENCE

	-- Nick barreling through the mass of faceless Salarymen.

	-- Kobo, hurrying ahead, occasionally glancing back.

	-- Charlie catching up to Nick.  They've lost him.  They
	   spin around.  A half dozen tunnels spin out in all
	   directions.

	-- Nick and Charlie spotting Kobo.  He's waiting for them
	   near the turnstile.

	Nick suddenly realizes it's a set-up.  Before he can say
	anything, Charlie sprints ahead, recklessly shoving
	people out of the way.

					NICK
				(calling after him)
			It's a set-up...!  Charlie!

	Charlie hasn't heard him.

	AT THE TURNSTILE

	Kobo hands a ticket to the turnstile guard and disappears
	onto the platform.  Charlie doesn't have a ticket.  The
	guard points to the automatic ticket machine.  Screw it.
	Charlie leaps over the turnstile.

	The GUARD blows his shrill whistle to signal the subway
	police.

	THE PLATFORM

	Charlie pushes through the crowd -- a wall of blank faces.
	Kobo is gone.

	NICK

	shoving through the crowd.  He spots Charlie.  Shouts at
	him to wait.  Charlie can't hear his partner.

	THE SUBWAY

	pulls in.  An immaculately uniformed CONDUCTOR blows his
	whistle and waves his white-gloved hands to keep the crowd
	back.

	A LEATHER JACKETED BOY shoves Charlie from behind; he
	stumbles forward toward the track.  Someone catches him at
	the last moment.  Charlie turns around to see it's Kobo.

	Kobo smiles, it's all a big joke.

	What follows happens in a flash:

	ON NICK

					NICK
			Charlie!

	Nick is close enough to see, too far to do anything.  He's
	blocked by TWO MORE LEATHER BOYS.  He tries to shove past,
	but they grab him.

	KOBO

	holding Charlie by his coat lapels.  An express train
	tears into the station.  Kobo casually glances at

	NICK

	trying to struggle free.

	KOBO

	his eyes still on Nick, drops Charlie in front of the
	speeding express as if he were a sack of laundry.

	NICK

					NICK
			NO!!

	A woman SCREAMS.

	The train barrels through the station.

	Kobo starts toward Nick.  He's next.

	A pair of SUBWAY POLICEMEN burst through the crowd
	searching for Charlie because he vaulted the turnstile.

	NICK

	manages to break free of the leatherboys holding him.
	They flee into the crowd as the police close in.

	ACROSS THE PLATFORM - KOBO

	slips into the wave of commuters being shoved into a
	train by white-gloved MEN.  It's their job to shove
	commuters into the already packed cars.

	Nick goes for Kobo, but the crowd closes in front of him.
	He can't get through.

	THE SUBWAY DOORS

	slam shut.  The train pulls out leaving Nick standing on
	the empty platform.

	THE LAST CAR

	streaks past him.  Kobo stands in the rear window, getting
	smaller and smaller until the train disappears down the
	tracks.

					ICH
			Nick!

	Ich, out of breath, is standing on the platform.  Nick
	looks at him with disgust -- where the hell was he.

	STAY on Nick, his head bowed, being surrounded by the sea
	of blue-suited commuters.

								 FADE TO WHITE.

	FADE IN:

	NICK'S FACE against a white wall.  That's all we see.
	Ohashi's voice OFF SCREEN.

					OHASHI (O.S.)
			... You ignored me.  I don't care
			about what you want.  Get on a
			plane, detective Conklin.  Go home.

	We HEAR a door open and SLAM shut off screen.  Hold on
	Nick, frozen in place, then:

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  CENTRAL SECTION - TOKYO POLICE H.Q. - DAY

	Again, the fifty desks, fifty faceless men working.
	Typewriters CLACKING, phones RINGING.  We MOVE down the
	rows to find Nick sitting behind one of the desks.  He's
	on the phone to New York.

					OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
			It's not your job.

					NICK
			He was my partner.

					OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
			They're blaming it on you.  Christ,
			Conklin, you didn't even tell me you
			lost the prisoner!

					NICK
			I planned on catching him, Captain.

					OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
			How?  You don't know the place.  You
			don't know the language.  Get on the
			plane.

					NICK
			He killed a police officer.

					OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
			Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it.
			That's orders.  Period.

	Oliver hangs up.  A moment of long distance hum cross
	talk.  Nick doesn't move.  Pull back through the rows of
	cops busily working... SOUND FADES.

	Charlie Parker's alto sax FADE UP as we --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  SHINJUKU - NIGHT

	The MUSIC continues.  The sax screams as the melody is
	abandoned.

	Nick is drunk.  Roaring angry drunk.  He doesn't know
	where he is.  He doesn't care.  He plows down the street,
	occasionally grabbing a passerby, then letting them go.

	Nick begins to laugh.  A couple is staring at him, Nick
	yells at them, but we DON'T HEAR HIM.  He stumbles on...
	drop back to find.

	ICH

	following in his wake.  He bows and apologizes to the
	offended.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  LAS VEGAS WELCOME BAR - NIGHT

	Nick is thrown onto the street.  He tries to reenter and
	is thrown out again.  We spot JOYCE inside watching; she
	turns back to her customers.


	EXT.  GINZA - NIGHT

	Nick is hassling a news vendor who pointedly ignores him
	and continues selling his papers.  Ich appears and
	apologizes to the news vendor.


	EXT.  STREET - TWO A.M.

	Nick's sitting on the curb, his head in his hands.  People
	step around him.

	Across the street, out of Nick's sight, Ich is watching
	his partner, feeling every barb of Nick's shame.

	Charlie Parker continues over the slow...

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	NICK --

	asleep, the futon tangled around him.  He opens his eyes.
	A woman is making tea in the kitchenette.  This is the
	kimonoed woman who led Nick and Charlie to Ich the other
	night.

	A RADIO is on softly in the background.  The Charlie
	Parker tune we've been listening to over the previous cuts
	ends, and the announcer comes on:

					RADIO
			... That was the Bird, from the Blue
			Note years.  1230 hours and 72
			degrees in central Osaka.  This is
			specialist Doug Dale, Tapestries in
			Jazz, on the Far East Network, armed
			forces radio...

	Nick slowly sits up to see

	ICH

	seated at a low table looking at him from across the room.

	Nick spots his clothes and luggage stacked in the corner.
	Nick now realizes he's in Ich's apartment.  It's spotless.
	Everything is now in its proper place.

					NICK
			What happened?

					ICH
			They made you leave your hotel...
				(looks away)
			... you caused a disturbance.

	Nick's eyes fall on Charlie's things:  his sports clothes,
	his tour book, his shoes which Ich has stacked on the
	table.

					ICH
			It may be too soon to talk about it.
			When someone we care for dies we...
				(beat)
			... keep something of their's.  A
			tie, a pen.

					NICK
			Why weren't you at the platform?

					ICH
			I couldn't keep up.  My shame is
			complete.

	Nick slowly shuts his eyes, his head pounding.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  PUBLIC BATH - DAY

	The neighborhood bathhouse.  Thick with steam and
	neighborhood kids.

	Nick walks toward the huge pool of water.  Ich is beside
	him.  Nick's about to climb in when Ich stops him, hands
	him a pail and a washcloth and points to the faucets along
	the wall where a dozen men squat on small stools as they
	wash themselves.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK

	as he pours a pail of water over his head, it runs down
	his face in slow motion.

								 CUT TO:

	THE POOL

	Nick soaking, on one side.  Ich is soaking nearby.

					ICH
			You must leave?

					NICK
			Yeah...

					ICH
			I'll get him for you, Nick.

	Nick looks at this thick bellied, alcoholic cop.  Not a
	very reassuring thought.

	TWO MEN carrying plastic pails cross in front of the tub.
	Young, muscular Yakuza, their bodies covered with
	exquisite tattoos.  They stare openly at Nick.  One makes
	a joke.  Both laugh obscenely as they slip into the hot
	tub.

					NICK
			Yakuza?

	Ich nods.  Nick eyes them for a long beat, then climbs out
	of the tub.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK

	Nick tossing two bags into a taxi in front of Ich's
	apartment building.

	ICH

	Ich watching Nick through the window from inside his
	apartment.  He glances back and sees Charlie's "Members
	Only" coat hanging on a hook.

	When he turns back, Nick's taxi has disappeared.


	EXT.  NARITA AIRPORT

	The brightest object in the frame is a yellow forklift
	carrying a jostling aluminum coffin toward the open belly
	of the cargo plane.  Nick watches it from the edge of the
	tarmac.

	AIRPORT CHECK IN GATE

	Nick hands the clerk his ticket.

					NICK
			... Smoking.

					CLERK
			Aisle or window?

	Nick spots a folded newspaper someone has left on the
	counter.  He can't read it, of course, but there's a
	picture of the subway platform where Charlie was killed,
	swarming with police.  Nick continues to stare at the
	paper.

					CLERK
			Aisle or window, sir?

					NICK
				(looks up)
			I want to cash it in.  Yen.

								 CUT TO:

	ICH'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Nick steps in, drops the two suitcases.

					NICK
			Ichiro?

	The woman steps out of the kitchen, babbles something in
	Japanese.  Nick doesn't have a clue.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  LAS VEGAS WELCOME BAR - AFTERNOON

	Only a handful of patrons.  Joyce is straightening bottles
	behind the bar.

					NICK (O.S.)
			What's tricks?

	She looks up, surprised to see Nick standing in front of
	her.

					JOYCE
			Ich said you left.

					NICK
			There was a change in plans.

	Beat.

					JOYCE
			I'm sorry about your friend.

	Nick's surprised at how fast she heard.

					JOYCE
			Dead gaiijin's are big news.

					NICK
			Gaiijin?

					JOYCE
			An outside person.  A foreigner.  A
			barbarian.  You, me.
				(beat)
			More you.

					NICK
			I could use some help.  Show me
			around.  I'll pay you for your time.

					JOYCE
			I don't give tours.

	Nick smiles.

					NICK
			You can count on the truth from
			people who don't like you.

					JOYCE
			You have a helluva way of asking for
			help.

					NICK
			You have a helluva way of answering.

	Draw.

					JOYCE
			Look, you need Ich.  I've been here
			five years and I still can't read
			all the street signs.

					NICK
			Maybe I'm a quicker learner.

					JOYCE
			I don't think so.

	From OFF SCREEN:

					ICH (O.S.)
			Nicklaus-san.

	Nick turns to see Ich, leaning against the door frame.
	He's already had a few drinks too many.  He's delighted to
	see Nick.

					ICH
			I've continued working on the case!

					NICK
			I can see that.

	Ich ambles into the room, slips down into a chair.  He
	spills the contents of the large manila envelope he's been
	carrying onto the table:  a wallet, a set of keys, playing
	cards, etc.

					ICH
				(signaling to Joyce)
			Joyce... A drink please.
				(to Nick)
			Kobo has disappeared.  My superiors
			don't trust me.

	Nick walks over to the table and looks at the items.

					ICH
			Kobo's.  Taken off him when he was
			arrested in New York.

	Nick sits down.  Joyce gives Ich his scotch.

					ICH
			I knew you'd come back.  You feel
			you have a debt you can never pay.
			But you will, even if it costs you
			your life.  Giri.  Honor.

	Nick picks up various items off the table.

					NICK
			How'd you get this?

					ICH
			I stole them.

	Ich drapes his arm over Nick's shoulder.

					ICH
			Partners, Nicklaus-san?

	Ich reaches for his drink.  Nick gets there first.  He
	holds it up as if he were proposing a toast, then
	purposefully spills his drink out.

					NICK
			Partners.

	Ich has just had his last drink on duty.

								 CUT TO:

	THE TABLE - LATER

	All the contents of the envelope are spread out on the
	table:  credit cards, matchbooks from New York City,
	choice clipping from Screw magazine, sugarless gum, cuff
	links...

	Nick's holding up a series of photos.

	CLOSE ON PHOTO

	of a naked women and Kobo screwing on a Tatami mat.
	Another photo.  Then another.  Each photo is more
	pornographic than the next.

	Joyce picks them up as Nick sets them down.

					JOYCE
			Busy man.

	Nick holds out several of the same girl in various poses.

					NICK
			Know her?

					ICH
				(shaking his head)
			We can ask someone I used to work
			with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay
			money to...

					NICK
			A snitch?

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  PACHINKO PARLOR - DAY

	The largest in Tokyo.  Endless rows of men sitting in
	front of the machines (horizontal pinball games) furiously
	punching the flippers.  The NOISE from the metal balls is
	deafening.

	A MAN

	in a Hawaiian shirt, his arms covered with tattoos, is
	starting a new game.

	Ich moves up to the vacant machine beside him, puts in his
	change.  Ich doesn't face the man as they speak in
	Japanese.  The man in the Hawaiian shirt walks off.

	ON NICK

	as the man in the Hawaiian shirt walks past him.  This is
	the snitch.  Nick glances back at Ich.  Ich nods --
	they're in business.

								 CUT TO:

	A CRAMPED ROOM - REAR OF PACHINKO PARLOR

	We HEAR the clattering of the machines outside.  The man
	in the Hawaiian shirt, mid-fifties and badly in need of a
	shower, is sitting on the floor studying the photos.  Ich
	and Nick tower above him.

	The man says something to Nick in Japanese, then continues
	to study the photos.

					NICK
			What's he saying?

					ICH
				(looking up)
			He says they're very nice.  He wants
			to know if you have anymore.

	Nick sighs.

					ICH
			I'll ask him again.

	Ich asks in Japanese.  The man shrugs.

					NICK
			My turn.

	He grabs the man by his shirt collar and shoves him
	against the wall.  The photos spill to the floor.

					NICK
			Who is she?

	He bangs the man's head back against the wall.  The man
	starts babbling in Japanese.

	Ich, horrified, tries to pull Nick off him.

					ICH
			Nick, stop.

	Nick bangs the snitches head against the wall again.  Ich
	gets Nick away.  The man is terrified.

					ICH
			This man must be treated with
			respect.

	Ich bows to the man, apologizes in Japanese.

					NICK
			Aw, for Christ's sake.

	They continue speaking in Japanese.  They bow to one
	another again.  Ich gives the man a glass of water, then
	motions for him to sit down.

	Nick, impatient, starts for the guy again.  Ich stops him.
	The snitch holds up one of the photos, and starts
	babbling.

					NICK
				(to Ich)
			Now we're making progress.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  SEIBU DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

	CLOSE ON A SALESGIRL behind the cosmetic counter.  She is
	wearing the store uniform:  blue and white dress and white
	gloves.  A doll.  We shouldn't recognize her at first.
	Then --

	INSERT A PHOTO

	one of Kobo's porno pics.  It's the same face.

	REVEAL NICK

	holding the photo, standing in the crowded store.  Ich is
	beside him.

					NICK
			That's Kobo's girl?  He's sure?

	Ich glances back at the man in the Hawaiian shirt standing
	by the door.  The man nods.

					ICH
			He's sure.

	They watch the girl help a customer choose an eyeliner.

					ICH
			Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three
			days.  He might not even be in
			Tokyo.

					NICK
			Only one way to find out... Get her
			up in the morning and put her to bed
			at night.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  SOBA RESTAURANT - DAY

	NICK

	is struggling with his chopsticks and bowl of noodles.
	From O.S. A LOUD SLURPING SOUND.  The sound stops, then
	starts again.  Nick can't eat.  He sets his bowl down and
	looks over at

	ICH

	slurping his noodles.  It is considered polite to slurp
	soba noodles as loud as possible.

	Ich stops.  Looks at Nick, then resumes his slurping.

					NICK
			Think you could keep it to a dull
			roar?

	They're sitting by the window across from the Seibu
	department store watching the entrance.

					ICH
			It's good manners.

	Nick nods.  Picks up his bowl.  Again the LOUD slurping
	off screen.  Nick starts to eat the noodles.  He can't
	continue with Ich slurping.  He sets the bowl down.

	Ich grins, resumes slurping and we --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - SIX P.M.

	The SALESGIRLS are lined up at the door bowing and
	thanking the last customers for shopping in their store.
	Standard practice.

	The GIRL whom Nick and Ich have been watching comes out
	wearing her uniform and heads down the street.

	NICK AND ICH

	waiting in the restaurant, get up to follow.

								 CUT TO:

	THE GIRL

	stepping out of the laundry carrying her wash.  She walks
	past a doorway where...

	NICK is standing.

	ICH now walks past his partner picking up the tail.  No
	acknowledgement between them.


	EXT.  STREET CAR STATION

	There are dozens of street cars waiting to pull out.  The
	girl is on one of them.  Ich has lost her.  Nick and Ich
	hurry from car to car.

					ICH
			You said you could keep up with her!
			'No problem, Nick-san.'

					NICK
				(cutting Ich off)
			No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do
			anything, and for Christ's sake,
			don't apologize!

					ICH
			Nick...

	Nick hurries toward another car to check it out.

					NICK
			What'd I tell you?

					ICH
			There she is!

	They spot the girl sitting in the window of one of the
	street cars, about to turn onto the main street.

	The two cops race for the car.  Nick leaps on.  Ich is a
	few steps behind.  Nick sticks out his hand, pulls Ich up.
	They stand looking at one another, both breathing hard,
	both out of shape.

								 CUT TO:

	NIGHTCLUB DISTRICT - NIGHT

	Narrow streets with exploding neon ideograph signs as far
	as the eye can see.

	We spot our girl hurrying down the street.  Nick, a half
	block behind, is bumping into people, trying not to lose
	her.

	She crosses the street and Ich picks her up.  Nick drops
	off.

	ON A SIDE STREET

	around the corner the girl disappears into a three story
	apartment building above an electronics store.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  GIRL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

	We're watching our girl inside her apartment.  She flips
	off the TV and climbs into bed.

								 CUT TO:

	A STOREROOM - NIGHT

	We've been watching the girl from a window across the
	street.  It's a storeroom full of shipping crates, not
	much else.  Ich is sitting on the floor, legs crossed,
	back erect, watching Nick.  Nick glances over.  Ich
	continues to watch him.  Nick returns to the window.

					ICH
			You dislike me.

	Nick keeps looking out the window.

					NICK
			Did I say that?

					ICH
			You toler -- yes, tolerate me.   

					NICK
			Are we getting married?

	Pause.

					ICH
			I'm a joke.  They sent you to me to
			make a fool of you.

	Nick looks over at Ich.  Ich is looking away.  Nick looks
	out the window, then back at his partner.

					NICK
			You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop
			it, okay?

					ICH
			Sure.

	The girl switches off her light across the street.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	THE STOREROOM - MORNING

	Ich is sleeping on his back looking like a grounded whale.

	Nick, exhausted, is sitting by the window his head resting
	against the sill.

	NICK'S POV OF THE STREET

	as the girl, dressed in her store uniform, comes out of
	the apartment and heads for work.

	NICK

	nudges the sleeping Ich with his foot.  Ich opens his
	eyes.

					NICK
			Let's book.

	Ich is groggy, nonplused.

					NICK
			Let's go.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  HALLWAY - GIRL'S APARTMENT BUILDING

	Ich, tucking in his shirt, comes down the hall to see --

	Nick, on his knees, examining the lock on the girl's
	apartment door.  He slides his NYPD card into the jam and
	lightly raps the knob plate.

					ICH
			You can't do this.

	Nick uses his sleeve to wipe prints off the knob and jam.

					NICK
			Call a cop.

	The door swings open.  Nick walks in.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  GIRL'S APARTMENT

	A cheesebox with a few vintage pieces of American deco
	furniture.

	Ich, very uptight, stands at the door while Nick goes over
	the place.

	Nick opens the closet.  It's packed with expensive
	dresses, pants, sweaters...

					ICH
			Nick...

					NICK
				(facing him)
			If you're gonna give me a hard time,
			wait outside.

	Nick goes through her chest of drawers:  on the top, a lot
	of high quality lingerie.

	INSERT PHOTO:  The girl and Kobo posing in a vintage
	Corvette.

	Nick replaces the picture, and carefully rearranges the
	drawer so it appears untouched.  He pulls open another
	drawer.  Then another.  Under the jeans and Mickey Mouse
	T-shirts, he finds:

	A BANK STACK OF U.S. CURRENCY

	in hundreds.  The bottom of the drawer is lined with
	stacks.  Nick holds them up for Ich to see.

					NICK
			Not too shabby for a perfume pusher.

	Ich, shocked, tries to play it cool.

					ICH
			Too bad it's not in yen.

	Nick shoves the drawer shut.

								 CUT TO:

	THE GIRL - DUSK - TWO DAYS LATER

	The GIRL buys fruit from a stand as NICK watches from one
	end of the block; ICH, listening to his transistor radio,
	waits at the other.

	THE GIRL

	suddenly turns and finds herself facing

	NICK

	a few yards away.   Nick smiles, then walks into the
	store, hoping he hasn't been made.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  GIRL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Rain pours down.


	INT.  STOREROOM - NIGHT

	Nick, leaning against the wall, watches the girl's
	apartment across the street.  The girl walks in, turns on
	her light, then disappears into the bathroom.

	Ich walks in, exhausted, soaked to the skin.  He tosses
	his cap in the corner.  Struck out again.

					ICH
			Work, lunch, groceries, laundry...
			Fabulous...

					NICK
				(looking back out
				 the window)
			Four goddamn days.  This is going
			nowhere...

	A KNOCK at the door.

					JOYCE (O.S.)
			It's me.

	Ich opens the door.  Joyce, dressed for work, is carrying
	two odons (box dinners).  Joyce and Ich exchange greetings
	in Japanese.

					JOYCE
			What's the latest?

	Nick shrugs.

					ICH
			We'll get him, Joyce.

	Joyce peeks out the window.  The girl is getting
	undressed.

					JOYCE
			She ever pull down her shades?

					NICK
				(right back at her)
			Sure, but then I just pull out the
			photos.

	Ich opens one of the box dinners and sets it on the ledge
	in front of Nick.

					ICH
				(enthusiastically)
			Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku,
			Ganmodoki --

					NICK
			Ichiro --

					ICH
				(realizing)
			Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll,
			soybean curd, devils tongue --

					NICK
			Smells like Bayonne at low tide.

	Joyce hands Ich a flask of hot sake in tinfoil.

					NICK
			Whoa whoa...

	Nick grabs the flask.  Dumps it out the window.

					JOYCE
			Don't be an ass.

					NICK
			He's on duty.

					JOYCE
			I paid for that.

	Nick tosses a few thousand yen on the table.  Then,
	spotting something out the window.

					NICK
			Alley oop!

	Nick grabs his coat and goes out the door.  Joyce slips
	Ich another flask of sake.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  STREET - GINZA DISTRICT - NIGHT

	It's our GIRL standing alone on the corner of the street
	but you wouldn't know it at first.  She's wearing tight
	leather pants, red leather jacket, earrings, bright red
	lipstick, and she's dumped the pony-tail, allowing her
	hair to fall to her waist.

	NICK AND ICH

	watching in a doorway down the block.  Nick's shivering,
	his hands thrust in his army surplus jacket.  Ich doesn't
	mind the cold.  He's had his sake.

	THREE BOSOZOKU

	riding their bikes come around the corner drive past her,
	then circle back.

	One of the RIDERS stops to talk to her, then drives off.
	She hurries off in the opposite direction.

					ICH
			Yakuza.

					NICK
			Good.  Very good...

								 CUT TO:

	A SUBWAY STATION

	The girl waits until the last minute, then after glancing

	disappears into the tunnel.

								 CUT TO:

	THE SHINZOA DISTRICT - NIGHT

	The girl, on the move, pushing through the crowd.  Drop
	back to find Ich twenty yards behind.  She crosses the
	street.  Nick, pretending to be looking in a store window,
	picks her up.

	AROUND THE CORNER

	Nick has lost her.  It's a cul de sac with a dozen
	buildings.  He's standing in the middle of the street.
	Ich catches up to him.

					NICK
			She disappeared... shit!

					ICH
			You were too far behind.

	Nick does a double-take.

					ICH

			Don't say anything more.  Don't do
			anything.  And, for Christ's sake,
			don't apologize!

	EXT.  STREET - SHINZOA DISTRICT - NIGHT - LATER

	NICK

	watching one end of the block.  TRACK over to reveal Ich,
	his back to Nick's, watching the other end.

	Ich glances back at Nick.  Nick ignores him.  Ich turns
	back.

					ICH
			Nicklaus-san!

	Nick turns to see the GIRL walk out of a bath house.
	She's wearing her ponytail again, with a black dress.  She
	climbs into a taxi.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  PINK SARON HOSTESS CLUB - NIGHT

	The girl climbs out of the taxi and goes inside.

	Nick and Ich are watching from across the street.


	INT.  HOSTESS CLUB

	Packed with Salarymen from the nearby brewery and
	hostesses in silk dresses selling cheap champagne at
	expensive prices.

	NICK AND ICH

	Walk in.  Everything seems normal.

	The BOUNCER in a white tux, stops them.  This is not a
	place frequented by Gaiijin.

	Ich beseeches the Bouncer to let his good friend in,
	promising that his friend will spend lots of money.

	Nick, thinking he's in, takes a step forward.  The Bouncer
	shoves him back.

					NICK
			Hey, no hands, huh?

	He bats his hands away.  Ich grabs Nick by the shoulders,
	preventing a fight.

					ICH
			You can't come in.  They don't
			want --

					NICK
			Gaiijin.

					ICH
			I'll check it out.

	Nick, unsure, turns to go, but before he does:

					NICK
			If I smell one drop of Scotch on
			your breath, my friend --

					ICH
			You can trust me.

	Nick hesitates, he's not so sure, then shoves the door
	open.


	EXT.  HOSTESS CLUB

	Nick waiting under the pink neon sign.


	INT.  HOSTESS CLUB - LATER

	Ich is sitting at the crowded bar.  A HOSTESS has her arm
	around his neck.  He checks out the room, searching for
	the girl.  He notices two THUGS standing outside a sliding
	door.  Ich finishes his drink.

					ICH
				(in Japanese)
			Let me up.

					HOSTESS
				(shoving him down)
			Sit, sweetie.
				(to bartender)
			Another Seagrams!

	Ich relents.  Then, spotting something across the room:

	WHAT HE SEES:  A rice paper door slides open, momentarily
	revealing a DOZEN men with close cropped hair sitting on
	tatami mats, playing poker.  Some have their coats off,
	revealing arms covered with tattoos.  Yakuza.

	A hostess, serving drinks, steps but leaving the door
	partially open.

	The hostess slides the door open to the adjacent room, but
	Ich CANNOT see inside.  She slides it shut.

	Ich's hostess wants him to buy another drink, but Ich
	shakes his head, gets to his feet, and pretending to be
	drunk, stumbles toward the sliding doors.

	Ich bumps into a table; slaps a stranger on the shoulder;
	then starts singing along with Frank Sinatra on the
	stereo.  He's a little too loud, a little off key.

	The bodyguards eye Ich suspiciously.  He stumbles past
	them, then grabs the sliding door and yanks it open.

	INSIDE THE ROOM

	A low table.  Kobo is at one end.  An older,
	distinguished, sliver-haired man in his seventies whom we
	will come to know as SUGAI is at the other.  Ich can't
	believe his eyes:  Sugai is the head of the largest Yakuza
	syndicate in Japan.

	A half dozen LIEUTENANTS sit on either side of the table.
	Half are older, dressed in conservative suits; the other
	half are younger wearing $700 Issy Miyake jackets.

	SUGAI AND KOBO

	are having a heated discussion.  The GIRL Ich and Nick
	have been following walks over to Kobo and sits beside
	him.  This makes Sugai even more irate.  He's on his feet,
	red faced and screaming.

	FOUR GUARDS

	seeing Ich, pull out their Beretta's.  Two more grab him
	and fling him head first against the wall.

					ICH
				(drunken, in Japanese)
			I have to piss, gentlemen... I'm so
			sorry but I have to --

	The bodyguards hurry him towards the door.


	EXT.  HOSTESS CLUB

	Nick checks his watch, it's been an hour - where the hell
	is Ich?

	Ich comes stumbling up the steps, still affecting his
	drunken, pigeon-toed walk.  Nick, of course, thinks Ich
	has gotten drunk again.  Two of the bodyguards are
	watching from inside.

					NICK
			I don't believe it...
				(grabs him)
			Son-of-a-bitch --   

	Ich, knowing they're being watched, grabs Nick by the
	sleeve and drags him off still pretending to be drunk.

					ICH
				(under his breath)
			I'm not drunk...

					NICK
			We're through.  I mean it.  This is
			the end of the line, Matsumoto.

					ICH
			Nick --

					NICK
			Shut-up.

	No longer fearing he's being watched, Ich abruptly stops
	his affected walk, and sounding very sober --

					ICH
			You shut-up!
				(then)
			Kobo is inside.  He's with Sugai,
			the head of the Summaguchi-clan.

	ACROSS THE STREET

	Ich is dialing on the police call box as he fills Nick in
	on Sugai.

					ICH
			... A Godfather.  His man was killed
			at the printing plant.

					NICK
			I want to yank Kobo.

					ICH
			Not without a small army, Nicklaus-
			san.

	Ich quickly speaks on the police phone, then hangs up,
	pleased with himself.

					NICK
			Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus,
			not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san.
			Nick.

					ICH
			San is an honorable title.

	Ich realizes it's better to drop it.

								 CUT TO:

	THE HOSTESS CLUB - MINUTES LATER

	Drunken Salarymen spill out the door.

	ICH AND NICK

	are standing across the street waiting for the cops to
	arrive.

	Nick freezes.

	THE GIRL

	they've been following steps out and lights a cigarette.
	TIME SLOWS.  She looks up and spots the two men through
	the traffic.  Nick turns away, afraid he's been made.
	When he looks back, she's gone back inside.

					NICK
			Shit...

	Nick races across the street toward the club.  Horns
	BLARE.

					ICH
				(doesn't understand)
			Nick?!

	IN FRONT OF THE CLUB

	Nick reaches the curb just as the front doors to the club
	BURST OPEN.  He's too late.  Three bodyguards burst out,
	checking the street.  A red and white Debonnaire pulls up.

	Sugai, surrounded by a half-dozen additional bodyguards,
	comes out and slips into the car.  It tears off down the
	street.

	SIRENS AND POLICE CARS

	from either end of the street peel around the corner.
	It's a madhouse.  The remaining lieutenants and bodyguards
	fan out, trying to elude arrest.

	Nick hurries down the steps.

	INSIDE THE CLUB

	The patrons are still in place, but the two side rooms are
	empty.

	Nick spots KOBO going out the rear entrance.  He starts
	after him but is confronted by the bouncer who stopped him
	earlier.  Nick connects to the guy's jaw before his
	adversary can raise his hands.  The bouncer staggers back.
	Nick flies out the rear door.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  FRONT OF CLUB - NIGHT

	Several lieutenants and bodyguards toss their guns --
	possession is a felony in Japan -- as the police close in.


	INT.  HOSTESS CLUB - NIGHT

	Ich hurries in, but Nick's long gone.


	EXT.  REAR OF HOSTESS CLUB - NEARBY STREETS - NIGHT

	SILENCE.  The narrow streets are deserted.  Nick slowly
	makes his way down the street.  The SOUND of a GUNSHOT.
	Nick ducks for cover -- it's a car BACKFIRING.  He
	continues on.

	Nick's POV of a woman giving a man a blow-job in a narrow
	alley.  The man's face is hidden by the shadow.

	Nick continues on.

					JAPANESE MAN (FROM THE DARKNESS)
			People like Charlie are a dime a
			dozen.

	Nick turns back to see Kobo as he steps into the light.

	Kobo tosses a handful of change at Nick.

					KOBO
			Keep the change.

					NICK
			I'm taking you back.

	The girl takes off down the block.

					KOBO
			Here I am.

	From across the street, a dozen bodyguards appear from
	various doorways and alleys.

					KOBO
			Charlie was a rookie...

	Kobo traces his finger across the spot where he cut Nick
	in New York.

					KOBO
			... But you can take care of
			yourself.  You're 'the biggest thing
			to hit this town since Godzilla.'

	Nick glances at the guards, then back at Kobo.  He is
	unarmed.  To make a move would be suicide.  More POLICE
	SIRENS in the b.g. closing in.

					KOBO
			What's the matter.  I'm right in
			front of you, Nick.
				(takes a step closer)
			But I was right in front of you when
			you let Charlie die.

	Kobo takes a step forward.  His face is inches from
	Nick's.

					KOBO
			Walk away again.  Maybe you'll get
			used to it.

	Nick doesn't budge.

	A LONG BEAT, then... Nick turns and slowly walk off.
	After a dozen yards Nick looks back.

	The street is empty, except for a street sweeper pushing
	his wet broom down the block.


	EXT.  HOSTESS CLUB - NIGHT

	A half dozen bodyguards are being frisked, then shoved
	into police cars.

	Ohashi is talking to the enraged nightclub owner.  Nick
	steps up to him.  Ich hurries over.

					ICH
			Nick!

					NICK
				(to Ohashi)
			A few minutes faster, we might've
			nailed him.

	Ohashi doesn't say a word, hands Nick a document.

					NICK
			What's this?

					OHASHI
			Your visa has expired.  Be on a
			plane in twenty-four hours or you
			will be deported.

					NICK
			While you were hanging out at the
			visa office, we found the son-of-a-
			bitch.

					OHASHI
			Look.

	Ohashi directs Nick's attention across the street where a
	SURVEILLANCE VAN is parked.  The rear doors are open
	revealing a van full of surveillance equipment and cops.

					OHASHI
			You ruined an on-going investigation
			that could have gotten us more than
			one runner.
				(to Ich, in Japanese)
			I want a full report in the morning,
			officer.

	Ich bows as Ohashi walks off.

					NICK
			Maybe if you'd work with us --

	Ohashi ignores him, continues walking toward his waiting
	car.

					NICK
				(shouting)
			Hey...!
				(Ohashi keeps
				 walking)
			HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!

					OHASHI
				(his back toward
				 Nick)
			Twenty-four hours, detective.

	Ohashi slips into his car.  Nick storms up to the car and
	slams his fist on the window.

					NICK
			Ohashi!

	Ohashi faces straight ahead, ignoring Nick.  Nick takes
	the extradition paper and spikes it on the car antenna.

	Ich grabs Nick by his arm, pulling him back from the car.
	The car pulls away.

					ICH
			Nick, stop!

	Nick whirls, and before he realizes what he's doing,
	punches Ich below his left eye.  Ich stumbles back over
	the curb and lands on his ass.

					NICK
			Damnit, Ichiro, I'm tired of people
			telling me what I can and can't do.
			No one ever solved anything sitting
			on their ass.

	Nick, beside himself with frustration, watches Ohashi's
	car disappear down the block.

	ON ICH

	looking up at

	NICK

	who walks off without looking back at his partner.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  ICH'S BATHROOM - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

	Nick, standing beside the tub, dumps a pail of hot water
	over his head, rinsing himself off.  He grabs a towel and
	walks out of the room.


	INT.  ICH'S APARTMENT

	Ich, holding an ice pack to his face, is lying on a tatami
	mat against the wall looking up at the ceiling.  An open
	bottle of Seagrams beside him.

	Nick stretches out on another tatami on the opposite side
	of the room and looks up at the ceiling, too.

					NICK
			The ice help?

	Nothing from Ich.

					NICK
			Where does this Sugai live?

					ICH
				(cold)
			A resort city, Beppu.

					NICK
			I want to go talk to him.

					ICH
			What...?  Why?

					NICK
			Because he knows how to get to our
			man.

					ICH
			He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.

					NICK
			I'll be a nice Gaiijin.

	Nick gets up and goes to the closet.  He slides open the
	door.  All of his and Charlie's clothes have been neatly
	hung up.

	He shoves Charlie's jacket aside.  Something's wrong with
	the way it hangs.  He pulls the jacket out, runs his hand
	over the coat, feeling something heavy in the lining.

	Nick rips the lining open.  Charlie's .32 Beretta and a
	spare clip tumble out.

					NICK
			The little bastard.  God bless him.

	Ich takes a drink from his bottle.

					ICH
			It's very small.

					NICK
			Big enough.

					ICH
			It's illegal, Nick.

					NICK
			It's a new deal.
				(putting it in his
				 waist band)
			... coming with me tomorrow?

					ICH
			Sugai's not going to be impressed
			with your gun, Nick.
				(beat)
			No.  I won't put myself in danger
			for you anymore.

	Nick picks up the liquor cap which rolled across the
	floor.  He tosses it to Ich.  Ich reaches for it, but
	misses.

					NICK
			Sure, pal.  You've got better things
			to do.

	Nick walks out shutting the door behind him.  Stay on Ich
	watching the door, then --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  LAS VEGAS BAR - CLOSING TIME

	The last customers find their way to the street, some with
	a little encouragement from a BOUNCER.

	Joyce steps out.  Nick comes up to her.

					NICK
			You know where I can get a decent
			cup of coffee this time of night?
			I'm buying.

					JOYCE
			Somebody must be suffering
			somewhere, you're being so nice.

	Joyce takes off down the street.  Nick watches her for a
	beat.

					NICK
			I need your help, Joyce.

					JOYCE
			Where's Ich?

					NICK
			Unavailable.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

	On the stage, a young professional looking man is singing
	along to "SUMMERTIME" blasting from the stereo.  The
	Japanese way of letting it all hang out.

	We find Joyce and Nick at a corner table having a drink.

					JOYCE
			I've heard of Sugai.  I've also
			heard of the emperor.  They're both
			national treasures.  One's a hood.

					NICK
			I need someone to translate for me.

					JOYCE
			My Japanese isn't that hot...
			Besides, you'll never get in.

					NICK
			It's my last shot.  I have to be on
			a plane home tomorrow night.

					JOYCE
			And I'm supposed to care?

					NICK
			You could fake it.

	Joyce finishes her drink, sets it down.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

	The neon flickers on the rain slicked pavement.  Nick and
	Joyce walk down the deserted street.  She's carrying an
	umbrella.

					JOYCE
			You're wrong to sell Ich short.

					NICK
			He drinks.

					JOYCE
			He's got a reason.

	Nick shrugs, everyone's got a reason.

					JOYCE
			His son hooked up with some bikers.
			Yakuza kids.  A cop shot him running
			from a robbery.

	Nick looks over for the first time.

					JOYCE
			A father doesn't out live that kind
			of thing here, much less a police
			officer...

	Pause.

					NICK
			Where's the wife?

					JOYCE
			You met her.

	Nick looks surprised.

					JOYCE
			The woman in the apartment.  She
			won't speak to him.  But she won't
			leave either.  Japan... Nice, huh?

	Before Nick can respond, something catches his eye:  What
	he sees --

	A MAN

	partially shadowed, standing in the alley.

	Nick grabs his gun.  The man steps out zipping up his
	trousers.  It's a drunken Salaryman.  Nick lowers his gun.
	The Salaryman staggers down the street singing to himself.

					JOYCE
			Not wound too tight...

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  JOYCE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

	A three story modern building on a quiet street.  She's
	searching for her keys.

					JOYCE
			I'd invite you up but I know you'd
			hate the incense.
				(as if to explain)
			I chant.

					NICK
			What do you chant?

					JOYCE
			'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think
			it's dumb of course.

					NICK
			Not if it works.
				(holding the door
				 open for her)
			I'll meet you at the train?

					JOYCE
			I don't remember saying yes.

					NICK
			I don't remember you saying no.

	Joyce smiles, heads inside.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  ICH'S APARTMENT - DAWN

	Ich is sleeping.

	Nick slips into his leather motorcycle jacket.  He drops
	Charlie's gun into his pocket.  He glances down at Ich,
	seeing if he's awake.  He's not.  Nick walks out.

	Ich opens his eyes.  He's been awake the whole time.

								 CUT TO:

	THE YANAKA CEMETERY - DAY

	Ich, wearing a blue suit, is pouring water over a simple
	stone with a wooden dipper.  Next, he places incense in a
	holder and folds his hands in prayer.

	The photo on the stone is of a young man wearing a school
	uniform.  Ich's son.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	A BULLET TRAIN - DAY

	It's bull's-eye nose cone scuds across the endless rice
	paddies west of Tokyo.  Women in straw hats stand in the
	knee deep water pruning the rice by hand.  Old Japan
	rubbing shoulders with the new.


	INT.  TRAIN - DAY

	CLOSE ON NICK looking out the window as the countryside
	shoots past at 140 mph.  From O.S. several children
	chanting:  "Harrow, Harrow."

	Nick looks over to see three uniformed school children
	thrusting their notebooks and pens at him.

	JOYCE

	is sitting across from Nick.

					JOYCE
			They want your autograph.

					NICK
			Who am I supposed to be?

					JOYCE
			This little guy thinks you're Robert
			Redford... the other one thinks
			you're Charles Bronson...

					NICK
			Tell them I'm not.

	She does, but the kids insist.

					JOYCE
			They'll never go away.

	Nick, reluctantly signs.  Joyce takes one of the kid's
	notebooks before passing it back.

					JOYCE
			Mick Jagger?

	Joyce smiles, surprised at his choice.  Then, she looks up
	shocked to see --

	ICH

	carrying a gift wrapped package under his arm.  He's
	wearing his hat, blue suit and tie.

	Ich sits ACROSS the aisle from Nick and Joyce.  He doesn't
	say a word.  Faces straight ahead.

	Nick looks at Joyce, then back at Ich.

					NICK
			I'm sorry, Ichiro.  I lost it last
			night.  I shouldn't have hit you.

	Still nothing from Ich.

					NICK
			What's in the box?

					ICH
				(still not facing
				 him)
			For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese,
			ham... If you come to apologize for
			interrupting his meeting, Sugai may
			feel obligated to see you.

					NICK
			So I bring some cheese?

					JOYCE
			Gifts are expected here.

	Nick nods, looks back out the window.  He'll never
	understand this country.  He looks back to see --

	Joyce looking annoyed at him.  Nick gets the message.

					NICK
			Hey, Ich... Thanks.  I'm glad you're
			here.  I mean it.

	Ich still won't acknowledge Nick.


	EXT.  BULLET TRAIN

	The Bullet Train disappearing into the foothills.


	EXT.  BEPPU - DAWN

	Plumes of white steam spindle skyward from every street
	corner.  If you didn't know it was steam, you'd think the
	city was on fire.  Beppu is a resort famous for it's
	geothermal baths.


	EXT.  SUGAI'S HOUSE

	The only traditional house we'll see in our story.  It's
	surrounded by a pool of blood red steaming water from the
	hot springs.

	AT THE GATE

	CLOSE ON A 1000 yen bill as it is dropped on the ground.
	A pair of dice rolls over it.  A handful of GUARDS wearing
	suits and ties are playing craps.

	OUTSIDE THE GATE

	Ich is sitting on the ground leaning against the wall,
	sound asleep.  Nick is standing nearby.  He checks his
	watch.  Tired of waiting, he walks over to --

	JOYCE

	reading the Manichi Daily.

					NICK
				(impatiently)
			They took the gift an hour ago.

	The phone rings inside the gate.  A guard picks it up.

					JOYCE
				(certain it's bad
				 news)
			All's not lost.  There's a famous
			temple here.  We could chant.

	The guard hangs up, calls out to Joyce.  Joyce responds in
	Japanese.  The guard opens the gate.

					NICK
			We're in?

					JOYCE
			The cheese...


	INT.  A ROOM IN SUGAI'S HOUSE

	A vast, austere, traditional room with sliding rice paper
	doors and tatami mats on the floor.

	Ich and Joyce, drinking tea, are sitting with their feet
	beneath them in the traditional manor.

	Nick, smoking, is in a semi-sprawl; using his tea cup as
	an ashtray.

	A LIEUTENANT enters.  He says something and beckons.  They
	all rise.  He says something else.

					JOYCE
				(to Nick)
			Just you.


	INT.  ANOTHER ROOM - SUGAI'S HOUSE

	Nick enters, ducking his head in the low doorway.  the
	shoji slides shut behind him.

	The furnishings are minimal but elegant.  There's a
	butsudan, a tokonoma, and a low, long table in the middle
	of the room.  No chairs.  Nick sits on the floor.

	A door slides open at the far end of the room.  Sugai,
	wearing a kimono over western style suit, walks in.  Nick
	stands up to shake his hand.  Sugai ignores it, and sits
	in the traditional position:  feet tucked beneath him.

					SUGAI
			I'll spare you the ritual.

	He tosses him a palm sized bundle.  Nick catches it.
	Inside, are brand new greenbacks:  hundreds.

					NICK
			This supposed to impress me?

	He sets it down.

					SUGAI
			Pick it up.  Look at it.

	Nick hesitates, then picks it up again.  He runs his
	fingers over the face of the bill and snaps the paper.

					SUGAI
			Seven years work by the finest
			engraver.  Mass produced,
			sequentially numbered.  The best
			there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.

					NICK
			I'm impressed.  But let's use the
			short form.  I'm looking for --

					SUGAI
			-- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of
			my partners.  One in New York, one
			at the printing plant.

	Sugai fills a cup of tea for Nick and hands it to him.

					NICK
			I don't drink tea.

	Sugai hands it to him anyway.

					SUGAI
			I took Kobo from the street.  I gave
			him a home, a future... But my ways
			were too slow for him... I served
			seven years in prison for my boss
			when I was a young man.  Kobo
			wouldn't serve seven minutes for his
			Oyabun.
				(sipping his tea)
			He was supposed to take over this
			syndicate when I retired.

					NICK
			I want him.

					SUGAI
			He'll be dealt with.

	Sugai sets a plastic wrapped object on a table before
	Nick.  Nick recognizes it from the restaurant massacre in
	New York.

	CLOSE UP:  Nick's fingers tear at the plastic.  A block of
	black iridescent polymer.  The negative image of a $100.00
	bill.  A printing plate.

					SUGAI
			Our associates in New York were
			close to closing a deal with us.

					NICK
			The families who control the
			casinos?

					SUGAI
			Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your
			criminals don't understand the words
			'honor' and 'duty'... We can't
			afford not to deal with them.

	Sugai takes the plate back.

					SUGAI
			Imagine if your families could pay
			their gambling and drug debts with
			perfect counterfeit bought for cents
			on the dollar.

					NICK
			The Feds would be onto you in a
			month.

					SUGAI
			Not with these bills.  And even if
			it only took them six months, do you
			know what our profit margin would
			be?

	Nick looks at a child playing near one of the hot pools in
	Sugai's garden.

					NICK
			Why tell me this?

					SUGAI
			The other plate is currently in New
			York, in the hands of Kobo's man.
			Find it for me.

					NICK
			You trust me?

					SUGAI
			I'll pay you.

	Nick laughs at Sugai's audaciousness.

					NICK
				(indicating the
				 counterfeit bills)
			With these?

					SUGAI
			Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion.
			Whatever you want.  You know the
			city and the police.

					NICK
			If I say no?

					SUGAI
			You're smarter than Kobo.  You know
			the price of deceit.  Think about
			it.

					NICK
			I don't have to.

	Sugai cools.  Without a word he gets to his feet and
	starts toward the door.

					NICK
			I have ten hours to grab my man.

	ON SUGAI

	still walking with his back to Nick.

					NICK (O.S.)
			You won't get hurt.

	Sugai turns to see Nick, across the room, pointing the
	Beretta at his head.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  ROOM - SUGAI'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	The room where Ich and Joyce are waiting.  Sugai enters.
	Their surprise turns to shock when they see Nick behind
	him holding a gun to the old man's head.

					ICH
			No...

					NICK
			Let's go.  Him first.

					ICH
			Nick, you can't do this.

					NICK
			It's done.
				(to Joyce)
			You don't have to come.

	She hasn't moved a muscle.


	INT SUGAI'S HOUSE - ENTRANCE WAY

	Sugai watches calmly as Nick, Ich, and Joyce put their
	shoes on.  Nick keeps the gun on him.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  SUGAI'S COURTYARD

	Nick steps out of the house.  He now has one end of a wire
	coat hanger loosely wrapped around Sugai's neck, the other
	end around his wrist.  His gun is pressed just beneath
	Sugai's ear.  If nick gets shot, so does Sugai.

	A handful of guards stand in the courtyard, one is
	polishing Sugai's Debonnaire car.  They spot Nick and
	Sugai coming, and immediately pull their guns.

					NICK
			Explain to them.  They shoot me,
			they kill you.
				(Sugai hesitates)
			DO IT!

	Sugai explains to his lieutenants.  They stand helpless as
	Nick walks Sugai toward the car.

					NICK
			Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.

					ICH
			No.

					NICK
			Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work
			with me.

	Ich takes the keys from the man polishing the car.  He
	gets inside.  Joyce hurries in bedside him.

					ICH
			You don't know what you're doing.

	Nick slides Sugai in the back seat, carefully reaches over
	and shuts the door.

					NICK
			Start it.

					ICH
				(terrified)
			I can't...

					JOYCE
			Slide over.

	Joyce, furious at Nick, starts the car, gets behind the
	wheel.  Ich gets in on the other side.

	She spins the car around.  The gate opens.  They tear off.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  STREET - BEPPU - DAY

	The car bursts through the funnels of steam from the hot-
	springs beneath the street.  It tears down the narrow
	block dodging traffic.  Joyce is concentrating hard on the
	road.

					NICK
				(to Ich)
			Where's somewhere safe?

	Nothing from Ich.  He's still apoplectic.

					JOYCE
				(angrily)
			You came up with the first part.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  KUDAN LOVE HOTEL - BEPPU

	A four story concrete hotel, strictly for making love.
	"Love Hotels" exist all over Japan.  Each have various
	themes:  western, fifties drive in, Star Wars, etc., each
	complete with music and lighting effects.


	INT.  HOTEL ROOM

	Western style.  Plastic five foot cacti in front of the
	western vista on the walls.  A hitching post at the head
	of the bed.  Cowboy hats and boots at the other end.

	Sugai hangs up the phone and turns to Nick and Joyce who
	are sitting nearby.  Ich hangs up the extension.

					SUGAI
			Kobo will meet me here tomorrow.
			Ten a.m.

	Ich nods, confirming that what Sugai says is true.

					NICK
			Good.

					SUGAI
			He'll find out you took me.  I'm
			unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of
			us.  You don't stand a chance.

	Ich, knowing Sugai is right, looks at Nick.  Nick flips
	Ich the gun.

					NICK
			Not if we're careful.

	Ich checks to make sure the gun is loaded, then watches as
	Nick escorts Joyce out of the room.

								 CUT TO:

	A HOTEL ROOM ACROSS THE HALL

	Fifties theme.  The front end of a pink chevy curves
	around the bed.  A "Drive-In" movie screen along one wall.

	Nick is dropping change into the vintage Wurlitzer.  Joyce
	steps in, leaving the door open.

					JOYCE
			You're out of your mind.  I'm
			leaving.

	Nick doesn't respond.

					JOYCE
			You'll get Ich killed.

					NICK
			No one's keeping him here.

					JOYCE
			Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me
			this is all just about Charlie.
			It's not.

					NICK
			Why would you care?

	That pushes her over the line.

					JOYCE
			Bastard...

	She moves toward him, enraged.  Nick grabs her arm.

					JOYCE
			Let go.

	He won't.

					JOYCE
			You're out of your mind.

	He grips her tighter.

								 CUT TO:

	THE ROOM - LATER

	Nick and Joyce, only partially undressed, are making love
	on the floor.  The Drifters singing "Under The Boardwalk"
	can be heard on the Wurlitzer.  The fifties decor, the
	music, it's all pretty incongruous.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  LOVE HOTEL - DAWN

	Nick is putting Joyce in a taxi.  He shuts the door.

					JOYCE
			I still think you're a bastard.

					NICK
			What if I chant?

					JOYCE
			Wouldn't help.
				(beat)
			Watch out for Ich.

	He nods.  The cab drives off.  Nick watches her taxi until
	it is out of sight, around a corner, then heads inside.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK - LATER

	walking into Sugai's room.  Sugai's asleep on the bed.
	Ich is vigilantly sitting awake in the corner, the gun
	resting on the table in front of him.

					NICK
			Better wake him up.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  LOVE HOTEL - LATER

	Quiet.  The wind twirls a discarded newspaper in the
	parking lot.

	INSIDE THE LOVE HOTEL - HALLWAY

	A YOUNG GIGGLING COUPLE step out of a door, arm in arm,
	and disappear down the hall.  STAR WARS MUSIC from one
	room.  HAWAIIAN MUSIC from another.

	THE CAMERA FINDS the closed elevator door.  It opens, Kobo
	steps out, followed by a half-dozen more men all carrying
	Sig-Saur assault rifles -- very heavy artillery.

								 CUT TO:

	SUGAI

	wearing his hat and coat is sitting on the couch, his back
	to us, facing out the window.

	Drop down to --

	THE ROOM BENEATH HIM

	A couple are making love in the Hawaiian theme room.

	The door burst open.  Two men, cradling Sig-Saur rifles in
	their arms, step in.  They aim at the ceiling, blasting
	into Sugai's room above.

	THE GIRL

	starts screaming.  The men ignore her and continue to pump
	bullets into the ceiling.

	KOBO AND HIS MEN

	stop in front of every door long enough to blast into the
	room.  They make their way down the hall.

	A naked man steps into the hallway and is matter-of-factly
	gunned down.

	Kobo and his men stop in front of Sugai's room.


	INT.  SUGAI'S ROOM

	Sugai, wearing his hat, is slumped down on the couch which
	has been splintered by the bullets from below.

	OUTSIDE THE ROOM

	Kobo signals the men.  All six open-up through the door.

	INSIDE THE ROOM

	The door, what's left of it, is kicked open.  The six men
	step in, shooting in all directions:  into the bathroom
	door, into the closet... Windows shatter, mirrors fall,
	total destruction.  They stop.  SILENCE.

	Kobo walks up to Sugai who is slumped on the couch.  He
	lifts up his hat.  It's a cowboy mannequin wearing Sugai's
	clothes.

	THE ELEVATOR DOOR

	opens.  A DOZEN of Sugai's men carrying machine pistols
	come out.

	THE OUTSIDE BALCONY

	Nick and Ich lie on their bellies, guns out.

	INSIDE THE ROOM

	Kobo's men turn.  Sugai's men open-up.  Three of Kobo's
	hitters go down.  The others try to flee into the
	adjoining room.

	Kobo goes for the balcony.

	THE BALCONY

	as Kobo steps out.  He steps right into --

	NICK

	who slams the side of Kobo's head with the butt of his
	gun.

	THE ROOM   

	Nick and Ich drag Kobo in by his jacket collar.  Sugai,
	very much alive, walks in from the hallway.  Nothing is
	said.  Sugai looks at Kobo for a long beat, then walks
	out.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  SUGAI'S HOUSE - DAY

	KOBO

	standing alone in the middle of a tatami room.  His face
	is badly beaten.  His hands are bound.  Two guards stand
	near the wall.  Nick and Ich stand across the room.

	SUGAI

	wearing a western suit, is asking Kobo questions in
	Japanese.  Sugai barks at him again.  Kobo refuses to
	answer.  Sugai pulls up a shuto -- an 18 inch knife --
	from it's scabbard.

					SUGAI
				(in Japanese)
			Contact your associate in New York
			and tell him to hand my plate over
			to Abolofia.

	Nothing from Kobo.

					SUGAI
			You have betrayed the syndicate and
			personally dishonored me.  I would
			rather the deal fell through than...

	The guards walk over and turn Kobo around.  His back is to
	Sugai.  Sugai runs the sword across the nape of Kobo's
	neck drawing blood.  The guards tighten their grip on
	Kobo's arms.

	NICK

	can't believe Sugai's going to kill him.  Nick starts to
	get up, Ich stops him.

	Kobo realizes Sugai isn't just threatening him.

					KOBO
			No... I'll arrange it.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	THE ROOM - LATER

	Kobo is led back into the room by two guards.  The guards
	shove him down to the floor.  His hands are still bound.

	Nick walks over and stands above him.  He doesn't say a
	word.  Just stands above him.  Then, Nick pulls spare
	change from his pocket and slowly drops the coins, one by
	one, in front of Kobo's face, like Kobo did to him.  He
	walks away.

	Sugai steps in.

					SUGAI
			Abolofia's person has received the
			plate.  It's done.

	A door opens at the far end of the room.  It's Kobo's
	girlfriend, the one Nick and Ich had been following.

	She starts toward Kobo; a lieutenant intercepts her.

					SUGAI
				(in Japanese)
			I wanted you to see him like this.

					GIRL
				(in Japanese)
			Let him go, father.

	ON ICH

	realizing she's Sugai's daughter.

					GIRL
				(in Japanese)
			You're too old...

					SUGAI
				(in Japanese)
			That's enough.

	Sugai turns away and picks up the sword.  The guards
	clutch Kobo.  Sugai's going to kill Kobo after all.

	The girl screams at him to stop.  Sugai's oblivious.

					NICK (O.S.)
			That wasn't our deal.

					SUGAI
			You want him dead too.

					NICK
			After a court convicts him.  He
			belongs to me.

	There's a long pause.  Then, something unusual happens.
	Sugai tells the lieutenant to unfasten Kobo's wrist.  When
	he does, Sugai hands Kobo the sword and demands that he
	cut off his finger.

	This is Yubitsume:  the ritual act within the Yakuza of
	slicing the joint of the little finger to atone for a
	mistake.

	Kobo, not believing in this ancient tradition, refuses.
	Sugai nods to a guard who places Kobo's finger on the
	table.

	KOBO

	stares defiantly at Sugai.  He doesn't even wince as the
	blade slices off his finger.  The guard hands Sugai the
	finger in a handkerchief.

					SUGAI
				(looking at Nick)
			If anything happens to Abolofia or
			my plate, detective...

	HOLD on Nick then --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  TRAIN - DAY

	as it bursts out of a tunnel on it's way to Tokyo.


	INT.  TRAIN - DAY

	Kobo is sitting by the window, his hands cuffed in front
	of him.  Another pair of cuffs chain him to the arm rest.

	Nick pours a drink from an airline-sized bottle of Scotch.
	He holds it out to... Ich.  It's his first drink in a
	week.

					NICK
			Just one, compadre... Kampai.

					ICH
			Kampai.

	They clink glasses.  Ich drinks it down.

					NICK
			It took 12 years to make it, you
			could take five minutes to drink it.

	Ich slows down.

					NICK
			You did great, Ichiro.

					ICH
			I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.
				(smiling)
			I like him waiting.

	Ich gets up.

					ICH
			Needs ice.

	He heads for the bar car, leaving Kobo and Nick alone.

	Kobo looks out the window at the people working the rice
	paddies, then back down the aisle at the Salarymen in
	their identical suits, then at the women separated from
	them.

					KOBO
			Ugly... A couple of thousand years
			they've been bound by these little
			rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid.
			Ugly little lives...

					NICK
			Save it, I already took the tour.

					KOBO
			You are a lucky man.  Where you come
			from a man can stand out.  It's
			expected.  Here a man is made to
			look a fool for standing out.

	Nick isn't paying much attention.

					KOBO
			I like your friend, Joyce.  You're
			lucky.

					NICK
			Guess I'm on a roll.

					KOBO
			She's such a long way home for you.

					NICK
			Time, I've got plenty of.

	A raucous SALARYMAN comes down the aisle, singing an Enka,
	swaying with the train, bumping into seats.  A common
	enough sight and ignored by the rest of the passengers.
	The Salaryman stumbles and falls across Nick's lap.

					NICK
				(helping him up)
			Hey, hey, come on, blow...

	The Salaryman bows deep.  Nick ignores it.  The man moves
	on.  Kobo looks out the window, the train begins to SLOW
	as it approaches the next station.

					KOBO
				(matter-of-factly)
			This is my stop.

					NICK
			I'm amused.

					KOBO
			Don't be.

	Nick looks up to see Kobo calmly fingering a lock of blond
	hair tied with black ribbon.  Joyce's ribbon.  Joyce's
	hair.

					KOBO
			I have her.

	Nick looks down the car.  The drunk Salaryman who stumbled
	over Nick is quite sober.  He made the hand-off to Kobo.
	Kobo holds out his wrists.  Nick hesitates.

					KOBO
				(matter-of-factly)
			I'll kill her.

	Nick, reluctantly, unlocks both sets of cuffs.  The train
	pulls into the station.

					KOBO
			I want the plate from your pal,
			Sugai.  When you get it, you get
			her.

	Kobo gets up, starts down the aisle.

					NICK
			Sugai won't give it to me, you know
			that.

					KOBO
			Then take it from him.

	Kobo gets off the train.

	NICK

	follows him to the door.

	THE STATION

	Kobo get into a waiting Jaguar.  Four guards nearby.

	INSIDE THE TRAIN

	Nick runs down the length of the car trying to keep the
	Jaguar in sight as the train pulls out... the car is gone.

	NICK

	bursts into the packed bar car.

					NICK
			Ichiro?!

	Everyone turns around.  No Ich.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  TRAIN - TRAIN STATION - TOKYO

	It slows into the station.


	INT.  TRAIN

	Nick shoves past the passengers lined up in the vestibule,
	ignoring a conductor's angry shouts.


	INT.  TERMINAL - MOMENTS LATER

	The train stops.  Nick flies out and starts running,
	dodging the crowd.

	Three uniformed policemen, including Ohashi's assistant,
	hurry toward him; they're dismayed to find that Kobo is
	gone.

					NICK
			Where's Ohashi?

	Instead of offering him help, the policemen grab him and
	slap a pair of handcuffs on Nick's wrists.

					NICK
			What the hell are you doing?!

								 CUT TO:

	HOLDING CELL - TOKYO POLICE STATION

	Nick, waiting alone in the cell.  It's been hours.  A door
	at the end of the hall opens.

	Ohashi stops in front of his cell.

					OHASHI
			Your plane leaves at six.  Two
			officers will escort you.

					NICK
			For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your
			help.  Let me out of here!

					OHASHI
			You had my help, detective.

					NICK
			If anything happens to her while I'm
			here --

					OHASHI
			-- Do you know where she is,
			detective?  Do you know how to find
			her?  Even where to start?  We will
			find them.

					NICK
			I have to get to Sugai.

					OHASHI
			Goodbye, officer.

	Ohashi keeps walking.

					NICK
			OHASHI!

	The LOUD clank of metal on metal.  Ohashi's gone.

					NICK
				(yelling at the top
				 of his lungs)
			OHASHI!!

	HOLD on Nick, his fingers squeezing the bars in rage,
	then --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  ROAD - DAY

	Flood rice paddies stretch to the distance on either side
	of the road.  We PAN over to Kobo at a phone kiosk outside
	a gas station.

					KOBO
				(in Japanese)
			Yes.  Do it.


	INT.  SUGAI'S HOUSE - AT THAT MOMENT

	Kobo's girl, Sugai's daughter, hangs up the phone.  She's
	been on the other end of the line.


	INT.  SUGAI'S ROOM

	The door swings open.  Sugai is sitting on the floor.  The
	girl is carrying a tray of tea.  Beneath the tray, we spot
	something else -- the butt of a short-bladed tanto.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  NARITA AIRPORT - TOKYO - DAY

	A police car rolls through the service gate.  We see Nick
	inside the car along with two police guards.


	INT.  HOLDING ROOM - NARITA AIRPORT

	A white room.  No chairs.  Jet engines can be HEARD
	through the walls.  Nick is sitting on the floor,
	defeated.  He doesn't look up when he hears someone enter.

					ICH (O.S.)
			I'll tell you one thing.  You can't
			solve a thing sitting on your ass.

	Nick looks up.  Ich is in uniform.  A revolver and batton
	hang from his white web gear.  His undershirt bulges
	through his khaki shirt.  He looks ridiculous.  Nick has
	never seen a more beautiful sight.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  POLICE CAR

	Ich is driving.  Nick is seated behind a cage in the back
	seat.  His hands are cuffed.  Ich is driving through the
	freight area towards a perimeter guard.

					NICK
			I was ready to have your ass for
			taking off on me.

					ICH
			I followed them.  An hour from the
			train station.

					NICK
			How many men?

					ICH
			I couldn't tell.

					NICK
			Joyce?

					ICH
			I don't know.

					NICK
			We need the plate to negotiate with.

	Ich nods.


	EXT.  AT THE GATE - TOKYO AIRPORT

	The car slows.  Ich speaks rapidly to the guard showing
	him his papers.  The guard takes a good hard look at Nick.
	Time stands still... He waves them through.  Nick can
	breath again.

					NICK
			You know, Ichiro, you just burned
			your bridges.

	Ich is silent for a moment.  He hands Nick's Beretta back
	through the partition.  So it goes.

					ICH
			Rest.

	Nick looks for Ich's eyes in the rearview mirror.  The
	little cop keeps driving, his eyes on the road.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  STREET - BEPUKU - DAY

	Nick and Ich are standing outside their car.  The Police
	radio crackles from inside.

	WHAT THEY SEE:

	A large crowd gathered outside of Sugai's estate.  Police
	have cordoned off the area.  An empty ambulance is parked
	out front with various other cars:  Debonnaire's,
	Cadillac's... A boy in shorts is endlessly bouncing a ball
	against the compound wall.  Whatever happened is long
	over.

	Ich flips off the radio.

					ICH
			Someone attacked him.

					NICK
			Now we've got nothing to negotiate
			with.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  ROAD - DUSK

	The police car streaks across endless fields.

	INSIDE THE CAR

	Nick is at the wheel.  He rubs the sleep from his eyes.
	Ich is slumped down in the seat watching the road.

	Ich pulls out a cigarette.  Nick lights it for him.

					NICK
			Joyce told me about your family.
			It's tough...

	Ich looks up surprised.

					ICH
			Thank you.
				(beat)
			You have one?

					NICK
			A wife.  She left.

					ICH
			I'm sorry.

					NICK
			Me too.

	Ich glances over at Nick, then back at the road.

	Nicks rubs out his cigarette and presses down on the
	accelerator.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  KOBO'S HIDEOUT - DAWN

	A small, contemporary house perched on a dry piece of
	land.  A paved road, lined with dense foliage runs on a
	berm between the flooded rice paddies.

	ON NICK AND ICH

	sitting in the car watching from a hillside turnoff.
	There's no easy way in.

					NICK
			Let's go.

	Ich hands Charlie his shuto -- an 18 inch long knife.

					NICK
			What's that for?

					ICH
			Luck.

	Nick tucks the shuto inside his jacket.

					NICK
			Thanks.

	Nick opens up his door and climbs out.

					ICH
			You know, Nick, we can't lose.

					NICK
				(stopping)
			Why's that?

					ICH
			Because we're the biggest things to
			hit this town since Godzilla.

								 CUT TO:

	THE DIRT ROAD

	leading to the house lined with foliage.  The rice paddies
	on either side.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK AND ICH

	making their way through the waist high water.

	TWO WORKERS

	with their hoes make their way into the water.  They don't
	see our cops.

	OUR COPS

	making their way along the edge of the road.  The SOUND of
	a motorcycle coming.

	THE MOTORCYCLE RIDER

	slows and drops a gear as he turns off the main road and
	onto the dirt berm toward the house.  He's one of Kobo's
	Bosozoku -- a long way from the streets of Tokyo.

	The rider comes around the bend to see --

	A COP

	standing in a uniform.  Ich.  For a moment he doesn't know
	what to do.  Then, he draws a pistol from his belt and
	accelerates toward Ich.

	ICH

	stands his ground as the bike closes in.  The biker takes
	aim.

	Ich drops off to the side as --

	NICK

	rises from a ditch and swings a hoe at the rider as he
	passes, catching the man across the face.  The rider drops
	like a swatted fly.  The biker's momentum carries it a few
	yards before it falls and skids to a halt.

	Nick hurries to the bike.

	Ich drags the biker off the road, then catches up to his
	partner.

	NICK AND ICH

	raise the heavy bike.  Nick mounts.  He takes the riders
	helmet and goggles from Ich, and puts them on.

					ICH
			What are you going to do?

	Nick doesn't know exactly.  He taps the bike into gear, it
	torques like a mule.  There's a lot more juice here
	than he's used to.

	Nick fishtails for a minute, then gets the hang of it.

	Ich heads off taking another route.


	INT.  HOUSE

	KOBO AND SUGAI'S DAUGHTER

	are putting the last of their belongings into a suitcase.
	She hands him the plate -- Sugai's plate.

	Kobo kisses her as he slips it into his breast pocket.
	The SOUND of a motorcycle approaching from outside.


	EXT.  THE HOUSE

	Kobo steps out, and not recognizing Nick, raises his hand
	to greet what he thinks is one of his men.

	ON NICK

	bearing down on Kobo.

	ON KOBO

	as Nick keeps coming.  He is unable to see clearly until
	Nick is almost on top of him.

	NICK

	dumps the bike at the foot of the stairs and leaps on
	Kobo.

	Nick and Kobo roll off the narrow porch.  Nick breaks
	free.  He isn't fighting fair this time.  He slams his
	foot into Kobo's face and ribs.  Kobo tries to get up, but
	Nick knees him in the chin.

	A woman cries out in Japanese.  Nick turns to see

	JOYCE

	standing at the top of the steps.  A biker is pressing the
	muzzle of a Sig-Saur assault rifle on her.  Kobo's girl is
	beside them holding a small pistol.

	KOBO

	gets to his feet.  The biker tosses Kobo the rifle.  Kobo
	works the charging lever and holds the weapon at his side.
	He has all the time in the world.

	Kobo whirls and kicks Nick in the groin.  Nick falls to
	his knees in agony.

	Kobo towers above Nick as he did in the alley in New York.

					KOBO
			Still on your knees, Nick?

	Kobo walks off, his back to Nick.

					KOBO
			There's nothing you can do for me
			anymore.  I have the plate.  Sugai's
			dead.  No there is something.

	He walks up to the steps to Joyce.

					KOBO
			You can tell me who I should shoot
			first.

	Nick struggles to get to his feet.  Kobo turns and faces
	Nick at the foot of the steps.

	ICH

	appears behind Kobo and takes him down with an amazing
	display of baton work that shows a lifetime of training.

	He grabs the gun.  A biker bursts out of the door.  Ich
	fires, hitting him in the thigh.  He drops his gun.

	SUGAI'S DAUGHTER

	grabs the gun.

	NICK

	tackles her, and wrestles the gun away.  She grabs for it.
	Nick slugs her.

	A GUN BLAST

	Ich is hit in the back of his shoulder, falls onto the
	porch.

	KOBO

	the shooter, is holding a pistol -- a Glock 17 automatic.
	He fires at

	NICK AND JOYCE

	who scramble for cover.

	KOBO

	continues firing as he climbs onto a motorcycle.  He pops
	the clutch and flies off down the road.  Nick fires after
	him, but Kobo's gone.

					NICK
				(to Ich)
			You all right?

					ICH
			Yes...

					NICK
				(to Joyce)
			Call for help.

	Nick mounts the other bike, and puts the turbo charged
	rocket into gear.

	THE ROAD

	Rain pours down as Kobo turns onto the main road.  He
	opens up the throttle, and in less than a second, he's a
	screaming dot in the distance.

	NICK

	comes around the same corner.  His bike fishtails and
	slides out from under him.

	FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD

	Kobo tears past a police car.  The police car takes off
	after him.

	THE FOOTHILLS

	A series of steep switchbacks traverse the steep, densely
	forested hills.

	Kobo's bike flies up the road.  The police car can't keep
	up, begins losing ground.

	THE POLICE CAR

	going flat out, falling further and further behind.
	Kobo's going to escape.

	SUDDENLY

	Nick, bent low, shoots past the cop car.  His left arm is
	scraped and bloody.

	ON KOBO

	glancing back, to see Nick gaining on him.  Kobo's
	pleased.  He gives it more gas.

	NICK

	pulling eight-five... ninety... one hundred.  The rain
	stings his face.  It's hard to keep his eye open.

	THE FOOTHILLS

	Kobo leaning into one of the steep turns, climbing higher
	and higher toward the clouds clinging to the top of the
	peak.

	NICK

	is gaining on him.  He HEARS something coming up behind
	him.

	A BOSOZOKU

	the one Ich shot in the leg, is closing fast on his tail.

	ON NICK

	as the biker draws even.

	THE BIKER

	pulls out his long knife and slashes at Nick's shoulder.

	Nick drops back causing him to miss.  The biker drops
	back.  Nick tries to speed up, but the biker sticks with
	him.  He's a good rider, this boy.  Very, very good.

	The biker moves in again, blade drawn.

	NICK SEES

	something the biker doesn't.

	A TRUCK

	coming around the corner.

	NICK

	swerves to avoid it at the last moment.  The biker reacts
	too late and runs --

	INTO THE GLEAMING

	radiator of the two ton truck, and disappears beneath its
	wheels.

	ON KOBO

	around the bend, glancing back.  Empty road.  He eases up
	on the throttle -- a free man... He circles back only to
	see

	NICK

	burst around the corner charging toward him at a hundred-
	and-twenty miles per hour, in the driving rain.

	KOBO

	waits and waits.  Nick draws closer.  Then, Kobo tears off
	back down the mountain, shooting past Nick.

	Nick brakes... He slows down, and starts to turn, but the
	wheels whirl on the gravel and the bike goes into a skid,
	heading right for the edge of the road.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK'S MOTORCYCLE

	flying over the edge of the road, and down the cliff.

								 CUT TO:

	THE EDGE OF THE ROAD

	Nick, lying on his stomach at the edge of the cliff, his
	arm is probably broken.

	He tries to get up with a one arm push up.  It's hopeless.
	His head falls into a puddle of water.

	The WHINE of an approaching motorcycle.  Kobo has come
	back for him.

	Nick, in excruciating pain, struggles for his gun.

	KOBO

	bearing down on Nick.

	NICK

	struggling to get his gun.  Finally he does.  But it's
	caked in mud.  If the barrel is stuffed it will explode.
	Nick has to take the chance.

	ON KOBO

	Closer and closer.

	NICK

	aims as best he can and fires.  The mud caked gun explodes
	in his hand.  Nick screams in agony.

	KOBO

	pulls his bike up inches in front of Nick's head.  Nick
	seems to be bleeding everywhere:  his hand, his nose, his
	mouth, the side of his head...

	Kobo's face and neck is caked in blood from when Nick beat
	him.

	The rain pours down.

	He picks up the gun.  Points it at Nick, squeezes the
	trigger.

					KOBO
				(slowly)
			Bang... bang...

	He tosses the gun in front of Nick's face.

					KOBO
			... You're dead.

	The sound of approaching Police SIRENS.

	Kobo swings the bike around, goes a hundred yards down the
	road, then swings back.

	Kobo guns the engine.  He gain speed... thirty, thirty-
	five.

	NICK

	struggles to get up.  He can't.

	KOBO

	opening the throttle.

	NICK

	crawling a few inches, that's it.

	KOBO

	twenty yards away.

	NICK

	reaches into his coat and pulls Ich's 18 inch shuto out.

	He rolls away at the last moment, slashing Kobo's ankle as
	he races past.

	KOBO

	screams in pain.  He tries to stop too suddenly.  The bike
	flips over.  Kobo flies into the air then hits the
	pavement on his side and rolls a few yards down the road.
	He stops on his back.  It's lucky he's alive.

	The SOUND of fast approaching police SIRENS.

	THE PLATE

	has fallen out of Kobo's jacket.  It rests in the road,
	halfway between the two men.

	KOBO

	crawls toward it on his belly.

	NICK

	mustering all his strength, struggles across the road on
	all fours.

	KOBO

	crawling snake-like.

	NICK

	still moving, his arms and legs feel like lead.

	KOBO'S FINGERS

	as they reach for the plate.

	NICK

	grabs Kobo's wrist forcing him to drop the plate.  Nick
	picks up a rock.  It looks as if he's going to smash
	Kobo's head.  Instead, he brings it down on the plate,
	shattering it in a half-dozen pieces.

	Nick tosses the pieces in front of Kobo's face.

					NICK
			Keep the change.

	Nick, exhausted, slowly falls onto his back.  He looks
	over at Kobo, their faces are inches apart.  Nick makes a
	slashing mark with his index finger above his eyebrows.
	The same gesture Kobo made to Nick through the two-way
	mirror in New York.

	Nick passes out.  His eyes shut... the screen...

								FADES TO BLACK.

	BLACK SCREEN

	The SOUND of three police cars screeching to a halt.  The
	SOUNDS of the police SIRENS winding down.

	The SIRENS get softer mixing with the SOUND of RINGING
	phones, CLACKING typewriters, VOICES...


	FADE IN:

	INT.  TOKYO POLICE HEADQUARTERS

	Fifty identical desks.  Fifty identically dressed men in
	white shirts and ties work under fluorescent lights.

	OHASHI

	is at his desk studying a report.

	Suddenly, the lights go out.  The fan's stop, so do the
	electric typewriters.

	Ohashi looks up to see --

	ICH

	walking toward him down the long aisle, his left arm is
	bandaged, his right hand handcuffed to Kobo on crutches.

	Ich silently leads the captured man down the long aisle to
	Ohashi's desk.

	ICH

	stops in front of the desk and snaps to attention.

					ICH
			Constable Ichiro Matsumoto presents
			captured prisoner Kobo, Chief
			Inspector Ohashi.

	Ich salutes.

					OHASHI
			Inspector Ohashi will take charge of
			the prisoner.

	Ich uncuffs Kobo and steps aside to reveal --

	NICK

	standing at the far end of the room by the fuse box.  He's
	also bandaged and on crutches.

	Nick looks at Ohashi without saying a word, then flips the
	main switch up.  The lights and fans start working.

	He turns and walks out the door.

								 CUT TO:

	Joyce and Nick are sitting alone at a table.  Nick's left
	arm in in a sling.

					NICK
			Can't make you change your mind?

					JOYCE
			Last time you asked me to come along
			I nearly got a hole in my head.

					NICK
			Might be different in New York.

					JOYCE
			Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find
			out.

					NICK
			I'd like that.

	Ich sits down with two fresh bowls of soba noodles.  Nick
	hesitates.

					ICH
			You can do it.

	Nick picks up his chopsticks with his good hand.  He
	begins to slurp the noodles.

					ICH
			Louder, pal, louder.

					NICK
			Joyce, give the assistant Chief
			Inspector a drink, would you?

	As Joyce refills all their cups we...

								 SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  EIGHT THREE PRECINCT - NEW YORK CITY - DAY

	It's raining.  A sun shower.


	INT.  POLICE STATION

	Capt. Oliver is standing by the window watching the rain
	pour down.

					OLIVER
			... Remember, counterfeiting is the
			Feds.  They'll be all over
			Abolofia's place.  Stick tight.
			You I.D. the other plate, he does
			real time.

					NICK
			Right.

	Reveal Nick sitting in front of Oliver's desk, his one arm
	is still in a sling.  Nick gets to his feet.

					OLIVER
				(still not facing
				 him)
			You know, Nick, if you'd held on to
			that plate, you could've been a very
			rich man.

	Oliver turns to face Nick.  Nick just looks at him, then:

					NICK
			Never crossed my mind.

	Oliver nods; he believes him.

					OLIVER
			Be careful on the run.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  SQUAD BAY - NIGHT

	In contrast to the Japanese police station -- it's chaos.
	Cops are in every imaginable kind of dress, trash cans
	over flow, a handcuffed prisoner screams abuse to anyone
	who will listen.

	THE RAIDING PARTY

	a dozen men in all, are donning flak jackets and
	windbreakers with POLICE and TREASURY stenciled on the
	back.

	NICK

	walks in with two heavy bullet proof vests slung over his
	shoulder.  He squeezes past the raiding party to find

	ICH

	sitting at a desk, thumbing through a Frommer's guide to
	New York City.  Nick drops one of the vests on the desk.
	It lands like a ton of bricks.  Ich continues to read.

	A Sergeant walks in.

					SERGEANT
			Saddle up.  Hard team in the first
			unit.  Conklin, your RMP awaits.

	The cops and treasury men, grabbing their gear, head for
	the door.

	Nick is struggling to get into his vest using one arm.

					NICK
			Sure you want to come?  Probably
			better than the Greyline Tour.

	Ich stands up, shoves the guidebook in his back pocket.
	He helps Nick fasten the strap in back.

					ICH
			You wouldn't make it without me.

	Nick smiles, takes the Frommer's out of Ich's pocket and
	tosses it into the trash.

	Nick hands him a shotgun, takes another one off the rack
	for himself.

	We watch from behind as the two men head down the long
	hallway toward the exit.

					ICH
			Think we'll get him, Nick?

					NICK
			We can't lose.

					ICH
			How can you be so sure?

	Nick opens the door at the far end of the hallway.  They
	step out into the sunlit rain.

					NICK
			Cause you're the biggest thing to
			hit this town since...

	Before Nick can finish his line, the door SLAMS SHUT
	behind them.

								 FADE TO BLACK.

	Darkness, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS. Presentation credits roll as we
	FADE UP ON:

	INT. HOSPITAL, INNER-CITY TRAUMA WARD - NIGHT

	It's 1967, the Summer of Love and --

	BOOM! Entry doors swing open as PARAMEDICS wheel in a FEMALE BLEEDER,
	VANESSA (20s, black, nine months pregnant). She's deathly pale,
	spewing founts of blood from a savagely slashed throat -- 

	A SHOCK-TRAUMA TEAM swarms over her, inserting a vacutainer into an
	artery to draw blood, wrapping a blood pressure cuff around her
	arm --

				NURSE #1
			(with stethoscope)
		She's not breathing!

				SENIOR RESIDENT
		Intubate her!

	The RESPIRATORY THERAPIST feeds an endotracheal tube down the woman's
	ruined throat, attaches that to an Amblu bag --

				RESIDENT
		Blood-pressure's forty and falling --

	The woman starts spasming violently. It takes three staff members
	just to hold her down.

				SENIOR RESIDENT
		Jesus, her water's broken --
			(calling for help)
		She's going into uterine contractions --

	CAMERA PUSHES IN on the woman as she bolts upright, SCREAMING to wake
	the dead. We PLUNGE INTO the darkness of her mouth and find
	ourselves --

	INSIDE HER BLOODSTREAM

	The sound of a HEART BEATING, pounding as we whip-snake through --

	CORPUSCLES 

	floating in amber plasma. Erythrocytes, leukocytes, neutrophils and
	eosinophils. 

	The rhythmic expansion of the artery walls, pulsing with each
	successive surge of blood as the HEART BEATS FASTER AND FASTER,
	taking us --

	IN UTERO,

	A CHILD, alive but unborn, shifting in a sea of amniotic fluid,
	surrounded by the white, protective substance known as vernix
	caseosa. The HEARTBEAT races like a locomotive now. The unborn child
	shifts, turns its head towards us --

	-- and opens its eyes.

	CUT TO:

	A SWORDBLADE

	cleaving the darkness, radiant light slicing across gleaming Damascus
	steel. Words acid-etched in the weapon's fine-tempered surface:

	BLADE

	Main credits end.

	EXT. INNER CITY, INDUSTRIAL GHETTO - NIGHT

	A decaying no man's land populated by condemned buildings and HUNGRY
	HOMELESS. Steam rises from manhole covers, drifting across the
	litter- lined streets. Suddenly --

	A black Mercedes 850 appears over the crest of a hill, ROARING past
	us, stereo system belting out FILTER.

	INT. MERCEDES - NIGHT

	Raquel, a wasp-wasted woman, sits behind the wheel. 20s, rich,
	sickeningly attractive. Hungry eyes. 

	Squirming around in the passenger seat is DENNIS, a model/actor boy-
	toy with a sub-zero IQ and a "fuck me sideways" grin. 

				DENNIS
		So where we going?

				RAQUEL
		It's a surprise. 

				DENNIS
		I likes surprises. 

	Raquel eyeballs Dennis -- "if looks could devour". 

				RAQUEL
		What do you have down there, little 
		man?

				DENNIS
		Heat-seeker.

				RAQUEL
		I'll bet.

	Raquel slides a manicured hand up his thigh, squeezes his groin.
	Dennis MOANS. She pulls her hand away, downshifts.

	EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT

	The 850 threads a narrow alley into a vacant lot, BRAKES hard. Raquel
	and Dennis climb out. She leads him into --

	EXT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - NIGHT

	Industry never sleeps, and certainly not this grisly facility. Raquel
	leads Dennis around the back of the plant, where a host of WORKERS
	are loading refrigerated trucks with product.

				DENNIS
		What the fuck are we doing here?

	Raquel just smiles, heads on into the plant via a loading door. The
	workers ignore her.

	INT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - NIGHT

	Dennis follows Raquel through the bowels of the plant, catching
	glimpses here and there of carcasses being rendered or hacked apart. 

	Through one partially open door we see what might be a line of
	BODYBAGS being trundled into the back of a truck via a hook and chain
	pulley-system. But Dennis doesn't have enough time to be disturbed by
	the vision, because he's being pulled away by Raquel, led down --

	A STAIRWELL

	We are in the basement now. At the end of the hall is a steel door,
	with perhaps, just the faintest HINT OF MUSIC heard coming from
	beyond. Raquel knocks.

	A "peep-hole" slat opens and a BLACK LIGHT shines into Raquel's eyes.
	A VOICE behind the door offers a verbal challenge, speaking a
	language we've never heard, laced with a devilish cadence. 

	Raquel responds in kind. The door opens. Raquel gives Dennis a
	knowing wink, enters. Dennis follows. 

	INT. CLUB - NIGHT

	Raquel and Dennis move past a hulking DOORMAN, making their way down
	a narrow stairway. Dennis is suitably impressed.

	THE CLUB 

	is elite, underground -- an "abattoir-chic" version of an old-time
	juke joint with a greasy, dangerous vibe. White-tiled walls and
	floors for easy hosing, chromed fittings, run-off gutters, drains. No
	bar.

	BODIES 

	writhe on the strobe-lit dance floor. A heavy S&M scene. Leather.
	Latex. Tattoos. Body-piercings.

	A D.J. wearing head-mounted spotlights orchestrates the tunes on
	twin- decks. MUSIC assaults us -- a beat so heavy it could jar the
	fillings from your teeth. Brutal "DARKCORE" along the lines of
	Prodigy or Underground. 

	Raquel pulls Dennis out onto the dance floor. They sway. 

	A lupine-featured GAULTIER GIRL with a streak of white running
	through her raven hair moves in behind Dennis, pressing up against
	him. Rachel Williams as the Angel of Death -- we'll call her MERCURY.

	Mercury flicks her tongue against Dennis' ear -- it's been pierced
	with a silver post which clicks against her teeth. Tattooed across
	her back in black is a swirling, tribal vortex. 

	Dennis is now sandwiched between Raquel and Mercury, the three of
	them dry-humping their way to every man's glory. 

	The beat gets LOUDER. The action heavier. The atmosphere more
	narcotic. People are stripping off their clothes, sweating like
	fiends. It's a virtual orgy.

	Dennis laughs, reveling in the hedonism. Everything rises to a fever
	pitch --

				DENNIS
			(over the music)
		Fuck, I need a drink!!!

	Raquel just smiles -- then Dennis notices a DROP OF SOMETHING spatter
	his hand. It looks like blood. Dennis looks up, concerned --

	-- MORE BLOOD DROPLETS are falling. Raquel's face is sprinkled with
	them now. Dennis stops dancing. What is this? Some kind of fucked up
	performance art?

	Raquel turns her face toward the ceiling, as if washing herself in a
	summer shower, now the other club goers are looking up too --

	BLOOD SHOWERS DOWN

	from sprinkler heads in the ceiling, drenching the dancers. The club
	goers love it, thrusting their heads back, mouths open wide to
	receive the crimson offering. 

	Horrified, Dennis recoils, turning towards --

	RAQUEL,

	whose face morphs into a preternatural snarl. Her canines extend,
	tapering to razor-sharp points. Her tongue flicks, lizard-like as
	fingernails sharpen into claws. All this while the whites of her eyes
	BLEED RED, pupils oscillating hypnotically. 

				RAQUEL
		What's wrong, baby?

	Dennis SCREAMS, pushes away from Raquel, only --

	-- Mercury has fangs now too. In fact, everyone in the club does,
	with the exception of poor Dennis. That's because they're all
	vampires.

	Dennis tries to run, but the burly Doorman blocks his exit, brutally
	smashing his fist into Dennis' face. 

	Dennis falls, dazed. The club-goers close in around him. They make a
	game of it, shoving him from one person to another, their pale faces
	leering like twisted jack-o-lanterns.

	The strobe lights quicken to a seizure-inducing intensity. Dennis
	spins, tumbling into Raquel's arms. She shoves him forward -- Dennis
	lands on the floor, falling at someone's boot-clad feet. He looks up.
	A DARK FIGURE sits in the shadows, unnoticed until this moment. The
	figure stands, moves into the light as time screeches to a halt -- 

	A BLACK MAN, 

	towers above Dennis, wearing dark glasses and a leather longcoat -- a
	sneer of cruel contempt etched upon a face tempered by a lifetime of
	horror. His name is BLADE.

	Blade whips open his long coat, shrugging it off, revealing an
	arsenal of high-tech weapons strapped to his body: 

	6-point adjustable body armor, a modified CAR-15 assault rifle with
	an ultra-violet entry light, two Casull .454 revolvers, a "Demon"
	automatic cross-bow, a bandoleer of mahogany stakes, an Indian-style
	katar punching dagger -- and last, but certainly not least, his
	namesake -- a silver sword which is secured in a back-scabbard.

	CLOSE ON BLADE

	A gaze as cold and pitiless as a midnight sun. The vampire club-goers
	stare back. Nuclear silence. And then --

	All hell breaks loose. With a SNARL, Raquel charges at Blade, moving
	at superhuman speed, practically a blur -- 

	Blade draws his Casulls, FIRES in multiple directions --

	MACRO BULLET SHOT 

	as a round roars through the air towards Raquel. A silver-tipped dum-
	dum bullet which explodes on contact.

	WHAM! The round punches a fist-sized hole through Raquel's chest,
	continuing on into the vamp behind her! Vampire blood fountains. Both
	creatures tumble forward, their bodies liquefying into puddles of
	black oil which go gurgling down the run-off drains.

	Blade continues FIRING, then -CLICK!- magazines empty. Next. He
	holsters the Casulls, swings up his assault rifle, calmly flicks on
	the UV entry light mounted above --

	MERCURY 

	leaps twenty feet straight up into the air. We've never seen anything
	move so fast. She CRASHES through a glass skylight, disappearing into
	the night just as --

	-- a shaft of blinding UV "sunlight" cuts across the vampires. They
	rear back, skin smoking from the light's corrosive effects. Blade
	opens FIRE, pumping round after round of wooden fragmentation bullets
	into the crowd -- vampire genocide.

	The strobe lights flicker as the mayhem mounts. Some of the vampires
	try to flee, scurrying up the stairs, but the exit quickly becomes
	clogged with liquefying bodies -- 

	-- then Blade's CAR-15 jams. The remaining club-goers see their
	opening, surge forward en masse -- 

	Blade drops the rifle, reaches over his shoulder and -SCHINGGG!-
	unsheathes his sword with a double-handed grip. 

	THE SWORD

	Four acid-etched feet of blood-soaked Damascus steel. An edge so
	sharp it could cleave a shadow in two.

	Blade moves like lightning, hacking his way into TWO CHARGING
	VAMPIRES. Blade spins again, cuts ANOTHER VAMPIRE clean in half --

	ON THE FAR END OF THE CLUB,

	a LATEX-CLAD VAMP makes a break for it. Blade flings his sword,
	sending it spinning end over end -- THUNK! The sword punches into the
	vampire's heart. The hellish creature convulses, dies.

	Beat. Blade retrieves his sword, then senses --

	SOMETHING BIG

	rising up behind him. In a flash, Blade swings his sword downward,
	cutting off the vampire's right hand at the elbow. The severed limb
	falls to the floor -- 

	-- but it doesn't slow the hulking creature down. It SLAMS into
	Blade. Blade flies backwards thirty feet, tumbling over tables,
	slamming into the rear wall so hard that plaster rains down from the
	ceiling. 

	Blade suddenly finds himself wrestling with a feral-faced six-foot-
	something nightmare named QUINN. The vampire rears back its head,
	jaws stretching wide. Every inch of his face is covered with ritual
	scarification patterns and Maori-like tribal tattoos. 

	Blade forces an elbow against Quinn's throat, trying to keep him at
	bay. With his other hand he reaches to his bandoleer, pulls out a
	stake -- CRUNCH! Blade shoves the stake through the vampire's larynx.
	Quinn gurgles, clutches at his throat. 

	Blade rolls out from under, unholsters the cross-bow secured to his
	leg. With a flick of a switch the arms of the bow -SNAP!- open,
	drawing the bow-string taut. Blade FIRES -- 

	The bolt hits Quinn in the shoulder, throwing him backwards and
	nailing him to the wall. As Quinn reaches over with his other hand to
	pull out the stake --

	Blade FIRES AGAIN. A second bolt slams into Quinn's other arm,
	effectively pinning him like a butterfly to a board.

	UP ABOVE, 

	mounted in one of the corners, is a security camera. Blade fires a
	cross-bow bolt straight into the lens. 

	Blade strides over, placing his sword against Quinn's chest.

				BLADE
		Where is Deacon Frost?

	Quinn glares, trying to speak, gagging on the stake still lodged in
	his trachea --

				BLADE
		Got something in your throat.

	Blade yanks the stake free. The vampire laughs, air whistling through
	his ruined larynx. 

				QUINN
		Fuck you, Day-walker, I ain't saying 
		shit --

				BLADE
		Frost.

	Quinn responds with a slew of rapid-fire vampire invectives. Blade
	sees he's getting nowhere fast, calmly sheathes his sword. He unclips
	a white phosphorous grenade from his combat harness -- 

				QUINN
		You won't stop him, Blade. The Tide's 
		rising, the Sleeper's gonna --

	Blade shoves the grenade in Quinn's mouth, pulls the pin. WHOOSH!
	Quinn goes up like a roman candle. Blade turns, surveying his work,
	ignoring the howling pyre behind him:

	All evidence of the vampires is gone -- with the exception of a few
	oily-black puddles. Clothes, jewelry -- it's all been burned away by
	the acidic process of the creatures' accelerated decomposition.

	DENNIS sits huddled in a corner, having pissed his pants. As Blade
	approaches, he cringes back --

				DENNIS
		Please don't --

	Blade simply grabs Dennis by the jaw, tilting his head upward,
	rotating it from side to side -- looking for bite marks. There aren't
	any.

	Blade moves on, leaving Dennis alone amidst the carnage. As Blade
	starts up the stairs, he pauses in mid-step --

	A COCKROACH

	scurries out from underfoot. 

	Blade adjusts his footfall, sparing the roach. He continues on up the
	stairs, disappearing in the smoky haze. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. CITY HOSPITAL, AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

	CAMERA FOLLOWS a bagged corpse as it's rolled into the autopsy room
	by an ASSISTANT. 

				ASSISTANT
		Brought you a baked potato, nice
		and crispy. Still warm, too.

	CURTIS WEBB, the forensic pathologist (30s, white bread, a little on
	the smarmy side) steps forward, unzips the bag --

	It's Quinn, what's left of him, anyway. Burnt to a charcoal
	briquette, limbs twisted horribly, oozing fluids.

	Curtis turns his head, grimacing, wafting the air.

				CURTIS
		Jesus, that's rank -- 

	Curtis turns back, makes note of the blackened stump where Quinn's
	arm used to be, the ruined throat -- 

				CURTIS
		What's his story?

				ASSISTANT
		Paramedics said he was still screaming 
		when they found him. Looks like some 
		joker had stapled him to a wall.

				CURTIS
		Pretty.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL, HEMATOLOGY LAB - NIGHT

	MICROSCOPE POV

	of a slide-mounted blood smear stained with Wright stain (blue ink).
	What we see is a collection of donut-shaped pink things (red blood
	cells) intermingled with some small blue specks (platelets) and the
	occasional larger, light-blue blobs (white blood cells).

	KAREN JANSEN (20s), a fine-featured hematologist with a social life
	in suspended animation, sits back from the microscope, stumped. Next
	to her is JULIE WHITAKER, a cheerful chemtech. 

				KAREN
		You took this off a DOA?

	Curtis sits on a stool nearby, slowly nodding.

				KAREN
		This isn't human blood.

				CURTIS
		Then what is it?

				KAREN
		I don't know --
			(re: microscope)
		Look at this blood smear -- 

	Curtis takes a look for himself.

				KAREN
		The red blood cells are biconvex, 
		which is theoretically impossible. 
		They're hypochromic, there's virtually 
		no hemoglobin in them. 
			(shaking her head)
		Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, 
		they should be mononucleated.

				CURTIS
		What about the chemistry panel? 

	Karen looks to Julie, who reaches for a computer print-out.

				JULIE
		Blood sugar level is three times the 
		norm, phosphorous and uric acid are 
		off the scales.
			(shrugs)
		Like the woman said, impossible.

	Karen removes her glasses, rubbing the bridge of her nose.

				KAREN
		Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm 
		really not in the mood for one of your 
		practical jokes.

				CURTIS
			(insistent)
		It's not a joke. I've got the stiff 
		sitting in the morgue right now -- 
		look, just come up and see him, okay? 
		Five minutes, that's all I ask.

				KAREN
		I thought you promised to give me some 
		distance?

				CURTIS
		This is purely professional curiosity, 
		Karen, I swear.

	Karen rolls her eyes, lets loose a tired sigh.

				KAREN
		Five minutes, not a second more. And I 
		don't want to hear a word about "us".

				CURTIS
		No problem.

	INT. HOSPITAL MORGUE - NIGHT

	The dead of night, not a mouse in the house. Curtis and Karen, each
	garbed in a mask, stand on either side of Quinn's body, which now
	rests on the autopsy table.

	QUINN'S BODY

	A preliminary exploratory Y-incision has been made across the chest,
	stretching from shoulder to shoulder, then continuing on down the
	abdomen. Ribs and cartilage have been cut open to expose the heart
	and lungs.

				KAREN
		You haven't started in on the internal 
		organs?

				CURTIS 
		Just the blood sample from the 
		pericardial sac.

	Curtis pauses, studying Quinn's disfigured face -- the features seem
	much less damaged now -- almost as if the corpse were healing itself.

				CURTIS
		That's weird --

				KAREN
		What?

				CURTIS
		He looks different now, burns are less 
		extreme, some of these wounds have 
		closed up -- 

	Curtis pulls out a penlight, flicks it on. He leans over Quinn,
	shining the light into one of his eyes.

				CURTIS
		Tell me something, honestly, you ever 
		have second thoughts about us?

				KAREN
			(grudgingly)
		Sometimes --

	Curtis looks up from the corpse, grinning beneath his mask.

				KAREN
		-- but then I remember what an 
		ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back 
		to reality. 

				CURTIS
		Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart 
		here --

	Quinn suddenly bolts up from the autopsy table, sinking his fangs
	into Curtis' jugular. He snaps the man's neck in two for easier
	access, sucking in blood like a living vacuum. 

	Karen stumbles backwards, sending autopsy tools CLATTERING.

	QUINN

	rises from the table, flinging Curtis' twitching body aside. He curls
	his blood-soaked lips back, baring viper-like fangs, emitting a
	GUTTURAL GROWL --

				QUINN
			(crazed by thirst)
		-- more -- blood --

	Karen backs into the corpse drawers, but Quinn is upon her in a half-
	second, wrapping a hand about her throat. His mouth opens/morphs
	disturbingly wide as if to swallow her head whole, caustic saliva
	dripping from his canines -- 

	Karen tries to turn her head away, but Quinn's grip is vise-like. She
	finds herself staring into his eyes -- pupils pulsing rapid-fire,
	opening and closing, hypnotic --

	As Quinn sinks the tips of his fangs into Karen's carotid artery and
	starts to nurse --

	BANG!!! A load of MAHOGANY buckshot chews into Quinn's side. He HOWLS
	in pain. Another load catches him full in the face. He drops Karen.
	She falls to the floor -- 

	KAREN'S POV

	The sound of RUSHING BLOOD pounding through her skull. Everything
	spinning. She struggles to move, turns her head, finds herself eye to
	eye with Curtis' corpse.

	ON QUINN

	rising, his face torn up, smoking. WHIP PAN TO --

	BLADE, 

	standing at the entrance to the morgue, a streetsweeper auto-shotgun
	in hand, sizing Quinn up.

				BLADE
		Now don't we look dapper?

	Quinn BELLOWS with rage, ripping one of the heavy steel refrigeration
	doors from its hinges, flinging it at Blade like it was lawn
	furniture --

	Blade rolls to the side as the door CRASHES against the wall. Quinn
	runs, moving through the morgue like a human tornado, heading for the
	windows at the end of the room --

	SMASH!!! Out goes Quinn, taking half the wall with him. Blade rushes
	to the decimated window, looks down --

	BLADE'S POV

	Quinn lands on the roof of an ambulance parked four stories below,
	caving it in. He springs off, loping across the tarmac on three
	limbs, then -SCREECH!-THWUMP!- rolling up onto the hood of an
	oncoming car, before disappearing into the night --

	BACK UP ABOVE,

	Blade spins, SEES Karen bleeding her life away on the floor. She
	reaches a hand out to him, beseeching --

	Blade pulls away from her grasp, takes a step towards the exit --
	then hesitates. 

	A flicker of doubt washes across Blade's face. He looks down at Karen
	once more, wrestling with his conscience, finally making a decision.
	He kneels, scoops Karen up into his arms. Just then, 

	TWO POLICEMEN 

	rush into the morgue, weapons drawn --

				UNIFORM #1
		Hold it, ass-hole!

	Blade ignores them, turning to face the window before him. It's a
	good thirty feet to the roof of the adjacent building, a parking
	structure -- and damned if Blade doesn't seem to be considering the
	jump.

	The Police close in, agitated. Blade crouches, switches Karen to a
	one-handed grip --

				UNIFORM #1
		I said hold it!!!

	-- and jumps.

	EXT. HOSPITAL/ROOFTOP PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT

	Blade clears the impossible distance -- almost. He snags the ledge of
	the adjacent parking structure with his left hand even as Karen slips
	from the grasp of his right --

	-- a last-second save, his fingers clamping around her wrist, is all
	that stands between Karen and street pizza. She SCREAMS anyway,
	dangling below him --

	Blade GRUNTS, swinging Karen like a pendulum, heaving her up and over
	the ledge as if she were a sack of potatoes. She lands on her
	shoulder, clutching it in pain --

	Blade heaves himself up, crouching beside her.

				KAREN
			(gasping)
		My shoulder -- dislocated --

	Blade places a hand on her shoulder, another around her elbow and
	without any consideration to discomfort -CRACK!- brutally pops it
	back in place. Karen SCREAMS again as he scoops her up once more and
	heads for --

	HIS '69 OLDSMOBILE 442, 

	which is parked nearby. Midnight-black. The definitive high-
	performance heavy-metal muscle machine with an engine big enough to
	power an Apollo rocket. 

	INT. BLADE'S OLDS - NIGHT

	Blade sets Karen down in the passenger seat, climbs behind the wheel,
	keys the ignition. The engine ROARS to life, belching fumes through
	the dual exhaust. Blade floors it, burning serious rubber as the Olds
	vanishes from sight. 

	BACK AT THE DEMOLISHED MORGUE WINDOW 

	as the two policemen stare numbly in open-mouthed astonishment.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

	Blade pilots the Olds down the streets, moving through a series of
	increasingly degenerating neighborhoods, coming at last to the
	sprawling warehouse district.

	EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT 

	The Olds approaches a mammoth industrial facility that's been
	cordoned off by cyclone fencing and razor wire. Ultra-violet
	floodlights illuminate the area, while an army of security cameras
	keep a watchful eye. 

	INT. BLADE'S OLDS - NIGHT

	Blade glances at Karen, cursing himself for giving into his emotions.
	He hits a remote secured to the sun visor --

	EXT. BLADE'S OLDS/ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

	A gate grinds open. 

	We follow the Olds as it cruises around the back of the building,
	heading down a concrete loading ramp. At the bottom of the ramp, a
	heavy iron door rises. Blade's Olds disappears into the darkness.

	INT. ABANDONED FACTORY, INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	More UV lights flicker on. We're in a massive loading elevator which
	HUMS as it ascends, eventually reaching its destination with a
	BOOMING CLANG. The doors at the rear glide open. Blade guides the
	Olds out.

	INT. ABANDONED FACTORY, WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

	Set up in an old ironworks, the place looks like a cross between an
	auto junkyard and an armory. Equipment is strewn everywhere --
	lathes, mills, old furnaces, gutted vehicles, an ad hoc surgical
	theater -- all of it jerry-rigged in a brutal, oily-tech.

	Blade climbs out of the Olds. He opens the passenger door and pulls
	Karen out, carries her in his arms. 

				BLADE
		Whistler!

				WHISTLER (O.S.)
		Are we bringing home strays now?

	ABRAHAM WHISTLER (60s)

	hobbles out of the shadows, leaning heavily on a cane. Gimlet-eyed,
	bitter, his right leg encased in a metal brace. Though his face is
	lined with wrinkles and his hair has long since gone gray, we sense
	he could kick the living shit out of any man half his age. 

				BLADE
		She's been bitten.

				WHISTLER
		You should've killed her, then.

				BLADE
		She hasn't turned yet. 
			(pointedly)
		You can help her.

	Blade and Whistler stare each other down. Finally, Whistler turns and
	heads over to the operating theater.

				WHISTLER
		No promises. You watch her close. She 
		starts to turn, you finish her off.

	Blade nods, lays Karen down on the operating table. Whistler turns on
	an overhead light. Karen is sheathed in sweat, ashen. She's lost a
	lot of blood.

	Whistler snaps on a pair of surgical gloves, probes the wound in
	Karen's neck with an antiseptic swab -- there's capillary damage
	around the perimeter of the wound, the tissue looks bruised,
	gangrenous. 

				WHISTLER
		Localized necrosis. She's borderline. 
		Another hour and she'd be well into 
		the change.

	Whistler cracks open a smelling salt capsule and waves under Karen's
	nose. As she starts to stir --

				WHISTLER
		Can you hear me, woman? 

	Karen's eyes open wide. She's scared, disoriented --

				KAREN
		What -- ?

				WHISTLER
		You've been bitten by a vampire. We've 
		got to try and burn out the venom, 
		just like a rattlesnake bite --

	Whistler reaches for a massive syringe filled with caustic-looking
	fluid. Karen sees the syringe, resists --

				WHISTLER
		Hold her. 

	Blade forces Karen back. Whistler readies the syringe.

				WHISTLER
			(reading her name tag)
		"Dr. Karen Jansen". Listen close, I'm 
		going to inject you with an antidote 
		made from allium setivum -- garlic. 
		This is going to hurt. A lot. 

	Whistler sinks the needle into Karen's neck and depresses the
	plunger. "Hurt" doesn't begin to describe what Karen experiences
	next. Imagine undergoing childbirth while someone pumps battery acid
	through your veins.

	Karen SHRIEKS, her body going into uncontrolled paroxysms. The wound
	on her neck begins to smoke as the antidote attacks the poisonous
	vampire venom.

	Karen clutches at Blade's arms, digging her nails in. She stares up
	at him with unflinching intensity, like a child desperately searching
	for assurance. 

	ON BLADE,

	uncomfortable playing the roll of nursemaid. He'd like nothing more
	than to be done with this, but the only thing he can do is hold Karen
	while she rides out the seizures. 

	KAREN'S POV

	growing darker by the moment. The last thing she sees is Blade
	staring down at her -- then the night closes in. 

	INT. HOUSE OF EREBUS, MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON a monitor featuring footage taken at the vampire club
	massacre. Blade turns and stares into the camera, fires his cross-
	bow. The screen cuts to static.

	A WITHERED, CLAWED HAND

	moves into frame, holding a remote. With a tap of a button, the
	monitor goes dark. 

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL a large, minimalist conference room -- the House
	of Erebus, seat of the vampire race's legislative assembly.

	Gathered around a massive table are the TWELVE VAMPIRE ELDERS,
	representing a "rainbow" of racial colors -- names like PALLINTINE,
	VON ESPER, ASHE, BAVA. Two of them, the FAUSTINAS, are identical
	twins -- lethal-looking women with alabaster skin. 

	Chilled carafes filled with blood are situated along the table. From
	time to time, a member will pour themselves a glass, or perhaps, help
	themselves to the bowls of human finger bones which serve as snacks.

	At the head of the table is GAETANO DRAGONETTI, current vampire
	"Overlord". Blood-red eyes, parchment skin stretched over skull-like
	features. Incalculably ancient, but still deadly and virile as a
	viper. 

	Dragonetti speaks. He uses the "secret tongue" -- the ancient vampire
	language which utilizes consonants human vocal chords are incapable
	of reproducing. 

				DRAGONETTI 
			(subtitled)
		Blade. Once again, our interests have 
		fallen victim to his ridiculous 
		crusade. He must be destroyed.

				FROST (O.S.)
			(in English)
		You're wrong, Dragonetti. 

	All heads turn. Who would dare such impudence?

	DEACON FROST, 

	a mere "Underlord" in the vampire hierarchy, steps forward.
	Strikingly handsome, younger, less conservative than his superiors,
	fueled with a passionate intensity. Amongst the vampire community
	he's known as an agitator. He's also the vampire equivalent of a
	racial supremacist.

				FROST
		The Day Walker represents a unique 
		opportunity. We'd be fools to waste 
		it by killing him. 

				DRAGONETTI
			(subtitled, taking umbrage)
		Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our 
		language, you insult the House of 
		Erebus by using the humans' 
		gutter-tongue, have you no respect 
		for tradition? 

				FROST
		Why should I respect something which 
		has outlived its purpose?

	This causes quite a stir amongst the other vampires. Frost might as
	well have slapped Dragonetti in the face.

				DRAGONETTI
			(simmering)
		I see. And what would you have us do 
		with this "half-breed"?

				FROST
		Study him. Unlock the secrets of his 
		DNA. He's the key we've been looking 
		for. 

				DRAGONETTI
		He is an abomination! 

	Dragonetti slams his fist down, toppling a carafe, spilling blood
	across the tabletop. Frost looks to the others --

				FROST
		Why should we spend our lives 
		cringing from the daylight when his 
		blood offers us an alternative? 
		Enough talk. It's time we stepped out 
		of the shadows!

	Dragonetti looks apoplectic. ELDER PALLINTINE, a five-hundred year-
	old vampire inhabiting the body of a prepubescent boy, interjects.

				PALLINTINE
		You're out of line, Frost.

				FROST
		Am I? Or am I just the first to say 
		out loud what we've all been 
		thinking? 

	The fact that no one answers is telling. Dragonetti glowers at the
	other Elders, sensing the tide turning.

				DRAGONETTI
		The shadows suit us, Frost. We've 
		existed this way for thousands of 
		years. Who are you to challenge our 
		ways?

				FROST
		Someone who's sick of living off 
		scraps. The coming age belongs to us, 
		not the humans! 
			(to the others)
		When the final war between our races 
		comes, who do you want leading the 
		charge? 

	Frost stabs an accusing finger at the Overlord.

				FROST
		Some withered up fossil ready to snap 
		like a brittle bone at the first sign 
		of change?

	Dragonetti GROWLS like an beast, raking his claws across the tyro
	vampire's face, knocking him to the ground. 

				DRAGONETTI
		Get out!!!

	Frost picks himself up, touches the gashes on his cheek. Looks at his
	fingers, licks the blood from them. 

				FROST
		Careful, old fang. You might wake up 
		one day and find yourself extinct.

	Frost smiles at Dragonetti and calmly exits the room.

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP, BLADE'S CELL - DAY

	ON KAREN as she comes to. Her wounds have been bandaged. She rises, a
	little shaky, takes in her surroundings -- She's in a spartan room,
	like a monk's cell. On the wall is a collection of knives and
	daggers. Some of them wooden, their hilts inscribed with bizarre-
	looking runes. In the center of these weapons rests --

	BLADE'S SWORD,

	hanging like a cross in a chapel, dominating all else. Karen touches
	it. Then her eyes drop to a silver locket which dangles from the hilt
	by a tarnished chain. She reaches for it, opens it --

	The locket features a photo, old and faded. It's the black woman we
	saw in the prologue, Vanessa, standing in the sunshine. 

	Karen moves towards the door, cautious -- 

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAY

	We hear VOICES now, coming from beyond a series of black-out
	curtains. Karen pushes one aside and SEES --

	BLADE

	strapped into some kind of Inquisition-esque restraint chair. His
	shirt is off, his body slick with sweat. Whistler finishes strapping
	Blade in, then stands back, holding up a gas-powered pistol injector,
	hesitant --

				WHISTLER 
		I had to increase the dose. You're 
		building up a resistance to the 
		serum --

				BLADE
			(impatient)
		Just do it, old man.

	Whistler nods, fitting Blade with a bite guard. Then he presses the
	pistol-injector against Blade's carotid artery. 

	Blade shakes violently, grinding his teeth through the bite guard,
	veins cording in his neck. He clutches Whistler's hand, holding it
	tightly as he fights his way through the hellish seizure. To his
	credit, Whistler never lets go.

	Mentor and student stare at one another as the mysterious serum runs
	its violent course. We understand that these shared moments, oddly
	private in their horror, are the glue which binds the two vampire
	hunters together. Finally, Blade slumps forward in his restraints,
	exhausted. 

	KAREN

	She draws back, instinctively knowing that she's just witnessed
	something she shouldn't have. She looks for an exit, SEES another
	doorway. She makes for it -- 

	INT. WHISTLER'S LAB - TANK ROOM - DAY 

	A dusty, darkened hole of a room, no windows, just shadows, crumbling
	concrete, rust stains, and --

	A LARGE TANK

	filled with swirling blood plasma, choked with electrical leads and
	biomedical sensors. SOMETHING floats within, suspended in the murky
	fluid -- a child , two or three years of age, drifting about like a
	medical oddity preserved in formaldehyde -- 

	THUMP! The child SLAMS up against the glass. Karen backpedals,
	startled. Its eyes are open now, pupils blown. It snarls, revealing a
	mouthful of razored fangs, trailing mouth-slime across the glass as
	it futilely tries to chew its way through to Karen.

	Karen stifles a sob, turning and running right into --

	BLADE,

	who now blocks the exit, sword in hand. Karen retreats a step,
	wary --

				BLADE
		You shouldn't be here.

				KAREN
		I'm sorry, I --

				WHISTLER (O.S.)
		Wandered off the beaten path, Doctor?

	Whistler has entered the room from a second doorway. Karen looks from
	Whistler to Blade, trapped between them --

				KAREN
		Who are you people?

				WHISTLER
		My name is Abraham Whistler.
			(re: Blade)
		This is Blade. As for our little 
		homunculus here --

	Whistler limps over to the tank, rapping his cane against it. The
	creature snaps at it reflexively, following the silver tip back and
	forth like a fish after a lure.

				BLADE
		-- he's a vampire.

				KAREN
		You're joking --

				WHISTLER
		Not at all. You're looking at a prime 
		specimen of the homines nocturna. 

	Whistler toys with the feral creature, engaging in a certain amount
	of sadistic delight as its efforts grow increasingly more frenzied.
	Suddenly, it surges towards the top of the tank, clawing at the
	lid --

	Karen becomes alarmed -- but then a massive ELECTRICAL JOLT shocks
	the creature back into submission. 

				WHISTLER
		If Blade hadn't brought you here, you 
		would've wound up like him.

	Karen brings a hand to her bandaged neck, recalling the events of the
	previous night. She looks to Blade.

				KAREN
		Why did you help me?

	Blade scowls, his gaze flickering to Whistler.

				BLADE
		Stupidity.

				WHISTLER
			(appraising her)
		Maybe not. I did some checking, she's 
		a hematologist. Knowledge like that 
		might come in handy.

				BLADE
		It's not worth the risk. We can't 
		trust her.

				KAREN
		Why?

				BLADE
		Because you're tainted. The venom's 
		still inside you. You could still 
		turn on us.

				KAREN
		What happens then?

	Blade looks to Whistler -- as far as he's concerned, the debate's
	over.

				BLADE
		Then I have to take you out, just 
		like any other bloodsucker.

	Blade turns and exits. Whistler and Karen follow.

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAY

	Beyond the grimy outer windows, we can see that the day is closing --
	long shadows, amber light. Karen lingers in the doorway, reeling from
	information overload. 

	Blade begins suiting up for his nightly hunt -- strapping on body
	armor, loading ammunition. He strings the tarnished locket around his
	neck as if it were an amulet that could ward off evil, then pauses to
	inspect a modified pistol, sighting down the length of it.

				BLADE
		We hunt them, moving from one city to 
		the next, tracking their migrations. 
		They're hard to kill. They tend to 
		regenerate.

	CLACK! Blade pulls the trigger on an empty chamber, then checks his
	next weapon --

				KAREN
			(sarcastic)
		So what do you use, then? A stake?

				WHISTLER
			(nodding)
		Some of the old wives' tales are true 
		-- they're severely allergic to 
		silver, various types of wood. Feed 
		them garlic and they'll go into 
		anaphylactic shock -- 

	Whistler picks up a customized rifle with a UV entry light, flicking
	on the beam.

				WHISTLER
		-- and of course there's always 
		sunlight, ultra-violet rays. 

	Karen shakes her head, incredulous -- 

				KAREN
		And you honestly expect me to believe 
		all this?

				BLADE
		I don't care what you believe. I 
		saved your life once, I don't plan on 
		making a habit of it. You want my 
		advice, you'll be out of the city by 
		nightfall. If you're stupid enough to 
		stay, that's your business.

				KAREN
		I can't just leave. I have a life 
		here, a career --

				BLADE 
		Not anymore. You've seen one of them. 
		You won't be allowed to live after 
		that. 

	Karen stares at Blade. Whistler gestures to the windows --

				WHISTLER
		There's a war going on out there. 
		Blade, myself, a few others -- we've 
		tried to keep it from spilling over 
		onto the streets. 
			(beat)
		Sometimes people like yourself get 
		caught in the cross-fire. 

	Whistler shrugs. As far as he's concerned, there's nothing else to
	say. Karen is still protesting, though. 

				KAREN
		I can go to the police. I have blood 
		samples back at the hospital. I can 
		show them. 

				BLADE
		Do it. You'll be dead before you can 
		file the complaint.

				KAREN
		That's ridiculous! No one's that 
		powerful. 

	Whistler sighs. He doesn't suffer fools gladly.

				WHISTLER 
		You're talking about a brotherhood 
		that predates the Catholic Church by 
		thousands of years. Their survival 
		depends on their ability to blend in. 
		Chances are, you've encountered them 
		and not even known it. On the subway, 
		in a bar --

	Blade slings his CAR-15 onto his shoulder, impatient. He starts
	towards the Olds, gesturing.

				BLADE
		Get in. Youre leaving.

				WHISTLER
		Wait.

	Whistler tosses a small metal canister to Karen.

				WHISTLER
		Consider it a parting gift. Vampire 
		mace -- silver nitrate, essence of 
		garlic. 

				KAREN
			(in disbelief)
		So that's it? You guys just patch me 
		up and send me on my way?

				WHISTLER
		There is one other thing. I'd buy 
		yourself a gun if I were you. If you 
		start becoming sensitive to the 
		daylight, if you start becoming 
		thirsty regardless of much you've had 
		to drink -- then I suggest you take 
		that gun and use it on yourself. 
		Better that, than the alternative.

	Karen stares at Whistler, horrified, as we --

	CUT TO:

	INT. THE VAMPIRE ARCHIVES - DAY

	We are deep in the narrow stacks of a sepulchral archive. Exactly
	what and where this place is will become more clear later on. 

	But for now, the CAMERA DRIFTS through the warren of aisles. Along
	the way, we catch a glimpse of a HULKING SILHOUETTE cowering behind a
	series of Japanese shoji screens. Later on, we find --

	FROST

	tucked away in a carrel, surrounded by books and scriptures, with
	only the SICKLY GLOW of his laptop to provide light.

				DRAGONETTI (O.S.)
		What are you doing here?

	Frost pauses, SEEING Dragonetti emerge from the shadows.

				DRAGONETTI
			(outraged)
		These archives are restricted to 
		members of the House of Erebus.

				FROST
		Please. You and the other Elders 
		wouldn't know what to do with these 
		texts if your lives depended on it. 
			(cryptically)
		Which, of course, they do.

				DRAGONETTI
		You're wasting your time, Frost. Far 
		greater scholars than you have tried 
		to decipher these words. Whatever 
		secrets they hold have been lost.

				FROST
		Perhaps.

	Frost studies Dragonetti, a self-satisfied grin on his face. If the
	act was intended to unnerve Dragonetti, it succeeded, though the
	ancient vampire would never admit it.

				DRAGONETTI
		What are you up to, Frost?

	Frost shuts the lid on his laptop, rising, drawing intimidatingly
	close to Dragonetti.

				FROST'S VOICE
		Wouldn't you like to know, Old Fang?

	A beat as the young turk stares his elder down. Dragonetti is the
	first to lose his nerve. Frost smiles and exits, leaving the old
	vampire to lick his wounds.

	CAMERA DRIFTS back to the hulking silhouette, which has been
	eavesdropping on the conversation. It quivers in fear.

	INT. BLADE'S OLDS (ON KAREN'S STREET CORNER) - DAY

	Blade brings the car to a stop. Karen looks at him. His eyes are
	hidden behind his glasses, his expression stone.

				BLADE
		Remember what we said. Keep your eyes 
		open. They're everywhere.

	EXT. KAREN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

	As Karen climbs out, Blade swings the door shut behind her. The Olds
	ROARS off down the quiet residential street. 

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, LOBBY - DAY

	Karen crosses the lobby, stepping into an elevator. Just as the doors
	are closing, a WOMAN and TWO MEN duck in alongside her. 

	INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

	Silence, the uncomfortableness of an elevator ride magnified tenfold.
	Karen can FEEL the eyes of her fellow passengers upon her. Finally
	succumbing to paranoia, she hazards a glance -- would she be able to
	tell if these people weren't human? The woman turns to Karen,
	smiles --

	Karen surreptitiously fishes the "vampire mace" from her pocket,
	clutching it -- and now one of the men turns to look at her,
	nodding --

	INT. KAREN'S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY

	The elevator doors open. Karen hurries out, heads left, finds herself
	in a deserted hallway. She looks back --

	-- then skips a heartbeat as the trio also step out! As Karen raises
	the canister of mace --

	-- the trio turn and head down to the right. Karen breathes a sigh of
	relief, shakes her head.

	INT. KAREN'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Karen enters quickly, bolting the door behind her. She picks up the
	phone, dials 911 --

				KAREN
		I need the police. This is an 
		emergency --

	As Karen waits to be connected, she moves to the back entrance and
	checks the locks -- then the windows, then the fire escape --
	finally, a VOICE comes on the other end.

				KAREN
		Hello? My name is Karen Jansen, I was 
		with Curtis Webb at Mid-Town Hospital 
		last night -- that's right, I 
		witnessed the attack --
			(listening)
		115 Aurora, apartment 3G. Yes, I'll 
		wait here. Please hurry.

	Karen hangs up the phone and turns -- 

	A SHAFT OF BRIGHT SUNLIGHT

	streams in through a window. Karen forces herself to look at it and
	winces, shielding her eyes. Again, she brings a hand to the bandaged
	wound on her neck. She moves to the window, pulling the shade down,
	frightened.

				KAREN
		Get a grip on yourself, girl.

	She sinks down into a chair to wait, setting Whistler's vampire mace
	aside. Then she shuts her eyes, massaging her temples. We SEE --

	A BRIEF FLASH OF

	Quinn, his mouth opening wide, saliva dripping from his fangs. His
	pupils pulsating hypnotically. We rush into his gaping maw and --

	WHAM! We're back to reality. Karen wakes with a start, looks to the
	windows -- time has passed, it's getting dark outside --

	-- and someone is KNOCKING at the front door. Karen reaches for the
	vampire mace, then moves to the door. She looks through the peephole,
	cautious --

				KAREN
		Who is it? 

	KAREN'S POV (FISH-EYE)

	A POLICE OFFICER stands in the hallway -- 30s, handsome, a knight in
	shining armor as far as she's concerned. 

				GIDEON
		Sergeant Gideon. I'm responding to a 
		911 call. 

	Karen visibly relaxes. She opens the door and steps aside, allowing
	Gideon to enter.

				KAREN
		Yes, that was me, I'm Karen Jansen -- 

	Gideon smiles, takes a quick glance around the room, then studies
	Karen's face, the bandages on her neck.

				GIDEON
		Are you all right?
			(off Karen's nod)
		I'm glad you called, Ms. Jansen, we've 
		been anxious to get a hold of you. You 
		disappeared on us for a while. 

				KAREN
		I know. Listen -- do you have any idea 
		what happened to Curtis, the other 
		doctor?

				GIDEON
			(matter of fact)
		Oh, he's dead. But I wouldn't worry 
		about that if I were you.

				KAREN
			(alarmed)
		Why?

	Gideon's smile vanishes as he unholsters his gun. 

				GIDEON
		Because you're dead too.

	Karen GASPS. She has a half-second to act -- in which she triggers a
	spray of vampire mace into Gideon's face. Gideon stumbles back,
	blinded, cursing, rubbing the heel of his palm against his eyes -- 

	Karen expects pyrotechnics -- but the end result is little more than
	an annoyance. A second later, Gideon is simply blinking, sniffing his
	fingers, confused --

				GIDEON
		Garlic?

				KAREN
		He said it would work against 
		vampires --

	Gideon bursts out laughing.

				GIDEON
		Who said I was a vampire? 

	Gideon shakes his head, still snickering. He forces Karen against the
	wall, placing the gun against her head --

				GIDEON
		Thanks for the laugh. You can shut 
		your eyes if you want to.

	CRASH!!! The front door explodes open as Blade comes flying through
	it! 

	Gideon tries to bring his pistol up -- but Blade grips the man's hand
	and squeezes. Gideon SCREAMS as his bones snap like kindling. The
	pistol falls from his grasp --

	Blade fires his fist into Gideon's gut again and again, then flings
	the officer across the room, sending him SMASHING into a glass-cased
	cabinet. Bleeding, battered, Gideon struggles to stand --

	Blade is all over him, kicking the shit out of the rogue cop until he
	sinks to the floor in a half-conscious haze.

	Blade stands over Gideon's limp form, fists clenched, breathing
	heavily, touching down after his adrenaline high. Finally, he looks
	to Karen --

				BLADE
		You okay?

	Karen nods, glances at Gideon --

				KAREN
		How did you know?

				BLADE
		Figured they'd send someone after you. 
		Thought I'd wait around and see who 
		showed up.

				KAREN
		You used me as bait?!

				BLADE
		It worked, didn't it?

				KAREN
		But, he could've --

				BLADE
		He didn't. Get over it.

	Blade kneels next to Gideon. He turns the man's head, inspects the
	neck, the skin behind the ear -- 

				KAREN
		But he's a policeman --

				BLADE
		He's a familiar. A human who works for 
		the vampires. See this mark?

	Blade pushes aside Gideon's hair, revealing a tiny, cryptic symbol
	tattooed into the man's scalp.

				BLADE
		That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire 
		cattle brand. That means Officer 
		Friendly here is someone's property. 
		Any of the other vampire's try to 
		bleed him, they'll have to answer to 
		Friendly's owner --
			(studying the glyph)
		This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. 
		We've been tracking him for a while 
		now --

				KAREN
		Why in God's name would anyone want to 
		work for them?

				BLADE
		Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If 
		they're loyal, if they prove 
		themselves, then their masters will 
		turn them. 

				KAREN
		And that's a good thing?

				BLADE
		For some. Live forever, never get old. 
		The ultimate high. 

	Just then, Gideon MOANS. Blade drags the man up so they're eye to
	eye.

				BLADE
		How 'bout you, Officer? You a good 
		little bloodhound?

	CUT TO:

	EXT. KAREN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSK

	Blade and Karen are now standing by Gideon's police cruiser which is
	parked outside Karen's apartment. Blade shoves Gideon against the
	hood of the cruiser. He finds Gideon's keys, moves to the trunk,
	opens it --

	IN THE TRUNK --

	A sophisticated medical cooling unit for transporting organs. Blade
	opens the unit, coolant vapor hisses out. Inside are plastic bags
	containing blood. 

				BLADE
		Looks like our friend was 
		blood-running.
			(to Gideon)
		Where were you headed?

	Gideon mumbles through a split lip and chipped teeth --

				GIDEON
		Mphuck you --

	WHAM! Blade plants Gideon's face into the hood of the car. Gideon
	GROANS, coughs --

				GIDEON
		Jesus -- 1227 Brookner -- 
		Holliston Clinic --

	Blade releases him, then reaches for his Casull.

				KAREN
		What are you doing?!

				BLADE
		Preventive medicine.

	Karen steps in front of Blade, shielding Gideon.

				KAREN
		You can't do this, he's human, it's 
		murder.

				BLADE
		It's war, now get the fuck out of the 
		way!

	Karen grabs Blade's arm, wrestling with him, trying to push his hand
	away. As the two of them struggle, Gideon makes a break for it,
	stumbling across the lawn. Blade pushes Karen aside, takes aim,
	FIRES --

	-- but Gideon ducks into an alley, disappearing from sight. Blade
	spins on Karen, enraged --

				BLADE
		God-damnit!!! Do you have any idea 
		what you just did?! He'll warn them. 
		They'll be waiting!

	But Karen's defiant, she's not backing down.

				KAREN
		You were going to kill him. What was I 
		supposed to do?! Shut my eyes and 
		pretend I didn't see what I saw? 

	Blade tears off his glasses. Karen gasps --

	BLADE'S EYES

	aren't human, nor are they vampire. They're something else -- emerald
	green, laced with swirling flecks of red. 

				BLADE
		Let me set you straight on something, 
		Doctor. What you've "seen" so far is 
		nothing. The world you live in's just 
		the sugar-coated topping. There's 
		another world beneath it, the real 
		world -- and it's a fucking bloodbath. 
		If you want to survive in it, you'd 
		better pull your head out of your ass. 

	Blade slips his glasses back on, leaving Karen shocked into silence.
	He heads for his Olds without looking back, climbs in, guns the
	engine. In seconds, he's gone, tearing off down the street in a cloud
	of exhaust.

	EXT. EDGEWOOD TOWERS, PENTHOUSE - DUSK

	We are soaring through the air above the gleaming city skyline,
	moving towards the Edgewood Towers whose windows reflect the blood-
	red sinking sun.

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, POOL - NIGHT

	Suffused lighting, elegant tile-work featuring evocative mosaics, the
	quiet strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC -- 

	MERCURY,

	the lupine Gaultier girl from the club, glides beneath the water,
	surfacing at the deep end. We SEE --

	FROST

	lounging in a chair, studying a laptop which rests beside him. On the
	screen is a digitized image -- a page taken from an ancient
	manuscript, written in a secret tongue.

	Officer Gideon waits nearby, cradling his ruined hand, his battered
	face cast downward like a boy who's been called into the Principal's
	office. 

				GIDEON
		Look, I know you're disappointed --

				FROST
		Crestfallen.

				GIDEON
		Blade was waiting for me. There wasn't 
		anything I could do.

	Frost nods, lapsing into brooding contemplation.

				FROST
		Tell me something, Gideon, what blood 
		type are you?

	Gideon hesitates. Is this a trick question?

				GIDEON
		I don't really know --

				FROST
		Take a wild stab. A? B? O, perhaps? 
		I'm interested in the antigens here, 
		the agglutination reaction --

	Gideon stammers as Frost rises. In the blink of an eye, Frost lifts
	Gideon from the floor, dangling the Officer over the deep end of the
	pool by his throat --

				FROST
		I'm going to guess AB positive.

	Gideon GURGLES as Frost's fingernails pierce his flesh, drawing
	blood. Then Frost releases him --

	Gideon plunges into the pool. Mercury is on him in a heartbeat,
	tearing him apart like a Great White consuming a piece of chum. The
	water churns violently around them, clouding with red.

	When it's over, Mercury rises from the pool, dripping wet, covered
	from head to toe in a crimson sheen. 

	She kisses Frost hungrily, letting Gideon's blood flow from her mouth
	to his. Frost flicks a tongue over his lips.

				FROST
		AB positive. Give the man a prize.

	Below them, Gideon's lifeless body sinks towards the pool bottom, his
	police badge twinkling like sunken treasure.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

	Blade's Olds cruises to a stop. We're in a low-end commercial
	district -- junky heaven. Blade climbs out, pulling an automatic
	rifle from the back seat, then heading into an alleyway. 

	EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

	Blade makes his way down the alley, cautious -- he SEES mountains of
	trash, boarded-up windows, overlapping layers of gang graffiti -- a
	RAT crouching on a trash dumpster, gnawing on a dead pigeon --

	-- then a SOUND behind Blade, the scuffle of feet -- 

	Blade whirls, drawing his sword, CHARGING at an approaching shadow,
	stopping mere millimeters from decapitating --

	KAREN,

	who's been backed up against the wall, her eyes wide with fright.
	Blade's sword vibrates from the tension in his forearm, having drawn
	just the slightest taste of blood.

				BLADE
		What the hell are you doing?! I could 
		have killed you!

	Blade lowers his sword. Karen remembers to breathe. She slumps,
	tracing her fingers over the line where her head almost parted with
	her body.

				KAREN
		I remembered the address. I followed 
		you --

	Blade shakes his head, amazed.

				BLADE
		Do you have a death wish or are you 
		just stupid?

	Karen pushes away from the wall, angry --

				KAREN
		Look, if what you say is true, if 
		there's a chance I could turn into one 
		of them, then I've got no choice, do 
		I? I have to work with you. I need to 
		learn everything I can about them. 
		It's the only way I'll be able to find 
		a cure for myself.

				BLADE
		There is no cure. 

				KAREN
			(defiant)
		You don't know that.

	Blade turns and moves to the end of the alley, studying the graffiti-
	covered wall intently --

				KAREN
		What are you looking at?

				BLADE
			(gesturing)
		What do you see here?

				KAREN
		Graffiti --

				BLADE
		Look closer.

	Blade indicates a design amongst the various gang-banger tags that
	looks something like a post-modern hieroglyphic.

				BLADE
		This isn't a gang tag, it's a vampire 
		marking. It means there's a safe-house 
		nearby. 
		A place they can go if dawn is coming. 

	Blade points to a building across the street --

	THE HOLLISTON CLINIC,

	your basic inner-city blood-barter establishment where desperate
	transients parley their plasma into cash.

				KAREN
			(recognizing it)
		I know this place -- it's a blood 
		bank. 

				BLADE
		Owned by vampires. There's one of 
		these in every major city, and just 
		like Domino's, they always deliver.
			(looking to Karen)
		You telling me you're ready to walk 
		through that door?

	Karen nods. Blade continues to stare at her, taking her measure --
	there's a strength in this woman's eyes, she has the soul of a
	fighter -- and Blade recognizes it. 

				BLADE
		All right, then, listen up, Vampire 
		Anatomy 101. Crosses and running water 
		don't do dick, so forget what you've 
		seen in the movies. 

	Blade enumerates the following on his fingers:

				BLADE
		You use the stake, silver, or 
		sunlight, got it? 

	Blade holds up one of his Casulls. 

				BLADE
		Know how to use one of these?

	Karen takes the weapon from him, eyes all over it.

				KAREN
		No.

	Blade takes the gun back, snorting derisively.

				BLADE
		Safety's off, round's already 
		chambered -- 
			(cocking it)
		Silver hollow-points filled with 
		garlic. You aim for the heart or the 
		head, anything else is a one-way 
		ticket to a pine box.

	Blade hand it to her again, then starts across the street towards the
	clinic. Karen follows --

	INT. HOLLISTON CLINIC, LOBBY - NIGHT

	Blade enters, swinging his rifle around for all to see.

				BLADE
		Get out. Now.

	The POTENTIAL DONORS scramble for the exit. Behind the counter,
	TANAKA, a male nurse, reaches for an alarm button. Blade vaults over
	the counter, aiming his rifle. 

				BLADE
		I know you're blood-running. Who's 
		your sponsor? 

				TANAKA
		I don't know what you're --

	POW! Blade backhands him across the face hard enough to loosen his
	teeth. Karen flinches, stepping forward -- 

				KAREN
		What if you've made a mistake?

	Blade pins Tanaka's head to the wall, turning it to the side --
	revealing the man's glyph. It's different than Gideon's, looking more
	like a Japanese kanji character.

				BLADE
		What's this? A birthmark?

	Blade grips Tanaka by his collar, shoving him through a doorway --

	INT. HOLLISTON CLINIC, SUPPLY ROOM - NIGHT

	Karen and Blade SEE supply cabinets, cots, a number of locked
	refrigeration units. Blade FIRES into the door handle of one of the
	units, tears it open -- the fridge is stacked floor to ceiling with
	plastic packets of blood.

				BLADE
			(to Karen)
		Still think we might be wrong?
			(to Tanaka)
		How much are you shipping?

				TANAKA
		Bite me!

	Blade opens FIRE, sweeping his rifle around the room, shooting
	everything in sight. Glass cabinetry shatters, ampoules and
	vacutainers go flying. Tanaka cowers, arms wrapped about his head.

	Blade stops shooting. He leans down towards Tanaka, placing the end
	of his rifle against the man's forehead. Tanaka looks like he's about
	to wet his pants.

				BLADE
		I've got a message for your masters -- 
		the night's no longer safe for their 
		kind.

	Blade pulls back his rifle, leaving a red indentation mark where the
	end of the rifle barrel pressed into Tanaka's skin. He starts towards
	the exit. Karen follows.

	CUT TO:

	INT. BLADE'S OLDS - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen return to the Olds. He keys the ignition, lets the
	engine idle. They're parked down the street from the blood clinic.
	Karen looks to Blade, confused --

				KAREN
		You let him go -- 
			(off Blade's nod)
		An hour ago you were ready to kill a 
		man for less, this one didn't even 
		talk.

				BLADE
		He will.

	Blade points --

	THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD --

	Tanaka rushes from the clinic, climbing behind the wheel of a Mustang
	parked nearby. He takes off -- 

	Blade follows the Mustang, CLICKING on a cell-phone scanner mounted
	on the dash. Numbers flash on the LCD screen as it searches for a
	signal, then locks onto it. We hear a DIAL TONE, then a number being
	dialed --

				AUTOMATED VOICE
			(filtered, on scanner)
		"You've reached a number that is no 
		longer in service. Please consult your 
		operator and try again".

				TANAKA'S VOICE
			(filtered, on scanner)
		It's Tanaka, PIN number 
		sixteen-zero-zero-nine --

	A "real" voice comes on the line:

				VOICE
			(filtered, on scanner)
		Yes?

	Karen looks to Blade, impressed. 

	INT. TANAKA'S MUSTANG - NIGHT

	Tanaka speeds, shouting into the speaker phone -- 

				TANAKA
		Get me Pearl! 

				VOICE
			(filtered, on speaker)
		Pearl is feeding --

				TANAKA
		Look, I'm not fucking around here! 
		That hunter Frost has been talking 
		about? He was just at the clinic. Tore 
		the goddamn place apart!

	EXT. THE BLACK PEARL - NIGHT

	Tokyo town. A black edifice, no windows, secured parking, no signage
	except for a purple neon scroll above the entrance -- a FLASHING
	KANJI, just like the glyph tattooed on Tanaka's neck.

	Tanaka's Mustang pulls into the parking lot. He climbs out, flagging
	away the valets, heads inside --

	WHIP PAN TO

	Blade's Olds stopping a few blocks down the street.

	INT. BLADE'S OLDS - NIGHT

	Blade kills the engine, studying The Black Pearl.

				BLADE
		Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place 
		is crawling with them.
			(pointing)
		See the valets over there? They're 
		vampires. So is the doorman.

				KAREN
		How can you tell?

				BLADE
		The way they move, they way they 
		smell --

	Blade continues to scan the area, pointing out a few more likely
	candidates --

				BLADE
		The whore on the corner, she's one 
		too. So are the two men standing under 
		the streetlight.

	Blade reaches into the back seat, retrieves his sword and a satchel.
	He snaps open his shotgun, loads it. Karen continues to study the
	vampires Blade identified.

				KAREN
		So many of them -- I still can't 
		believe they're real.

				BLADE
		There are worse things than vampires 
		out there.

				KAREN
		Like what?

				BLADE
			(pumping his shotgun)
		Like me.

	Blade reaches for the door --

	EXT. THE BLACK PEARL - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen climb out. He lets his shotgun fall within the folds
	of his longcoat and starts across the street -- only to be challenged
	by a HULKING DOORMAN at the entrance.

				DOORMAN
		I'm sorry, sir -- do you have an 
		invitation?

	INT. BLACK PEARL - NIGHT

	CRASH! The front door flies open as the Doorman's body sails through.
	Blade enters, Karen at his heels -- 

	The 'Pearl' is an all-hours strip club cum casino catering
	exclusively to Japanese zaibatsu clientele. Dimly lit, the air thick
	with cigarette smoke, deafening MUSIC. Go boards, pachinko machines,
	sexy little MANGA WAIFS in schoolgirl outfits doling out drinks --

	STRIPPERS writhe in the circular "pit" tables surrounded by HOWLING
	grab-ass men. But that's nothing compared to --

	The MAIN ATTRACTION,

	who's doing a bump and grind down the runway, shaking a body worthy
	of a schoolboy's wet dream. Her attire? A leather S&M face mask,
	nipple rings, 6-inch spikes, and a pair of panties to hide her
	modesty.

	Blade scans the room -- just in time to see Tanaka ducking into a
	back hallway. Blade pushes towards the rear of the club. Karen
	follows. 

	ON THE STRIPPER

	as she catches sight of Blade and freezes in mid-routine. The
	stripper pulls off her hood. Long black hair with a streak of white
	tumbles down her back -- it's Mercury. 

	INT. BLACK PEARL, HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen head past the bathrooms. At the end of the hall is a
	door marked "OFFICE". Just then, the Men's door opens, a DRUNK
	COLLEGE KID steps out, SEES Blade --

				KID
		Hey --

	Blade plants a hand over the kid's face, shoving him back into the
	bathroom as he kicks open the office door --

	INT. THE BLACK PEARL, BACK OFFICE - NIGHT

	Tanaka spins around, startled, tries to throw a punch -- 

	Blade traps Tanaka's arm, levering the man up and over. He CRASHES
	into a shelving unit, taking the whole thing down with him. Karen
	winces. Blade grabs a handful of Tanaka's hair, yanks his head up --

				BLADE
		Where's the entrance?!

				TANAKA
		I can't -- they'll kill me!

	Blade rips off his glasses and gives Tanaka an eyeful -- his irises
	pulse and glow. 

				BLADE
		I got news for you, butt-boy. You're 
		already dead. 

				TANAKA
			(terrified)
		Oh God, shit -- behind the bookcase --

	Blade drops Tanaka, moves to the bookcase. He searches the wall a
	moment, then finds a trigger. Hits it -- the bookcase slides aside,
	revealing a hidden elevator. As Blade moves to put his sunglasses
	back on --

	BLADE'S POV (IN THE REFLECTION OF HIS SUNGLASSES)

	We see Tanaka behind him, pulling a handgun out of a desk drawer,
	swinging it up --

	Blade unholsters one of his Casulls faster than any gunslinger in
	history. He FIRES over his own shoulder, BLOWING Tanaka back against
	the wall. 

	Blade puts his sunglasses back on, motions to the elevator, then nods
	to Karen --

				BLADE
		After you. 

	INT. THE BLACK PEARL, ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	The elevator descends. Then a tone CHIMES, signaling the end of the
	ride. The doors hiss open -- 

	INT. THE VAMPIRE ARCHIVES, HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen enter the narrow, maze-like "stacks" of the vampire
	archives, weaving their way through shelves of climate-controlled,
	digitized records. 

				KAREN
		What is this place?

				BLADE
		Some kind of archive --

				KAREN
		Isn't this all a little high-tech? I 
		thought vampires were more into 
		cobwebs and coffins.

				BLADE
		You've been watching too much TV. 
		They've got their claws sunk into 
		everything -- finance, real estate, 
		politics. Probably own half of 
		Downtown. 

	Blade pulls a CD-ROM from the shelves, its spine labeled in
	indecipherable vampire glyphs.

				BLADE
		This must be where they keep their 
		records --

	He pauses, hearing a DISTANT WHISPER. Blade signals quiet, silently
	leading Karen through the stacks towards -- 

	PEARL'S LAIR

	A vestibule of sorts, leading to a larger bed chamber constructed of
	rice paper shoji screens and tatami mats. Candles glow within,
	illuminating a MONSTROUSLY OBESE SHADOW beyond the translucent rice
	paper walls.

	The shadow speaks in a tremulous, bird-like voice -- the secret
	tongue. As Blade draws his sword, the massive shadow freezes --

				PEARL'S VOICE
			(frightened)
		Lorca, is that you?

	Blade slides open the nearest shoji screen --

	INT. PEARL'S BED CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Nothing Karen's seen up until this point could prepare her for the
	archive's curator --

	PEARL,

	a nine-hundred-pound androgynous vampire of Asian origin, lounging
	amidst pillowed rice mats, wearing a communications headset. Think of
	a cross between Divine and Jabba The Hutt. Skin the complexion of
	buttermilk, so corpulent he can barely move, so engorged with blood
	that he's actually sweating it from the pores of his skin. 

	Pearl is surrounded by a nest of monitors and keyboards which have
	been affixed to counter-balanced arms -- this way, Pearl can access
	information without leaving bed.

	Lying next to Pearl, dwarfed by the vampire's massive size, is the
	chalk-white body of a recently-drained NAKED BOY. 

	At the sight of Blade, Pearl's eyes widen in fear --

				PEARL
			(into a speakerphone)
		He's here!

				FROST'S VOICE
			(over speakerphone)
		Congratulations, Day-Walker.

				BLADE
		Frost?

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, POOL - NIGHT

	Frost paces the length of his pool, wearing a hands-free
	communications headset, grinning.

				FROST
		In the flesh, Blade. I understand 
		you've been looking for me. I'm 
		flattered.

	INT. PEARL'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

	As Blade listens, Pearl reaches for his trackball, attempting to
	delete the document currently on his monitors -- but Blade lunges
	forward, sinking the tip of his sword into Pearl's fleshy throat.
	Pearl freezes. 

				BLADE
			(eyeballing Pearl)
		Don't be. You're another notch on my 
		sword hilt, nothing else.

	Frost's DEEP LAUGHTER drifts from the speakerphone.

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, POOL - NIGHT

	Frost settles into his chair, enjoying the cat and mouse.

				FROST
		You're quick, Blade, I'll give you 
		that. In the space of an hour you've 
		crossed my familiar, destroyed a blood 
		bank --
			(beat)
		Now here you are in the heart of our 
		archives, terrorizing our curator.

				PEARL'S VOICE
		He has a knife to my throat, Frost! 
		He --

				FROST
			(cutting him off)
		You're history, Pearl. Have the good 
		grace to die with some dignity.
			(beat)
		Round one to you, Blade.

	INT. PEARL'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

	CLICK, the line goes dead. Blade tosses his satchel on the bed, opens
	it. Inside is a hand-held UV lamp hooked up to a nine-volt battery.
	Pearl eyes the device, fearful -- 

				PEARL
		What is that?

				BLADE
		A sun lamp. We're gonna play twenty 
		questions. Depending on your answers, 
		you might get to have yourself a 
		tanning session. 

	Blade looks to Pearl's monitor and SEES a digitized image, the SAME
	MANUSCRIPT Deacon had been studying earlier. 

				BLADE
		What were you in such a big hurry to 
		delete just now?

	Pearl hesitates. Blade turns on the lamp. Pearl HOWLS as the harsh
	light falls upon him. Blade flicks the light off.

	Pearl cringes, GROWLING, his face smoking profusely. Exposure to the
	UV rays, even for one short second, has made his face blister like a
	plague victim's.

				PEARL
			(relenting)
		It's an epistle, a letter Frost has 
		been translating -- it prophesizes 
		LaMagra's return.

				BLADE
		And who is LaMagra?

	Pearl hesitates again -- Blade turns on the lamp for a longer time.
	Pearl thrashes, covering his face. His hands blacken, the skin
	sizzling away to expose the finger bones beneath. Karen has to avert
	her gaze --

	Blade turns off the lamp. Pearl SNARLS, his body quivering with
	poisonous rage.

				PEARL
		LaMagra is The Sleeper!!! 

	Blade leans in close so he's eye to eye with Pearl.

				BLADE
		Where's the original, Pearl? You must 
		have it around here somewhere.

	Pearl sweats blood, his flaking, slug-like lips quivering. 

				PEARL
		The vault --

	Blade follows Pearl's eyes to an armored door, then he stands back,
	handing the UV rig to Karen.

				BLADE
		If he moves, cook him.

	Blade approaches the vault door, sizing up its locking mechanism. He
	pulls an explosive charge from his combat belt and secures it to the
	door, arming it with a BEEP!

				PEARL
		Please, I'll give you the combination 
		-- you'll damage the documents --

				BLADE
		That's the point.

	Enraged, Pearl LUNGES from his bed. Karen triggers the UV rig, flash-
	frying him to a blackened crisp. Pearl quivers, his enormous body
	smoking like a piece of charred meat. 

	Blade looks back at Karen with newfound respect. She shrugs.

				KAREN
		He moved.

	Blade turns back to the vault, setting off the charge. BOOM! Blade
	kicks the damaged door in, knocking it clear off its hinges --

	INSIDE THE VAULT,

	ancient papers flutter through the smoky air like wind-borne leaves.
	Blade and Karen SEE a lucite-encased document -- fragments of an
	ancient, calligraphied papyrus. 

				KAREN
		What are these?

				QUINN (o.s.)
		Curiosity killed the cat.

	Blade and Karen spin --

	-- QUINN,

	Mercury, and a number of other vampires stand at the entrance to the
	vault.

				QUINN
			(grins)
		Hola, amigo. Remember me?

	Karen triggers the UV light, but Mercury ducks under it, ripping it
	from her hands, crushing it. In a split-second, the she-demon has her
	claws around Karen's throat.

	As Blade reaches for his rifle, the vampires converge on him like
	quicksilver. They drag Karen and Blade out --

	PEARL'S BEDCHAMBER

	The vampires fling Blade against the wall, pinning him. 

				QUINN
		You took my arm, Blade. But that's 
		okay, I'm growing a new one --

	Quinn lifts up his "arm". A skeletal forearm has grown from the
	stump. It's got cartilage, sinew, and muscle, but no flesh yet. 

				QUINN
		Nice, huh? Think I'll ever play the 
		piano again?
			(shrugging)
		You can slice him, you can dice him, 
		and the man just keeps on coming. 

	Blade struggles violently, but Quinn is upon him, pounding his fist
	into Blade again and again and again -- giving him payback with
	compounded interest. When it's over, Quinn steps back, winded -- 

	Blade's head hangs down. He gasps, wincing, every breath sending a
	red hot poker to his gut. Quinn grabs a hold of Blade's jaw, forcing
	his head up. 

				QUINN
		Stay with me, sweetness, I'm not 
		through with you yet.

	Quinn pulls Blade's jacket open, sees the bandoleer of mahogany
	stakes. He tugs one out, admiring it.

				QUINN
		Teak. Nice craftsmanship. 
			(to the others)
		Now here's a man who takes his job 
		just a little too seriously, don't you 
		think?
			(back to Blade)
		Which reminds me, Blade, think I owe 
		you one --

	Quinn stabs the stake into Blade's shoulder. Blade CRIES OUT, tries
	to pull free. Karen, who's being held by Mercury, averts her gaze.

				QUINN
		Actually, if you want to get 
		technical, I owe you two.

	As Quinn reaches for another stake, Blade starts to laugh.

				QUINN
		What's so funny, bright eyes?

				BLADE
		I'm expecting some company.

	It's then that Quinn notices the micro ear-coil radio receiver in
	Blade's ear. As we MOVE IN on it, we hear a tiny VOICE squawking from
	it:

				VOICE
			(filtered)
		Get down!

	Blade kicks his feet out, sending Quinn flying backwards. He tears
	free of the vamps holding him and DIVES forward, knocking Karen to
	the ground just as --

	BOOM!!! The wall of Pearl's bedchamber EXPLODES INWARD, knocking
	Quinn and the rest of his cronies to their feet. 

	WHISTLER

	stands in the smoking hole where the wall used to be, brandishing his
	cane in one hand and an automatic rifle in the other. He balances the
	rifle against his hip like an over-the-hill gunslinger and OPENS FIRE
	on the vampires.

	Blade rolls, snatching up a fragment of the parchment which has blown
	free from the vault. Seconds later, he and Karen are fleeing after
	Whistler, retreating back through his newly created exit.

	INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

	The three of them find themselves ankle-deep in a flooded sewer
	tunnel running parallel to the archives. Whistler pauses, wheezing
	from overexertion. 

				WHISTLER
		Christ, I'm too old for this. Somebody 
		get me a goddamn wheelchair.

	Blade leans against the tunnel wall, GRUNTING as he yanks the stake
	from his shoulder. He then pulls out a light-stick, snapping it,
	illuminating the area in a GREEN GLOW -- disturbing waves of
	GLITTERING COCKROACHES. 

	Meanwhile, Whistler pulls another explosive device from his backpack
	and sets it against the tunnel wall, arming it.

				KAREN
		How did you find us?!

	Whistler taps a tiny radio headset curled around his ear.

				WHISTLER
		We keep in radio contact. 

				KAREN
			(incredulous)
		You've been listening in the whole 
		time?

				WHISTLER
		You think I'd let him run loose 
		without a chaperone? Blade ferrets 
		their rat-holes out, I map them. Then 
		we blow them all to kingdom come.

	Whistler finishes arming the explosive device. It BEEPS. He turns
	back to Blade and Karen, referring to a handheld navigation device.

				WHISTLER
		There's a subway line due East of 
		here. We'd best make tracks. 

	INT. PEARL'S BEDCHAMBER, ARCHIVES - NIGHT

	An EXPLOSION rips through the bedchamber, mushrooming outward --

	INT. BLACK PEARL - NIGHT

	The EXPLOSION continues expanding, sending tables, drinks, and
	zaibatsu clientele flying.

	INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

	As the group splashes through the water, a FIREBALL chases them down
	the tunnel. They duck into an alcove, narrowly avoiding the flames.
	Whistler WHOOPS with excitement, loving every minute of it. But his
	triumph is short-lived, for now we hear --

	-- a deafening chorus of HIGH-PITCHED VAMPIRE WAR CRIES coming from
	behind. Karen hazards a look back --

	THE VAMPIRES

	surge down the tunnel like a pack of hungry wolves on high-octane.
	There must be a dozen of them now and Quinn is right in the lead.

	Our trio hustles along, but Whistler stumbles, tumbling and sliding
	down a washout. The steep incline of the washout makes it virtually
	impossible for Whistler to climb back up to the main tunnel.

				KAREN
		Whistler!

				WHISTLER
		Go on, I'll be fine!

	Karen hesitates, but Blade yanks her down the tunnel --

				BLADE
		He can take care of himself! GO!!!

	They race through the twisting warren of tunnels, taking one turn
	after another, the vampires hot on their heels --

	INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen stumble out into a larger subway tunnel, which widens
	into a station stop up ahead. We can see the RED TAIL-LIGHTS of a
	train just pulling away from the platform -- Blade and Karen re-
	double their efforts, lungs burning, legs pumping like mad. Just as
	the train enters the next tunnel --

	-- they leap, dragging themselves up onto the back of the rear-
	passenger car. Blade SMASHES his fist through the emergency exit
	window, then lifts Karen up, helping her climb through into the
	car -- 

	-- but the vampires are still coming! Crawling along the tunnel walls
	on all fours, limbs a blur, claws striking the concrete and spewing
	out sparks. Closing fast. Too fast. 

	QUINN

	springs forward, snagging Blade's ankle with his "good" hand. The
	vampire's weight threatens to haul Blade down. Blade reaches to his
	back-scabbard, unsheathes his sword --

	THUNK! Blade brings the sword down on Quinn's good arm, cutting it
	off at the wrist! Quinn falls to the tracks, tumbling head over heels
	back into the darkness --

	THE AMPUTATED HAND,

	which continues to clutch at Blade's ankle, starts to melt. With a
	cry of disgust, Blade kicks the thing away. He turns and climbs
	through the window --

	INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT 

	Karen helps Blade inside. He sinks to the floor of the otherwise
	deserted car, exhausted. He's looking ashen now. The whites of his
	eyes are shot through with red.

	Karen gets a good look at Blade's wounds -- the front of his jacket
	is soaked in blood. She reaches for him --

				KAREN
		You're hurt --

				BLADE
		Nothing that won't heal by dawn.

	Blade reaches into his jacket and pulls out the small, gas-powered
	pistol-injector we saw Whistler inject him with earlier. He tries to
	load one of the ampoules into it, but because of his wounds, he's not
	having much luck -- 

				BLADE
			(frustrated)
		I need help with this --

	Karen nods, inserting the ampoule into the gun. Blade shrugs off his
	jacket, holds out his arm. Karen pauses --

				KAREN
		What am I injecting you with?

				BLADE
			(weakly)
		Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin 
		substitute.

	Karen locates a vein, presses the injector against it -- Blade
	tenses, grits his teeth, fights to keep his body thrashing as the
	serum enters his bloodstream. He grips the wall behind him --
	actually digs his nails into the metal surface -- the agony he's
	going through is excruciating, like nothing we could imagine. 

	When it's over, he slumps forward, spent, vulnerable, flushed with
	sweat. Karen stares at him --

				KAREN
		You're one of them, aren't you?

	Blade turns away from Karen, filled with self-loathing. 

				BLADE
		Not quite. I'm a hybrid. Half-human, 
		half-vampire.

	Off Karen's surprised reaction, we --

	CUT TO:

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

	The loading elevator CLANGS to a stop. Blade throws the gate open.
	Karen helps him out. Now that they're safely back, the last of
	Blade's strength seems to dissipate. 

	WHISTLER

	is waiting for them, sitting at a workbench. 

				WHISTLER
		What took you so long?

				BLADE
		Don't even start, old man.

	Blade throws his sword aside, then moves off into the shadows,
	disappearing beyond the curtains. Karen looks to Whistler --

				KAREN
		Why didn't you tell me the truth 
		about him?

				WHISTLER
		We weren't sure we could trust you.

	Whistler sighs, removing his glasses.

				WHISTLER
		Blade's mother was attacked by a 
		vampire while she was pregnant. 
		Ultimately, she died, but her unborn 
		child lived. Unfortunately, he'd 
		undergone certain genetic changes 
		while in the womb --

	Whistler reaches for a pack of cigarettes, pulls one out. He thumbs a
	match, fires up. Takes a long drag --

				WHISTLER
		I found Blade when he was thirteen. 
		He'd been living on the streets, 
		feeding off the homeless. Apparently 
		the Thirst manifested itself at 
		puberty -- 
			(beat)
		I took him for one of them at first, 
		almost killed him, too. But then I 
		realized what he was. 

	CUT TO:

	EXT. EDGEWOOD TOWERS, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

	Frost stands at the window, looking out at the glimmering cityscape
	before him.

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

	Frost turns away from window. Quinn, Mercury, and the other vampires
	from the Black Pearl stand before him. Quinn cradles his amputated
	stump with his newly grown arm. 

				QUINN
		He took my fucking hand! Again!

				FROST
		You seem to be in the habit of losing 
		them fairly often, Quinn. Maybe the 
		amputee lifestyle just suits you.

	The other vampires laugh. Quinn stares them into silence. 

				QUINN
		We need to find him, tonight.

	Frost claps a hand on Quinn's shoulder.

				FROST
		Down, boy. Blade's not going anywhere. 
		I promise. Right now, though, we've 
		more pressing business --
			(off Mercury's look)
		It's time Dragonetti paid the piper. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

	Whistler studies Karen, exhaling another lungful of smoke.

				WHISTLER
		Blade's unique, you know. A one in a 
		billion anomaly. He can withstand 
		sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he 
		still has the Thirst. 

				KAREN
		What happens if he doesn't take the 
		serum?

				WHISTLER
		The Thirst overcomes him, just like 
		the others. It's not something he can 
		control. 
			(sighs)
		The problem is, time's running out. 
		His body's starting to reject the 
		serum. And so far, all my efforts to 
		find a cure have ended in failure --

				KAREN
		No offense, Whistler, but you're not 
		exactly working with state of the art 
		equipment here. You might have missed 
		something.

				WHISTLER
			(pointedly)
		Which is why you're here. We could use 
		someone with your experience.

	A beat passes between them and Karen knows where she stands now. In
	for a penny, in for a pound. Whistler reaches for Blade's sword.

				WHISTLER
		This used to be mine, you know. It's 
		been passed down through the 
		centuries, from one hunter to the 
		next --

	Whistler extends the sword, sighting down the length of it. He takes
	a few practice parries -- it's obvious he used to be quite skilled in
	the art of swordsmanship.

				KAREN
		Why do you hunt them?

				WHISTLER
		Habit, mostly, just like this. 

	Whistler gestures with his cigarette. He finally stubs it out, his
	wistful reverie vanishing like so much smoke.

				WHISTLER
		I had a family once -- a wife, three 
		daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon 
		Frost came calling one evening --

				KAREN
		He killed them?

				WHISTLER
		Eventually. He toyed with them first. 
		He made me choose, do you understand? 
		Which order they would die in --

	Karen stares at Whistler, horrified.

				KAREN
		How did you escape?

				WHISTLER
		I didn't. He was cruel enough to let 
		me live.
			(slapping his brace)
		Even gave me a souvenir to remember 
		him by.

	Karen nods -- it's all falling into place for her now.

				KAREN
		And now you're using Blade to exact 
		your revenge?

				WHISTLER
			(pointedly)
		Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and 
		I'm not getting any younger, am I?

	Just then, we hear a SCREAM come from Blade's room, sounding more
	like the cry of a beast than a man. Karen takes a step towards
	Blade's room --

				WHISTLER
		I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
		It's best to leave him alone when he's 
		like this.

				KAREN
		I'll take my chances.

	INT. BLADE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Karen enters. It's dark, just a trace of moonlight.

				KAREN
		Blade?

	No answer. Then Karen SEES him -- crouched in the corner of the room
	like some kind of nocturnal animal.

				KAREN
		It's dark in here.

				BLADE
		You get used to the darkness.

	Karen takes a step towards him.

				KAREN
		Whistler told me about your mother. 

	Blade clutches the silver locket in his hand. It swings back and
	forth, like a pendulum.

				BLADE
		I can't close my eyes without hearing 
		her scream.

				KAREN
		Those aren't real memories. No one has 
		that kind of recall.

				BLADE
		I do. I remember from day one. People 
		staring at me, sensing I was 
		different. Watching the fear grow in 
		their eyes, knowing in their hearts I 
		wasn't human.

				KAREN
		If you're not human, then why do you 
		bleed like us? 
		I've seen vampire blood, you don't 
		have it running through your veins.

	Blade looks at Karen, his lambent eyes glowing in the moonlight.

				BLADE
		Just get out of here.

				KAREN
		Blade --

	Blade turns, his eyes glowing with preternatural fury. 

				BLADE
		I said, GET OUT!!!

	Karen backs away, startled by Blade's vehemence. She exits, leaving
	him alone with his demons. He holds up one of his empty serum
	ampoules, crushing it in his fist.

				FROST'S VOICE
		Rise and shine, little wing.

	EXT. THE BURNING GROUNDS - JUST BEFORE DAWN

	FADE IN on Dragonetti, his face covered with a black condemned man's
	hood --

	Frost stands before him, grinning like the Cheshire Cat. He's dressed
	from head to toe in a black motorcycle suit -- boots, gloves, a
	visored helmet tucked under one arm. Mercury and Quinn are standing
	nearby, similarly attired. 

	We're on a stretch of rocky coastline, tucked away in a secluded
	cove. Dragonetti has been stripped bare, chained like Prometheus to
	an ancient standing stone. 

				DRAGONETTI
			(straining)
		What is this? Where am I?!

	Frost steps forward, pulling Dragonetti's hood off. Dragonetti stares
	at his surroundings, horrified.

				FROST
		When was the last time you stopped to 
		appreciate a sunrise, Dragonetti? 
		Three, four hundred years? 

	Frost checks his watch, then looks to the ocean. On the horizon, a
	sliver of gold appears. 

				FROST
		How do you like that? Right on time.

				DRAGONETTI
			(snarling)
		The other elders will never let you 
		get away with this!

	Just then, the TWELVE VAMPIRE ELDERS emerge behind Frost, forming a
	circle around Dragonetti. All wear business suits, gloves, along with
	high-tech "sun masks" to protect their faces from the light's lethal
	rays. 

	They stare at Dragonetti like a silent jury. His face darkens, anger
	rising -- but there's a desperation in his eyes now too. He speaks in
	the secret tongue:

				DRAGONETTI
			(subtitled)
		Don't you see, you fools?! He'll 
		betray you too! He's planning on 
		invoking LaMagra himself!

	The vampires just smile and shake their heads.

				FROST
		The wheel turns, old fang. Guess you 
		just got a little too long in the 
		tooth.

	Dragonetti's cries are cut short as Frost forces the aging vampire's
	mouth open, ripping out his fangs with his bare hands. Dragonetti
	GURGLES and SHRIEKS, sounding like a dying animal.

	Frost turns to face the Twelve now, his eyes bright with victory. He
	pulls on his motorcycle helmet, as do Mercury and Quinn. 

	Behind them, Dragonetti struggles furiously against his chains to no
	avail as the first faint rays of daylight fall upon him, channeled
	inward by the natural formation of the cove -- 

	Dragonetti HOWLS, his skin beginning sizzle and smoke. Then he
	catches fire like paper beneath a magnifying glass. He thrashes about
	as his flesh starts to run from his body.

	THE VAMPIRE ELDERS

	watch, impassive, protected by their masks --

	-- when suddenly, TWELVE FIGURES rise up behind them, clad in bike
	helmets and black leather, just like Frost. The intruders grip each
	of the Elders in a strangle hold, ripping their masks off. 

				FROST
		Dragonetti was right. You were fools 
		to trust me.

	Frost flips down the visor of his helmet even as --

	THE RED SUN

	rises in all its fiery glory.

	One by one, the vampire Elder's heads catch fire, skullflesh sizzling
	away -- burning down the line of them in successively building
	intensity until all twelve EXPLODE in a conflagration of BLINDING
	WHITE LIGHT.

	Frost and his compatriots are blown off their feet by the sheer
	intensity of the occult blast -- a blast which sends the skeletal
	bodies of the Elders SLAMMING into the rock wall.

	When it's over, Frost picks himself back up. We SEE that the only
	thing left of Dragonetti and the others are --

	THIRTEEN SHADOW SILHOUETTES

	permanently etched onto the rock's surface, just like the bombing
	victims of Hiroshima. 

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAY

	Karen stands at a lab table with Whistler, preparing a number of
	blood sample vials. They are surrounded by host of new medical
	equipment -- from centrifuges to genetic sequencers and beyond.

	Blade emerges from his room, looks to Karen. As if by silent
	agreement, last night's words go unacknowledged. He straps on his
	bandoleer of stakes, secures his scabbard.

				WHISTLER
		Going somewhere?

				BLADE
		China Town. I need more serum.
			(re: new equipment)
		What's all this?

				KAREN
		I made a trip to the hospital last 
		night, borrowed some equipment.

				BLADE
			(sarcastic)
		For your miracle cure? 

				WHISTLER
		She's been making real progress, 
		Blade.
			(to Karen)
		Show him --

	Karen looks to Blade, who shrugs. She opens a refrigerator, removing
	a syringe filled with blue fluid.

				KAREN
		This is sodium citrate. It's an 
		anti-coagulant. We use it to treat 
		blood-clots sometimes. Vampire blood 
		is thinner than humans, though. Watch 
		what happens when I introduce some 
		into a sample --

	Karen gestures to the microscope. Blade takes a look --

	BLADE'S POV

	Vampire blood cells swirling about.

	Karen injects the contents of the syringe onto the slide of cells --
	the reaction is immediate. The vampire blood turns black, then begins
	violently bubbling.

	Blade lifts his head away from the microscope just in time -- the
	blood on the slide atomizes, exploding outward in a fine mist which
	bursts apart the glass lens of the scope. 

	Whistler laughs, thrilled with the results.

				WHISTLER
		Can you imagine what a dash of that 
		would do on your sword? 

	Whistler claps his hand on Karen's shoulder in approval, then limps
	away, quickly busying himself with another project. Blade moves to
	follow, but Karen stops him --

				KAREN
		Before you go, I'd like to take a 
		sample of your blood.

	Blade grudgingly rolls up his sleeve. As Karen takes her sample,
	Blade looks to Whistler. The older man brings a handkerchief to his
	lips, coughing into it. 

				KAREN
		Is he sick?

				BLADE
		Cancer.

	Karen watches as Blade's blood flows into the vacutainer. She fills
	the first, then inserts another. 

				KAREN
		You care about him, don't you? 

				BLADE
		We've got a good arrangement, that's 
		all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use 
		them, the vampires die -- end of 
		story.

	Karen finishes. Blade rolls up his sleeve.

				KAREN
			(pointedly)
		My mother used to say that a cold 
		heart is a dead heart.

				BLADE
		Your mother sounds like a Hallmark 
		greeting card. 

	Blade slips his Casulls into a shoulder holster, then shrugs into his
	leather jacket, donning his sunglasses.

				BLADE
		I'd wish you luck, Doc, but I never 
		put much stock in optimism.

	He heads towards the elevator.

	EXT. CHINATOWN, STREETS - DAY

	Blade makes his way down a street lined with vending stalls --
	passing MERCHANTS peddling exotic vegetables and cheap curios,
	butcher shops with rows of roast ducks in the window, tyro GANG-
	BANGERS lounging at the entrance to a video arcade.

	BLADE'S POV

	Even though the streets are crowded, the people seem to make way for
	him, avoiding eye-contact. 

	Blade turns into a dark alley, ducking into the doorway of a hole-in-
	the-wall herbalist shop.

	INT. HERBALIST SHOP - DAY 

	A bell atop the door JINGLES, announcing Blade's arrival. We're in a
	dusty, cave-like room filled with baskets and bottle-lined shelves
	featuring things like "Toad Spleen Extract" and "Barking Deer Wine".
	Joss sticks burn, sending wispy tendrils of incense into the air. 

	At the back of the shop, an elderly CHINESE MAN in a cardigan sits in
	front of a battered television, watching a boxing match. He's eating
	a bowl of litchi fruit. On the counter nearby, a SPIDER MONKEY
	watches attentively. 

				BLADE
		How's it going, Kam?

				KAM
			(re: calendar)
		You're a week early.

				BLADE
		I was in the neighborhood.

	Kam sets his fruit bowl aside, leads Blade through a curtain into a
	back room.

	INT. HERBALIST SHOP, BACK ROOM - DAY

	Kam hands Blade a leather valise. He opens it -- its lined with tiny
	ampoules of scarlet-colored serum. Blade pulls one out, holds it up
	to the light.

				BLADE
		Whistler says I'm building up a 
		resistance to it.

				KAM
		I was afraid that might happen.

				BLADE
		Maybe it's time to start exploring 
		other alternatives.

				KAM
		There's only one alternative to the 
		serum.

	Blade nods. They both know what that "alternative" is. 

				BLADE
		Yeah. I know.

	Blade closes the valise and tucks it inside his jacket. 

				BLADE
		Thanks, Kam.
			(thinking)
		One other thing. Have you ever heard 
		of a vampire called the Sleeper?

	Kam shakes his head. Blade pulls out the parchment he took from
	Pearl.

				BLADE
		I found this in there archives. I need 
		to find someone who can read their 
		language. 

	Kam studies the parchment.

				KAM
		I've heard about a woman named 
		Miracia. Some say she's a mayombero, a 
		Santeria witch. Supposedly she lives 
		in that tent community down by the 
		city dump. I'm told she only sees 
		people at night. 

	Blade nods his thanks and heads back through the curtains.

	EXT. CHINATOWN, STREET - DAY

	Blade emerges from the alley into the sunlight, then hears his name
	WHISPERED on the wind.

				VOICE (o.s.)
		Blade.

	Blade spins, scanning his surroundings -- did he really hear his
	name, or was it just the wind?

				VOICE (o.s.)
		Blade.

	Again, the taunting voice calls him. Blade's gaze finally settles
	on --

	A MAN

	sitting on a bench in the deep shade, his face obscured by the
	Chinese newspaper he's reading. There's a LITTLE GIRL sitting stiffly
	beside the man -- a look of pure terror written on her face. 

				MAN
		Afternoon, Blade.

	The man lowers his newspaper. It's Deacon Frost. He's wearing
	sunglasses, but otherwise, he's seemingly unprotected by the sun. 

	Blade reaches for his .454 -- 

				FROST
		Easy.

	Frost's hand rests on the back of the girl's neck. We see his claws
	extend, caressing the flesh beneath her chin.

				FROST
		Wouldn't want our little friend here 
		to wind up on the back of a milk 
		carton, would we? 

	Blade reluctantly lowers his hand. Frost smiles. He takes in a deep
	breath of air, savoring it. 

				FROST
		Beautiful day, isn't it? 

				BLADE
			(confused)
		How can you be out here?

				FROST
		I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical 
		research. We've developed a type of 
		sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a 
		few others things. 

	On closer examination we see that Frost is wearing a translucent
	lotion on his face. He touches a finger to his cheek, rubs some of
	the lotion between his fingers.

				FROST
		It's not very effective in direct 
		sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, 
		of course, is to be like you, "the 
		Day-walker". 

				BLADE
		I don't buy it.

				FROST
		Why not? The future of our race runs 
		through your bloodstream. You've got 
		the best of both worlds, Blade. All of 
		our strengths and none of our 
		weaknesses.

				BLADE
		Maybe I don't see it that way.

				FROST
		Oh, so it's back to pretending we're 
		human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle 
		Tom routine. You can't keep denying 
		what you are. You're one of us, Blade. 
		You always have been.

				BLADE
		You're wrong.

				FROST
		Am I? You think the humans will ever 
		accept a half-breed like you? They 
		can't. They're afraid of you. 
			(pointedly)
		The humans fear us because we're 
		superior. They fear us because in 
		their hearts they know their race has 
		become obsolete.

	Frost watches the marketers stream past, sneering in contempt. 

				FROST
		Look at them, just an endless stream 
		of cattle in a mad race to the 
		slaughterhouse. 

	Frost lifts a silver flask to his mouth, taking a swig of blood. He
	smacks his lips, sighs contentedly --

				FROST
		The pause that refreshes --
			(offering it to Blade)
		Care for some? Smells good, doesn't 
		it? Pungent, with just an 
		irrepressible hint of iron. 

				BLADE
		Pass.

				FROST
		You sure now? I bled a newborn for 
		this. You won't find a drink that's 
		sweeter. 

	It takes every ounce of Blade's self-control to keep from attacking
	Frost -- and Frost senses this, pressing his sharp thumbnail against
	the child's jugular.

				FROST
		Tell me honestly, do you really get 
		the same rush from that pasteurized 
		piss-serum of yours?
			(off Blade's look)
		You're surprised I know about your 
		serum? You shouldn't be. I know 
		everything about you. 

	Frost leans forward, grinning.

				FROST
		You can't keep walking the razor's 
		edge, Blade. The day will come -- and 
		soon, when you'll have to choose 
		between our kind and their's. If I 
		were you, I'd take care not to wind up 
		on the wrong end of the fang.

	A bead of sweat runs down Frost's neck, washing away a minute amount
	of the sun-blocking cream. The patch of exposed skin instantly
	blackens. Frost gazes upwards at the sun.

				FROST
		Love to continue this chat, but it 
		appears I'm melting.

	Frost rises, taking the little girl by the hand. Blade follows, his
	hand resting on the butt of his Casull.

				BLADE
		You're not going anywhere.

				FROST
			(growling)
		Watch me.

	Frost's eyes flicker towards the street -- a CITY BUS is rumbling by.
	In a heartbeat, Frost hurls the little girl forward --

	-- out into the path of the oncoming bus! 

	Blade has a split-second to act. It's Frost or the girl -- and for a
	moment we actually think he's going to go for Frost --

	-- but then he DIVES forward, scooping the girl into his arms,
	throwing themselves out of the bus' path. The bus misses them by a
	hair. By the time Blade looks up again --

	-- Frost is gone. Blade rises, cursing, scanning the street as
	market-goers gather around him.

	WHIP PAN TO --

	SOMEONE sitting astride a motorcycle, watching Blade from the roof of
	an elevated parking garage. The rider is clad from head to toe in a
	helmet and black leather -- Mercury. 

	EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

	Blade's Olds cruises into the gated grounds. It zips down the ramp
	way into the loading elevator.

	BACK BY THE TRAIN TRACKS --

	Mercury's cycle rolls into frame. She picks up a radio handset and
	keys it.

				MERCURY
			(into radio)
		This is Mercury. Tell Deacon I've 
		found their hiding place.

	CUT TO:

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAY

	Blade enters through the loading elevator, finding Karen and Whistler
	hard at work. She turns as he approaches -- SEES him back-lit by the
	sun. She looks pale, the whites of her eyes are streaked with red.

				BLADE
		Any progress?

				KAREN
		Some. It's been slow --

				BLADE
		You don't look so good. 

				KAREN
		I'm just tired, that's all. We've been 
		up all night.

	Blade nods, not buying her explanation. He shoots a glance to
	Whistler, which doesn't go unnoticed by Karen.

				KAREN
		Excuse me.

	Karen turns, heading for the back of the workshop.

	INT. WORKSHOP - BATHROOM - NIGHT

	Karen enters a dingy bathroom, turning on the overhead bulb. She
	studies her reflection in the mirror above the sink, then grimaces as
	she peels the dressing from her wound -- the wound is clearly
	infected, gangrenous. 

				BLADE (O.S.)
		It's started.

	Karen spins, startled. Blade stands behind her. He grips her jaw,
	turning her head so he can better view the wound.

				BLADE
		You've got another day or two at most.

	Karen nods, shaken. As she moves to leave, Blade reaches for her arm,
	stopping her.

				BLADE
		For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

				KAREN
		You make it sound like I'm already 
		dead.

	Blade just stares at her. Finally, she pulls away.

	EXT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DUSK

	CLOSE ON Karen as she moves to the grimy outer windows, watching the
	sun go down, an unmistakable look of dread creeping over her.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. LANDFILL GHETTO - DUSK

	Windy. Urban desolation. Blade stands on the perimeter of a sprawling
	cardboard and plywood squatter's ghetto which has sprung up around
	the city dump. CHILDREN and DOGS forage for salvageable items, while
	in the distance, dumptrucks grind over the dunes of refuse.

	MOMENTS LATER,

	Blade is winding his way through the maze of makeshift homes and
	ashcan fires. A CROWD quickly closes in around him, suspicious. A
	BRUTISH MAN steps forward, challenging him --

				MAN
		Extranjero. ¿Quien es?

				BLADE
		I'm here to see Miracia. Kam sent me.

	The man turns to his fellow squatters, WHISPERING. After a heated
	debate, a GAUNT WOMAN steps forward, motioning --

				WOMAN
		This way.

	CUT TO:

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

	Whistler and Karen sit at a work table. Karen is looking at a blood
	smear slide through a microscope. 

				KAREN
		All right, let's start with the basics 
		-- why do vampires need to drink 
		blood?

				WHISTLER
		Their own blood can't sustain 
		hemoglobin. 

				KAREN
		Then vampirism is a genetic defect, 
		just like Hemolytic anemia?

	Whistler nods.

				KAREN
		So what about gene therapy?

	Whistler looks intrigued. Karen continues.

				KAREN
		Basically you'd have to re-write the 
		victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA 
		will produce proteins capable of 
		generating hemoglobin. 

				WHISTLER
		How?

				KAREN
		With a retrovirus. It's injected into 
		the bone marrow cells, it causes the 
		host's DNA to mutate. They've been 
		using them to treat Sickle-cell 
		anemia. 

	Whistler can hardly believe what he's hearing.

				WHISTLER
		You're serious? You actually think 
		this could work?

	Karen pauses -- we can see in her expression that there's something
	she's been holding back.

				KAREN
		On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so 
		sure -- 
			(gravely)
		The problem is, Blade didn't contract 
		the vampire virus from a bite like I 
		did. He was born with it. The irony 
		is, I could probably cure every 
		vampire but him.

				WHISTLER
		Then we're back to square one, aren't 
		we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always 
		wins.

	At that moment, the lights in the workshop flicker, then go out.
	Karen looks around the room, alarmed. 

				KAREN
		What happened to the power?

				WHISTLER
			(concerned)
		I don't know, but the back-up 
		generator should've kicked in.

	A few seconds pass. The back-up generator still hasn't activated.
	Whistler moves to the window --

				WHISTLER
		UV floodlights are down too.

	As Whistler reaches for a flashlight we hear the sound of GLASS
	SHATTERING coming from the other end of the workshop. Whistler shines
	the flashlight in that direction. We hear more sounds now -- water
	draining, glass tinkling.

	Whistler raises a finger to his lips, signaling silence. He edges
	towards the black-out curtains, Karen falling in behind him.

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - TANK ROOM - NIGHT

	Whistler and Karen enter, cautious --

	THE TANK

	containing the vampire child has been smashed open. It's empty now,
	with just the steadily draining blood seeping across the floor in a
	widening pool -- and a trail of tiny BLOODY FOOTPRINTS leading back
	out into the main workshop.

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

	Karen scans the shadows, eyes alert. We hear a WHISPER, then a
	teasing, childish, GIGGLE.

	Whistler moves the flashlight in a slow circle, shining the beam over
	every inch of the room. And just as he's about to complete his
	circuit --

	THE CHILD

	leaps from where it had been hiding overhead! Karen SCREAMS.
	Whistler is knocked to the floor, the flashlight spinning from his
	hand --

	The feral child lands atop Whistler, HISSING like a cobra. Its
	macrocephalic head seems to morph, twisting into grotesque
	proportions. And just as it's about to strike --

	ZZZZING! Whistler withdraws a silver rapier which had been hidden
	inside his cane. He lunges forward --

	WHOOSH! The child takes off like a blue streak, sending test tubes
	and medical equipment CRASHING to the floor. It zips past Karen --

				WHISTLER
		Get it!!!

	Karen snatches up the flashlight, chasing after it as Whistler
	struggles to his feet --

	Karen sweeps the flashlight around, catching only fleeting glimpses
	of the child as it darts through the workshop. She reaches a shelving
	unit where Whistler's weapons are stored, grabs one of the modified
	pistols --

	Karen tries to draw a bead on the creature. She FIRES, misses, FIRES
	again -- she's getting more unnerved as the seconds tick by and the
	creature is moving closer and --

	-- suddenly it's right in front of her, flying through the air, fangs
	bared! 

	The child knocks Karen back against the wall. It's at her throat,
	sinking its claws into her neck. Karen chokes, forcing Whistler's
	pistol under the monstrosity's chin --

	-- but then the creature morphs again, transforming into a beatific
	little cherubim of a child -- and Karen hesitates, because the child
	seems so goddamned human now and its eyes are luminous, pulsing and
	hypnotic and --

	-- suddenly Whistler reaches in from behind, YANKING the vampire
	child's head back, FIRING a pistol into its skull. The creature
	slumps --

	Karen cries out, disgusted, flinging the corpse away from her. As it
	continues to writhe --

	THUNK! Whistler swings his cane-rapier down on the creature, brutally
	decapitating it. Finishing the job. Then he looks to Karen, winded.

				WHISTLER
		Understand this -- they are monsters. 
		Hesitate for even a moment, and you've 
		lost.

				FROST (O.S.)
		Words to live by, Whistler.

	Whistler spins, eyes wide. He knows that voice.

	DEACON FROST

	steps into the pool of illumination thrown off by the flashlight,
	followed by Mercury and Quinn. 

				FROST
		It's been a long time, hasn't it, "old 
		friend"? 

	EXT. LANDFILL GHETTO - MIRACIA'S CABIN - NIGHT

	Blade is led to a plywood cabin crowded with candle-lit altars --
	garish pictures of Saints and demons abound, alongside bottles of
	roots and herbs steeped in alcohol, human bones, voodoo dolls. 

	MIRACIA 

	sits on a sagging couch outside, clutching a deck of well-thumbed
	Bicycle playing cards. She's ancient, with a mouthful of gold-capped
	teeth and cataract-clouded eyes. Blind.

				MIRACIA
		Is something wrong, my friend?

				BLADE
		You're blind --

				MIRACIA
		There are other ways to see. Sit.

	Blade approaches, uneasy. Miracia deals out the playing cards on a
	rickety table, setting them in nine piles which take on a cross
	formation. 

				MIRACIA
		Perhaps you have brought me something 
		-- an offering for the orishas?

	Blade tosses a handful of bills on the table. Miracia nods, then
	flips over the first card in the center pile -- a one-eyed Jack. She
	sighs, grave --

				MIRACIA
		Hold out your hands.

				BLADE
		I didn't come here to get my palms 
		read. I need something translated.

				MIRACIA
		Show me.

	Blade removes parchment fragment from his jacket and sets it on the
	table. Miracia traces her fingers over the ancient paper, touching
	her fingertips to her lips.

				MIRACIA
		Sangre. Written in blood. 

	She runs her hands over each line as if it were written in Braille.
	Some of the candles gutter, then extinguish themselves as the wind
	around them rises.

				MIRACIA
		This is an old tongue, from an old 
		world. It concerns LaMagra.

				BLADE
		Who is LaMagra?

				MIRACIA
		The vampire God. This speaks of His 
		return.

	Miracia's fingers search the parchment again.

				MIRACIA
		"-- there will come a Day Walker."
			(reading)
		"His blood will call the Sleeper from 
		beyond the Veil of Tears."

	Blade stares at Miracia, shaken.

				BLADE
		His blood -- ?

	The old woman nods, reaching for a smoldering cigarette.

				MIRACIA
		The Day Walker's blood is a disparador 
		-- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's 
		return. One need only consume it and 
		the spirit of his ancestors will 
		settle upon him.
			(reading)
		"And the Sleeper will rise from the 
		shadows anew, cleansing the world in a 
		Tide of Blood."

				BLADE
			(recalling the phrase)
		"The Blood Tide".

				MIRACIA
			(nodding)
		Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is 
		said that all who feel its taint will 
		succumb to the Thirst. 

				BLADE
		How do I stop it?

	Miracia shrugs, spreading her hands.

				MIRACIA
		The Great Wheel turns, my friend. The 
		Dark is rising. How would you fight a 
		shadow? 

	Miracia sits back, slumping into her chair. The candles have burnt
	themselves down to nothing. 

				MIRACIA
		I am tired. Dawn is coming. 

				BLADE
		But I just got here --

				MIRACIA
		You've been here longer than you 
		think. 

	Blade rises, looking to the horizon. Incredibly, dawn is coming. As
	he stands there, mystified, the wind picks up, sweeping the parchment
	fragment out of his hand. He tries to snatch it back, but the
	fragment is quickly borne away. He watches it disappear into the sky,
	then turns back --

	Miracia is gone. Blade glances around him, but she's nowhere to be
	found. 

	CAMERA PULLS BACK,

	isolating Blade amidst the ghostly squalor. From our vantage point,
	he looks like any other homeless phantom.

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAWN

	Blade steps out from the elevator into the workshop --

	The place has been trashed. It looks like a tornado touched down in
	his absence. Blade pulls out one of his .454s, cautious --

				BLADE
		WHISTLER?!

	-- and then he stops dead in his tracks.

	WHISTLER

	has been strung up by his arms against the far wall, tortured and
	left for dead. In response to Blade's voice, a MOAN escapes the dying
	man's lips.

	Blade rushes to the wall, cutting Whistler down with his sword,
	gently lowering him to the floor. As he cradles the old man in his
	arms, Blade sees the primary wound -- two ragged puncture marks along
	Whistler's throat.

				BLADE
		Jesus, Whistler, what did they do to 
		you?

	Whistler opens his eyes, struggling to speak --

				WHISTLER
		Frost took her --

	Whistler spasms and coughs, wincing from the pain.

				BLADE
		Don't try to talk --

				WHISTLER
		Listen. You have to -- finish me off. 
		You don't want me coming back.

				BLADE
		No, we can treat the wounds --

	But Whistler is shaking his hand.

				WHISTLER
		Too far gone, you know that.

	Blade's at a complete loss.

				BLADE
		Whistler, I can't.

	Whistler clutches at Blade's arm, his eyes burning with conviction.

				WHISTLER
		Yes you can. Now get on with it. 

	As much as he'd like to deny it, Blade knows that Whistler is right.
	He pulls a stake from his bandoleer, hesitates.

				BLADE
		Whistler, I --

				WHISTLER
			(cutting him off, more gentle now)
		I know. 
			(forcing a smile)
		Just be quick about it, will you? Do 
		it right.

	Blade fights back tears. With a wretched moan, he turns his head and
	drives the stake into Whistler's chest. Whistler GASPS. Blade wraps
	his arms around the older man, holding him tight as the life runs out
	of him, rocking back and forth --

	After a while, the rocking stops and Blade lays Whistler on the
	floor. Then something catches his eye --

	A SHARP VIEW-CAMCORDER

	resting nearby, labeled, "PLAY ME". Blade reaches for the camcorder,
	cues the tape -- Frost's face appears on the tiny built-in screen.

				FROST
		Hello, Blade. By the time you watch 
		this, Whistler will no doubt be 
		winging his way to Heaven, thanks to 
		your capable hands. If it makes any 
		difference to you, he put up quite a 
		fight.

	Frost touches a deep gash which runs across his cheek.

				FROST
		Now, I'm sure you're wondering about 
		Ms. Jansen's well-being. She's alive 
		and kicking -- "ambulatory", as they 
		like to say in the trade. Whether or 
		not she remains so is entirely up to 
		you.
			(beat)
		I'll make this as easy as possible for 
		you, Blade. You can find us at the 
		Edgewood Towers. We'll be waiting with 
		baited breath.

	The tape cuts to static. Blade throws the camcorder against the wall.
	It shatters into a dozen pieces.

	Blade turns now, his eyes falling on the medical equipment Karen
	brought from the hospital. He moves to the refrigerator, removing a
	canister labeled "SODIUM CITRATE". Then he draws his sword. We can
	practically see the wheels turning within his mind --

	MOMENTS LATER,

	Blade stands before the open flames of one of the furnaces, heating
	his sword in the fire. He withdraws it -- it's molten red.

	Blade turns, dousing the molten hot sword into the sodium citrate
	canister. The refrigerated liquid reacts with the heat, causing the
	sword to STEAM and HISS.

	When Blade withdraws the smoking sword, we SEE that the gleaming
	steel has changed colors, taking on a bluish tinge, just like the
	sodium citrate it was immersed in. Blade smiles to himself,
	satisfied.

	CUT TO:

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, INNER CHAMBER - DAY

	Sparse decor in a Neo-Japanese vein. Minimalist lighting. The walls
	are glass. Recirculating pumps send a constant stream of water
	cascading down them.

	Karen is escorted into the room by Mercury. She gestures to a chair
	at the end of a long table. Karen sits. 

	FROST 

	leans forward out of the shadows, resting his elbows on the table,
	hands steepled together. 

				FROST
		Well, here we are, Doctor.

	A cigarette appears in Frost's hand. In the blink of an eye, the
	cigarette is lit, burning. The movements are so quick we barely have
	time to register them. 

				KAREN
		Why haven't you killed me yet? 

				MERCURY
		Deacon likes to play with his food 
		before he eats it.

	Frost laughs. Karen tries to keep calm. The longer she keeps them
	talking, the longer she remains alive.

				KAREN
		How many of you are there?

				FROST
		A few thousand scattered about the 
		globe. In the past, we've had to 
		restrict our numbers for fear of 
		discovery. That won't be necessary 
		after tonight. 

				KAREN
		What happens then?

				FROST
		The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied 
		holy war against the humans. There's a 
		force, you see -- a spirit that exists 
		in our blood. I've discovered a way to 
		invoke it.

				KAREN
		LaMagra --

				FROST
		That's right. The answers were there 
		all along, of course, scribbled down 
		in the forgotten languages of my kind. 
		Waiting for someone with the patience 
		to decipher them. 
		My elders were foolish enough to 
		dismiss them as wives tales. But I 
		knew better. 
			(beat)
		Imagine my surprise when Blade turned 
		out to be the key which would set that 
		force free. 

	Frost sits forward now, impassioned.

				FROST
		LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a 
		spirit, requiring a flesh and blood 
		host in order to manifest himself.

				KAREN
		You.

				FROST
		Who better to usher in the Blood Tide? 

	Karen shakes her head, protesting --

				KAREN
		There's no need for any of this. Your 
		condition can be treated. Whistler and 
		I were working on a cure when --

				FROST
		What makes you think we want to be 
		cured? Blood is only part of the 
		equation. The hunt, the killing, 
		that's what the Thirst is really 
		about.

				KAREN
		But you use blood banks --

				FROST
		Only as a last resort. Preserved blood 
		is inferior. There's no flavor left to 
		it, no life. 
			(rising from his seat)
		Fortunately, I've found a way around 
		that particular obstacle. 

	Frost moves to the end of the room. He pushes a button. With a HUM
	the wall slides open, revealing something Karen wishes she'd never
	seen -- living blood banks.

	THREE SEDATED HUMANS

	have been hooked up to IV feeds which replenish various nutrients as
	their blood is drained from them. Shunts have been implanted in their
	forearms which serve as taps. 

				FROST
		Under these conditions I can keep a 
		donor alive for years, producing 
		anywhere from fifty to a hundred pints 
		of blood.
			(admiring his charges)
		Of course, this is just a pilot 
		program, really. Once the Tide comes, 
		we'll need to expand production. So 
		many more mouths to feed -- 

	Karen turns away, overwhelmed by revulsion. 

				KAREN
		You're a monster.

				FROST
		Why? Because we live at another 
		species' expense? Your people farm 
		cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening 
		them up with steroids? It's called 
		evolution, Doctor. Survival of the 
		fittest. 

	Frost stares at Karen with an intense, uncompromising gaze. 

				FROST
		I have a wake-up call for the human 
		race. You're no longer at the top of 
		the food chain.

	EXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOFTOP - DAY

	BLADE'S POV

	A telephoto view of Frost's penthouse. The windows are polarized,
	blocking out the sun's harsh rays.

	Blade lowers a pair of binoculars. He's standing on the roof of a
	building across the street. He hefts an air-launcher rifle up into
	firing position --

	BANG! An iron spike trailing a steel cable rockets through the air
	between the two buildings, sinking into the concrete facade of
	Frost's penthouse. Blade secures his end of the rope. He slips a
	pulley over the rope, grabs hold of two handles, and leaps off the
	roof ledge!

	WHOOSH! Blade slides towards Frost's penthouse, a good twenty stories
	above street level. A second before he reaches the windows, Blade
	lets go. Momentum sends him CRASHING through in a shower of glass.

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - DAY

	An ALARM is ringing. Sunlight streams in through the broken window.
	TWO VAMPIRE GUARDS who have been caught in the sudden swath of light
	are burning up before our eyes. Blade climbs to his feet --

	A THIRD VAMPIRE

	leaps at him. Blade spins, flipping the vampire over his shoulder,
	sending him straight through one of the other windows --

	EXT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - DAY

	The vampire tumbles earthward, SCREAMING as the sun's rays ignite his
	body, falling like a human comet.

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - DAY

	Blade unsheathes his sword and heads out into the hall --

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, HALLWAY - DAY

	To Blade's right is the inner chamber with the "waterfall" walls. As
	ANOTHER VAMPIRE approaches, Blade readies his sword --

				VAMPIRE
		You think I'm afraid of that toothpick 
		of yours?

				BLADE
		You should be. I've made some 
		improvements.

	And with that, Blade thrusts his blackened sword forward, right
	through the vampire's chest. 

	The creature SHRIEKS and atomizes -FWOOSH!- flying apart in a fine-
	beaded spray of blood mist. 

	Up ahead are a set of steel doors with a time-lock mechanism. Blade
	draws a Casull, BLASTS away at the lock, then shoulders the doors
	open --

	INT. FROST'S SLEEPING CHAMBER - DAY

	We are in a windowless, vault-like room dominated by a series of
	high-tech STAINLESS STEEL SARCOPHAGI. Think of a hyperbaric coffin, 
	each unit possessing a small face-plate window through which the 
	sleeping subject can be viewed.

	Blade unsheathes his sword. He grabs the lid of the first
	sarcophagus, HEAVING upward. With a PNEUMATIC HISS, the lid rises,
	belching out a cloud of condensation mist. 

	As the mist clears, revealing the occupant within, Blade raises his
	sword, ready to plunge it downward -- only it's not Deacon Frost who
	rests beneath him, it's --

	VANESSA,

	Blade's mother!!! Although some thirty years have passed since the
	events of our prologue, Vanessa looks exactly the same -- vibrant,
	beautiful, full of life. Her eyes open.

				VANESSA
		Jason. 

	Blade gasps, uncomprehending.

				BLADE
		Mother -- ?!

	Vanessa rises from the sarcophagus, tears staining her cheeks.

				VANESSA
		I've missed you so much, Jason. 
			(drawing closer)
		You have no idea what I've been 
		through, how much I've wanted to see 
		you -- 

	Blade falters, his mind reeling. What he's seeing is incomprehensible
	-- his mother is dead. Yet, here she is in the flesh, reaching out to
	him and --

	-- flashing a mouthful of viper-like fangs! She SNARLS and strikes,
	brutally raking her claws across Blade's face, knocking the sword
	from his grasp --

	A TRIO OF BLACK-CLAD VAMPIRES

	led by Mercury step from the shadows where they'd been waiting all
	along. They're armed with tasers which they fire en masse --

	Blade is hit by the taser darts from all sides. He writhes as
	electricity courses through him, then collapses in a heap. He labors
	to lift his head, looking up at Vanessa -- 

				BLADE
		But you -- died --

				VANESSA
			(a hellish smile)
		Deacon brought me back. 

				BLADE
		Fight him --

	As if on cue, Frost appears at Vanessa's side, wrapping a proprietary
	arm about her waist, kissing the nape of her neck. She leans into him
	-- an act of practiced intimacy.

				FROST
		She can't. She's one of my thralls 
		now. She has about as much free will 
		as a puppet on a string.
			(looking at Vanessa)
		You love me, don't you, Vanessa? 

				VANESSA
		Yes.

	Frost kisses Vanessa hungrily. Then he kneels and reaches into
	Blade's jacket, retrieving a vial of Blade's serum.

				FROST
		What do we have here? Your precious 
		serum? I don't think you'll be needing 
		this anymore.

	Frost crushes the vial in his fist. Blade struggles to reach Frost,
	stretching a palsied hand upwards --

				BLADE
		Please -- 

				VANESSA
		Listen to your father, Jason. It's 
		going to be a better world.

	Blade stares at Vanessa uncomprehending. 

				FROST
		Don't look so surprised, Blade. You've 
		spent your life looking for the 
		vampire who fathered you. Well you can 
		rest easy now, you've found him.
			(gripping Blade's chin)
		Daddy's here.

	Blade's eyes widen in shock. Frost simply laughs.

				FROST
		It's true, Blade. You've got my blood 
		running through your veins.
			(smiling)
		Thirty years ago. A moonlit street, a 
		woman on her way home alone. You were 
		conceived the night I tore my fangs 
		into your mother's flesh. 

	Frost swings his fist into Blade's skull. Everything goes black. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. ARMORED TRUCK - NIGHT

	FADE IN as Blade opens his eyes, still groggy, his face beaded with
	sweat. Feverish. His hands have been bound tightly behind his back
	with manacles and chains. 

	KAREN

	sits nearby, watching him. From the steady rocking motion and the
	SOUNDS of traffic outside, it's evident that they are in the back of
	a moving truck.

				KAREN
		Are you all right?

				BLADE
			(weakly)
		I've been better --

				BLADE
		How long have we been driving?

				KAREN
			(shaking her head)
		I don't know. I woke up just before 
		you did --

	As he struggles to sit up, she crosses over to him. Blade shuts his
	eyes for a moment, fighting a wave of pain.

				KAREN
		Is it bad?

				BLADE
			(nodding)
		We get out of this alive, maybe I'll 
		take that miracle cure of yours.

	Karen doesn't respond. Instead she looks away. How in the world is
	she supposed to tell him this?

				KAREN
			(quietly)
		It won't work on you.

				BLADE
		What are you talking about?

	Karen forces herself to meet his gaze.

				KAREN
		Your condition's congenital, the 
		genetic mutations occurred in utero. 
		All the other victims contracted 
		vampirism after birth. 

	Blade stares at Karen, disbelieving. Who could imagine a more
	horrifying irony? She's crying now. She can't help it.

				KAREN
		I can't cure you, Blade. I can cure 
		myself, but I can't cure you.
			(beat)
		I'm so sorry.

	Blade's head sinks, the last vestiges of hope draining out of him.

	And then, as if the final stake were being pounded in, the truck
	lurches to a stop. We hear the ENGINE being killed, then FOOTSTEPS
	approaching, and then a series of BOLTS BEING SHIFTED as --

	-- the back of the truck is thrown open. Frost stands there,
	grinning, flanked by Mercury, Quinn, Vanessa, and a half-dozen other
	VAMPIRE ASSOCIATES. 

				FROST
		Welcome home, children.

	EXT. THE BANK OF EREBUS - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen are dragged from the back of the truck, which is
	revealed now to be an armored car. 

	THE BANK OF EREBUS

	rises up before them. A towering beaux-arts edifice situated in the
	heart of the city's high-priced financial district -- one of the many
	institutions owned and operated by the vampire enclave.

	Frost starts up the marble steps towards a grand, triple-arched
	entrance flanked by Corinthian columns. Karen and Blade are dragged
	along after him. 

	INT. BANK OF EREBUS - ATRIUM - NIGHT

	Frost leads his vampires into a high-ceilinged atrium, moving towards
	a bank of elevators -- one of the doors of which is outfitted with a
	high-tech hand-key ID system.

	Frost places his palm on the ID screen. The screen GLOWS GREEN,
	acknowledging his identity. In response, the doors HISS open.

	INT. SECURITY ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen are pulled inside the elevator. The control panel
	buttons have vampire glyphs, rather than numbers. Frost presses the
	bottom one. The doors close with a WHOOSH and the car descends --
	down, down, down.

	Frost glances over at Karen, smiling amiably.

				FROST
		On its surface, this building houses 
		one of the city's oldest financial 
		institutions -- and for over 
		two-hundred years its served our 
		corporate needs. Look beneath the 
		surface, however, and you'll discover 
		another truth entirely --

	The elevator CHIMES, having arrived at its destination. The doors
	HISS open, revealing 

	INT. THE TEMPLE OF NIGHT 

	A vast, barrel-vaulted chamber lined with recessed tombs stretches
	out before us -- an underground cathedral of sorts, wrought from
	alabaster and marble. Restrained. Elegant. Replete with dark
	splendor.

				FROST
		As above, so below.

	Torches burn in wall sconces, casting everything in a warm, amber
	glow. Frost takes in the beauty of the place.

				FROST
		Welcome to our hall of ancients, 
		Doctor. We call it the Temple of 
		Night.

	Blade and Karen are led to the middle of the room, where a stone
	altar rises up from a dais. Blade is roughly thrown to the ground. He
	kneels there, eyes cast downward. Broken. His system being assaulted
	by the devastating effects of the Thirst. 

	Quinn and Mercury pick their way through Blade's discarded gear.
	Quinn picks up the punching dagger, admiring it. 

	Frost turns to Mercury, who's been holding Blade's scabbarded sword.

				FROST
		Let's see this sword of his.

	Mercury draws the sword, handing it to Frost. He sights down the
	length of it, testing its weight. With a flick of his wrist, he
	lashes out, slashing Blade's cheek open. 

				FROST
		Still quite sharp, I see.

	Blade feebly struggles to rise. Frost clubs him on the back of the
	neck with the sword pommel. Blade crumples. Karen tries to pull free,
	but Quinn holds her tight.

				KAREN
		Blade --

				FROST
		You're wasting your breath, woman. He 
		can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, 
		you see? It already has him in its 
		grip.

	Frost reaches down, dragging Blade's head up by his hair. Karen
	watches on as Frost continues to taunt him.

				FROST
		How long has it been since you had 
		your serum? Twelve hours? More? You 
		must be quite thirsty by now.

	He crouches down so he's eye to eye with Blade.

				FROST
		What does it feel like? Is your blood 
		on fire? Are you burning up inside? 
		Give in to the Thirst, Blade. Embrace 
		your true nature.

	Blade shivers, grits his teeth, it's like he's going through heroin
	withdrawal. 

				BLADE
		-- go to hell --

	Frost smiles, his eyes burning with an infernal glow.

				FROST
		I've got news for you, Blade. We're 
		already here.

	Frost turns to the others, motioning.

				FROST
		Take him to the sanctuary. It's time 
		he was bled.

	The other vampires retreat, dragging Blade along with them. Karen is
	left alone with Frost and Quinn.

				FROST
		I'd let you watch the proceedings, 
		Doctor, but I'm afraid that privilege 
		is reserved for members of my own 
		race. Don't worry, though, I've made 
		alternate arrangements for you.

	Frost motions and Quinn drags Karen towards --

	THE MOUTH OF A PIT

	some forty feet deep, its lichen-encrusted stone walls worn smooth
	over time. As Frost gestures to the yawning darkness beneath them,
	Quinn forces Karen towards the edge. 

				FROST
		We call this the Bone Pit. It's where 
		we keep our mistakes, the ones who 
		couldn't successfully make the 
		transition from human to vampire. 

	Frost reaches out, caressing Karen's neck, puncturing the soft flesh
	beneath her chin with a razored fingernail.

				FROST
		They'll feed on anything, given the 
		chance -- animals, corpses, even other 
		vampires.

	Frost nods. Karen struggles against Quinn, but it's no good. In a
	manner of seconds, she's falling --

	INT. BONE PIT - NIGHT

	-- making a decidedly rough landing on a heap of bones far below. She
	GROANS, taking stock of her battered body.

	UP ABOVE,

	Deacon watches from the lip of the pit, amused. 

				FROST
		Of course, a strapping young woman 
		like yourself -- well I think you just 
		might be considered finger food.

	And with that, he's gone, stepping away from the pit.

	INT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - BLEEDING CHAMBER - NIGHT

	We are in a small, elevated antechamber which is situated above the
	main vampire sanctuary.

	BLADE, 

	now weakened to the point of collapse, is being lashed to a rack-like
	device by iron chains. 

	Mercury and her cohorts move efficiently, quickly securing him. When
	they are through, the rack is hoisted up into the air via a series of
	winch-driven chains. 

	With every turn of the winch crank, the chains are drawn tighter,
	causing Blade to CRY OUT, until at last, he is suspended in mid-air,
	spread-eagle. 

	FROST

	approaches, still carrying Blade's sword.

				FROST
		It's been a long road, hasn't it? Such 
		a pity Whistler led you so far astray. 

	Frost cocks his head to the side, studying Blade's face.

				FROST
		I don't blame you, though. I want you 
		to know that. Even after all you've 
		done. I understand, Blade, I really 
		do. It's the human side of you which 
		has corrupted your reasoning, made you 
		weak. But we'll take care of that, 
		won't we?

	Blade struggles to lift his head, forcing himself to match Frost's
	gaze, shaking with hatred.

				BLADE
		I'd kill myself -- before I turned 
		into something like you.

	Frost just smiles and shakes his head.

				FROST
		No you wouldn't. I'm going to bleed 
		you dry, Blade. All the poison that 
		makes you human. 
			(drawing closer)
		When the Tide comes, you'll be begging 
		me put you through the Change. 

	Frost lifts up Blade's sword, methodically slitting Blade's wrists
	one by one. He makes the cuts lengthwise, opening up the cephalic and
	basilic veins with surgical precision.

	Blood wells up from the fresh wounds, running down Blade's forearms,
	collecting in a cistern beneath his feet. 

	Frost watches the steady, inexorable process, then nods, satisfied.
	He looks to the others who are gathered behind him, watching on with
	silent reverence.

				FROST
		It's done. We should ready ourselves 
		for the ritual of invocation.

	Frost leads Mercury, Quinn, and the others from the sanctuary.

	Blade struggles futilely against his bonds, crying out in
	frustration, his body eventually sagging from exhaustion. 

				VANESSA (O.S.)
		There's no use fighting us, Jason. 

	Blade looks up, focusing now on --

	VANESSA, 

	who has remained behind. Blade stares at her. As terrible as his
	physical torment is, his mother's betrayal is infinitely worse.

				BLADE
		How could you be a part of this?

				VANESSA
		These are my people now. I'm one of 
		them.

				BLADE
		You don't have to be. 

				VANESSA
		You don't understand. I've killed, 
		I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it. 

	She draws closer, caressing her son's face. There's just a hint of
	creepy eroticism in her action, a dash of incest. 

				VANESSA
		I wish you could see the world as I 
		do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no 
		turning back from that.

				BLADE
		I don't believe that.

				VANESSA
		You will. Time is on our side. Sooner 
		or later, the Thirst always wins.

	Vanessa turns away now. Blade cries after her --

				BLADE
		Mother!

	Vanessa pauses, looking back, smiling cruelly.

				VANESSA
		Your mother died the night you
		were born. 

	And with that, she's gone, melting into the shadows. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. THE BONE PIT - NIGHT 

	Karen rises, wary, taking in her shadowed surroundings. 

	HEAPS OF HUMAN BONES

	are piled against the pit walls -- skulls, rib-cages, femurs, tibias
	-- all picked clean of flesh. Some of the skulls have large, canine-
	like fangs -- the remnants, no doubt, of long-deceased vampires.

	Suddenly we hear a WHISPER of sorts, the soft CLINKING of bone
	fragments grinding together --

	Karen spins, trying to place the source of the sound. Then she hears
	the SOUND again. Behind her now, closer.

				REVENANT (O.S.)
		Karennnnn --

	Karen looks up with a growing sense of dread.

	A FACE

	emerges from the darkness. Pallid, cadaverous, shedding its
	desiccated flesh. Lidless eyes like black marbles slick with
	Vaseline. A mouth like a raw wound. 

				REVENANT
		Karreennnnnn. I never thought I'd see 
		you againnnnn.

	Karen backs away, realizing who she's standing before.

				KAREN
		Curtis?!

	What used to be Curtis SNARLS, knocking Karen back into the drift-
	pile of bones. It pins her to the ground, kneeling above her,
	gurgling through its gutted trachea.

				CURTIS REVENANT
		Tell, me, Karennn -- ever have second 
		thoughts -- about us?

	Karen SCREAMS, trying to force the revenant away from her, but it
	lunges closer, lolling its distended tongue over her mouth in a
	pathetic approximation of a French kiss.

	She fumbles behind her, choking, grabbing hold of a human femur,
	blindly swinging it upward --

	CRACK! The blow shatters the Curtis-thing's jaw. It rears back,
	falling to the side. 

	Karen crawls out from under its weight, swinging the femur again and
	again --

	CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Karen pummels the howling horror, driving it
	back until the femur actually splinters in half. The creature's head
	hangs at an awkward angle now, its neck broken -- but still it
	advances, dragging itself back up.

	Sobbing, Karen retreats, clutching the splintered femur like a
	makeshift dagger.

	Curtis charges at her, a blur of slashing claws. At the last moment,
	Karen ducks, thrusting the bone dagger up into Curtis' chest --

	Curtis impales himself, right through the heart. For one split-
	second, his eyes widen in surprise --

	-- and then he goes into a death-spasm, vomiting up a spray of
	caustic vampire blood-bile, spattering Karen. She sinks to her knees,
	GASPING, as the thing that used to be Curtis shrivels up, melting
	away into burbling puddle.

	After a beat, Karen rises and moves to the pit wall, running her
	hands over the lichen-slick surface, searching for a way out. The
	mortar between the brickwork is ancient, crumbling. 

	Karen looks to the ground, reaching for one of the splintered femurs.
	She pounds it into the mortar between two bricks -- and it holds,
	working as a makeshift piton.

	Karen reaches for another broken femur, lodging it a foot above the
	first. She hauls her body up now, suspending her weight from the two
	makeshift pitons. Again, they hold.

	Trembling from exertion, Karen pulls the right piton free, hanging
	solely from her left hand now. Though her handhold is precarious, she
	manages to swing the right hand up again, pounding that piton another
	foot above the left.

	In this slow, torturous manner, Karen begins to climb her way up out
	of the pit.

	INT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - BLEEDING CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Blade hangs from his chains, head slack, eyes half-lidded and
	lusterless. His skin has grown ashen as his life's blood has been
	bled away.

	Mercury appears before him, accompanied by Quinn. She bends in close
	to kiss Blade lightly on the lips.

				MERCURY
		It won't be long now, lover. 

	Quinn draws alongside her, hefting Blade's punching dagger. He places
	it against Blade's throat, slowly applying pressure. At this point,
	Blade's too weak to even resist.

				QUINN
		We should finish him off.

				MERCURY
			(shaking her head)
		No. Deacon wants him turned.

	Quinn releases Blade, disgusted. 

				QUINN
		Fucking waste, if you ask me.

	As Mercury and Quinn exit, the CAMERA DROPS DOWN to the cistern
	beneath Blade's feet. We follow the blood which has collected there
	as it flows into a crude drain and --

	INT. SANCTUARY - NIGHT 

	-- emerges from the ceiling of the sanctuary below. The stream of
	blood is directed down the channels of a spiral column, where it
	finally pools into a waiting chalice.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	the sanctuary in full. A large circular chamber, the perimeter of
	which is lined with recessed alcoves housing the remains of the
	vampire ancients, set into the sanctuary walls like cells in a hive.

	DEACON FROST

	stands in the center of the chamber, allowing Vanessa to clothe him
	in ceremonial regalia -- gleaming, centuries-old armor. He pauses,
	kissing her hungrily.

	Having finished suiting up, he turns to face the vampires who have
	been faithful to his cause -- Mercury, Quinn, a host of others. A
	hush settles upon them. There's an excitement in the air, a sense
	that something remarkable is about to happen.

				FROST
		Tonight is the night we've waited our 
		entire lives for. Tonight, the 
		blood-dimmed Tide is loosed upon the 
		world. Tonight, the Age of Man comes 
		to an end. 

	The vampires bellow out a CHORUS OF CHEERS, their voices resonating
	off the stone walls like thunder. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - BONE PIT - NIGHT

	Karen's hands appear over the lip of the bone pit. She heaves herself
	up, collapsing onto the floor --

	-- but there's no time to rest. Even now she can hear the VAMPIRES
	CHEERING. She drags herself to her feet, letting the voices guide
	her.

	CUT TO:

	INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

	Karen slips around a corner, guarded, searching. She SEES Blade
	strung up before her, seemingly lifeless.

	Karen studies the chains which bind Blade, following them back to
	their source at the winch. She releases the brake on the winch crank,
	sending the chains RATTLING down through the overhead pulleys which
	suspend them. 

	Blade crumples to the floor, lying still. Karen is at his side in an
	instant --

				KAREN
			(whispering, urgent)
		Blade.

	Blade's eyes flicker open, fixing on her. Inhuman. He's shaking
	like an alcoholic going into delirium tremens.

	INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	Vanessa hands Frost the chalice containing Blade's blood. He lifts it
	up for all to see. The vampires begin to chant en masse, some long-
	forgotten invocation in the vampire tongue.

				FROST
			(grinning, to himself)
		"And what rough beast, its hour come 
		round at last, slouches towards 
		Bethlehem to be born?"

	Frost lifts the chalice to his lips and begins to drink. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

	Blade tries to sit up, gripping Karen's wrist --

				BLADE
		Get out of here --

				KAREN
		I'm not leaving without you.

				BLADE
		You don't understand. The Thirst --

	He clutches his stomach, experiencing phenomenal pain.

				BLADE
			(gasping)
		-- tearing me -- apart.

				KAREN
		I know. Take some of my blood.

				BLADE
		No --

				KAREN
		It's the only way. You know that. 
		We'll never get out of here alive if 
		you don't.

	Blade suppresses a shudder. Simply keeping himself from attacking her
	takes every ounce of his resolve.

				BLADE
		I can't -- I won't be able to stop --

				KAREN
		Yes you will. The human side of you is 
		stronger. I know it is.

	Karen matches Blade's gaze, steeling herself. The truth is, she's
	terrified. 

	Blade stares back at her. At this moment, he wants what Karen is
	offering more than anything he's ever desired. And so he rises --

	CUT TO:

	INT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	Frost continues drinking down the blood, when suddenly, a force
	seizes his body. He throws his head back, eyes rolling to white,
	flinging the chalice aside.

	And as the vampire incantation reaches a fevered pitch, we SEE the
	stone tomb tablets off the vampire ancestors beginning to judder --
	as if some force within were trying to break free --

	CUT TO:

	INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

	Karen turns her head to the side, baring her neck, offering herself
	to Blade. Blade opens his mouth. His canines elongate. He lowers his
	head --

	-- and starts to feed. Karen involuntarily stiffens as Blade's teeth
	puncture her skin and we --

	CUT TO:

	INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	Frost shakes, possessed by an unseen force. A wind picks up from
	nowhere, swirling about the chamber, accompanied by a strange
	HUMMING. 

	Suddenly, one of the tombs BURSTS OPEN. A WRAITH-LIKE SPIRIT rushes
	outward in a fountain of light, penetrating Frost's body.

	Then ANOTHER TOMB SPLITS APART. Then ANOTHER, and ANOTHER -- until a
	torrent of SPIRIT-WRAITHS are surging into Frost, buffeting him about
	like a scarecrow in a cyclone.

	Mercury, Vanessa, and the other vampires back away, apprehensive,
	humbled by what they're witnessing.

	CUT TO:

	INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

	Blade moans, sinking his teeth deeper. Karen's head rolls back. Her
	eyes open -- glassy, unseeing -- as a wave of ecstasy overtakes her. 

	She shudders, her breath quickening, falling into a synchronous
	rhythm with Blade's. Her fingers dig deep into his back, clawing
	downward, tearing into him -- 

	She's not Karen anymore -- she's a red blood cell, an erythrocyte,
	spinning in a river of plasma, roaring up Blade's femoral artery,
	racing towards the pumping chambers of his heart which beats like the
	deafening breath of God, which blots all other sounds out of
	existence and we're --

	CUTTING BACK AND FORTH NOW

	between Frost's transformation and Blade's, each of them growing
	stronger by the second, caught in an ever-increasing feedback loop of
	expanding energy until --

				BLADE
		NO!!!!

	Blade tears himself from Karen, his pulse racing as -- 

	CUT TO:

	INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	-- the invocation of LaMagra reaches critical mass. Frost is consumed
	by a hellish force, unable to withstand the onslaught of spirit
	energy any longer. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

	-- Karen clawing at Blade, tears streaming down her cheeks.

				KAREN
		Don't stop --

	But Blade grips her by her shoulders, shoving her back. Karen stares
	at Blade, wide-eyed, as if waking from a trance. She touches the raw
	wounds on her neck, shaken --

				KAREN
		My God --

	Blade rises to his full height. His strength has more than returned,
	it's been doubled by the infusion of real blood. And there's
	something else in his gaze now too -- an animal fury that was missing
	before. Blade has taken one giant step closer to the darkness. 

				KAREN
			(hesitant)
		Are you -- all right?

	Blade pulls at the chains manacled to his wrists, SNAPPING them apart
	like toys. He flexes his hands -- fingernails lengthening to tapered
	points. And he smiles, offering us a view of his canines, which have
	elongated into fangs.

				BLADE
			(near-demonic)
		Never been better.

	INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	The aftermath. Smoke hangs heavy in the air, occluding the area where
	Frost had stood. As it dissipates, Mercury and the others creep
	forward, apprehensive --

				MERCURY
		Deacon?

	FROST

	stands with his back to us, his body trailing wisps of occult fumes.
	As he slowly turns, we catch a glimpse of his eyes -- burning with an
	awesome, inner fire. 

				FROST
		No longer.

				BLADE (O.S.)
		Frost!!!

	All heads turn --

	BLADE 

	stands at the balcony overhead, Karen at his side. He leaps from it,
	somersaulting down to the floor below, landing on his feet like a
	predatory cat.

				BLADE
		Who dies first?

				FROST
			(growling, to the others)
		Take him.

	Quinn GROWLS, stepping forward, armed with Blade's punching dagger.
	He offers his second "new hand" up for view. 

				QUINN
		Grew another hand for you sweetmeat --
			(tossing the dagger to his new hand)
		-- and now I'm gonna kill you with it.

	Quinn charges. Blade meets the vampire head-on, dropping into a low
	kick and sweeping the vampire's legs out from under him. He spins
	behind Quinn -- 

				BLADE
		Let's see if you can grow a new one
		of these!

	Blade hooks a finger through the metal ring at the end of his jacket
	sleeve, pulling out a retractable strangle-wire which he twists
	around Quinn's throat. 

	Blade tightens the wire, decapitating Quinn. The headless body
	staggers about, then drops to the cavern floor. Blade scoops up his
	punching dagger --

				BLADE
		Next?

	Mercury and the other faithful vampires charge en masse. Blade
	launches a spinning wheel kick into the first vamp's face, SNAPPING
	its neck --

	Mercury has Blade's .454 Casulls. She aims them at him --

				MERCURY
		Have a taste of your own medicine!

	As she FIRES, Blade tucks and rolls, knocking one of the guns from
	her hand. The guns spins across the floor, where it's scooped up
	by --

	KAREN,

	who takes aim at an approaching vamp, BLOWING it away.

	Meanwhile, Blade traps Mercury's other hand, disarming her, flipping
	her over his shoulder. He hefts his Casull, BLASTING her into
	eternity --

	A bloodbath ensues. Blade moves like speed-personified, FIRING off
	one, two, THREE HEADSHOTS with brain-numbing accuracy, cutting down
	the vampires where they stand. 

	It's an orgy of gunpowder smoke and showering bodily fluids and
	-CLICK-CA-CHING-CLICK!- Blade and Karen have spent their bullets
	and --

				FROST (O.S.)
		Enough!!!

	Blade turns to face --

	FROST, 

	who's advancing, clutching Blade's own sword in his hand. He thrusts
	the sword forward --

	Blade presses the grip-trigger on his punching dagger -CHING!- the
	two side blades spread out. We hear the RASP and CLANG of metal on
	metal as Blade manages to trap the sword-point between two of the
	dagger blades --

	For a moment, both men are eye to eye, their weapons locked together,
	then, Frost forces Blade backwards --

	What happens next is the most blindingly-fast sword fight ever
	exposed to celluloid. Both men, fueled by super-human speed, lunge
	and spin across the cavern floor in a blurred ballet of lethal moves.

	Frost lands a powerful blow on Blade's shoulder, the sword-edge
	biting deep into the flesh. Blade SCREAMS. Frost withdraws the sword
	for another strike --

	-- until Blade sees an opening and takes it, slicing Frost's left arm
	off at the shoulder --

	The severed arm releases Blade's sword, but the arm doesn't fall! To
	Frost and Blade's mutual surprise the arm floats in mid-air, bleeding
	red, quivering like zero-G liquid, then SLURPING back to Frost's arm-
	stump to re-attach itself!

	Undaunted, Blade slices the punching dagger into Frost's mid-section,
	meeting only liquid-like resistance. The moment Blade withdraws his
	dagger, Frost's flesh seals itself up again.

	Blade hesitates now, uncertain -- and Frost laughs, understanding
	what has happened.

				FROST
		You're too late, Blade. I'm already 
		changing. Don't you see? The Sleeper 
		has awakened. I'm not just Frost 
		anymore. I'm becoming a god now, 
		blood incarnate.

	Even as Frost utters the words, his body begins to ripple and morph,
	bleeding red, taking on the characteristics of liquid. He doesn't
	walk so much now as flow. He's become a three-dimensional creature of
	animated blood! A blood demon.

	ON KAREN,

	as she watches Frost's transformation, wide-eyed. She SEES Blade's
	discarded sword, reaches for it -- suddenly, a SHADOW moves on the
	periphery of her vision --

	VANESSA

	rushes at Karen in a near-blur. The SNARLING hellion is upon Karen in
	an eye-blink, SLAMMING her down against the temple floor, pinning
	her. 

				VANESSA
		Did you think I'd forgotten you, you 
		little whore?

	BACK TO FROST,

	who towers above Blade, swaying back and forth in his new, liquid-
	like form.

				FROST
		You can't hurt me anymore. 

	WHOOSH! Frost rises upwards on a spiraling column of blood, HOWLING
	WITH LAUGHTER, then just as suddenly --

	-- splashes back to earth, spreading out in a widening pool. In the
	blink of an eye, he streams through Blade's feet, re-solidifying
	behind Blade. Blade spins, swings his dagger --

	Once again, Frost morphs into blood-form. He races around Blade in a
	series of spouting arcs, turning from blood-form to solid and back
	again in a series of split-second transformations.

	Blade whirls, striking with his dagger and missing every time --

	WHOOSH! Frost suddenly dissipates, SPLASHING away into a million
	zero-G blood bubbles, vanishing. Blade spins, unnerved, trying to
	pin-point his foe's next manifestation.

				BLADE
		Where are you?!

	Frost's voice answers from all directions.

				FROST
		Everywhere.

	A DROPLET OF BLOOD

	spatters the floor at Blade's feet. Blade looks up --

	A SHOWER OF BLOOD

	rains from above, coalescing into Frost as he sweeps down on Blade
	like a giant bird of prey, crushing him against the temple floor. 

				FROST
		You want my blood so much?! Take it!

	Frost's arms elongate and liquefy, flowing into two snake-like spouts
	of blood -- the rest of Frost remains solid. The blood-spouts twist
	around Blade's neck, melding together, completely encasing Blade's
	head in a bubble of blood.

	Blade claws at the blood-bubble as if it were a solid object that he
	could dislodge, but his fingers just pass through it!

	BACK TO VANESSA

	as she wraps a hand around Karen's throat, choking her.

	As Karen struggles, she frees a hand, sliding it down to her hip
	pocket, digging something out -- Whistler's vampire mace canister!

	She forces it up between them, triggering a jet of TOXIC MIST into
	Vanessa's face --

	Vanessa recoils, HOWLING, her head smoking as if it were doused with
	formic acid, skin sloughing off from her skull. Karen lunges for
	Blade's sword --

	BACK TO FROST AND BLADE

	Blade is drowning in Frost's blood. His eyes bulge. Oxygen bubbles
	stream from his mouth. Frost leans in close, his face a twisted mask
	of insanity.

				FROST
		I was wrong about you, Blade. You were 
		never one of us. You're a traitor to 
		your race. 

				KAREN (O.S.)
		Get away from him!

	Frost looks up -- Karen is wielding Blade's sword. She brings it down
	on Frost, severing the blood-tendrils which envelope Blade. The
	blood-bubble dissolves instantly, flowing away from Blade's face. He
	gasps, chokes in air --

	Frost backs away, horrified. His blood-tendrils don't reform.
	Instead, the lay where they fell, solidifying into crystalline
	powder.

				KAREN
		Blade!

	Karen flings the sword at Blade. 

	THE SWORD 

	spins end over end, its mirrored surface reflecting coruscating
	pinwheels of candlelight as Blade catches the weapon by its hilt.

	Blade rises, advancing on Frost, sword outstretched and Frost
	retreats, uncertain now.

				BLADE
		Guess you're not quite as invulnerable 
		as you thought.

				FROST
		You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and 
		my transition will be complete. Even 
		your sword won't be able to affect me 
		then.

				BLADE
		You don't have a few minutes, Frost.

	Frost eyes Blade warily, then lunges towards Vanessa, sweeping behind
	her. Blade follows, but even as he raises his sword to strike, Frost
	spins Vanessa around, using her body as a shield!

	Blade hesitates, stopping the sword in mid-strike, catching his
	mother's gaze -- her face is monstrous now, scarred by Karen's
	poisonous mace. Piteous, really. 

	Frost smiles, for he's found a final weakness of Blade's to exploit.

				FROST
			(laughing cruelly)
		Just as I thought. Still chained to 
		your mother's breast after all these 
		years.

	In the same instant, Vanessa's features morph, taking on the angelic,
	youthful vibrancy she possessed in the locket photo.

				FROST
			(gloating)
		You're too human, Blade. 

				BLADE
			(steeling himself)
		It's because I'm human that I can do 
		this.

	Frost's eyes widen in shock, but he has no time to react, for --

	Blade is already LUNGING forward, driving the sword-point through
	Vanessa's chest, on into Frost's heart! It strikes the stone behind
	them, SHATTERING and --

	Frost and Vanessa HOWL AS ONE, their SCREAMS rising to an unendurable
	intensity as the two vampires go nova, exploding into an expanding
	ball of light and ATOMIZING BLOOD.

	Blade is thrown back off his feet, having to shield his eyes from the
	backlash of occult energy as a near tidal WAVE of blood surges over
	him -- 

	EXT. BANK OF EREBUS - CITY STREET - NIGHT

	Every door and window of the bank is BLOWN OUTWARD from the force of
	the EXPLOSION. While along the street, manhole covers flip from their
	moorings, spinning up into the air like dimes, being buoyed by
	geysers of blood.

	INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	Silence, just the steady DRIP-DRIP of liquid draining. The underworld
	temple gleams with a crimson sheen now. 

	ON BLADE 

	as he stirs. He's been blown clear across the sanctuary by the force
	of the blast, soaked to the quick by blood. He rises to his feet,
	retrieving the hilt of his shattered weapon. At his feet -- 

	THE SWORDBLADE 

	lies in pieces. Amidst them, we find the singed remains of the locket
	-- Vanessa's face barely recognizable beneath the grime. Blade stoops
	to pick it up.

				KAREN (O.S.)
		Blade?

	Blade turns. Karen moves to him, searching his eyes. Which side of
	Blade's soul has won out? Human or vampire?

	Then she SEES the tears rimming Blade's eyes, the first he's shed in
	a lifetime. Human. 

	They embrace, holding each other that way for a long, long time. And
	we --

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. ROOFTOP, BANK OF EREBUS - DAWN

	Blade and Karen stand on the rooftop, watching as dawn slowly creeps
	across the silent city.

				KAREN
		I never imagined I'd be so happy to 
		see the sun rise --
			(turning to him)
		It's over, isn't it?

				BLADE
		For them. But for me --

	He lifts his face towards the rising sun, letting its warmth wash
	over his upturned face.

				BLADE
		I feel like it's finally beginning.

	And on that note we leave them -- TWO FIGURES, silhouetted against
	the new day.

	FADE TO BLACK.

	THE END
BLADE
                                -----

	Darkness, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS. Presentation credits roll as we
	FADE UP ON:

	INT. HOSPITAL, INNER-CITY TRAUMA WARD - NIGHT

	It's 1967, the Summer of Love and --

	BOOM! Entry doors swing open as PARAMEDICS wheel in a FEMALE BLEEDER,
	VANESSA (20s, black, nine months pregnant). She's deathly pale,
	spewing founts of blood from a savagely slashed throat -- 

	A SHOCK-TRAUMA TEAM swarms over her, inserting a vacutainer into an
	artery to draw blood, wrapping a blood pressure cuff around her
	arm --

				NURSE #1
			(with stethoscope)
		She's not breathing!

				SENIOR RESIDENT
		Intubate her!

	The RESPIRATORY THERAPIST feeds an endotracheal tube down the woman's
	ruined throat, attaches that to an Amblu bag --

				RESIDENT
		Blood-pressure's forty and falling --

	The woman starts spasming violently. It takes three staff members
	just to hold her down.

				SENIOR RESIDENT
		Jesus, her water's broken --
			(calling for help)
		She's going into uterine contractions --

	CAMERA PUSHES IN on the woman as she bolts upright, SCREAMING to wake
	the dead. We PLUNGE INTO the darkness of her mouth and find
	ourselves --

	INSIDE HER BLOODSTREAM

	The sound of a HEART BEATING, pounding as we whip-snake through --

	CORPUSCLES 

	floating in amber plasma. Erythrocytes, leukocytes, neutrophils and
	eosinophils. 

	The rhythmic expansion of the artery walls, pulsing with each
	successive surge of blood as the HEART BEATS FASTER AND FASTER,
	taking us --

	IN UTERO,

	A CHILD, alive but unborn, shifting in a sea of amniotic fluid,
	surrounded by the white, protective substance known as vernix
	caseosa. The HEARTBEAT races like a locomotive now. The unborn child
	shifts, turns its head towards us --

	-- and opens its eyes.

	CUT TO:

	A SWORDBLADE

	cleaving the darkness, radiant light slicing across gleaming Damascus
	steel. Words acid-etched in the weapon's fine-tempered surface:

	BLADE

	Main credits end.

	EXT. INNER CITY, INDUSTRIAL GHETTO - NIGHT

	A decaying no man's land populated by condemned buildings and HUNGRY
	HOMELESS. Steam rises from manhole covers, drifting across the
	litter- lined streets. Suddenly --

	A black Mercedes 850 appears over the crest of a hill, ROARING past
	us, stereo system belting out FILTER.

	INT. MERCEDES - NIGHT

	Raquel, a wasp-wasted woman, sits behind the wheel. 20s, rich,
	sickeningly attractive. Hungry eyes. 

	Squirming around in the passenger seat is DENNIS, a model/actor boy-
	toy with a sub-zero IQ and a "fuck me sideways" grin. 

				DENNIS
		So where we going?

				RAQUEL
		It's a surprise. 

				DENNIS
		I likes surprises. 

	Raquel eyeballs Dennis -- "if looks could devour". 

				RAQUEL
		What do you have down there, little 
		man?

				DENNIS
		Heat-seeker.

				RAQUEL
		I'll bet.

	Raquel slides a manicured hand up his thigh, squeezes his groin.
	Dennis MOANS. She pulls her hand away, downshifts.

	EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT

	The 850 threads a narrow alley into a vacant lot, BRAKES hard. Raquel
	and Dennis climb out. She leads him into --

	EXT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - NIGHT

	Industry never sleeps, and certainly not this grisly facility. Raquel
	leads Dennis around the back of the plant, where a host of WORKERS
	are loading refrigerated trucks with product.

				DENNIS
		What the fuck are we doing here?

	Raquel just smiles, heads on into the plant via a loading door. The
	workers ignore her.

	INT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - NIGHT

	Dennis follows Raquel through the bowels of the plant, catching
	glimpses here and there of carcasses being rendered or hacked apart. 

	Through one partially open door we see what might be a line of
	BODYBAGS being trundled into the back of a truck via a hook and chain
	pulley-system. But Dennis doesn't have enough time to be disturbed by
	the vision, because he's being pulled away by Raquel, led down --

	A STAIRWELL

	We are in the basement now. At the end of the hall is a steel door,
	with perhaps, just the faintest HINT OF MUSIC heard coming from
	beyond. Raquel knocks.

	A "peep-hole" slat opens and a BLACK LIGHT shines into Raquel's eyes.
	A VOICE behind the door offers a verbal challenge, speaking a
	language we've never heard, laced with a devilish cadence. 

	Raquel responds in kind. The door opens. Raquel gives Dennis a
	knowing wink, enters. Dennis follows. 

	INT. CLUB - NIGHT

	Raquel and Dennis move past a hulking DOORMAN, making their way down
	a narrow stairway. Dennis is suitably impressed.

	THE CLUB 

	is elite, underground -- an "abattoir-chic" version of an old-time
	juke joint with a greasy, dangerous vibe. White-tiled walls and
	floors for easy hosing, chromed fittings, run-off gutters, drains. No
	bar.

	BODIES 

	writhe on the strobe-lit dance floor. A heavy S&M scene. Leather.
	Latex. Tattoos. Body-piercings.

	A D.J. wearing head-mounted spotlights orchestrates the tunes on
	twin- decks. MUSIC assaults us -- a beat so heavy it could jar the
	fillings from your teeth. Brutal "DARKCORE" along the lines of
	Prodigy or Underground. 

	Raquel pulls Dennis out onto the dance floor. They sway. 

	A lupine-featured GAULTIER GIRL with a streak of white running
	through her raven hair moves in behind Dennis, pressing up against
	him. Rachel Williams as the Angel of Death -- we'll call her MERCURY.

	Mercury flicks her tongue against Dennis' ear -- it's been pierced
	with a silver post which clicks against her teeth. Tattooed across
	her back in black is a swirling, tribal vortex. 

	Dennis is now sandwiched between Raquel and Mercury, the three of
	them dry-humping their way to every man's glory. 

	The beat gets LOUDER. The action heavier. The atmosphere more
	narcotic. People are stripping off their clothes, sweating like
	fiends. It's a virtual orgy.

	Dennis laughs, reveling in the hedonism. Everything rises to a fever
	pitch --

				DENNIS
			(over the music)
		Fuck, I need a drink!!!

	Raquel just smiles -- then Dennis notices a DROP OF SOMETHING spatter
	his hand. It looks like blood. Dennis looks up, concerned --

	-- MORE BLOOD DROPLETS are falling. Raquel's face is sprinkled with
	them now. Dennis stops dancing. What is this? Some kind of fucked up
	performance art?

	Raquel turns her face toward the ceiling, as if washing herself in a
	summer shower, now the other club goers are looking up too --

	BLOOD SHOWERS DOWN

	from sprinkler heads in the ceiling, drenching the dancers. The club
	goers love it, thrusting their heads back, mouths open wide to
	receive the crimson offering. 

	Horrified, Dennis recoils, turning towards --

	RAQUEL,

	whose face morphs into a preternatural snarl. Her canines extend,
	tapering to razor-sharp points. Her tongue flicks, lizard-like as
	fingernails sharpen into claws. All this while the whites of her eyes
	BLEED RED, pupils oscillating hypnotically. 

				RAQUEL
		What's wrong, baby?

	Dennis SCREAMS, pushes away from Raquel, only --

	-- Mercury has fangs now too. In fact, everyone in the club does,
	with the exception of poor Dennis. That's because they're all
	vampires.

	Dennis tries to run, but the burly Doorman blocks his exit, brutally
	smashing his fist into Dennis' face. 

	Dennis falls, dazed. The club-goers close in around him. They make a
	game of it, shoving him from one person to another, their pale faces
	leering like twisted jack-o-lanterns.

	The strobe lights quicken to a seizure-inducing intensity. Dennis
	spins, tumbling into Raquel's arms. She shoves him forward -- Dennis
	lands on the floor, falling at someone's boot-clad feet. He looks up.
	A DARK FIGURE sits in the shadows, unnoticed until this moment. The
	figure stands, moves into the light as time screeches to a halt -- 

	A BLACK MAN, 

	towers above Dennis, wearing dark glasses and a leather longcoat -- a
	sneer of cruel contempt etched upon a face tempered by a lifetime of
	horror. His name is BLADE.

	Blade whips open his long coat, shrugging it off, revealing an
	arsenal of high-tech weapons strapped to his body: 

	6-point adjustable body armor, a modified CAR-15 assault rifle with
	an ultra-violet entry light, two Casull .454 revolvers, a "Demon"
	automatic cross-bow, a bandoleer of mahogany stakes, an Indian-style
	katar punching dagger -- and last, but certainly not least, his
	namesake -- a silver sword which is secured in a back-scabbard.

	CLOSE ON BLADE

	A gaze as cold and pitiless as a midnight sun. The vampire club-goers
	stare back. Nuclear silence. And then --

	All hell breaks loose. With a SNARL, Raquel charges at Blade, moving
	at superhuman speed, practically a blur -- 

	Blade draws his Casulls, FIRES in multiple directions --

	MACRO BULLET SHOT 

	as a round roars through the air towards Raquel. A silver-tipped dum-
	dum bullet which explodes on contact.

	WHAM! The round punches a fist-sized hole through Raquel's chest,
	continuing on into the vamp behind her! Vampire blood fountains. Both
	creatures tumble forward, their bodies liquefying into puddles of
	black oil which go gurgling down the run-off drains.

	Blade continues FIRING, then -CLICK!- magazines empty. Next. He
	holsters the Casulls, swings up his assault rifle, calmly flicks on
	the UV entry light mounted above --

	MERCURY 

	leaps twenty feet straight up into the air. We've never seen anything
	move so fast. She CRASHES through a glass skylight, disappearing into
	the night just as --

	-- a shaft of blinding UV "sunlight" cuts across the vampires. They
	rear back, skin smoking from the light's corrosive effects. Blade
	opens FIRE, pumping round after round of wooden fragmentation bullets
	into the crowd -- vampire genocide.

	The strobe lights flicker as the mayhem mounts. Some of the vampires
	try to flee, scurrying up the stairs, but the exit quickly becomes
	clogged with liquefying bodies -- 

	-- then Blade's CAR-15 jams. The remaining club-goers see their
	opening, surge forward en masse -- 

	Blade drops the rifle, reaches over his shoulder and -SCHINGGG!-
	unsheathes his sword with a double-handed grip. 

	THE SWORD

	Four acid-etched feet of blood-soaked Damascus steel. An edge so
	sharp it could cleave a shadow in two.

	Blade moves like lightning, hacking his way into TWO CHARGING
	VAMPIRES. Blade spins again, cuts ANOTHER VAMPIRE clean in half --

	ON THE FAR END OF THE CLUB,

	a LATEX-CLAD VAMP makes a break for it. Blade flings his sword,
	sending it spinning end over end -- THUNK! The sword punches into the
	vampire's heart. The hellish creature convulses, dies.

	Beat. Blade retrieves his sword, then senses --

	SOMETHING BIG

	rising up behind him. In a flash, Blade swings his sword downward,
	cutting off the vampire's right hand at the elbow. The severed limb
	falls to the floor -- 

	-- but it doesn't slow the hulking creature down. It SLAMS into
	Blade. Blade flies backwards thirty feet, tumbling over tables,
	slamming into the rear wall so hard that plaster rains down from the
	ceiling. 

	Blade suddenly finds himself wrestling with a feral-faced six-foot-
	something nightmare named QUINN. The vampire rears back its head,
	jaws stretching wide. Every inch of his face is covered with ritual
	scarification patterns and Maori-like tribal tattoos. 

	Blade forces an elbow against Quinn's throat, trying to keep him at
	bay. With his other hand he reaches to his bandoleer, pulls out a
	stake -- CRUNCH! Blade shoves the stake through the vampire's larynx.
	Quinn gurgles, clutches at his throat. 

	Blade rolls out from under, unholsters the cross-bow secured to his
	leg. With a flick of a switch the arms of the bow -SNAP!- open,
	drawing the bow-string taut. Blade FIRES -- 

	The bolt hits Quinn in the shoulder, throwing him backwards and
	nailing him to the wall. As Quinn reaches over with his other hand to
	pull out the stake --

	Blade FIRES AGAIN. A second bolt slams into Quinn's other arm,
	effectively pinning him like a butterfly to a board.

	UP ABOVE, 

	mounted in one of the corners, is a security camera. Blade fires a
	cross-bow bolt straight into the lens. 

	Blade strides over, placing his sword against Quinn's chest.

				BLADE
		Where is Deacon Frost?

	Quinn glares, trying to speak, gagging on the stake still lodged in
	his trachea --

				BLADE
		Got something in your throat.

	Blade yanks the stake free. The vampire laughs, air whistling through
	his ruined larynx. 

				QUINN
		Fuck you, Day-walker, I ain't saying 
		shit --

				BLADE
		Frost.

	Quinn responds with a slew of rapid-fire vampire invectives. Blade
	sees he's getting nowhere fast, calmly sheathes his sword. He unclips
	a white phosphorous grenade from his combat harness -- 

				QUINN
		You won't stop him, Blade. The Tide's 
		rising, the Sleeper's gonna --

	Blade shoves the grenade in Quinn's mouth, pulls the pin. WHOOSH!
	Quinn goes up like a roman candle. Blade turns, surveying his work,
	ignoring the howling pyre behind him:

	All evidence of the vampires is gone -- with the exception of a few
	oily-black puddles. Clothes, jewelry -- it's all been burned away by
	the acidic process of the creatures' accelerated decomposition.

	DENNIS sits huddled in a corner, having pissed his pants. As Blade
	approaches, he cringes back --

				DENNIS
		Please don't --

	Blade simply grabs Dennis by the jaw, tilting his head upward,
	rotating it from side to side -- looking for bite marks. There aren't
	any.

	Blade moves on, leaving Dennis alone amidst the carnage. As Blade
	starts up the stairs, he pauses in mid-step --

	A COCKROACH

	scurries out from underfoot. 

	Blade adjusts his footfall, sparing the roach. He continues on up the
	stairs, disappearing in the smoky haze. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. CITY HOSPITAL, AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

	CAMERA FOLLOWS a bagged corpse as it's rolled into the autopsy room
	by an ASSISTANT. 

				ASSISTANT
		Brought you a baked potato, nice
		and crispy. Still warm, too.

	CURTIS WEBB, the forensic pathologist (30s, white bread, a little on
	the smarmy side) steps forward, unzips the bag --

	It's Quinn, what's left of him, anyway. Burnt to a charcoal
	briquette, limbs twisted horribly, oozing fluids.

	Curtis turns his head, grimacing, wafting the air.

				CURTIS
		Jesus, that's rank -- 

	Curtis turns back, makes note of the blackened stump where Quinn's
	arm used to be, the ruined throat -- 

				CURTIS
		What's his story?

				ASSISTANT
		Paramedics said he was still screaming 
		when they found him. Looks like some 
		joker had stapled him to a wall.

				CURTIS
		Pretty.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL, HEMATOLOGY LAB - NIGHT

	MICROSCOPE POV

	of a slide-mounted blood smear stained with Wright stain (blue ink).
	What we see is a collection of donut-shaped pink things (red blood
	cells) intermingled with some small blue specks (platelets) and the
	occasional larger, light-blue blobs (white blood cells).

	KAREN JANSEN (20s), a fine-featured hematologist with a social life
	in suspended animation, sits back from the microscope, stumped. Next
	to her is JULIE WHITAKER, a cheerful chemtech. 

				KAREN
		You took this off a DOA?

	Curtis sits on a stool nearby, slowly nodding.

				KAREN
		This isn't human blood.

				CURTIS
		Then what is it?

				KAREN
		I don't know --
			(re: microscope)
		Look at this blood smear -- 

	Curtis takes a look for himself.

				KAREN
		The red blood cells are biconvex, 
		which is theoretically impossible. 
		They're hypochromic, there's virtually 
		no hemoglobin in them. 
			(shaking her head)
		Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, 
		they should be mononucleated.

				CURTIS
		What about the chemistry panel? 

	Karen looks to Julie, who reaches for a computer print-out.

				JULIE
		Blood sugar level is three times the 
		norm, phosphorous and uric acid are 
		off the scales.
			(shrugs)
		Like the woman said, impossible.

	Karen removes her glasses, rubbing the bridge of her nose.

				KAREN
		Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm 
		really not in the mood for one of your 
		practical jokes.

				CURTIS
			(insistent)
		It's not a joke. I've got the stiff 
		sitting in the morgue right now -- 
		look, just come up and see him, okay? 
		Five minutes, that's all I ask.

				KAREN
		I thought you promised to give me some 
		distance?

				CURTIS
		This is purely professional curiosity, 
		Karen, I swear.

	Karen rolls her eyes, lets loose a tired sigh.

				KAREN
		Five minutes, not a second more. And I 
		don't want to hear a word about "us".

				CURTIS
		No problem.

	INT. HOSPITAL MORGUE - NIGHT

	The dead of night, not a mouse in the house. Curtis and Karen, each
	garbed in a mask, stand on either side of Quinn's body, which now
	rests on the autopsy table.

	QUINN'S BODY

	A preliminary exploratory Y-incision has been made across the chest,
	stretching from shoulder to shoulder, then continuing on down the
	abdomen. Ribs and cartilage have been cut open to expose the heart
	and lungs.

				KAREN
		You haven't started in on the internal 
		organs?

				CURTIS 
		Just the blood sample from the 
		pericardial sac.

	Curtis pauses, studying Quinn's disfigured face -- the features seem
	much less damaged now -- almost as if the corpse were healing itself.

				CURTIS
		That's weird --

				KAREN
		What?

				CURTIS
		He looks different now, burns are less 
		extreme, some of these wounds have 
		closed up -- 

	Curtis pulls out a penlight, flicks it on. He leans over Quinn,
	shining the light into one of his eyes.

				CURTIS
		Tell me something, honestly, you ever 
		have second thoughts about us?

				KAREN
			(grudgingly)
		Sometimes --

	Curtis looks up from the corpse, grinning beneath his mask.

				KAREN
		-- but then I remember what an 
		ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back 
		to reality. 

				CURTIS
		Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart 
		here --

	Quinn suddenly bolts up from the autopsy table, sinking his fangs
	into Curtis' jugular. He snaps the man's neck in two for easier
	access, sucking in blood like a living vacuum. 

	Karen stumbles backwards, sending autopsy tools CLATTERING.

	QUINN

	rises from the table, flinging Curtis' twitching body aside. He curls
	his blood-soaked lips back, baring viper-like fangs, emitting a
	GUTTURAL GROWL --

				QUINN
			(crazed by thirst)
		-- more -- blood --

	Karen backs into the corpse drawers, but Quinn is upon her in a half-
	second, wrapping a hand about her throat. His mouth opens/morphs
	disturbingly wide as if to swallow her head whole, caustic saliva
	dripping from his canines -- 

	Karen tries to turn her head away, but Quinn's grip is vise-like. She
	finds herself staring into his eyes -- pupils pulsing rapid-fire,
	opening and closing, hypnotic --

	As Quinn sinks the tips of his fangs into Karen's carotid artery and
	starts to nurse --

	BANG!!! A load of MAHOGANY buckshot chews into Quinn's side. He HOWLS
	in pain. Another load catches him full in the face. He drops Karen.
	She falls to the floor -- 

	KAREN'S POV

	The sound of RUSHING BLOOD pounding through her skull. Everything
	spinning. She struggles to move, turns her head, finds herself eye to
	eye with Curtis' corpse.

	ON QUINN

	rising, his face torn up, smoking. WHIP PAN TO --

	BLADE, 

	standing at the entrance to the morgue, a streetsweeper auto-shotgun
	in hand, sizing Quinn up.

				BLADE
		Now don't we look dapper?

	Quinn BELLOWS with rage, ripping one of the heavy steel refrigeration
	doors from its hinges, flinging it at Blade like it was lawn
	furniture --

	Blade rolls to the side as the door CRASHES against the wall. Quinn
	runs, moving through the morgue like a human tornado, heading for the
	windows at the end of the room --

	SMASH!!! Out goes Quinn, taking half the wall with him. Blade rushes
	to the decimated window, looks down --

	BLADE'S POV

	Quinn lands on the roof of an ambulance parked four stories below,
	caving it in. He springs off, loping across the tarmac on three
	limbs, then -SCREECH!-THWUMP!- rolling up onto the hood of an
	oncoming car, before disappearing into the night --

	BACK UP ABOVE,

	Blade spins, SEES Karen bleeding her life away on the floor. She
	reaches a hand out to him, beseeching --

	Blade pulls away from her grasp, takes a step towards the exit --
	then hesitates. 

	A flicker of doubt washes across Blade's face. He looks down at Karen
	once more, wrestling with his conscience, finally making a decision.
	He kneels, scoops Karen up into his arms. Just then, 

	TWO POLICEMEN 

	rush into the morgue, weapons drawn --

				UNIFORM #1
		Hold it, ass-hole!

	Blade ignores them, turning to face the window before him. It's a
	good thirty feet to the roof of the adjacent building, a parking
	structure -- and damned if Blade doesn't seem to be considering the
	jump.

	The Police close in, agitated. Blade crouches, switches Karen to a
	one-handed grip --

				UNIFORM #1
		I said hold it!!!

	-- and jumps.

	EXT. HOSPITAL/ROOFTOP PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT

	Blade clears the impossible distance -- almost. He snags the ledge of
	the adjacent parking structure with his left hand even as Karen slips
	from the grasp of his right --

	-- a last-second save, his fingers clamping around her wrist, is all
	that stands between Karen and street pizza. She SCREAMS anyway,
	dangling below him --

	Blade GRUNTS, swinging Karen like a pendulum, heaving her up and over
	the ledge as if she were a sack of potatoes. She lands on her
	shoulder, clutching it in pain --

	Blade heaves himself up, crouching beside her.

				KAREN
			(gasping)
		My shoulder -- dislocated --

	Blade places a hand on her shoulder, another around her elbow and
	without any consideration to discomfort -CRACK!- brutally pops it
	back in place. Karen SCREAMS again as he scoops her up once more and
	heads for --

	HIS '69 OLDSMOBILE 442, 

	which is parked nearby. Midnight-black. The definitive high-
	performance heavy-metal muscle machine with an engine big enough to
	power an Apollo rocket. 

	INT. BLADE'S OLDS - NIGHT

	Blade sets Karen down in the passenger seat, climbs behind the wheel,
	keys the ignition. The engine ROARS to life, belching fumes through
	the dual exhaust. Blade floors it, burning serious rubber as the Olds
	vanishes from sight. 

	BACK AT THE DEMOLISHED MORGUE WINDOW 

	as the two policemen stare numbly in open-mouthed astonishment.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

	Blade pilots the Olds down the streets, moving through a series of
	increasingly degenerating neighborhoods, coming at last to the
	sprawling warehouse district.

	EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT 

	The Olds approaches a mammoth industrial facility that's been
	cordoned off by cyclone fencing and razor wire. Ultra-violet
	floodlights illuminate the area, while an army of security cameras
	keep a watchful eye. 

	INT. BLADE'S OLDS - NIGHT

	Blade glances at Karen, cursing himself for giving into his emotions.
	He hits a remote secured to the sun visor --

	EXT. BLADE'S OLDS/ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

	A gate grinds open. 

	We follow the Olds as it cruises around the back of the building,
	heading down a concrete loading ramp. At the bottom of the ramp, a
	heavy iron door rises. Blade's Olds disappears into the darkness.

	INT. ABANDONED FACTORY, INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	More UV lights flicker on. We're in a massive loading elevator which
	HUMS as it ascends, eventually reaching its destination with a
	BOOMING CLANG. The doors at the rear glide open. Blade guides the
	Olds out.

	INT. ABANDONED FACTORY, WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

	Set up in an old ironworks, the place looks like a cross between an
	auto junkyard and an armory. Equipment is strewn everywhere --
	lathes, mills, old furnaces, gutted vehicles, an ad hoc surgical
	theater -- all of it jerry-rigged in a brutal, oily-tech.

	Blade climbs out of the Olds. He opens the passenger door and pulls
	Karen out, carries her in his arms. 

				BLADE
		Whistler!

				WHISTLER (O.S.)
		Are we bringing home strays now?

	ABRAHAM WHISTLER (60s)

	hobbles out of the shadows, leaning heavily on a cane. Gimlet-eyed,
	bitter, his right leg encased in a metal brace. Though his face is
	lined with wrinkles and his hair has long since gone gray, we sense
	he could kick the living shit out of any man half his age. 

				BLADE
		She's been bitten.

				WHISTLER
		You should've killed her, then.

				BLADE
		She hasn't turned yet. 
			(pointedly)
		You can help her.

	Blade and Whistler stare each other down. Finally, Whistler turns and
	heads over to the operating theater.

				WHISTLER
		No promises. You watch her close. She 
		starts to turn, you finish her off.

	Blade nods, lays Karen down on the operating table. Whistler turns on
	an overhead light. Karen is sheathed in sweat, ashen. She's lost a
	lot of blood.

	Whistler snaps on a pair of surgical gloves, probes the wound in
	Karen's neck with an antiseptic swab -- there's capillary damage
	around the perimeter of the wound, the tissue looks bruised,
	gangrenous. 

				WHISTLER
		Localized necrosis. She's borderline. 
		Another hour and she'd be well into 
		the change.

	Whistler cracks open a smelling salt capsule and waves under Karen's
	nose. As she starts to stir --

				WHISTLER
		Can you hear me, woman? 

	Karen's eyes open wide. She's scared, disoriented --

				KAREN
		What -- ?

				WHISTLER
		You've been bitten by a vampire. We've 
		got to try and burn out the venom, 
		just like a rattlesnake bite --

	Whistler reaches for a massive syringe filled with caustic-looking
	fluid. Karen sees the syringe, resists --

				WHISTLER
		Hold her. 

	Blade forces Karen back. Whistler readies the syringe.

				WHISTLER
			(reading her name tag)
		"Dr. Karen Jansen". Listen close, I'm 
		going to inject you with an antidote 
		made from allium setivum -- garlic. 
		This is going to hurt. A lot. 

	Whistler sinks the needle into Karen's neck and depresses the
	plunger. "Hurt" doesn't begin to describe what Karen experiences
	next. Imagine undergoing childbirth while someone pumps battery acid
	through your veins.

	Karen SHRIEKS, her body going into uncontrolled paroxysms. The wound
	on her neck begins to smoke as the antidote attacks the poisonous
	vampire venom.

	Karen clutches at Blade's arms, digging her nails in. She stares up
	at him with unflinching intensity, like a child desperately searching
	for assurance. 

	ON BLADE,

	uncomfortable playing the roll of nursemaid. He'd like nothing more
	than to be done with this, but the only thing he can do is hold Karen
	while she rides out the seizures. 

	KAREN'S POV

	growing darker by the moment. The last thing she sees is Blade
	staring down at her -- then the night closes in. 

	INT. HOUSE OF EREBUS, MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON a monitor featuring footage taken at the vampire club
	massacre. Blade turns and stares into the camera, fires his cross-
	bow. The screen cuts to static.

	A WITHERED, CLAWED HAND

	moves into frame, holding a remote. With a tap of a button, the
	monitor goes dark. 

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL a large, minimalist conference room -- the House
	of Erebus, seat of the vampire race's legislative assembly.

	Gathered around a massive table are the TWELVE VAMPIRE ELDERS,
	representing a "rainbow" of racial colors -- names like PALLINTINE,
	VON ESPER, ASHE, BAVA. Two of them, the FAUSTINAS, are identical
	twins -- lethal-looking women with alabaster skin. 

	Chilled carafes filled with blood are situated along the table. From
	time to time, a member will pour themselves a glass, or perhaps, help
	themselves to the bowls of human finger bones which serve as snacks.

	At the head of the table is GAETANO DRAGONETTI, current vampire
	"Overlord". Blood-red eyes, parchment skin stretched over skull-like
	features. Incalculably ancient, but still deadly and virile as a
	viper. 

	Dragonetti speaks. He uses the "secret tongue" -- the ancient vampire
	language which utilizes consonants human vocal chords are incapable
	of reproducing. 

				DRAGONETTI 
			(subtitled)
		Blade. Once again, our interests have 
		fallen victim to his ridiculous 
		crusade. He must be destroyed.

				FROST (O.S.)
			(in English)
		You're wrong, Dragonetti. 

	All heads turn. Who would dare such impudence?

	DEACON FROST, 

	a mere "Underlord" in the vampire hierarchy, steps forward.
	Strikingly handsome, younger, less conservative than his superiors,
	fueled with a passionate intensity. Amongst the vampire community
	he's known as an agitator. He's also the vampire equivalent of a
	racial supremacist.

				FROST
		The Day Walker represents a unique 
		opportunity. We'd be fools to waste 
		it by killing him. 

				DRAGONETTI
			(subtitled, taking umbrage)
		Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our 
		language, you insult the House of 
		Erebus by using the humans' 
		gutter-tongue, have you no respect 
		for tradition? 

				FROST
		Why should I respect something which 
		has outlived its purpose?

	This causes quite a stir amongst the other vampires. Frost might as
	well have slapped Dragonetti in the face.

				DRAGONETTI
			(simmering)
		I see. And what would you have us do 
		with this "half-breed"?

				FROST
		Study him. Unlock the secrets of his 
		DNA. He's the key we've been looking 
		for. 

				DRAGONETTI
		He is an abomination! 

	Dragonetti slams his fist down, toppling a carafe, spilling blood
	across the tabletop. Frost looks to the others --

				FROST
		Why should we spend our lives 
		cringing from the daylight when his 
		blood offers us an alternative? 
		Enough talk. It's time we stepped out 
		of the shadows!

	Dragonetti looks apoplectic. ELDER PALLINTINE, a five-hundred year-
	old vampire inhabiting the body of a prepubescent boy, interjects.

				PALLINTINE
		You're out of line, Frost.

				FROST
		Am I? Or am I just the first to say 
		out loud what we've all been 
		thinking? 

	The fact that no one answers is telling. Dragonetti glowers at the
	other Elders, sensing the tide turning.

				DRAGONETTI
		The shadows suit us, Frost. We've 
		existed this way for thousands of 
		years. Who are you to challenge our 
		ways?

				FROST
		Someone who's sick of living off 
		scraps. The coming age belongs to us, 
		not the humans! 
			(to the others)
		When the final war between our races 
		comes, who do you want leading the 
		charge? 

	Frost stabs an accusing finger at the Overlord.

				FROST
		Some withered up fossil ready to snap 
		like a brittle bone at the first sign 
		of change?

	Dragonetti GROWLS like an beast, raking his claws across the tyro
	vampire's face, knocking him to the ground. 

				DRAGONETTI
		Get out!!!

	Frost picks himself up, touches the gashes on his cheek. Looks at his
	fingers, licks the blood from them. 

				FROST
		Careful, old fang. You might wake up 
		one day and find yourself extinct.

	Frost smiles at Dragonetti and calmly exits the room.

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP, BLADE'S CELL - DAY

	ON KAREN as she comes to. Her wounds have been bandaged. She rises, a
	little shaky, takes in her surroundings -- She's in a spartan room,
	like a monk's cell. On the wall is a collection of knives and
	daggers. Some of them wooden, their hilts inscribed with bizarre-
	looking runes. In the center of these weapons rests --

	BLADE'S SWORD,

	hanging like a cross in a chapel, dominating all else. Karen touches
	it. Then her eyes drop to a silver locket which dangles from the hilt
	by a tarnished chain. She reaches for it, opens it --

	The locket features a photo, old and faded. It's the black woman we
	saw in the prologue, Vanessa, standing in the sunshine. 

	Karen moves towards the door, cautious -- 

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAY

	We hear VOICES now, coming from beyond a series of black-out
	curtains. Karen pushes one aside and SEES --

	BLADE

	strapped into some kind of Inquisition-esque restraint chair. His
	shirt is off, his body slick with sweat. Whistler finishes strapping
	Blade in, then stands back, holding up a gas-powered pistol injector,
	hesitant --

				WHISTLER 
		I had to increase the dose. You're 
		building up a resistance to the 
		serum --

				BLADE
			(impatient)
		Just do it, old man.

	Whistler nods, fitting Blade with a bite guard. Then he presses the
	pistol-injector against Blade's carotid artery. 

	Blade shakes violently, grinding his teeth through the bite guard,
	veins cording in his neck. He clutches Whistler's hand, holding it
	tightly as he fights his way through the hellish seizure. To his
	credit, Whistler never lets go.

	Mentor and student stare at one another as the mysterious serum runs
	its violent course. We understand that these shared moments, oddly
	private in their horror, are the glue which binds the two vampire
	hunters together. Finally, Blade slumps forward in his restraints,
	exhausted. 

	KAREN

	She draws back, instinctively knowing that she's just witnessed
	something she shouldn't have. She looks for an exit, SEES another
	doorway. She makes for it -- 

	INT. WHISTLER'S LAB - TANK ROOM - DAY 

	A dusty, darkened hole of a room, no windows, just shadows, crumbling
	concrete, rust stains, and --

	A LARGE TANK

	filled with swirling blood plasma, choked with electrical leads and
	biomedical sensors. SOMETHING floats within, suspended in the murky
	fluid -- a child , two or three years of age, drifting about like a
	medical oddity preserved in formaldehyde -- 

	THUMP! The child SLAMS up against the glass. Karen backpedals,
	startled. Its eyes are open now, pupils blown. It snarls, revealing a
	mouthful of razored fangs, trailing mouth-slime across the glass as
	it futilely tries to chew its way through to Karen.

	Karen stifles a sob, turning and running right into --

	BLADE,

	who now blocks the exit, sword in hand. Karen retreats a step,
	wary --

				BLADE
		You shouldn't be here.

				KAREN
		I'm sorry, I --

				WHISTLER (O.S.)
		Wandered off the beaten path, Doctor?

	Whistler has entered the room from a second doorway. Karen looks from
	Whistler to Blade, trapped between them --

				KAREN
		Who are you people?

				WHISTLER
		My name is Abraham Whistler.
			(re: Blade)
		This is Blade. As for our little 
		homunculus here --

	Whistler limps over to the tank, rapping his cane against it. The
	creature snaps at it reflexively, following the silver tip back and
	forth like a fish after a lure.

				BLADE
		-- he's a vampire.

				KAREN
		You're joking --

				WHISTLER
		Not at all. You're looking at a prime 
		specimen of the homines nocturna. 

	Whistler toys with the feral creature, engaging in a certain amount
	of sadistic delight as its efforts grow increasingly more frenzied.
	Suddenly, it surges towards the top of the tank, clawing at the
	lid --

	Karen becomes alarmed -- but then a massive ELECTRICAL JOLT shocks
	the creature back into submission. 

				WHISTLER
		If Blade hadn't brought you here, you 
		would've wound up like him.

	Karen brings a hand to her bandaged neck, recalling the events of the
	previous night. She looks to Blade.

				KAREN
		Why did you help me?

	Blade scowls, his gaze flickering to Whistler.

				BLADE
		Stupidity.

				WHISTLER
			(appraising her)
		Maybe not. I did some checking, she's 
		a hematologist. Knowledge like that 
		might come in handy.

				BLADE
		It's not worth the risk. We can't 
		trust her.

				KAREN
		Why?

				BLADE
		Because you're tainted. The venom's 
		still inside you. You could still 
		turn on us.

				KAREN
		What happens then?

	Blade looks to Whistler -- as far as he's concerned, the debate's
	over.

				BLADE
		Then I have to take you out, just 
		like any other bloodsucker.

	Blade turns and exits. Whistler and Karen follow.

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAY

	Beyond the grimy outer windows, we can see that the day is closing --
	long shadows, amber light. Karen lingers in the doorway, reeling from
	information overload. 

	Blade begins suiting up for his nightly hunt -- strapping on body
	armor, loading ammunition. He strings the tarnished locket around his
	neck as if it were an amulet that could ward off evil, then pauses to
	inspect a modified pistol, sighting down the length of it.

				BLADE
		We hunt them, moving from one city to 
		the next, tracking their migrations. 
		They're hard to kill. They tend to 
		regenerate.

	CLACK! Blade pulls the trigger on an empty chamber, then checks his
	next weapon --

				KAREN
			(sarcastic)
		So what do you use, then? A stake?

				WHISTLER
			(nodding)
		Some of the old wives' tales are true 
		-- they're severely allergic to 
		silver, various types of wood. Feed 
		them garlic and they'll go into 
		anaphylactic shock -- 

	Whistler picks up a customized rifle with a UV entry light, flicking
	on the beam.

				WHISTLER
		-- and of course there's always 
		sunlight, ultra-violet rays. 

	Karen shakes her head, incredulous -- 

				KAREN
		And you honestly expect me to believe 
		all this?

				BLADE
		I don't care what you believe. I 
		saved your life once, I don't plan on 
		making a habit of it. You want my 
		advice, you'll be out of the city by 
		nightfall. If you're stupid enough to 
		stay, that's your business.

				KAREN
		I can't just leave. I have a life 
		here, a career --

				BLADE 
		Not anymore. You've seen one of them. 
		You won't be allowed to live after 
		that. 

	Karen stares at Blade. Whistler gestures to the windows --

				WHISTLER
		There's a war going on out there. 
		Blade, myself, a few others -- we've 
		tried to keep it from spilling over 
		onto the streets. 
			(beat)
		Sometimes people like yourself get 
		caught in the cross-fire. 

	Whistler shrugs. As far as he's concerned, there's nothing else to
	say. Karen is still protesting, though. 

				KAREN
		I can go to the police. I have blood 
		samples back at the hospital. I can 
		show them. 

				BLADE
		Do it. You'll be dead before you can 
		file the complaint.

				KAREN
		That's ridiculous! No one's that 
		powerful. 

	Whistler sighs. He doesn't suffer fools gladly.

				WHISTLER 
		You're talking about a brotherhood 
		that predates the Catholic Church by 
		thousands of years. Their survival 
		depends on their ability to blend in. 
		Chances are, you've encountered them 
		and not even known it. On the subway, 
		in a bar --

	Blade slings his CAR-15 onto his shoulder, impatient. He starts
	towards the Olds, gesturing.

				BLADE
		Get in. Youre leaving.

				WHISTLER
		Wait.

	Whistler tosses a small metal canister to Karen.

				WHISTLER
		Consider it a parting gift. Vampire 
		mace -- silver nitrate, essence of 
		garlic. 

				KAREN
			(in disbelief)
		So that's it? You guys just patch me 
		up and send me on my way?

				WHISTLER
		There is one other thing. I'd buy 
		yourself a gun if I were you. If you 
		start becoming sensitive to the 
		daylight, if you start becoming 
		thirsty regardless of much you've had 
		to drink -- then I suggest you take 
		that gun and use it on yourself. 
		Better that, than the alternative.

	Karen stares at Whistler, horrified, as we --

	CUT TO:

	INT. THE VAMPIRE ARCHIVES - DAY

	We are deep in the narrow stacks of a sepulchral archive. Exactly
	what and where this place is will become more clear later on. 

	But for now, the CAMERA DRIFTS through the warren of aisles. Along
	the way, we catch a glimpse of a HULKING SILHOUETTE cowering behind a
	series of Japanese shoji screens. Later on, we find --

	FROST

	tucked away in a carrel, surrounded by books and scriptures, with
	only the SICKLY GLOW of his laptop to provide light.

				DRAGONETTI (O.S.)
		What are you doing here?

	Frost pauses, SEEING Dragonetti emerge from the shadows.

				DRAGONETTI
			(outraged)
		These archives are restricted to 
		members of the House of Erebus.

				FROST
		Please. You and the other Elders 
		wouldn't know what to do with these 
		texts if your lives depended on it. 
			(cryptically)
		Which, of course, they do.

				DRAGONETTI
		You're wasting your time, Frost. Far 
		greater scholars than you have tried 
		to decipher these words. Whatever 
		secrets they hold have been lost.

				FROST
		Perhaps.

	Frost studies Dragonetti, a self-satisfied grin on his face. If the
	act was intended to unnerve Dragonetti, it succeeded, though the
	ancient vampire would never admit it.

				DRAGONETTI
		What are you up to, Frost?

	Frost shuts the lid on his laptop, rising, drawing intimidatingly
	close to Dragonetti.

				FROST'S VOICE
		Wouldn't you like to know, Old Fang?

	A beat as the young turk stares his elder down. Dragonetti is the
	first to lose his nerve. Frost smiles and exits, leaving the old
	vampire to lick his wounds.

	CAMERA DRIFTS back to the hulking silhouette, which has been
	eavesdropping on the conversation. It quivers in fear.

	INT. BLADE'S OLDS (ON KAREN'S STREET CORNER) - DAY

	Blade brings the car to a stop. Karen looks at him. His eyes are
	hidden behind his glasses, his expression stone.

				BLADE
		Remember what we said. Keep your eyes 
		open. They're everywhere.

	EXT. KAREN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

	As Karen climbs out, Blade swings the door shut behind her. The Olds
	ROARS off down the quiet residential street. 

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, LOBBY - DAY

	Karen crosses the lobby, stepping into an elevator. Just as the doors
	are closing, a WOMAN and TWO MEN duck in alongside her. 

	INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

	Silence, the uncomfortableness of an elevator ride magnified tenfold.
	Karen can FEEL the eyes of her fellow passengers upon her. Finally
	succumbing to paranoia, she hazards a glance -- would she be able to
	tell if these people weren't human? The woman turns to Karen,
	smiles --

	Karen surreptitiously fishes the "vampire mace" from her pocket,
	clutching it -- and now one of the men turns to look at her,
	nodding --

	INT. KAREN'S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY

	The elevator doors open. Karen hurries out, heads left, finds herself
	in a deserted hallway. She looks back --

	-- then skips a heartbeat as the trio also step out! As Karen raises
	the canister of mace --

	-- the trio turn and head down to the right. Karen breathes a sigh of
	relief, shakes her head.

	INT. KAREN'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Karen enters quickly, bolting the door behind her. She picks up the
	phone, dials 911 --

				KAREN
		I need the police. This is an 
		emergency --

	As Karen waits to be connected, she moves to the back entrance and
	checks the locks -- then the windows, then the fire escape --
	finally, a VOICE comes on the other end.

				KAREN
		Hello? My name is Karen Jansen, I was 
		with Curtis Webb at Mid-Town Hospital 
		last night -- that's right, I 
		witnessed the attack --
			(listening)
		115 Aurora, apartment 3G. Yes, I'll 
		wait here. Please hurry.

	Karen hangs up the phone and turns -- 

	A SHAFT OF BRIGHT SUNLIGHT

	streams in through a window. Karen forces herself to look at it and
	winces, shielding her eyes. Again, she brings a hand to the bandaged
	wound on her neck. She moves to the window, pulling the shade down,
	frightened.

				KAREN
		Get a grip on yourself, girl.

	She sinks down into a chair to wait, setting Whistler's vampire mace
	aside. Then she shuts her eyes, massaging her temples. We SEE --

	A BRIEF FLASH OF

	Quinn, his mouth opening wide, saliva dripping from his fangs. His
	pupils pulsating hypnotically. We rush into his gaping maw and --

	WHAM! We're back to reality. Karen wakes with a start, looks to the
	windows -- time has passed, it's getting dark outside --

	-- and someone is KNOCKING at the front door. Karen reaches for the
	vampire mace, then moves to the door. She looks through the peephole,
	cautious --

				KAREN
		Who is it? 

	KAREN'S POV (FISH-EYE)

	A POLICE OFFICER stands in the hallway -- 30s, handsome, a knight in
	shining armor as far as she's concerned. 

				GIDEON
		Sergeant Gideon. I'm responding to a 
		911 call. 

	Karen visibly relaxes. She opens the door and steps aside, allowing
	Gideon to enter.

				KAREN
		Yes, that was me, I'm Karen Jansen -- 

	Gideon smiles, takes a quick glance around the room, then studies
	Karen's face, the bandages on her neck.

				GIDEON
		Are you all right?
			(off Karen's nod)
		I'm glad you called, Ms. Jansen, we've 
		been anxious to get a hold of you. You 
		disappeared on us for a while. 

				KAREN
		I know. Listen -- do you have any idea 
		what happened to Curtis, the other 
		doctor?

				GIDEON
			(matter of fact)
		Oh, he's dead. But I wouldn't worry 
		about that if I were you.

				KAREN
			(alarmed)
		Why?

	Gideon's smile vanishes as he unholsters his gun. 

				GIDEON
		Because you're dead too.

	Karen GASPS. She has a half-second to act -- in which she triggers a
	spray of vampire mace into Gideon's face. Gideon stumbles back,
	blinded, cursing, rubbing the heel of his palm against his eyes -- 

	Karen expects pyrotechnics -- but the end result is little more than
	an annoyance. A second later, Gideon is simply blinking, sniffing his
	fingers, confused --

				GIDEON
		Garlic?

				KAREN
		He said it would work against 
		vampires --

	Gideon bursts out laughing.

				GIDEON
		Who said I was a vampire? 

	Gideon shakes his head, still snickering. He forces Karen against the
	wall, placing the gun against her head --

				GIDEON
		Thanks for the laugh. You can shut 
		your eyes if you want to.

	CRASH!!! The front door explodes open as Blade comes flying through
	it! 

	Gideon tries to bring his pistol up -- but Blade grips the man's hand
	and squeezes. Gideon SCREAMS as his bones snap like kindling. The
	pistol falls from his grasp --

	Blade fires his fist into Gideon's gut again and again, then flings
	the officer across the room, sending him SMASHING into a glass-cased
	cabinet. Bleeding, battered, Gideon struggles to stand --

	Blade is all over him, kicking the shit out of the rogue cop until he
	sinks to the floor in a half-conscious haze.

	Blade stands over Gideon's limp form, fists clenched, breathing
	heavily, touching down after his adrenaline high. Finally, he looks
	to Karen --

				BLADE
		You okay?

	Karen nods, glances at Gideon --

				KAREN
		How did you know?

				BLADE
		Figured they'd send someone after you. 
		Thought I'd wait around and see who 
		showed up.

				KAREN
		You used me as bait?!

				BLADE
		It worked, didn't it?

				KAREN
		But, he could've --

				BLADE
		He didn't. Get over it.

	Blade kneels next to Gideon. He turns the man's head, inspects the
	neck, the skin behind the ear -- 

				KAREN
		But he's a policeman --

				BLADE
		He's a familiar. A human who works for 
		the vampires. See this mark?

	Blade pushes aside Gideon's hair, revealing a tiny, cryptic symbol
	tattooed into the man's scalp.

				BLADE
		That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire 
		cattle brand. That means Officer 
		Friendly here is someone's property. 
		Any of the other vampire's try to 
		bleed him, they'll have to answer to 
		Friendly's owner --
			(studying the glyph)
		This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. 
		We've been tracking him for a while 
		now --

				KAREN
		Why in God's name would anyone want to 
		work for them?

				BLADE
		Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If 
		they're loyal, if they prove 
		themselves, then their masters will 
		turn them. 

				KAREN
		And that's a good thing?

				BLADE
		For some. Live forever, never get old. 
		The ultimate high. 

	Just then, Gideon MOANS. Blade drags the man up so they're eye to
	eye.

				BLADE
		How 'bout you, Officer? You a good 
		little bloodhound?

	CUT TO:

	EXT. KAREN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSK

	Blade and Karen are now standing by Gideon's police cruiser which is
	parked outside Karen's apartment. Blade shoves Gideon against the
	hood of the cruiser. He finds Gideon's keys, moves to the trunk,
	opens it --

	IN THE TRUNK --

	A sophisticated medical cooling unit for transporting organs. Blade
	opens the unit, coolant vapor hisses out. Inside are plastic bags
	containing blood. 

				BLADE
		Looks like our friend was 
		blood-running.
			(to Gideon)
		Where were you headed?

	Gideon mumbles through a split lip and chipped teeth --

				GIDEON
		Mphuck you --

	WHAM! Blade plants Gideon's face into the hood of the car. Gideon
	GROANS, coughs --

				GIDEON
		Jesus -- 1227 Brookner -- 
		Holliston Clinic --

	Blade releases him, then reaches for his Casull.

				KAREN
		What are you doing?!

				BLADE
		Preventive medicine.

	Karen steps in front of Blade, shielding Gideon.

				KAREN
		You can't do this, he's human, it's 
		murder.

				BLADE
		It's war, now get the fuck out of the 
		way!

	Karen grabs Blade's arm, wrestling with him, trying to push his hand
	away. As the two of them struggle, Gideon makes a break for it,
	stumbling across the lawn. Blade pushes Karen aside, takes aim,
	FIRES --

	-- but Gideon ducks into an alley, disappearing from sight. Blade
	spins on Karen, enraged --

				BLADE
		God-damnit!!! Do you have any idea 
		what you just did?! He'll warn them. 
		They'll be waiting!

	But Karen's defiant, she's not backing down.

				KAREN
		You were going to kill him. What was I 
		supposed to do?! Shut my eyes and 
		pretend I didn't see what I saw? 

	Blade tears off his glasses. Karen gasps --

	BLADE'S EYES

	aren't human, nor are they vampire. They're something else -- emerald
	green, laced with swirling flecks of red. 

				BLADE
		Let me set you straight on something, 
		Doctor. What you've "seen" so far is 
		nothing. The world you live in's just 
		the sugar-coated topping. There's 
		another world beneath it, the real 
		world -- and it's a fucking bloodbath. 
		If you want to survive in it, you'd 
		better pull your head out of your ass. 

	Blade slips his glasses back on, leaving Karen shocked into silence.
	He heads for his Olds without looking back, climbs in, guns the
	engine. In seconds, he's gone, tearing off down the street in a cloud
	of exhaust.

	EXT. EDGEWOOD TOWERS, PENTHOUSE - DUSK

	We are soaring through the air above the gleaming city skyline,
	moving towards the Edgewood Towers whose windows reflect the blood-
	red sinking sun.

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, POOL - NIGHT

	Suffused lighting, elegant tile-work featuring evocative mosaics, the
	quiet strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC -- 

	MERCURY,

	the lupine Gaultier girl from the club, glides beneath the water,
	surfacing at the deep end. We SEE --

	FROST

	lounging in a chair, studying a laptop which rests beside him. On the
	screen is a digitized image -- a page taken from an ancient
	manuscript, written in a secret tongue.

	Officer Gideon waits nearby, cradling his ruined hand, his battered
	face cast downward like a boy who's been called into the Principal's
	office. 

				GIDEON
		Look, I know you're disappointed --

				FROST
		Crestfallen.

				GIDEON
		Blade was waiting for me. There wasn't 
		anything I could do.

	Frost nods, lapsing into brooding contemplation.

				FROST
		Tell me something, Gideon, what blood 
		type are you?

	Gideon hesitates. Is this a trick question?

				GIDEON
		I don't really know --

				FROST
		Take a wild stab. A? B? O, perhaps? 
		I'm interested in the antigens here, 
		the agglutination reaction --

	Gideon stammers as Frost rises. In the blink of an eye, Frost lifts
	Gideon from the floor, dangling the Officer over the deep end of the
	pool by his throat --

				FROST
		I'm going to guess AB positive.

	Gideon GURGLES as Frost's fingernails pierce his flesh, drawing
	blood. Then Frost releases him --

	Gideon plunges into the pool. Mercury is on him in a heartbeat,
	tearing him apart like a Great White consuming a piece of chum. The
	water churns violently around them, clouding with red.

	When it's over, Mercury rises from the pool, dripping wet, covered
	from head to toe in a crimson sheen. 

	She kisses Frost hungrily, letting Gideon's blood flow from her mouth
	to his. Frost flicks a tongue over his lips.

				FROST
		AB positive. Give the man a prize.

	Below them, Gideon's lifeless body sinks towards the pool bottom, his
	police badge twinkling like sunken treasure.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

	Blade's Olds cruises to a stop. We're in a low-end commercial
	district -- junky heaven. Blade climbs out, pulling an automatic
	rifle from the back seat, then heading into an alleyway. 

	EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

	Blade makes his way down the alley, cautious -- he SEES mountains of
	trash, boarded-up windows, overlapping layers of gang graffiti -- a
	RAT crouching on a trash dumpster, gnawing on a dead pigeon --

	-- then a SOUND behind Blade, the scuffle of feet -- 

	Blade whirls, drawing his sword, CHARGING at an approaching shadow,
	stopping mere millimeters from decapitating --

	KAREN,

	who's been backed up against the wall, her eyes wide with fright.
	Blade's sword vibrates from the tension in his forearm, having drawn
	just the slightest taste of blood.

				BLADE
		What the hell are you doing?! I could 
		have killed you!

	Blade lowers his sword. Karen remembers to breathe. She slumps,
	tracing her fingers over the line where her head almost parted with
	her body.

				KAREN
		I remembered the address. I followed 
		you --

	Blade shakes his head, amazed.

				BLADE
		Do you have a death wish or are you 
		just stupid?

	Karen pushes away from the wall, angry --

				KAREN
		Look, if what you say is true, if 
		there's a chance I could turn into one 
		of them, then I've got no choice, do 
		I? I have to work with you. I need to 
		learn everything I can about them. 
		It's the only way I'll be able to find 
		a cure for myself.

				BLADE
		There is no cure. 

				KAREN
			(defiant)
		You don't know that.

	Blade turns and moves to the end of the alley, studying the graffiti-
	covered wall intently --

				KAREN
		What are you looking at?

				BLADE
			(gesturing)
		What do you see here?

				KAREN
		Graffiti --

				BLADE
		Look closer.

	Blade indicates a design amongst the various gang-banger tags that
	looks something like a post-modern hieroglyphic.

				BLADE
		This isn't a gang tag, it's a vampire 
		marking. It means there's a safe-house 
		nearby. 
		A place they can go if dawn is coming. 

	Blade points to a building across the street --

	THE HOLLISTON CLINIC,

	your basic inner-city blood-barter establishment where desperate
	transients parley their plasma into cash.

				KAREN
			(recognizing it)
		I know this place -- it's a blood 
		bank. 

				BLADE
		Owned by vampires. There's one of 
		these in every major city, and just 
		like Domino's, they always deliver.
			(looking to Karen)
		You telling me you're ready to walk 
		through that door?

	Karen nods. Blade continues to stare at her, taking her measure --
	there's a strength in this woman's eyes, she has the soul of a
	fighter -- and Blade recognizes it. 

				BLADE
		All right, then, listen up, Vampire 
		Anatomy 101. Crosses and running water 
		don't do dick, so forget what you've 
		seen in the movies. 

	Blade enumerates the following on his fingers:

				BLADE
		You use the stake, silver, or 
		sunlight, got it? 

	Blade holds up one of his Casulls. 

				BLADE
		Know how to use one of these?

	Karen takes the weapon from him, eyes all over it.

				KAREN
		No.

	Blade takes the gun back, snorting derisively.

				BLADE
		Safety's off, round's already 
		chambered -- 
			(cocking it)
		Silver hollow-points filled with 
		garlic. You aim for the heart or the 
		head, anything else is a one-way 
		ticket to a pine box.

	Blade hand it to her again, then starts across the street towards the
	clinic. Karen follows --

	INT. HOLLISTON CLINIC, LOBBY - NIGHT

	Blade enters, swinging his rifle around for all to see.

				BLADE
		Get out. Now.

	The POTENTIAL DONORS scramble for the exit. Behind the counter,
	TANAKA, a male nurse, reaches for an alarm button. Blade vaults over
	the counter, aiming his rifle. 

				BLADE
		I know you're blood-running. Who's 
		your sponsor? 

				TANAKA
		I don't know what you're --

	POW! Blade backhands him across the face hard enough to loosen his
	teeth. Karen flinches, stepping forward -- 

				KAREN
		What if you've made a mistake?

	Blade pins Tanaka's head to the wall, turning it to the side --
	revealing the man's glyph. It's different than Gideon's, looking more
	like a Japanese kanji character.

				BLADE
		What's this? A birthmark?

	Blade grips Tanaka by his collar, shoving him through a doorway --

	INT. HOLLISTON CLINIC, SUPPLY ROOM - NIGHT

	Karen and Blade SEE supply cabinets, cots, a number of locked
	refrigeration units. Blade FIRES into the door handle of one of the
	units, tears it open -- the fridge is stacked floor to ceiling with
	plastic packets of blood.

				BLADE
			(to Karen)
		Still think we might be wrong?
			(to Tanaka)
		How much are you shipping?

				TANAKA
		Bite me!

	Blade opens FIRE, sweeping his rifle around the room, shooting
	everything in sight. Glass cabinetry shatters, ampoules and
	vacutainers go flying. Tanaka cowers, arms wrapped about his head.

	Blade stops shooting. He leans down towards Tanaka, placing the end
	of his rifle against the man's forehead. Tanaka looks like he's about
	to wet his pants.

				BLADE
		I've got a message for your masters -- 
		the night's no longer safe for their 
		kind.

	Blade pulls back his rifle, leaving a red indentation mark where the
	end of the rifle barrel pressed into Tanaka's skin. He starts towards
	the exit. Karen follows.

	CUT TO:

	INT. BLADE'S OLDS - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen return to the Olds. He keys the ignition, lets the
	engine idle. They're parked down the street from the blood clinic.
	Karen looks to Blade, confused --

				KAREN
		You let him go -- 
			(off Blade's nod)
		An hour ago you were ready to kill a 
		man for less, this one didn't even 
		talk.

				BLADE
		He will.

	Blade points --

	THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD --

	Tanaka rushes from the clinic, climbing behind the wheel of a Mustang
	parked nearby. He takes off -- 

	Blade follows the Mustang, CLICKING on a cell-phone scanner mounted
	on the dash. Numbers flash on the LCD screen as it searches for a
	signal, then locks onto it. We hear a DIAL TONE, then a number being
	dialed --

				AUTOMATED VOICE
			(filtered, on scanner)
		"You've reached a number that is no 
		longer in service. Please consult your 
		operator and try again".

				TANAKA'S VOICE
			(filtered, on scanner)
		It's Tanaka, PIN number 
		sixteen-zero-zero-nine --

	A "real" voice comes on the line:

				VOICE
			(filtered, on scanner)
		Yes?

	Karen looks to Blade, impressed. 

	INT. TANAKA'S MUSTANG - NIGHT

	Tanaka speeds, shouting into the speaker phone -- 

				TANAKA
		Get me Pearl! 

				VOICE
			(filtered, on speaker)
		Pearl is feeding --

				TANAKA
		Look, I'm not fucking around here! 
		That hunter Frost has been talking 
		about? He was just at the clinic. Tore 
		the goddamn place apart!

	EXT. THE BLACK PEARL - NIGHT

	Tokyo town. A black edifice, no windows, secured parking, no signage
	except for a purple neon scroll above the entrance -- a FLASHING
	KANJI, just like the glyph tattooed on Tanaka's neck.

	Tanaka's Mustang pulls into the parking lot. He climbs out, flagging
	away the valets, heads inside --

	WHIP PAN TO

	Blade's Olds stopping a few blocks down the street.

	INT. BLADE'S OLDS - NIGHT

	Blade kills the engine, studying The Black Pearl.

				BLADE
		Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place 
		is crawling with them.
			(pointing)
		See the valets over there? They're 
		vampires. So is the doorman.

				KAREN
		How can you tell?

				BLADE
		The way they move, they way they 
		smell --

	Blade continues to scan the area, pointing out a few more likely
	candidates --

				BLADE
		The whore on the corner, she's one 
		too. So are the two men standing under 
		the streetlight.

	Blade reaches into the back seat, retrieves his sword and a satchel.
	He snaps open his shotgun, loads it. Karen continues to study the
	vampires Blade identified.

				KAREN
		So many of them -- I still can't 
		believe they're real.

				BLADE
		There are worse things than vampires 
		out there.

				KAREN
		Like what?

				BLADE
			(pumping his shotgun)
		Like me.

	Blade reaches for the door --

	EXT. THE BLACK PEARL - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen climb out. He lets his shotgun fall within the folds
	of his longcoat and starts across the street -- only to be challenged
	by a HULKING DOORMAN at the entrance.

				DOORMAN
		I'm sorry, sir -- do you have an 
		invitation?

	INT. BLACK PEARL - NIGHT

	CRASH! The front door flies open as the Doorman's body sails through.
	Blade enters, Karen at his heels -- 

	The 'Pearl' is an all-hours strip club cum casino catering
	exclusively to Japanese zaibatsu clientele. Dimly lit, the air thick
	with cigarette smoke, deafening MUSIC. Go boards, pachinko machines,
	sexy little MANGA WAIFS in schoolgirl outfits doling out drinks --

	STRIPPERS writhe in the circular "pit" tables surrounded by HOWLING
	grab-ass men. But that's nothing compared to --

	The MAIN ATTRACTION,

	who's doing a bump and grind down the runway, shaking a body worthy
	of a schoolboy's wet dream. Her attire? A leather S&M face mask,
	nipple rings, 6-inch spikes, and a pair of panties to hide her
	modesty.

	Blade scans the room -- just in time to see Tanaka ducking into a
	back hallway. Blade pushes towards the rear of the club. Karen
	follows. 

	ON THE STRIPPER

	as she catches sight of Blade and freezes in mid-routine. The
	stripper pulls off her hood. Long black hair with a streak of white
	tumbles down her back -- it's Mercury. 

	INT. BLACK PEARL, HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen head past the bathrooms. At the end of the hall is a
	door marked "OFFICE". Just then, the Men's door opens, a DRUNK
	COLLEGE KID steps out, SEES Blade --

				KID
		Hey --

	Blade plants a hand over the kid's face, shoving him back into the
	bathroom as he kicks open the office door --

	INT. THE BLACK PEARL, BACK OFFICE - NIGHT

	Tanaka spins around, startled, tries to throw a punch -- 

	Blade traps Tanaka's arm, levering the man up and over. He CRASHES
	into a shelving unit, taking the whole thing down with him. Karen
	winces. Blade grabs a handful of Tanaka's hair, yanks his head up --

				BLADE
		Where's the entrance?!

				TANAKA
		I can't -- they'll kill me!

	Blade rips off his glasses and gives Tanaka an eyeful -- his irises
	pulse and glow. 

				BLADE
		I got news for you, butt-boy. You're 
		already dead. 

				TANAKA
			(terrified)
		Oh God, shit -- behind the bookcase --

	Blade drops Tanaka, moves to the bookcase. He searches the wall a
	moment, then finds a trigger. Hits it -- the bookcase slides aside,
	revealing a hidden elevator. As Blade moves to put his sunglasses
	back on --

	BLADE'S POV (IN THE REFLECTION OF HIS SUNGLASSES)

	We see Tanaka behind him, pulling a handgun out of a desk drawer,
	swinging it up --

	Blade unholsters one of his Casulls faster than any gunslinger in
	history. He FIRES over his own shoulder, BLOWING Tanaka back against
	the wall. 

	Blade puts his sunglasses back on, motions to the elevator, then nods
	to Karen --

				BLADE
		After you. 

	INT. THE BLACK PEARL, ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	The elevator descends. Then a tone CHIMES, signaling the end of the
	ride. The doors hiss open -- 

	INT. THE VAMPIRE ARCHIVES, HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen enter the narrow, maze-like "stacks" of the vampire
	archives, weaving their way through shelves of climate-controlled,
	digitized records. 

				KAREN
		What is this place?

				BLADE
		Some kind of archive --

				KAREN
		Isn't this all a little high-tech? I 
		thought vampires were more into 
		cobwebs and coffins.

				BLADE
		You've been watching too much TV. 
		They've got their claws sunk into 
		everything -- finance, real estate, 
		politics. Probably own half of 
		Downtown. 

	Blade pulls a CD-ROM from the shelves, its spine labeled in
	indecipherable vampire glyphs.

				BLADE
		This must be where they keep their 
		records --

	He pauses, hearing a DISTANT WHISPER. Blade signals quiet, silently
	leading Karen through the stacks towards -- 

	PEARL'S LAIR

	A vestibule of sorts, leading to a larger bed chamber constructed of
	rice paper shoji screens and tatami mats. Candles glow within,
	illuminating a MONSTROUSLY OBESE SHADOW beyond the translucent rice
	paper walls.

	The shadow speaks in a tremulous, bird-like voice -- the secret
	tongue. As Blade draws his sword, the massive shadow freezes --

				PEARL'S VOICE
			(frightened)
		Lorca, is that you?

	Blade slides open the nearest shoji screen --

	INT. PEARL'S BED CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Nothing Karen's seen up until this point could prepare her for the
	archive's curator --

	PEARL,

	a nine-hundred-pound androgynous vampire of Asian origin, lounging
	amidst pillowed rice mats, wearing a communications headset. Think of
	a cross between Divine and Jabba The Hutt. Skin the complexion of
	buttermilk, so corpulent he can barely move, so engorged with blood
	that he's actually sweating it from the pores of his skin. 

	Pearl is surrounded by a nest of monitors and keyboards which have
	been affixed to counter-balanced arms -- this way, Pearl can access
	information without leaving bed.

	Lying next to Pearl, dwarfed by the vampire's massive size, is the
	chalk-white body of a recently-drained NAKED BOY. 

	At the sight of Blade, Pearl's eyes widen in fear --

				PEARL
			(into a speakerphone)
		He's here!

				FROST'S VOICE
			(over speakerphone)
		Congratulations, Day-Walker.

				BLADE
		Frost?

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, POOL - NIGHT

	Frost paces the length of his pool, wearing a hands-free
	communications headset, grinning.

				FROST
		In the flesh, Blade. I understand 
		you've been looking for me. I'm 
		flattered.

	INT. PEARL'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

	As Blade listens, Pearl reaches for his trackball, attempting to
	delete the document currently on his monitors -- but Blade lunges
	forward, sinking the tip of his sword into Pearl's fleshy throat.
	Pearl freezes. 

				BLADE
			(eyeballing Pearl)
		Don't be. You're another notch on my 
		sword hilt, nothing else.

	Frost's DEEP LAUGHTER drifts from the speakerphone.

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, POOL - NIGHT

	Frost settles into his chair, enjoying the cat and mouse.

				FROST
		You're quick, Blade, I'll give you 
		that. In the space of an hour you've 
		crossed my familiar, destroyed a blood 
		bank --
			(beat)
		Now here you are in the heart of our 
		archives, terrorizing our curator.

				PEARL'S VOICE
		He has a knife to my throat, Frost! 
		He --

				FROST
			(cutting him off)
		You're history, Pearl. Have the good 
		grace to die with some dignity.
			(beat)
		Round one to you, Blade.

	INT. PEARL'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

	CLICK, the line goes dead. Blade tosses his satchel on the bed, opens
	it. Inside is a hand-held UV lamp hooked up to a nine-volt battery.
	Pearl eyes the device, fearful -- 

				PEARL
		What is that?

				BLADE
		A sun lamp. We're gonna play twenty 
		questions. Depending on your answers, 
		you might get to have yourself a 
		tanning session. 

	Blade looks to Pearl's monitor and SEES a digitized image, the SAME
	MANUSCRIPT Deacon had been studying earlier. 

				BLADE
		What were you in such a big hurry to 
		delete just now?

	Pearl hesitates. Blade turns on the lamp. Pearl HOWLS as the harsh
	light falls upon him. Blade flicks the light off.

	Pearl cringes, GROWLING, his face smoking profusely. Exposure to the
	UV rays, even for one short second, has made his face blister like a
	plague victim's.

				PEARL
			(relenting)
		It's an epistle, a letter Frost has 
		been translating -- it prophesizes 
		LaMagra's return.

				BLADE
		And who is LaMagra?

	Pearl hesitates again -- Blade turns on the lamp for a longer time.
	Pearl thrashes, covering his face. His hands blacken, the skin
	sizzling away to expose the finger bones beneath. Karen has to avert
	her gaze --

	Blade turns off the lamp. Pearl SNARLS, his body quivering with
	poisonous rage.

				PEARL
		LaMagra is The Sleeper!!! 

	Blade leans in close so he's eye to eye with Pearl.

				BLADE
		Where's the original, Pearl? You must 
		have it around here somewhere.

	Pearl sweats blood, his flaking, slug-like lips quivering. 

				PEARL
		The vault --

	Blade follows Pearl's eyes to an armored door, then he stands back,
	handing the UV rig to Karen.

				BLADE
		If he moves, cook him.

	Blade approaches the vault door, sizing up its locking mechanism. He
	pulls an explosive charge from his combat belt and secures it to the
	door, arming it with a BEEP!

				PEARL
		Please, I'll give you the combination 
		-- you'll damage the documents --

				BLADE
		That's the point.

	Enraged, Pearl LUNGES from his bed. Karen triggers the UV rig, flash-
	frying him to a blackened crisp. Pearl quivers, his enormous body
	smoking like a piece of charred meat. 

	Blade looks back at Karen with newfound respect. She shrugs.

				KAREN
		He moved.

	Blade turns back to the vault, setting off the charge. BOOM! Blade
	kicks the damaged door in, knocking it clear off its hinges --

	INSIDE THE VAULT,

	ancient papers flutter through the smoky air like wind-borne leaves.
	Blade and Karen SEE a lucite-encased document -- fragments of an
	ancient, calligraphied papyrus. 

				KAREN
		What are these?

				QUINN (o.s.)
		Curiosity killed the cat.

	Blade and Karen spin --

	-- QUINN,

	Mercury, and a number of other vampires stand at the entrance to the
	vault.

				QUINN
			(grins)
		Hola, amigo. Remember me?

	Karen triggers the UV light, but Mercury ducks under it, ripping it
	from her hands, crushing it. In a split-second, the she-demon has her
	claws around Karen's throat.

	As Blade reaches for his rifle, the vampires converge on him like
	quicksilver. They drag Karen and Blade out --

	PEARL'S BEDCHAMBER

	The vampires fling Blade against the wall, pinning him. 

				QUINN
		You took my arm, Blade. But that's 
		okay, I'm growing a new one --

	Quinn lifts up his "arm". A skeletal forearm has grown from the
	stump. It's got cartilage, sinew, and muscle, but no flesh yet. 

				QUINN
		Nice, huh? Think I'll ever play the 
		piano again?
			(shrugging)
		You can slice him, you can dice him, 
		and the man just keeps on coming. 

	Blade struggles violently, but Quinn is upon him, pounding his fist
	into Blade again and again and again -- giving him payback with
	compounded interest. When it's over, Quinn steps back, winded -- 

	Blade's head hangs down. He gasps, wincing, every breath sending a
	red hot poker to his gut. Quinn grabs a hold of Blade's jaw, forcing
	his head up. 

				QUINN
		Stay with me, sweetness, I'm not 
		through with you yet.

	Quinn pulls Blade's jacket open, sees the bandoleer of mahogany
	stakes. He tugs one out, admiring it.

				QUINN
		Teak. Nice craftsmanship. 
			(to the others)
		Now here's a man who takes his job 
		just a little too seriously, don't you 
		think?
			(back to Blade)
		Which reminds me, Blade, think I owe 
		you one --

	Quinn stabs the stake into Blade's shoulder. Blade CRIES OUT, tries
	to pull free. Karen, who's being held by Mercury, averts her gaze.

				QUINN
		Actually, if you want to get 
		technical, I owe you two.

	As Quinn reaches for another stake, Blade starts to laugh.

				QUINN
		What's so funny, bright eyes?

				BLADE
		I'm expecting some company.

	It's then that Quinn notices the micro ear-coil radio receiver in
	Blade's ear. As we MOVE IN on it, we hear a tiny VOICE squawking from
	it:

				VOICE
			(filtered)
		Get down!

	Blade kicks his feet out, sending Quinn flying backwards. He tears
	free of the vamps holding him and DIVES forward, knocking Karen to
	the ground just as --

	BOOM!!! The wall of Pearl's bedchamber EXPLODES INWARD, knocking
	Quinn and the rest of his cronies to their feet. 

	WHISTLER

	stands in the smoking hole where the wall used to be, brandishing his
	cane in one hand and an automatic rifle in the other. He balances the
	rifle against his hip like an over-the-hill gunslinger and OPENS FIRE
	on the vampires.

	Blade rolls, snatching up a fragment of the parchment which has blown
	free from the vault. Seconds later, he and Karen are fleeing after
	Whistler, retreating back through his newly created exit.

	INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

	The three of them find themselves ankle-deep in a flooded sewer
	tunnel running parallel to the archives. Whistler pauses, wheezing
	from overexertion. 

				WHISTLER
		Christ, I'm too old for this. Somebody 
		get me a goddamn wheelchair.

	Blade leans against the tunnel wall, GRUNTING as he yanks the stake
	from his shoulder. He then pulls out a light-stick, snapping it,
	illuminating the area in a GREEN GLOW -- disturbing waves of
	GLITTERING COCKROACHES. 

	Meanwhile, Whistler pulls another explosive device from his backpack
	and sets it against the tunnel wall, arming it.

				KAREN
		How did you find us?!

	Whistler taps a tiny radio headset curled around his ear.

				WHISTLER
		We keep in radio contact. 

				KAREN
			(incredulous)
		You've been listening in the whole 
		time?

				WHISTLER
		You think I'd let him run loose 
		without a chaperone? Blade ferrets 
		their rat-holes out, I map them. Then 
		we blow them all to kingdom come.

	Whistler finishes arming the explosive device. It BEEPS. He turns
	back to Blade and Karen, referring to a handheld navigation device.

				WHISTLER
		There's a subway line due East of 
		here. We'd best make tracks. 

	INT. PEARL'S BEDCHAMBER, ARCHIVES - NIGHT

	An EXPLOSION rips through the bedchamber, mushrooming outward --

	INT. BLACK PEARL - NIGHT

	The EXPLOSION continues expanding, sending tables, drinks, and
	zaibatsu clientele flying.

	INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

	As the group splashes through the water, a FIREBALL chases them down
	the tunnel. They duck into an alcove, narrowly avoiding the flames.
	Whistler WHOOPS with excitement, loving every minute of it. But his
	triumph is short-lived, for now we hear --

	-- a deafening chorus of HIGH-PITCHED VAMPIRE WAR CRIES coming from
	behind. Karen hazards a look back --

	THE VAMPIRES

	surge down the tunnel like a pack of hungry wolves on high-octane.
	There must be a dozen of them now and Quinn is right in the lead.

	Our trio hustles along, but Whistler stumbles, tumbling and sliding
	down a washout. The steep incline of the washout makes it virtually
	impossible for Whistler to climb back up to the main tunnel.

				KAREN
		Whistler!

				WHISTLER
		Go on, I'll be fine!

	Karen hesitates, but Blade yanks her down the tunnel --

				BLADE
		He can take care of himself! GO!!!

	They race through the twisting warren of tunnels, taking one turn
	after another, the vampires hot on their heels --

	INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen stumble out into a larger subway tunnel, which widens
	into a station stop up ahead. We can see the RED TAIL-LIGHTS of a
	train just pulling away from the platform -- Blade and Karen re-
	double their efforts, lungs burning, legs pumping like mad. Just as
	the train enters the next tunnel --

	-- they leap, dragging themselves up onto the back of the rear-
	passenger car. Blade SMASHES his fist through the emergency exit
	window, then lifts Karen up, helping her climb through into the
	car -- 

	-- but the vampires are still coming! Crawling along the tunnel walls
	on all fours, limbs a blur, claws striking the concrete and spewing
	out sparks. Closing fast. Too fast. 

	QUINN

	springs forward, snagging Blade's ankle with his "good" hand. The
	vampire's weight threatens to haul Blade down. Blade reaches to his
	back-scabbard, unsheathes his sword --

	THUNK! Blade brings the sword down on Quinn's good arm, cutting it
	off at the wrist! Quinn falls to the tracks, tumbling head over heels
	back into the darkness --

	THE AMPUTATED HAND,

	which continues to clutch at Blade's ankle, starts to melt. With a
	cry of disgust, Blade kicks the thing away. He turns and climbs
	through the window --

	INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT 

	Karen helps Blade inside. He sinks to the floor of the otherwise
	deserted car, exhausted. He's looking ashen now. The whites of his
	eyes are shot through with red.

	Karen gets a good look at Blade's wounds -- the front of his jacket
	is soaked in blood. She reaches for him --

				KAREN
		You're hurt --

				BLADE
		Nothing that won't heal by dawn.

	Blade reaches into his jacket and pulls out the small, gas-powered
	pistol-injector we saw Whistler inject him with earlier. He tries to
	load one of the ampoules into it, but because of his wounds, he's not
	having much luck -- 

				BLADE
			(frustrated)
		I need help with this --

	Karen nods, inserting the ampoule into the gun. Blade shrugs off his
	jacket, holds out his arm. Karen pauses --

				KAREN
		What am I injecting you with?

				BLADE
			(weakly)
		Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin 
		substitute.

	Karen locates a vein, presses the injector against it -- Blade
	tenses, grits his teeth, fights to keep his body thrashing as the
	serum enters his bloodstream. He grips the wall behind him --
	actually digs his nails into the metal surface -- the agony he's
	going through is excruciating, like nothing we could imagine. 

	When it's over, he slumps forward, spent, vulnerable, flushed with
	sweat. Karen stares at him --

				KAREN
		You're one of them, aren't you?

	Blade turns away from Karen, filled with self-loathing. 

				BLADE
		Not quite. I'm a hybrid. Half-human, 
		half-vampire.

	Off Karen's surprised reaction, we --

	CUT TO:

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

	The loading elevator CLANGS to a stop. Blade throws the gate open.
	Karen helps him out. Now that they're safely back, the last of
	Blade's strength seems to dissipate. 

	WHISTLER

	is waiting for them, sitting at a workbench. 

				WHISTLER
		What took you so long?

				BLADE
		Don't even start, old man.

	Blade throws his sword aside, then moves off into the shadows,
	disappearing beyond the curtains. Karen looks to Whistler --

				KAREN
		Why didn't you tell me the truth 
		about him?

				WHISTLER
		We weren't sure we could trust you.

	Whistler sighs, removing his glasses.

				WHISTLER
		Blade's mother was attacked by a 
		vampire while she was pregnant. 
		Ultimately, she died, but her unborn 
		child lived. Unfortunately, he'd 
		undergone certain genetic changes 
		while in the womb --

	Whistler reaches for a pack of cigarettes, pulls one out. He thumbs a
	match, fires up. Takes a long drag --

				WHISTLER
		I found Blade when he was thirteen. 
		He'd been living on the streets, 
		feeding off the homeless. Apparently 
		the Thirst manifested itself at 
		puberty -- 
			(beat)
		I took him for one of them at first, 
		almost killed him, too. But then I 
		realized what he was. 

	CUT TO:

	EXT. EDGEWOOD TOWERS, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

	Frost stands at the window, looking out at the glimmering cityscape
	before him.

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

	Frost turns away from window. Quinn, Mercury, and the other vampires
	from the Black Pearl stand before him. Quinn cradles his amputated
	stump with his newly grown arm. 

				QUINN
		He took my fucking hand! Again!

				FROST
		You seem to be in the habit of losing 
		them fairly often, Quinn. Maybe the 
		amputee lifestyle just suits you.

	The other vampires laugh. Quinn stares them into silence. 

				QUINN
		We need to find him, tonight.

	Frost claps a hand on Quinn's shoulder.

				FROST
		Down, boy. Blade's not going anywhere. 
		I promise. Right now, though, we've 
		more pressing business --
			(off Mercury's look)
		It's time Dragonetti paid the piper. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

	Whistler studies Karen, exhaling another lungful of smoke.

				WHISTLER
		Blade's unique, you know. A one in a 
		billion anomaly. He can withstand 
		sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he 
		still has the Thirst. 

				KAREN
		What happens if he doesn't take the 
		serum?

				WHISTLER
		The Thirst overcomes him, just like 
		the others. It's not something he can 
		control. 
			(sighs)
		The problem is, time's running out. 
		His body's starting to reject the 
		serum. And so far, all my efforts to 
		find a cure have ended in failure --

				KAREN
		No offense, Whistler, but you're not 
		exactly working with state of the art 
		equipment here. You might have missed 
		something.

				WHISTLER
			(pointedly)
		Which is why you're here. We could use 
		someone with your experience.

	A beat passes between them and Karen knows where she stands now. In
	for a penny, in for a pound. Whistler reaches for Blade's sword.

				WHISTLER
		This used to be mine, you know. It's 
		been passed down through the 
		centuries, from one hunter to the 
		next --

	Whistler extends the sword, sighting down the length of it. He takes
	a few practice parries -- it's obvious he used to be quite skilled in
	the art of swordsmanship.

				KAREN
		Why do you hunt them?

				WHISTLER
		Habit, mostly, just like this. 

	Whistler gestures with his cigarette. He finally stubs it out, his
	wistful reverie vanishing like so much smoke.

				WHISTLER
		I had a family once -- a wife, three 
		daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon 
		Frost came calling one evening --

				KAREN
		He killed them?

				WHISTLER
		Eventually. He toyed with them first. 
		He made me choose, do you understand? 
		Which order they would die in --

	Karen stares at Whistler, horrified.

				KAREN
		How did you escape?

				WHISTLER
		I didn't. He was cruel enough to let 
		me live.
			(slapping his brace)
		Even gave me a souvenir to remember 
		him by.

	Karen nods -- it's all falling into place for her now.

				KAREN
		And now you're using Blade to exact 
		your revenge?

				WHISTLER
			(pointedly)
		Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and 
		I'm not getting any younger, am I?

	Just then, we hear a SCREAM come from Blade's room, sounding more
	like the cry of a beast than a man. Karen takes a step towards
	Blade's room --

				WHISTLER
		I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
		It's best to leave him alone when he's 
		like this.

				KAREN
		I'll take my chances.

	INT. BLADE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Karen enters. It's dark, just a trace of moonlight.

				KAREN
		Blade?

	No answer. Then Karen SEES him -- crouched in the corner of the room
	like some kind of nocturnal animal.

				KAREN
		It's dark in here.

				BLADE
		You get used to the darkness.

	Karen takes a step towards him.

				KAREN
		Whistler told me about your mother. 

	Blade clutches the silver locket in his hand. It swings back and
	forth, like a pendulum.

				BLADE
		I can't close my eyes without hearing 
		her scream.

				KAREN
		Those aren't real memories. No one has 
		that kind of recall.

				BLADE
		I do. I remember from day one. People 
		staring at me, sensing I was 
		different. Watching the fear grow in 
		their eyes, knowing in their hearts I 
		wasn't human.

				KAREN
		If you're not human, then why do you 
		bleed like us? 
		I've seen vampire blood, you don't 
		have it running through your veins.

	Blade looks at Karen, his lambent eyes glowing in the moonlight.

				BLADE
		Just get out of here.

				KAREN
		Blade --

	Blade turns, his eyes glowing with preternatural fury. 

				BLADE
		I said, GET OUT!!!

	Karen backs away, startled by Blade's vehemence. She exits, leaving
	him alone with his demons. He holds up one of his empty serum
	ampoules, crushing it in his fist.

				FROST'S VOICE
		Rise and shine, little wing.

	EXT. THE BURNING GROUNDS - JUST BEFORE DAWN

	FADE IN on Dragonetti, his face covered with a black condemned man's
	hood --

	Frost stands before him, grinning like the Cheshire Cat. He's dressed
	from head to toe in a black motorcycle suit -- boots, gloves, a
	visored helmet tucked under one arm. Mercury and Quinn are standing
	nearby, similarly attired. 

	We're on a stretch of rocky coastline, tucked away in a secluded
	cove. Dragonetti has been stripped bare, chained like Prometheus to
	an ancient standing stone. 

				DRAGONETTI
			(straining)
		What is this? Where am I?!

	Frost steps forward, pulling Dragonetti's hood off. Dragonetti stares
	at his surroundings, horrified.

				FROST
		When was the last time you stopped to 
		appreciate a sunrise, Dragonetti? 
		Three, four hundred years? 

	Frost checks his watch, then looks to the ocean. On the horizon, a
	sliver of gold appears. 

				FROST
		How do you like that? Right on time.

				DRAGONETTI
			(snarling)
		The other elders will never let you 
		get away with this!

	Just then, the TWELVE VAMPIRE ELDERS emerge behind Frost, forming a
	circle around Dragonetti. All wear business suits, gloves, along with
	high-tech "sun masks" to protect their faces from the light's lethal
	rays. 

	They stare at Dragonetti like a silent jury. His face darkens, anger
	rising -- but there's a desperation in his eyes now too. He speaks in
	the secret tongue:

				DRAGONETTI
			(subtitled)
		Don't you see, you fools?! He'll 
		betray you too! He's planning on 
		invoking LaMagra himself!

	The vampires just smile and shake their heads.

				FROST
		The wheel turns, old fang. Guess you 
		just got a little too long in the 
		tooth.

	Dragonetti's cries are cut short as Frost forces the aging vampire's
	mouth open, ripping out his fangs with his bare hands. Dragonetti
	GURGLES and SHRIEKS, sounding like a dying animal.

	Frost turns to face the Twelve now, his eyes bright with victory. He
	pulls on his motorcycle helmet, as do Mercury and Quinn. 

	Behind them, Dragonetti struggles furiously against his chains to no
	avail as the first faint rays of daylight fall upon him, channeled
	inward by the natural formation of the cove -- 

	Dragonetti HOWLS, his skin beginning sizzle and smoke. Then he
	catches fire like paper beneath a magnifying glass. He thrashes about
	as his flesh starts to run from his body.

	THE VAMPIRE ELDERS

	watch, impassive, protected by their masks --

	-- when suddenly, TWELVE FIGURES rise up behind them, clad in bike
	helmets and black leather, just like Frost. The intruders grip each
	of the Elders in a strangle hold, ripping their masks off. 

				FROST
		Dragonetti was right. You were fools 
		to trust me.

	Frost flips down the visor of his helmet even as --

	THE RED SUN

	rises in all its fiery glory.

	One by one, the vampire Elder's heads catch fire, skullflesh sizzling
	away -- burning down the line of them in successively building
	intensity until all twelve EXPLODE in a conflagration of BLINDING
	WHITE LIGHT.

	Frost and his compatriots are blown off their feet by the sheer
	intensity of the occult blast -- a blast which sends the skeletal
	bodies of the Elders SLAMMING into the rock wall.

	When it's over, Frost picks himself back up. We SEE that the only
	thing left of Dragonetti and the others are --

	THIRTEEN SHADOW SILHOUETTES

	permanently etched onto the rock's surface, just like the bombing
	victims of Hiroshima. 

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAY

	Karen stands at a lab table with Whistler, preparing a number of
	blood sample vials. They are surrounded by host of new medical
	equipment -- from centrifuges to genetic sequencers and beyond.

	Blade emerges from his room, looks to Karen. As if by silent
	agreement, last night's words go unacknowledged. He straps on his
	bandoleer of stakes, secures his scabbard.

				WHISTLER
		Going somewhere?

				BLADE
		China Town. I need more serum.
			(re: new equipment)
		What's all this?

				KAREN
		I made a trip to the hospital last 
		night, borrowed some equipment.

				BLADE
			(sarcastic)
		For your miracle cure? 

				WHISTLER
		She's been making real progress, 
		Blade.
			(to Karen)
		Show him --

	Karen looks to Blade, who shrugs. She opens a refrigerator, removing
	a syringe filled with blue fluid.

				KAREN
		This is sodium citrate. It's an 
		anti-coagulant. We use it to treat 
		blood-clots sometimes. Vampire blood 
		is thinner than humans, though. Watch 
		what happens when I introduce some 
		into a sample --

	Karen gestures to the microscope. Blade takes a look --

	BLADE'S POV

	Vampire blood cells swirling about.

	Karen injects the contents of the syringe onto the slide of cells --
	the reaction is immediate. The vampire blood turns black, then begins
	violently bubbling.

	Blade lifts his head away from the microscope just in time -- the
	blood on the slide atomizes, exploding outward in a fine mist which
	bursts apart the glass lens of the scope. 

	Whistler laughs, thrilled with the results.

				WHISTLER
		Can you imagine what a dash of that 
		would do on your sword? 

	Whistler claps his hand on Karen's shoulder in approval, then limps
	away, quickly busying himself with another project. Blade moves to
	follow, but Karen stops him --

				KAREN
		Before you go, I'd like to take a 
		sample of your blood.

	Blade grudgingly rolls up his sleeve. As Karen takes her sample,
	Blade looks to Whistler. The older man brings a handkerchief to his
	lips, coughing into it. 

				KAREN
		Is he sick?

				BLADE
		Cancer.

	Karen watches as Blade's blood flows into the vacutainer. She fills
	the first, then inserts another. 

				KAREN
		You care about him, don't you? 

				BLADE
		We've got a good arrangement, that's 
		all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use 
		them, the vampires die -- end of 
		story.

	Karen finishes. Blade rolls up his sleeve.

				KAREN
			(pointedly)
		My mother used to say that a cold 
		heart is a dead heart.

				BLADE
		Your mother sounds like a Hallmark 
		greeting card. 

	Blade slips his Casulls into a shoulder holster, then shrugs into his
	leather jacket, donning his sunglasses.

				BLADE
		I'd wish you luck, Doc, but I never 
		put much stock in optimism.

	He heads towards the elevator.

	EXT. CHINATOWN, STREETS - DAY

	Blade makes his way down a street lined with vending stalls --
	passing MERCHANTS peddling exotic vegetables and cheap curios,
	butcher shops with rows of roast ducks in the window, tyro GANG-
	BANGERS lounging at the entrance to a video arcade.

	BLADE'S POV

	Even though the streets are crowded, the people seem to make way for
	him, avoiding eye-contact. 

	Blade turns into a dark alley, ducking into the doorway of a hole-in-
	the-wall herbalist shop.

	INT. HERBALIST SHOP - DAY 

	A bell atop the door JINGLES, announcing Blade's arrival. We're in a
	dusty, cave-like room filled with baskets and bottle-lined shelves
	featuring things like "Toad Spleen Extract" and "Barking Deer Wine".
	Joss sticks burn, sending wispy tendrils of incense into the air. 

	At the back of the shop, an elderly CHINESE MAN in a cardigan sits in
	front of a battered television, watching a boxing match. He's eating
	a bowl of litchi fruit. On the counter nearby, a SPIDER MONKEY
	watches attentively. 

				BLADE
		How's it going, Kam?

				KAM
			(re: calendar)
		You're a week early.

				BLADE
		I was in the neighborhood.

	Kam sets his fruit bowl aside, leads Blade through a curtain into a
	back room.

	INT. HERBALIST SHOP, BACK ROOM - DAY

	Kam hands Blade a leather valise. He opens it -- its lined with tiny
	ampoules of scarlet-colored serum. Blade pulls one out, holds it up
	to the light.

				BLADE
		Whistler says I'm building up a 
		resistance to it.

				KAM
		I was afraid that might happen.

				BLADE
		Maybe it's time to start exploring 
		other alternatives.

				KAM
		There's only one alternative to the 
		serum.

	Blade nods. They both know what that "alternative" is. 

				BLADE
		Yeah. I know.

	Blade closes the valise and tucks it inside his jacket. 

				BLADE
		Thanks, Kam.
			(thinking)
		One other thing. Have you ever heard 
		of a vampire called the Sleeper?

	Kam shakes his head. Blade pulls out the parchment he took from
	Pearl.

				BLADE
		I found this in there archives. I need 
		to find someone who can read their 
		language. 

	Kam studies the parchment.

				KAM
		I've heard about a woman named 
		Miracia. Some say she's a mayombero, a 
		Santeria witch. Supposedly she lives 
		in that tent community down by the 
		city dump. I'm told she only sees 
		people at night. 

	Blade nods his thanks and heads back through the curtains.

	EXT. CHINATOWN, STREET - DAY

	Blade emerges from the alley into the sunlight, then hears his name
	WHISPERED on the wind.

				VOICE (o.s.)
		Blade.

	Blade spins, scanning his surroundings -- did he really hear his
	name, or was it just the wind?

				VOICE (o.s.)
		Blade.

	Again, the taunting voice calls him. Blade's gaze finally settles
	on --

	A MAN

	sitting on a bench in the deep shade, his face obscured by the
	Chinese newspaper he's reading. There's a LITTLE GIRL sitting stiffly
	beside the man -- a look of pure terror written on her face. 

				MAN
		Afternoon, Blade.

	The man lowers his newspaper. It's Deacon Frost. He's wearing
	sunglasses, but otherwise, he's seemingly unprotected by the sun. 

	Blade reaches for his .454 -- 

				FROST
		Easy.

	Frost's hand rests on the back of the girl's neck. We see his claws
	extend, caressing the flesh beneath her chin.

				FROST
		Wouldn't want our little friend here 
		to wind up on the back of a milk 
		carton, would we? 

	Blade reluctantly lowers his hand. Frost smiles. He takes in a deep
	breath of air, savoring it. 

				FROST
		Beautiful day, isn't it? 

				BLADE
			(confused)
		How can you be out here?

				FROST
		I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical 
		research. We've developed a type of 
		sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a 
		few others things. 

	On closer examination we see that Frost is wearing a translucent
	lotion on his face. He touches a finger to his cheek, rubs some of
	the lotion between his fingers.

				FROST
		It's not very effective in direct 
		sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, 
		of course, is to be like you, "the 
		Day-walker". 

				BLADE
		I don't buy it.

				FROST
		Why not? The future of our race runs 
		through your bloodstream. You've got 
		the best of both worlds, Blade. All of 
		our strengths and none of our 
		weaknesses.

				BLADE
		Maybe I don't see it that way.

				FROST
		Oh, so it's back to pretending we're 
		human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle 
		Tom routine. You can't keep denying 
		what you are. You're one of us, Blade. 
		You always have been.

				BLADE
		You're wrong.

				FROST
		Am I? You think the humans will ever 
		accept a half-breed like you? They 
		can't. They're afraid of you. 
			(pointedly)
		The humans fear us because we're 
		superior. They fear us because in 
		their hearts they know their race has 
		become obsolete.

	Frost watches the marketers stream past, sneering in contempt. 

				FROST
		Look at them, just an endless stream 
		of cattle in a mad race to the 
		slaughterhouse. 

	Frost lifts a silver flask to his mouth, taking a swig of blood. He
	smacks his lips, sighs contentedly --

				FROST
		The pause that refreshes --
			(offering it to Blade)
		Care for some? Smells good, doesn't 
		it? Pungent, with just an 
		irrepressible hint of iron. 

				BLADE
		Pass.

				FROST
		You sure now? I bled a newborn for 
		this. You won't find a drink that's 
		sweeter. 

	It takes every ounce of Blade's self-control to keep from attacking
	Frost -- and Frost senses this, pressing his sharp thumbnail against
	the child's jugular.

				FROST
		Tell me honestly, do you really get 
		the same rush from that pasteurized 
		piss-serum of yours?
			(off Blade's look)
		You're surprised I know about your 
		serum? You shouldn't be. I know 
		everything about you. 

	Frost leans forward, grinning.

				FROST
		You can't keep walking the razor's 
		edge, Blade. The day will come -- and 
		soon, when you'll have to choose 
		between our kind and their's. If I 
		were you, I'd take care not to wind up 
		on the wrong end of the fang.

	A bead of sweat runs down Frost's neck, washing away a minute amount
	of the sun-blocking cream. The patch of exposed skin instantly
	blackens. Frost gazes upwards at the sun.

				FROST
		Love to continue this chat, but it 
		appears I'm melting.

	Frost rises, taking the little girl by the hand. Blade follows, his
	hand resting on the butt of his Casull.

				BLADE
		You're not going anywhere.

				FROST
			(growling)
		Watch me.

	Frost's eyes flicker towards the street -- a CITY BUS is rumbling by.
	In a heartbeat, Frost hurls the little girl forward --

	-- out into the path of the oncoming bus! 

	Blade has a split-second to act. It's Frost or the girl -- and for a
	moment we actually think he's going to go for Frost --

	-- but then he DIVES forward, scooping the girl into his arms,
	throwing themselves out of the bus' path. The bus misses them by a
	hair. By the time Blade looks up again --

	-- Frost is gone. Blade rises, cursing, scanning the street as
	market-goers gather around him.

	WHIP PAN TO --

	SOMEONE sitting astride a motorcycle, watching Blade from the roof of
	an elevated parking garage. The rider is clad from head to toe in a
	helmet and black leather -- Mercury. 

	EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

	Blade's Olds cruises into the gated grounds. It zips down the ramp
	way into the loading elevator.

	BACK BY THE TRAIN TRACKS --

	Mercury's cycle rolls into frame. She picks up a radio handset and
	keys it.

				MERCURY
			(into radio)
		This is Mercury. Tell Deacon I've 
		found their hiding place.

	CUT TO:

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAY

	Blade enters through the loading elevator, finding Karen and Whistler
	hard at work. She turns as he approaches -- SEES him back-lit by the
	sun. She looks pale, the whites of her eyes are streaked with red.

				BLADE
		Any progress?

				KAREN
		Some. It's been slow --

				BLADE
		You don't look so good. 

				KAREN
		I'm just tired, that's all. We've been 
		up all night.

	Blade nods, not buying her explanation. He shoots a glance to
	Whistler, which doesn't go unnoticed by Karen.

				KAREN
		Excuse me.

	Karen turns, heading for the back of the workshop.

	INT. WORKSHOP - BATHROOM - NIGHT

	Karen enters a dingy bathroom, turning on the overhead bulb. She
	studies her reflection in the mirror above the sink, then grimaces as
	she peels the dressing from her wound -- the wound is clearly
	infected, gangrenous. 

				BLADE (O.S.)
		It's started.

	Karen spins, startled. Blade stands behind her. He grips her jaw,
	turning her head so he can better view the wound.

				BLADE
		You've got another day or two at most.

	Karen nods, shaken. As she moves to leave, Blade reaches for her arm,
	stopping her.

				BLADE
		For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

				KAREN
		You make it sound like I'm already 
		dead.

	Blade just stares at her. Finally, she pulls away.

	EXT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DUSK

	CLOSE ON Karen as she moves to the grimy outer windows, watching the
	sun go down, an unmistakable look of dread creeping over her.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. LANDFILL GHETTO - DUSK

	Windy. Urban desolation. Blade stands on the perimeter of a sprawling
	cardboard and plywood squatter's ghetto which has sprung up around
	the city dump. CHILDREN and DOGS forage for salvageable items, while
	in the distance, dumptrucks grind over the dunes of refuse.

	MOMENTS LATER,

	Blade is winding his way through the maze of makeshift homes and
	ashcan fires. A CROWD quickly closes in around him, suspicious. A
	BRUTISH MAN steps forward, challenging him --

				MAN
		Extranjero. ¿Quien es?

				BLADE
		I'm here to see Miracia. Kam sent me.

	The man turns to his fellow squatters, WHISPERING. After a heated
	debate, a GAUNT WOMAN steps forward, motioning --

				WOMAN
		This way.

	CUT TO:

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

	Whistler and Karen sit at a work table. Karen is looking at a blood
	smear slide through a microscope. 

				KAREN
		All right, let's start with the basics 
		-- why do vampires need to drink 
		blood?

				WHISTLER
		Their own blood can't sustain 
		hemoglobin. 

				KAREN
		Then vampirism is a genetic defect, 
		just like Hemolytic anemia?

	Whistler nods.

				KAREN
		So what about gene therapy?

	Whistler looks intrigued. Karen continues.

				KAREN
		Basically you'd have to re-write the 
		victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA 
		will produce proteins capable of 
		generating hemoglobin. 

				WHISTLER
		How?

				KAREN
		With a retrovirus. It's injected into 
		the bone marrow cells, it causes the 
		host's DNA to mutate. They've been 
		using them to treat Sickle-cell 
		anemia. 

	Whistler can hardly believe what he's hearing.

				WHISTLER
		You're serious? You actually think 
		this could work?

	Karen pauses -- we can see in her expression that there's something
	she's been holding back.

				KAREN
		On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so 
		sure -- 
			(gravely)
		The problem is, Blade didn't contract 
		the vampire virus from a bite like I 
		did. He was born with it. The irony 
		is, I could probably cure every 
		vampire but him.

				WHISTLER
		Then we're back to square one, aren't 
		we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always 
		wins.

	At that moment, the lights in the workshop flicker, then go out.
	Karen looks around the room, alarmed. 

				KAREN
		What happened to the power?

				WHISTLER
			(concerned)
		I don't know, but the back-up 
		generator should've kicked in.

	A few seconds pass. The back-up generator still hasn't activated.
	Whistler moves to the window --

				WHISTLER
		UV floodlights are down too.

	As Whistler reaches for a flashlight we hear the sound of GLASS
	SHATTERING coming from the other end of the workshop. Whistler shines
	the flashlight in that direction. We hear more sounds now -- water
	draining, glass tinkling.

	Whistler raises a finger to his lips, signaling silence. He edges
	towards the black-out curtains, Karen falling in behind him.

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - TANK ROOM - NIGHT

	Whistler and Karen enter, cautious --

	THE TANK

	containing the vampire child has been smashed open. It's empty now,
	with just the steadily draining blood seeping across the floor in a
	widening pool -- and a trail of tiny BLOODY FOOTPRINTS leading back
	out into the main workshop.

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

	Karen scans the shadows, eyes alert. We hear a WHISPER, then a
	teasing, childish, GIGGLE.

	Whistler moves the flashlight in a slow circle, shining the beam over
	every inch of the room. And just as he's about to complete his
	circuit --

	THE CHILD

	leaps from where it had been hiding overhead! Karen SCREAMS.
	Whistler is knocked to the floor, the flashlight spinning from his
	hand --

	The feral child lands atop Whistler, HISSING like a cobra. Its
	macrocephalic head seems to morph, twisting into grotesque
	proportions. And just as it's about to strike --

	ZZZZING! Whistler withdraws a silver rapier which had been hidden
	inside his cane. He lunges forward --

	WHOOSH! The child takes off like a blue streak, sending test tubes
	and medical equipment CRASHING to the floor. It zips past Karen --

				WHISTLER
		Get it!!!

	Karen snatches up the flashlight, chasing after it as Whistler
	struggles to his feet --

	Karen sweeps the flashlight around, catching only fleeting glimpses
	of the child as it darts through the workshop. She reaches a shelving
	unit where Whistler's weapons are stored, grabs one of the modified
	pistols --

	Karen tries to draw a bead on the creature. She FIRES, misses, FIRES
	again -- she's getting more unnerved as the seconds tick by and the
	creature is moving closer and --

	-- suddenly it's right in front of her, flying through the air, fangs
	bared! 

	The child knocks Karen back against the wall. It's at her throat,
	sinking its claws into her neck. Karen chokes, forcing Whistler's
	pistol under the monstrosity's chin --

	-- but then the creature morphs again, transforming into a beatific
	little cherubim of a child -- and Karen hesitates, because the child
	seems so goddamned human now and its eyes are luminous, pulsing and
	hypnotic and --

	-- suddenly Whistler reaches in from behind, YANKING the vampire
	child's head back, FIRING a pistol into its skull. The creature
	slumps --

	Karen cries out, disgusted, flinging the corpse away from her. As it
	continues to writhe --

	THUNK! Whistler swings his cane-rapier down on the creature, brutally
	decapitating it. Finishing the job. Then he looks to Karen, winded.

				WHISTLER
		Understand this -- they are monsters. 
		Hesitate for even a moment, and you've 
		lost.

				FROST (O.S.)
		Words to live by, Whistler.

	Whistler spins, eyes wide. He knows that voice.

	DEACON FROST

	steps into the pool of illumination thrown off by the flashlight,
	followed by Mercury and Quinn. 

				FROST
		It's been a long time, hasn't it, "old 
		friend"? 

	EXT. LANDFILL GHETTO - MIRACIA'S CABIN - NIGHT

	Blade is led to a plywood cabin crowded with candle-lit altars --
	garish pictures of Saints and demons abound, alongside bottles of
	roots and herbs steeped in alcohol, human bones, voodoo dolls. 

	MIRACIA 

	sits on a sagging couch outside, clutching a deck of well-thumbed
	Bicycle playing cards. She's ancient, with a mouthful of gold-capped
	teeth and cataract-clouded eyes. Blind.

				MIRACIA
		Is something wrong, my friend?

				BLADE
		You're blind --

				MIRACIA
		There are other ways to see. Sit.

	Blade approaches, uneasy. Miracia deals out the playing cards on a
	rickety table, setting them in nine piles which take on a cross
	formation. 

				MIRACIA
		Perhaps you have brought me something 
		-- an offering for the orishas?

	Blade tosses a handful of bills on the table. Miracia nods, then
	flips over the first card in the center pile -- a one-eyed Jack. She
	sighs, grave --

				MIRACIA
		Hold out your hands.

				BLADE
		I didn't come here to get my palms 
		read. I need something translated.

				MIRACIA
		Show me.

	Blade removes parchment fragment from his jacket and sets it on the
	table. Miracia traces her fingers over the ancient paper, touching
	her fingertips to her lips.

				MIRACIA
		Sangre. Written in blood. 

	She runs her hands over each line as if it were written in Braille.
	Some of the candles gutter, then extinguish themselves as the wind
	around them rises.

				MIRACIA
		This is an old tongue, from an old 
		world. It concerns LaMagra.

				BLADE
		Who is LaMagra?

				MIRACIA
		The vampire God. This speaks of His 
		return.

	Miracia's fingers search the parchment again.

				MIRACIA
		"-- there will come a Day Walker."
			(reading)
		"His blood will call the Sleeper from 
		beyond the Veil of Tears."

	Blade stares at Miracia, shaken.

				BLADE
		His blood -- ?

	The old woman nods, reaching for a smoldering cigarette.

				MIRACIA
		The Day Walker's blood is a disparador 
		-- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's 
		return. One need only consume it and 
		the spirit of his ancestors will 
		settle upon him.
			(reading)
		"And the Sleeper will rise from the 
		shadows anew, cleansing the world in a 
		Tide of Blood."

				BLADE
			(recalling the phrase)
		"The Blood Tide".

				MIRACIA
			(nodding)
		Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is 
		said that all who feel its taint will 
		succumb to the Thirst. 

				BLADE
		How do I stop it?

	Miracia shrugs, spreading her hands.

				MIRACIA
		The Great Wheel turns, my friend. The 
		Dark is rising. How would you fight a 
		shadow? 

	Miracia sits back, slumping into her chair. The candles have burnt
	themselves down to nothing. 

				MIRACIA
		I am tired. Dawn is coming. 

				BLADE
		But I just got here --

				MIRACIA
		You've been here longer than you 
		think. 

	Blade rises, looking to the horizon. Incredibly, dawn is coming. As
	he stands there, mystified, the wind picks up, sweeping the parchment
	fragment out of his hand. He tries to snatch it back, but the
	fragment is quickly borne away. He watches it disappear into the sky,
	then turns back --

	Miracia is gone. Blade glances around him, but she's nowhere to be
	found. 

	CAMERA PULLS BACK,

	isolating Blade amidst the ghostly squalor. From our vantage point,
	he looks like any other homeless phantom.

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAWN

	Blade steps out from the elevator into the workshop --

	The place has been trashed. It looks like a tornado touched down in
	his absence. Blade pulls out one of his .454s, cautious --

				BLADE
		WHISTLER?!

	-- and then he stops dead in his tracks.

	WHISTLER

	has been strung up by his arms against the far wall, tortured and
	left for dead. In response to Blade's voice, a MOAN escapes the dying
	man's lips.

	Blade rushes to the wall, cutting Whistler down with his sword,
	gently lowering him to the floor. As he cradles the old man in his
	arms, Blade sees the primary wound -- two ragged puncture marks along
	Whistler's throat.

				BLADE
		Jesus, Whistler, what did they do to 
		you?

	Whistler opens his eyes, struggling to speak --

				WHISTLER
		Frost took her --

	Whistler spasms and coughs, wincing from the pain.

				BLADE
		Don't try to talk --

				WHISTLER
		Listen. You have to -- finish me off. 
		You don't want me coming back.

				BLADE
		No, we can treat the wounds --

	But Whistler is shaking his hand.

				WHISTLER
		Too far gone, you know that.

	Blade's at a complete loss.

				BLADE
		Whistler, I can't.

	Whistler clutches at Blade's arm, his eyes burning with conviction.

				WHISTLER
		Yes you can. Now get on with it. 

	As much as he'd like to deny it, Blade knows that Whistler is right.
	He pulls a stake from his bandoleer, hesitates.

				BLADE
		Whistler, I --

				WHISTLER
			(cutting him off, more gentle now)
		I know. 
			(forcing a smile)
		Just be quick about it, will you? Do 
		it right.

	Blade fights back tears. With a wretched moan, he turns his head and
	drives the stake into Whistler's chest. Whistler GASPS. Blade wraps
	his arms around the older man, holding him tight as the life runs out
	of him, rocking back and forth --

	After a while, the rocking stops and Blade lays Whistler on the
	floor. Then something catches his eye --

	A SHARP VIEW-CAMCORDER

	resting nearby, labeled, "PLAY ME". Blade reaches for the camcorder,
	cues the tape -- Frost's face appears on the tiny built-in screen.

				FROST
		Hello, Blade. By the time you watch 
		this, Whistler will no doubt be 
		winging his way to Heaven, thanks to 
		your capable hands. If it makes any 
		difference to you, he put up quite a 
		fight.

	Frost touches a deep gash which runs across his cheek.

				FROST
		Now, I'm sure you're wondering about 
		Ms. Jansen's well-being. She's alive 
		and kicking -- "ambulatory", as they 
		like to say in the trade. Whether or 
		not she remains so is entirely up to 
		you.
			(beat)
		I'll make this as easy as possible for 
		you, Blade. You can find us at the 
		Edgewood Towers. We'll be waiting with 
		baited breath.

	The tape cuts to static. Blade throws the camcorder against the wall.
	It shatters into a dozen pieces.

	Blade turns now, his eyes falling on the medical equipment Karen
	brought from the hospital. He moves to the refrigerator, removing a
	canister labeled "SODIUM CITRATE". Then he draws his sword. We can
	practically see the wheels turning within his mind --

	MOMENTS LATER,

	Blade stands before the open flames of one of the furnaces, heating
	his sword in the fire. He withdraws it -- it's molten red.

	Blade turns, dousing the molten hot sword into the sodium citrate
	canister. The refrigerated liquid reacts with the heat, causing the
	sword to STEAM and HISS.

	When Blade withdraws the smoking sword, we SEE that the gleaming
	steel has changed colors, taking on a bluish tinge, just like the
	sodium citrate it was immersed in. Blade smiles to himself,
	satisfied.

	CUT TO:

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, INNER CHAMBER - DAY

	Sparse decor in a Neo-Japanese vein. Minimalist lighting. The walls
	are glass. Recirculating pumps send a constant stream of water
	cascading down them.

	Karen is escorted into the room by Mercury. She gestures to a chair
	at the end of a long table. Karen sits. 

	FROST 

	leans forward out of the shadows, resting his elbows on the table,
	hands steepled together. 

				FROST
		Well, here we are, Doctor.

	A cigarette appears in Frost's hand. In the blink of an eye, the
	cigarette is lit, burning. The movements are so quick we barely have
	time to register them. 

				KAREN
		Why haven't you killed me yet? 

				MERCURY
		Deacon likes to play with his food 
		before he eats it.

	Frost laughs. Karen tries to keep calm. The longer she keeps them
	talking, the longer she remains alive.

				KAREN
		How many of you are there?

				FROST
		A few thousand scattered about the 
		globe. In the past, we've had to 
		restrict our numbers for fear of 
		discovery. That won't be necessary 
		after tonight. 

				KAREN
		What happens then?

				FROST
		The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied 
		holy war against the humans. There's a 
		force, you see -- a spirit that exists 
		in our blood. I've discovered a way to 
		invoke it.

				KAREN
		LaMagra --

				FROST
		That's right. The answers were there 
		all along, of course, scribbled down 
		in the forgotten languages of my kind. 
		Waiting for someone with the patience 
		to decipher them. 
		My elders were foolish enough to 
		dismiss them as wives tales. But I 
		knew better. 
			(beat)
		Imagine my surprise when Blade turned 
		out to be the key which would set that 
		force free. 

	Frost sits forward now, impassioned.

				FROST
		LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a 
		spirit, requiring a flesh and blood 
		host in order to manifest himself.

				KAREN
		You.

				FROST
		Who better to usher in the Blood Tide? 

	Karen shakes her head, protesting --

				KAREN
		There's no need for any of this. Your 
		condition can be treated. Whistler and 
		I were working on a cure when --

				FROST
		What makes you think we want to be 
		cured? Blood is only part of the 
		equation. The hunt, the killing, 
		that's what the Thirst is really 
		about.

				KAREN
		But you use blood banks --

				FROST
		Only as a last resort. Preserved blood 
		is inferior. There's no flavor left to 
		it, no life. 
			(rising from his seat)
		Fortunately, I've found a way around 
		that particular obstacle. 

	Frost moves to the end of the room. He pushes a button. With a HUM
	the wall slides open, revealing something Karen wishes she'd never
	seen -- living blood banks.

	THREE SEDATED HUMANS

	have been hooked up to IV feeds which replenish various nutrients as
	their blood is drained from them. Shunts have been implanted in their
	forearms which serve as taps. 

				FROST
		Under these conditions I can keep a 
		donor alive for years, producing 
		anywhere from fifty to a hundred pints 
		of blood.
			(admiring his charges)
		Of course, this is just a pilot 
		program, really. Once the Tide comes, 
		we'll need to expand production. So 
		many more mouths to feed -- 

	Karen turns away, overwhelmed by revulsion. 

				KAREN
		You're a monster.

				FROST
		Why? Because we live at another 
		species' expense? Your people farm 
		cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening 
		them up with steroids? It's called 
		evolution, Doctor. Survival of the 
		fittest. 

	Frost stares at Karen with an intense, uncompromising gaze. 

				FROST
		I have a wake-up call for the human 
		race. You're no longer at the top of 
		the food chain.

	EXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOFTOP - DAY

	BLADE'S POV

	A telephoto view of Frost's penthouse. The windows are polarized,
	blocking out the sun's harsh rays.

	Blade lowers a pair of binoculars. He's standing on the roof of a
	building across the street. He hefts an air-launcher rifle up into
	firing position --

	BANG! An iron spike trailing a steel cable rockets through the air
	between the two buildings, sinking into the concrete facade of
	Frost's penthouse. Blade secures his end of the rope. He slips a
	pulley over the rope, grabs hold of two handles, and leaps off the
	roof ledge!

	WHOOSH! Blade slides towards Frost's penthouse, a good twenty stories
	above street level. A second before he reaches the windows, Blade
	lets go. Momentum sends him CRASHING through in a shower of glass.

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - DAY

	An ALARM is ringing. Sunlight streams in through the broken window.
	TWO VAMPIRE GUARDS who have been caught in the sudden swath of light
	are burning up before our eyes. Blade climbs to his feet --

	A THIRD VAMPIRE

	leaps at him. Blade spins, flipping the vampire over his shoulder,
	sending him straight through one of the other windows --

	EXT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - DAY

	The vampire tumbles earthward, SCREAMING as the sun's rays ignite his
	body, falling like a human comet.

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - DAY

	Blade unsheathes his sword and heads out into the hall --

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, HALLWAY - DAY

	To Blade's right is the inner chamber with the "waterfall" walls. As
	ANOTHER VAMPIRE approaches, Blade readies his sword --

				VAMPIRE
		You think I'm afraid of that toothpick 
		of yours?

				BLADE
		You should be. I've made some 
		improvements.

	And with that, Blade thrusts his blackened sword forward, right
	through the vampire's chest. 

	The creature SHRIEKS and atomizes -FWOOSH!- flying apart in a fine-
	beaded spray of blood mist. 

	Up ahead are a set of steel doors with a time-lock mechanism. Blade
	draws a Casull, BLASTS away at the lock, then shoulders the doors
	open --

	INT. FROST'S SLEEPING CHAMBER - DAY

	We are in a windowless, vault-like room dominated by a series of
	high-tech STAINLESS STEEL SARCOPHAGI. Think of a hyperbaric coffin, 
	each unit possessing a small face-plate window through which the 
	sleeping subject can be viewed.

	Blade unsheathes his sword. He grabs the lid of the first
	sarcophagus, HEAVING upward. With a PNEUMATIC HISS, the lid rises,
	belching out a cloud of condensation mist. 

	As the mist clears, revealing the occupant within, Blade raises his
	sword, ready to plunge it downward -- only it's not Deacon Frost who
	rests beneath him, it's --

	VANESSA,

	Blade's mother!!! Although some thirty years have passed since the
	events of our prologue, Vanessa looks exactly the same -- vibrant,
	beautiful, full of life. Her eyes open.

				VANESSA
		Jason. 

	Blade gasps, uncomprehending.

				BLADE
		Mother -- ?!

	Vanessa rises from the sarcophagus, tears staining her cheeks.

				VANESSA
		I've missed you so much, Jason. 
			(drawing closer)
		You have no idea what I've been 
		through, how much I've wanted to see 
		you -- 

	Blade falters, his mind reeling. What he's seeing is incomprehensible
	-- his mother is dead. Yet, here she is in the flesh, reaching out to
	him and --

	-- flashing a mouthful of viper-like fangs! She SNARLS and strikes,
	brutally raking her claws across Blade's face, knocking the sword
	from his grasp --

	A TRIO OF BLACK-CLAD VAMPIRES

	led by Mercury step from the shadows where they'd been waiting all
	along. They're armed with tasers which they fire en masse --

	Blade is hit by the taser darts from all sides. He writhes as
	electricity courses through him, then collapses in a heap. He labors
	to lift his head, looking up at Vanessa -- 

				BLADE
		But you -- died --

				VANESSA
			(a hellish smile)
		Deacon brought me back. 

				BLADE
		Fight him --

	As if on cue, Frost appears at Vanessa's side, wrapping a proprietary
	arm about her waist, kissing the nape of her neck. She leans into him
	-- an act of practiced intimacy.

				FROST
		She can't. She's one of my thralls 
		now. She has about as much free will 
		as a puppet on a string.
			(looking at Vanessa)
		You love me, don't you, Vanessa? 

				VANESSA
		Yes.

	Frost kisses Vanessa hungrily. Then he kneels and reaches into
	Blade's jacket, retrieving a vial of Blade's serum.

				FROST
		What do we have here? Your precious 
		serum? I don't think you'll be needing 
		this anymore.

	Frost crushes the vial in his fist. Blade struggles to reach Frost,
	stretching a palsied hand upwards --

				BLADE
		Please -- 

				VANESSA
		Listen to your father, Jason. It's 
		going to be a better world.

	Blade stares at Vanessa uncomprehending. 

				FROST
		Don't look so surprised, Blade. You've 
		spent your life looking for the 
		vampire who fathered you. Well you can 
		rest easy now, you've found him.
			(gripping Blade's chin)
		Daddy's here.

	Blade's eyes widen in shock. Frost simply laughs.

				FROST
		It's true, Blade. You've got my blood 
		running through your veins.
			(smiling)
		Thirty years ago. A moonlit street, a 
		woman on her way home alone. You were 
		conceived the night I tore my fangs 
		into your mother's flesh. 

	Frost swings his fist into Blade's skull. Everything goes black. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. ARMORED TRUCK - NIGHT

	FADE IN as Blade opens his eyes, still groggy, his face beaded with
	sweat. Feverish. His hands have been bound tightly behind his back
	with manacles and chains. 

	KAREN

	sits nearby, watching him. From the steady rocking motion and the
	SOUNDS of traffic outside, it's evident that they are in the back of
	a moving truck.

				KAREN
		Are you all right?

				BLADE
			(weakly)
		I've been better --

				BLADE
		How long have we been driving?

				KAREN
			(shaking her head)
		I don't know. I woke up just before 
		you did --

	As he struggles to sit up, she crosses over to him. Blade shuts his
	eyes for a moment, fighting a wave of pain.

				KAREN
		Is it bad?

				BLADE
			(nodding)
		We get out of this alive, maybe I'll 
		take that miracle cure of yours.

	Karen doesn't respond. Instead she looks away. How in the world is
	she supposed to tell him this?

				KAREN
			(quietly)
		It won't work on you.

				BLADE
		What are you talking about?

	Karen forces herself to meet his gaze.

				KAREN
		Your condition's congenital, the 
		genetic mutations occurred in utero. 
		All the other victims contracted 
		vampirism after birth. 

	Blade stares at Karen, disbelieving. Who could imagine a more
	horrifying irony? She's crying now. She can't help it.

				KAREN
		I can't cure you, Blade. I can cure 
		myself, but I can't cure you.
			(beat)
		I'm so sorry.

	Blade's head sinks, the last vestiges of hope draining out of him.

	And then, as if the final stake were being pounded in, the truck
	lurches to a stop. We hear the ENGINE being killed, then FOOTSTEPS
	approaching, and then a series of BOLTS BEING SHIFTED as --

	-- the back of the truck is thrown open. Frost stands there,
	grinning, flanked by Mercury, Quinn, Vanessa, and a half-dozen other
	VAMPIRE ASSOCIATES. 

				FROST
		Welcome home, children.

	EXT. THE BANK OF EREBUS - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen are dragged from the back of the truck, which is
	revealed now to be an armored car. 

	THE BANK OF EREBUS

	rises up before them. A towering beaux-arts edifice situated in the
	heart of the city's high-priced financial district -- one of the many
	institutions owned and operated by the vampire enclave.

	Frost starts up the marble steps towards a grand, triple-arched
	entrance flanked by Corinthian columns. Karen and Blade are dragged
	along after him. 

	INT. BANK OF EREBUS - ATRIUM - NIGHT

	Frost leads his vampires into a high-ceilinged atrium, moving towards
	a bank of elevators -- one of the doors of which is outfitted with a
	high-tech hand-key ID system.

	Frost places his palm on the ID screen. The screen GLOWS GREEN,
	acknowledging his identity. In response, the doors HISS open.

	INT. SECURITY ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen are pulled inside the elevator. The control panel
	buttons have vampire glyphs, rather than numbers. Frost presses the
	bottom one. The doors close with a WHOOSH and the car descends --
	down, down, down.

	Frost glances over at Karen, smiling amiably.

				FROST
		On its surface, this building houses 
		one of the city's oldest financial 
		institutions -- and for over 
		two-hundred years its served our 
		corporate needs. Look beneath the 
		surface, however, and you'll discover 
		another truth entirely --

	The elevator CHIMES, having arrived at its destination. The doors
	HISS open, revealing 

	INT. THE TEMPLE OF NIGHT 

	A vast, barrel-vaulted chamber lined with recessed tombs stretches
	out before us -- an underground cathedral of sorts, wrought from
	alabaster and marble. Restrained. Elegant. Replete with dark
	splendor.

				FROST
		As above, so below.

	Torches burn in wall sconces, casting everything in a warm, amber
	glow. Frost takes in the beauty of the place.

				FROST
		Welcome to our hall of ancients, 
		Doctor. We call it the Temple of 
		Night.

	Blade and Karen are led to the middle of the room, where a stone
	altar rises up from a dais. Blade is roughly thrown to the ground. He
	kneels there, eyes cast downward. Broken. His system being assaulted
	by the devastating effects of the Thirst. 

	Quinn and Mercury pick their way through Blade's discarded gear.
	Quinn picks up the punching dagger, admiring it. 

	Frost turns to Mercury, who's been holding Blade's scabbarded sword.

				FROST
		Let's see this sword of his.

	Mercury draws the sword, handing it to Frost. He sights down the
	length of it, testing its weight. With a flick of his wrist, he
	lashes out, slashing Blade's cheek open. 

				FROST
		Still quite sharp, I see.

	Blade feebly struggles to rise. Frost clubs him on the back of the
	neck with the sword pommel. Blade crumples. Karen tries to pull free,
	but Quinn holds her tight.

				KAREN
		Blade --

				FROST
		You're wasting your breath, woman. He 
		can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, 
		you see? It already has him in its 
		grip.

	Frost reaches down, dragging Blade's head up by his hair. Karen
	watches on as Frost continues to taunt him.

				FROST
		How long has it been since you had 
		your serum? Twelve hours? More? You 
		must be quite thirsty by now.

	He crouches down so he's eye to eye with Blade.

				FROST
		What does it feel like? Is your blood 
		on fire? Are you burning up inside? 
		Give in to the Thirst, Blade. Embrace 
		your true nature.

	Blade shivers, grits his teeth, it's like he's going through heroin
	withdrawal. 

				BLADE
		-- go to hell --

	Frost smiles, his eyes burning with an infernal glow.

				FROST
		I've got news for you, Blade. We're 
		already here.

	Frost turns to the others, motioning.

				FROST
		Take him to the sanctuary. It's time 
		he was bled.

	The other vampires retreat, dragging Blade along with them. Karen is
	left alone with Frost and Quinn.

				FROST
		I'd let you watch the proceedings, 
		Doctor, but I'm afraid that privilege 
		is reserved for members of my own 
		race. Don't worry, though, I've made 
		alternate arrangements for you.

	Frost motions and Quinn drags Karen towards --

	THE MOUTH OF A PIT

	some forty feet deep, its lichen-encrusted stone walls worn smooth
	over time. As Frost gestures to the yawning darkness beneath them,
	Quinn forces Karen towards the edge. 

				FROST
		We call this the Bone Pit. It's where 
		we keep our mistakes, the ones who 
		couldn't successfully make the 
		transition from human to vampire. 

	Frost reaches out, caressing Karen's neck, puncturing the soft flesh
	beneath her chin with a razored fingernail.

				FROST
		They'll feed on anything, given the 
		chance -- animals, corpses, even other 
		vampires.

	Frost nods. Karen struggles against Quinn, but it's no good. In a
	manner of seconds, she's falling --

	INT. BONE PIT - NIGHT

	-- making a decidedly rough landing on a heap of bones far below. She
	GROANS, taking stock of her battered body.

	UP ABOVE,

	Deacon watches from the lip of the pit, amused. 

				FROST
		Of course, a strapping young woman 
		like yourself -- well I think you just 
		might be considered finger food.

	And with that, he's gone, stepping away from the pit.

	INT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - BLEEDING CHAMBER - NIGHT

	We are in a small, elevated antechamber which is situated above the
	main vampire sanctuary.

	BLADE, 

	now weakened to the point of collapse, is being lashed to a rack-like
	device by iron chains. 

	Mercury and her cohorts move efficiently, quickly securing him. When
	they are through, the rack is hoisted up into the air via a series of
	winch-driven chains. 

	With every turn of the winch crank, the chains are drawn tighter,
	causing Blade to CRY OUT, until at last, he is suspended in mid-air,
	spread-eagle. 

	FROST

	approaches, still carrying Blade's sword.

				FROST
		It's been a long road, hasn't it? Such 
		a pity Whistler led you so far astray. 

	Frost cocks his head to the side, studying Blade's face.

				FROST
		I don't blame you, though. I want you 
		to know that. Even after all you've 
		done. I understand, Blade, I really 
		do. It's the human side of you which 
		has corrupted your reasoning, made you 
		weak. But we'll take care of that, 
		won't we?

	Blade struggles to lift his head, forcing himself to match Frost's
	gaze, shaking with hatred.

				BLADE
		I'd kill myself -- before I turned 
		into something like you.

	Frost just smiles and shakes his head.

				FROST
		No you wouldn't. I'm going to bleed 
		you dry, Blade. All the poison that 
		makes you human. 
			(drawing closer)
		When the Tide comes, you'll be begging 
		me put you through the Change. 

	Frost lifts up Blade's sword, methodically slitting Blade's wrists
	one by one. He makes the cuts lengthwise, opening up the cephalic and
	basilic veins with surgical precision.

	Blood wells up from the fresh wounds, running down Blade's forearms,
	collecting in a cistern beneath his feet. 

	Frost watches the steady, inexorable process, then nods, satisfied.
	He looks to the others who are gathered behind him, watching on with
	silent reverence.

				FROST
		It's done. We should ready ourselves 
		for the ritual of invocation.

	Frost leads Mercury, Quinn, and the others from the sanctuary.

	Blade struggles futilely against his bonds, crying out in
	frustration, his body eventually sagging from exhaustion. 

				VANESSA (O.S.)
		There's no use fighting us, Jason. 

	Blade looks up, focusing now on --

	VANESSA, 

	who has remained behind. Blade stares at her. As terrible as his
	physical torment is, his mother's betrayal is infinitely worse.

				BLADE
		How could you be a part of this?

				VANESSA
		These are my people now. I'm one of 
		them.

				BLADE
		You don't have to be. 

				VANESSA
		You don't understand. I've killed, 
		I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it. 

	She draws closer, caressing her son's face. There's just a hint of
	creepy eroticism in her action, a dash of incest. 

				VANESSA
		I wish you could see the world as I 
		do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no 
		turning back from that.

				BLADE
		I don't believe that.

				VANESSA
		You will. Time is on our side. Sooner 
		or later, the Thirst always wins.

	Vanessa turns away now. Blade cries after her --

				BLADE
		Mother!

	Vanessa pauses, looking back, smiling cruelly.

				VANESSA
		Your mother died the night you
		were born. 

	And with that, she's gone, melting into the shadows. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. THE BONE PIT - NIGHT 

	Karen rises, wary, taking in her shadowed surroundings. 

	HEAPS OF HUMAN BONES

	are piled against the pit walls -- skulls, rib-cages, femurs, tibias
	-- all picked clean of flesh. Some of the skulls have large, canine-
	like fangs -- the remnants, no doubt, of long-deceased vampires.

	Suddenly we hear a WHISPER of sorts, the soft CLINKING of bone
	fragments grinding together --

	Karen spins, trying to place the source of the sound. Then she hears
	the SOUND again. Behind her now, closer.

				REVENANT (O.S.)
		Karennnnn --

	Karen looks up with a growing sense of dread.

	A FACE

	emerges from the darkness. Pallid, cadaverous, shedding its
	desiccated flesh. Lidless eyes like black marbles slick with
	Vaseline. A mouth like a raw wound. 

				REVENANT
		Karreennnnnn. I never thought I'd see 
		you againnnnn.

	Karen backs away, realizing who she's standing before.

				KAREN
		Curtis?!

	What used to be Curtis SNARLS, knocking Karen back into the drift-
	pile of bones. It pins her to the ground, kneeling above her,
	gurgling through its gutted trachea.

				CURTIS REVENANT
		Tell, me, Karennn -- ever have second 
		thoughts -- about us?

	Karen SCREAMS, trying to force the revenant away from her, but it
	lunges closer, lolling its distended tongue over her mouth in a
	pathetic approximation of a French kiss.

	She fumbles behind her, choking, grabbing hold of a human femur,
	blindly swinging it upward --

	CRACK! The blow shatters the Curtis-thing's jaw. It rears back,
	falling to the side. 

	Karen crawls out from under its weight, swinging the femur again and
	again --

	CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Karen pummels the howling horror, driving it
	back until the femur actually splinters in half. The creature's head
	hangs at an awkward angle now, its neck broken -- but still it
	advances, dragging itself back up.

	Sobbing, Karen retreats, clutching the splintered femur like a
	makeshift dagger.

	Curtis charges at her, a blur of slashing claws. At the last moment,
	Karen ducks, thrusting the bone dagger up into Curtis' chest --

	Curtis impales himself, right through the heart. For one split-
	second, his eyes widen in surprise --

	-- and then he goes into a death-spasm, vomiting up a spray of
	caustic vampire blood-bile, spattering Karen. She sinks to her knees,
	GASPING, as the thing that used to be Curtis shrivels up, melting
	away into burbling puddle.

	After a beat, Karen rises and moves to the pit wall, running her
	hands over the lichen-slick surface, searching for a way out. The
	mortar between the brickwork is ancient, crumbling. 

	Karen looks to the ground, reaching for one of the splintered femurs.
	She pounds it into the mortar between two bricks -- and it holds,
	working as a makeshift piton.

	Karen reaches for another broken femur, lodging it a foot above the
	first. She hauls her body up now, suspending her weight from the two
	makeshift pitons. Again, they hold.

	Trembling from exertion, Karen pulls the right piton free, hanging
	solely from her left hand now. Though her handhold is precarious, she
	manages to swing the right hand up again, pounding that piton another
	foot above the left.

	In this slow, torturous manner, Karen begins to climb her way up out
	of the pit.

	INT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - BLEEDING CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Blade hangs from his chains, head slack, eyes half-lidded and
	lusterless. His skin has grown ashen as his life's blood has been
	bled away.

	Mercury appears before him, accompanied by Quinn. She bends in close
	to kiss Blade lightly on the lips.

				MERCURY
		It won't be long now, lover. 

	Quinn draws alongside her, hefting Blade's punching dagger. He places
	it against Blade's throat, slowly applying pressure. At this point,
	Blade's too weak to even resist.

				QUINN
		We should finish him off.

				MERCURY
			(shaking her head)
		No. Deacon wants him turned.

	Quinn releases Blade, disgusted. 

				QUINN
		Fucking waste, if you ask me.

	As Mercury and Quinn exit, the CAMERA DROPS DOWN to the cistern
	beneath Blade's feet. We follow the blood which has collected there
	as it flows into a crude drain and --

	INT. SANCTUARY - NIGHT 

	-- emerges from the ceiling of the sanctuary below. The stream of
	blood is directed down the channels of a spiral column, where it
	finally pools into a waiting chalice.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	the sanctuary in full. A large circular chamber, the perimeter of
	which is lined with recessed alcoves housing the remains of the
	vampire ancients, set into the sanctuary walls like cells in a hive.

	DEACON FROST

	stands in the center of the chamber, allowing Vanessa to clothe him
	in ceremonial regalia -- gleaming, centuries-old armor. He pauses,
	kissing her hungrily.

	Having finished suiting up, he turns to face the vampires who have
	been faithful to his cause -- Mercury, Quinn, a host of others. A
	hush settles upon them. There's an excitement in the air, a sense
	that something remarkable is about to happen.

				FROST
		Tonight is the night we've waited our 
		entire lives for. Tonight, the 
		blood-dimmed Tide is loosed upon the 
		world. Tonight, the Age of Man comes 
		to an end. 

	The vampires bellow out a CHORUS OF CHEERS, their voices resonating
	off the stone walls like thunder. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - BONE PIT - NIGHT

	Karen's hands appear over the lip of the bone pit. She heaves herself
	up, collapsing onto the floor --

	-- but there's no time to rest. Even now she can hear the VAMPIRES
	CHEERING. She drags herself to her feet, letting the voices guide
	her.

	CUT TO:

	INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

	Karen slips around a corner, guarded, searching. She SEES Blade
	strung up before her, seemingly lifeless.

	Karen studies the chains which bind Blade, following them back to
	their source at the winch. She releases the brake on the winch crank,
	sending the chains RATTLING down through the overhead pulleys which
	suspend them. 

	Blade crumples to the floor, lying still. Karen is at his side in an
	instant --

				KAREN
			(whispering, urgent)
		Blade.

	Blade's eyes flicker open, fixing on her. Inhuman. He's shaking
	like an alcoholic going into delirium tremens.

	INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	Vanessa hands Frost the chalice containing Blade's blood. He lifts it
	up for all to see. The vampires begin to chant en masse, some long-
	forgotten invocation in the vampire tongue.

				FROST
			(grinning, to himself)
		"And what rough beast, its hour come 
		round at last, slouches towards 
		Bethlehem to be born?"

	Frost lifts the chalice to his lips and begins to drink. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

	Blade tries to sit up, gripping Karen's wrist --

				BLADE
		Get out of here --

				KAREN
		I'm not leaving without you.

				BLADE
		You don't understand. The Thirst --

	He clutches his stomach, experiencing phenomenal pain.

				BLADE
			(gasping)
		-- tearing me -- apart.

				KAREN
		I know. Take some of my blood.

				BLADE
		No --

				KAREN
		It's the only way. You know that. 
		We'll never get out of here alive if 
		you don't.

	Blade suppresses a shudder. Simply keeping himself from attacking her
	takes every ounce of his resolve.

				BLADE
		I can't -- I won't be able to stop --

				KAREN
		Yes you will. The human side of you is 
		stronger. I know it is.

	Karen matches Blade's gaze, steeling herself. The truth is, she's
	terrified. 

	Blade stares back at her. At this moment, he wants what Karen is
	offering more than anything he's ever desired. And so he rises --

	CUT TO:

	INT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	Frost continues drinking down the blood, when suddenly, a force
	seizes his body. He throws his head back, eyes rolling to white,
	flinging the chalice aside.

	And as the vampire incantation reaches a fevered pitch, we SEE the
	stone tomb tablets off the vampire ancestors beginning to judder --
	as if some force within were trying to break free --

	CUT TO:

	INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

	Karen turns her head to the side, baring her neck, offering herself
	to Blade. Blade opens his mouth. His canines elongate. He lowers his
	head --

	-- and starts to feed. Karen involuntarily stiffens as Blade's teeth
	puncture her skin and we --

	CUT TO:

	INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	Frost shakes, possessed by an unseen force. A wind picks up from
	nowhere, swirling about the chamber, accompanied by a strange
	HUMMING. 

	Suddenly, one of the tombs BURSTS OPEN. A WRAITH-LIKE SPIRIT rushes
	outward in a fountain of light, penetrating Frost's body.

	Then ANOTHER TOMB SPLITS APART. Then ANOTHER, and ANOTHER -- until a
	torrent of SPIRIT-WRAITHS are surging into Frost, buffeting him about
	like a scarecrow in a cyclone.

	Mercury, Vanessa, and the other vampires back away, apprehensive,
	humbled by what they're witnessing.

	CUT TO:

	INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

	Blade moans, sinking his teeth deeper. Karen's head rolls back. Her
	eyes open -- glassy, unseeing -- as a wave of ecstasy overtakes her. 

	She shudders, her breath quickening, falling into a synchronous
	rhythm with Blade's. Her fingers dig deep into his back, clawing
	downward, tearing into him -- 

	She's not Karen anymore -- she's a red blood cell, an erythrocyte,
	spinning in a river of plasma, roaring up Blade's femoral artery,
	racing towards the pumping chambers of his heart which beats like the
	deafening breath of God, which blots all other sounds out of
	existence and we're --

	CUTTING BACK AND FORTH NOW

	between Frost's transformation and Blade's, each of them growing
	stronger by the second, caught in an ever-increasing feedback loop of
	expanding energy until --

				BLADE
		NO!!!!

	Blade tears himself from Karen, his pulse racing as -- 

	CUT TO:

	INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	-- the invocation of LaMagra reaches critical mass. Frost is consumed
	by a hellish force, unable to withstand the onslaught of spirit
	energy any longer. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

	-- Karen clawing at Blade, tears streaming down her cheeks.

				KAREN
		Don't stop --

	But Blade grips her by her shoulders, shoving her back. Karen stares
	at Blade, wide-eyed, as if waking from a trance. She touches the raw
	wounds on her neck, shaken --

				KAREN
		My God --

	Blade rises to his full height. His strength has more than returned,
	it's been doubled by the infusion of real blood. And there's
	something else in his gaze now too -- an animal fury that was missing
	before. Blade has taken one giant step closer to the darkness. 

				KAREN
			(hesitant)
		Are you -- all right?

	Blade pulls at the chains manacled to his wrists, SNAPPING them apart
	like toys. He flexes his hands -- fingernails lengthening to tapered
	points. And he smiles, offering us a view of his canines, which have
	elongated into fangs.

				BLADE
			(near-demonic)
		Never been better.

	INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	The aftermath. Smoke hangs heavy in the air, occluding the area where
	Frost had stood. As it dissipates, Mercury and the others creep
	forward, apprehensive --

				MERCURY
		Deacon?

	FROST

	stands with his back to us, his body trailing wisps of occult fumes.
	As he slowly turns, we catch a glimpse of his eyes -- burning with an
	awesome, inner fire. 

				FROST
		No longer.

				BLADE (O.S.)
		Frost!!!

	All heads turn --

	BLADE 

	stands at the balcony overhead, Karen at his side. He leaps from it,
	somersaulting down to the floor below, landing on his feet like a
	predatory cat.

				BLADE
		Who dies first?

				FROST
			(growling, to the others)
		Take him.

	Quinn GROWLS, stepping forward, armed with Blade's punching dagger.
	He offers his second "new hand" up for view. 

				QUINN
		Grew another hand for you sweetmeat --
			(tossing the dagger to his new hand)
		-- and now I'm gonna kill you with it.

	Quinn charges. Blade meets the vampire head-on, dropping into a low
	kick and sweeping the vampire's legs out from under him. He spins
	behind Quinn -- 

				BLADE
		Let's see if you can grow a new one
		of these!

	Blade hooks a finger through the metal ring at the end of his jacket
	sleeve, pulling out a retractable strangle-wire which he twists
	around Quinn's throat. 

	Blade tightens the wire, decapitating Quinn. The headless body
	staggers about, then drops to the cavern floor. Blade scoops up his
	punching dagger --

				BLADE
		Next?

	Mercury and the other faithful vampires charge en masse. Blade
	launches a spinning wheel kick into the first vamp's face, SNAPPING
	its neck --

	Mercury has Blade's .454 Casulls. She aims them at him --

				MERCURY
		Have a taste of your own medicine!

	As she FIRES, Blade tucks and rolls, knocking one of the guns from
	her hand. The guns spins across the floor, where it's scooped up
	by --

	KAREN,

	who takes aim at an approaching vamp, BLOWING it away.

	Meanwhile, Blade traps Mercury's other hand, disarming her, flipping
	her over his shoulder. He hefts his Casull, BLASTING her into
	eternity --

	A bloodbath ensues. Blade moves like speed-personified, FIRING off
	one, two, THREE HEADSHOTS with brain-numbing accuracy, cutting down
	the vampires where they stand. 

	It's an orgy of gunpowder smoke and showering bodily fluids and
	-CLICK-CA-CHING-CLICK!- Blade and Karen have spent their bullets
	and --

				FROST (O.S.)
		Enough!!!

	Blade turns to face --

	FROST, 

	who's advancing, clutching Blade's own sword in his hand. He thrusts
	the sword forward --

	Blade presses the grip-trigger on his punching dagger -CHING!- the
	two side blades spread out. We hear the RASP and CLANG of metal on
	metal as Blade manages to trap the sword-point between two of the
	dagger blades --

	For a moment, both men are eye to eye, their weapons locked together,
	then, Frost forces Blade backwards --

	What happens next is the most blindingly-fast sword fight ever
	exposed to celluloid. Both men, fueled by super-human speed, lunge
	and spin across the cavern floor in a blurred ballet of lethal moves.

	Frost lands a powerful blow on Blade's shoulder, the sword-edge
	biting deep into the flesh. Blade SCREAMS. Frost withdraws the sword
	for another strike --

	-- until Blade sees an opening and takes it, slicing Frost's left arm
	off at the shoulder --

	The severed arm releases Blade's sword, but the arm doesn't fall! To
	Frost and Blade's mutual surprise the arm floats in mid-air, bleeding
	red, quivering like zero-G liquid, then SLURPING back to Frost's arm-
	stump to re-attach itself!

	Undaunted, Blade slices the punching dagger into Frost's mid-section,
	meeting only liquid-like resistance. The moment Blade withdraws his
	dagger, Frost's flesh seals itself up again.

	Blade hesitates now, uncertain -- and Frost laughs, understanding
	what has happened.

				FROST
		You're too late, Blade. I'm already 
		changing. Don't you see? The Sleeper 
		has awakened. I'm not just Frost 
		anymore. I'm becoming a god now, 
		blood incarnate.

	Even as Frost utters the words, his body begins to ripple and morph,
	bleeding red, taking on the characteristics of liquid. He doesn't
	walk so much now as flow. He's become a three-dimensional creature of
	animated blood! A blood demon.

	ON KAREN,

	as she watches Frost's transformation, wide-eyed. She SEES Blade's
	discarded sword, reaches for it -- suddenly, a SHADOW moves on the
	periphery of her vision --

	VANESSA

	rushes at Karen in a near-blur. The SNARLING hellion is upon Karen in
	an eye-blink, SLAMMING her down against the temple floor, pinning
	her. 

				VANESSA
		Did you think I'd forgotten you, you 
		little whore?

	BACK TO FROST,

	who towers above Blade, swaying back and forth in his new, liquid-
	like form.

				FROST
		You can't hurt me anymore. 

	WHOOSH! Frost rises upwards on a spiraling column of blood, HOWLING
	WITH LAUGHTER, then just as suddenly --

	-- splashes back to earth, spreading out in a widening pool. In the
	blink of an eye, he streams through Blade's feet, re-solidifying
	behind Blade. Blade spins, swings his dagger --

	Once again, Frost morphs into blood-form. He races around Blade in a
	series of spouting arcs, turning from blood-form to solid and back
	again in a series of split-second transformations.

	Blade whirls, striking with his dagger and missing every time --

	WHOOSH! Frost suddenly dissipates, SPLASHING away into a million
	zero-G blood bubbles, vanishing. Blade spins, unnerved, trying to
	pin-point his foe's next manifestation.

				BLADE
		Where are you?!

	Frost's voice answers from all directions.

				FROST
		Everywhere.

	A DROPLET OF BLOOD

	spatters the floor at Blade's feet. Blade looks up --

	A SHOWER OF BLOOD

	rains from above, coalescing into Frost as he sweeps down on Blade
	like a giant bird of prey, crushing him against the temple floor. 

				FROST
		You want my blood so much?! Take it!

	Frost's arms elongate and liquefy, flowing into two snake-like spouts
	of blood -- the rest of Frost remains solid. The blood-spouts twist
	around Blade's neck, melding together, completely encasing Blade's
	head in a bubble of blood.

	Blade claws at the blood-bubble as if it were a solid object that he
	could dislodge, but his fingers just pass through it!

	BACK TO VANESSA

	as she wraps a hand around Karen's throat, choking her.

	As Karen struggles, she frees a hand, sliding it down to her hip
	pocket, digging something out -- Whistler's vampire mace canister!

	She forces it up between them, triggering a jet of TOXIC MIST into
	Vanessa's face --

	Vanessa recoils, HOWLING, her head smoking as if it were doused with
	formic acid, skin sloughing off from her skull. Karen lunges for
	Blade's sword --

	BACK TO FROST AND BLADE

	Blade is drowning in Frost's blood. His eyes bulge. Oxygen bubbles
	stream from his mouth. Frost leans in close, his face a twisted mask
	of insanity.

				FROST
		I was wrong about you, Blade. You were 
		never one of us. You're a traitor to 
		your race. 

				KAREN (O.S.)
		Get away from him!

	Frost looks up -- Karen is wielding Blade's sword. She brings it down
	on Frost, severing the blood-tendrils which envelope Blade. The
	blood-bubble dissolves instantly, flowing away from Blade's face. He
	gasps, chokes in air --

	Frost backs away, horrified. His blood-tendrils don't reform.
	Instead, the lay where they fell, solidifying into crystalline
	powder.

				KAREN
		Blade!

	Karen flings the sword at Blade. 

	THE SWORD 

	spins end over end, its mirrored surface reflecting coruscating
	pinwheels of candlelight as Blade catches the weapon by its hilt.

	Blade rises, advancing on Frost, sword outstretched and Frost
	retreats, uncertain now.

				BLADE
		Guess you're not quite as invulnerable 
		as you thought.

				FROST
		You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and 
		my transition will be complete. Even 
		your sword won't be able to affect me 
		then.

				BLADE
		You don't have a few minutes, Frost.

	Frost eyes Blade warily, then lunges towards Vanessa, sweeping behind
	her. Blade follows, but even as he raises his sword to strike, Frost
	spins Vanessa around, using her body as a shield!

	Blade hesitates, stopping the sword in mid-strike, catching his
	mother's gaze -- her face is monstrous now, scarred by Karen's
	poisonous mace. Piteous, really. 

	Frost smiles, for he's found a final weakness of Blade's to exploit.

				FROST
			(laughing cruelly)
		Just as I thought. Still chained to 
		your mother's breast after all these 
		years.

	In the same instant, Vanessa's features morph, taking on the angelic,
	youthful vibrancy she possessed in the locket photo.

				FROST
			(gloating)
		You're too human, Blade. 

				BLADE
			(steeling himself)
		It's because I'm human that I can do 
		this.

	Frost's eyes widen in shock, but he has no time to react, for --

	Blade is already LUNGING forward, driving the sword-point through
	Vanessa's chest, on into Frost's heart! It strikes the stone behind
	them, SHATTERING and --

	Frost and Vanessa HOWL AS ONE, their SCREAMS rising to an unendurable
	intensity as the two vampires go nova, exploding into an expanding
	ball of light and ATOMIZING BLOOD.

	Blade is thrown back off his feet, having to shield his eyes from the
	backlash of occult energy as a near tidal WAVE of blood surges over
	him -- 

	EXT. BANK OF EREBUS - CITY STREET - NIGHT

	Every door and window of the bank is BLOWN OUTWARD from the force of
	the EXPLOSION. While along the street, manhole covers flip from their
	moorings, spinning up into the air like dimes, being buoyed by
	geysers of blood.

	INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	Silence, just the steady DRIP-DRIP of liquid draining. The underworld
	temple gleams with a crimson sheen now. 

	ON BLADE 

	as he stirs. He's been blown clear across the sanctuary by the force
	of the blast, soaked to the quick by blood. He rises to his feet,
	retrieving the hilt of his shattered weapon. At his feet -- 

	THE SWORDBLADE 

	lies in pieces. Amidst them, we find the singed remains of the locket
	-- Vanessa's face barely recognizable beneath the grime. Blade stoops
	to pick it up.

				KAREN (O.S.)
		Blade?

	Blade turns. Karen moves to him, searching his eyes. Which side of
	Blade's soul has won out? Human or vampire?

	Then she SEES the tears rimming Blade's eyes, the first he's shed in
	a lifetime. Human. 

	They embrace, holding each other that way for a long, long time. And
	we --

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. ROOFTOP, BANK OF EREBUS - DAWN

	Blade and Karen stand on the rooftop, watching as dawn slowly creeps
	across the silent city.

				KAREN
		I never imagined I'd be so happy to 
		see the sun rise --
			(turning to him)
		It's over, isn't it?

				BLADE
		For them. But for me --

	He lifts his face towards the rising sun, letting its warmth wash
	over his upturned face.

				BLADE
		I feel like it's finally beginning.

	And on that note we leave them -- TWO FIGURES, silhouetted against
	the new day.

	FADE TO BLACK.

	THE END

	    BLADE II -- By David Goyer

            EXT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - NIGHT

            PULL BACK from a neon red cross ablaze in the cold December
            night to REVEAL an inner-city, store-front clinic.  Trash and
            leaves blow over wet, snowy pavement.

            ANGLE ON a PALE FIGURE standing across the street.  He looks
            feverish and strung-out, in serious need of a fix.  This is
            JARED NOMAK, 20s.  He starts towards the clinic.

            INT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

            Potential DONORS sit in a waiting area, filling out forms,
            leafing through informational material.  A sign in the window
            reads: "Se habla Espanol".  Others read: "YOU ARE MAKING A
            DIFFERENCE", "GIVE LIFE", and "BECOME A PLATELET DONOR".  We
            overhear a bored-looking EMPLOYEE behind the information desk
            quizzing someone over the phone:

                                EMPLOYEE
                      Have you recently visited a tropical
                      country?  Uh-huh?  In the past twelve
                      months have you gotten a tattoo, non
                      sterile acupuncture, or undergone any
                      ear, skin or body piercing?

            We MOVE PAST the employee to Nomak, waiting.

                                NURSE (O.S.)
                      Jared Nomak?

            Nomak looks up.  We get a better look at his face now - he
            has a thin scar running from his lower lip down his chin.  A
            childhood accident, perhaps.  A NURSE smiles and motions for
            him to join her.  She's carrying a clipboard.

                                NURSE (CONT'D)
                      Hi.  We're ready for you now.

            INT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - HALLWAY - NIGHT

            Nomak follows the Nurse into a dimly-lit hallway.  We track
            their progress in a convex safety mirror suspended from the
            hallway ceiling as they pass all manner of medical supplies --
            centrifuges, an apheresis device, etc.

                                NURSE
                          (referring to her clipboard)
                      I see from your questionnaire that you
                      don't have any immediate next of kin?

                                NOMAK
                      Not that I'm in contact with.

                                NURSE
                      Nobody to call in case of an emergency?

                                NOMAK
                      No --
                          (apprehensive)
                      Does that mean I can't be a donor?

                                NURSE
                      It depends.  We came up with some
                      unusual results on your blood test.

            Nomak follows the Nurse to a steel door were TWO SECURITY
            GUARDS await them.  Both look bored, paying little attention
            to the monitor which offers a view of the examining room
            beyond.  There is also a small window with safety glass.
            GUARD #1 opens the door, following Nomak and the Nurse
            inside.  GUARD #2 remains behind, manning the hallway.

            INT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT

            The Nurse ushers Nomak into the room, indicating he should
            sit in a kind of reclining dental chair with arm and
            headrests.  Nomak notices a security camera mounted above.

                                NOMAK
                          (anxious)
                      How unusual?

            Beat.  The Nurse sets aside Nomak's file, looking
            uncomfortable.

                                NURSE
                      Your blood has a very rare phenotype,
                      one that's quite valuable to people like
                      us.

                                NOMAK
                      Us?  What are you talking about?

            A kind-faced DOCTOR enters, nodding to Guard #1.

                                DOCTOR
                      It's a good news-bad news scenario,
                      Jared.  Good news for us, bad for you.

            The Doctor and Nurse smile, BARING FANGS.  We realize now
            that they are both vampires.  The Guard, too.  He grips Nomak
            by the throat, forcing him back into the restraint chair.  As
            the vampire Guard does so, his hand brushes against Nomak's
            jaw.  The flesh on Nomak's chin briefly separates along the
            scar - almost as if it were a seam.

            The guard pauses - and Nomak LAUGHS.  Definitely NOT the
            reaction the vampires were expecting from a potential victim.
            Nomak starts to shake and twitch, like he's going into some
            kind of seizure.  The whites of his eyes bleed red.  He
            throws his head back, opening his mouth as a PAIR OF RAZOR
            SHARP CANINES extrude from his gums.  These are longer, much
            more lethal-looking than the fangs of the vampires and --

            Nomak lashes out, knocking the Guard backwards.  The Nurse
            SCREAMS.  Nomak clamps his mouth onto her throat, SLAMMING
            her back against the wall.

            The vampire Doctor rushes to the door, scrambling to unbolt
            it.  Nomak reaches for him, HOWLING with blood-drunk laughter
            as he lifts the Doctor up.  Nomak flings the Doctor about
            like a toy, using his body to SMASH the lights, then the
            security camera above.

            INT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - HALLWAY - NIGHT

            We hear SCREAMS and HORRIBLE NOISES coming from the examining
            room.  Guard #2 draws a gun and looks to the security monitor
            with alarm.  The screen goes black.  He looks to the small
            window, trying to peer into the now-darkened room beyond --

            SPLASH!  A wave of blood smears across a window.  A HAND
            wipes a patch of blood away, revealing Nomak's baleful,
            distorted eyes.  Guard #2 starts to back away when --

            BANG!  Nomak slams against the other side of the steel door.
            BANG!BANG!BANG!  The door begins to bend, hand-shaped
            impressions bulging outward as Nomak starts to peel the door
            apart like it was an aluminum can.

            Guard #2 has seen enough.  He turns and runs even as the door
            CAVES INWARD off its hinges.  Forward momentum sends the door
            sliding across the hallway floor where it trips up the Guard.

            ON THE DOORWAY

            as Nomak steps into the hallway.  Because of the lights
            above, there are alternating pools of light and shadow in the
            hall.  Nomak advances towards us, his face coming in and out
            of darkness.

                                NOMAK
                      Vampires --

            With each pool of light, his awful smile seems to distort
            further and further, until his mouth seems to be widening all
            the way back to his ears.

                                NOMAK (CONT'D)
                      I fucking hate vampires.

            On the floor, the vampire Guard CRIES OUT in fear, helplessly
            raising his hands to defend himself.  Nomak HOWLS and leaps
            towards him/us, blacking out the screen with his hurtling
            form as we --

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. INNER-CITY BACK-ALLEY - NIGHT

            BOOM!  A second-story door flies open and FIVE VAMPIRE thug
            wannabes come spilling out.  They race down a flight of
            stairs, tripping and tumbling over themselves.  In descending
            order, they are: RUSH, a pimped-out Vanilla Ice clone wearing
            Karl Kani gear, followed by JIGSAW, ST. CLOUD, T-BAG and
            SEGURA.

            BLADE

            exits just behind them, eschewing the stairs completely and
            vaulting over the railing.  He unholsters his MACH pistol as
            he drops, FIRING it as he lands in a cat-like stance on the
            snowy ground below --

            BA-BANG!  A silver-tipped bullet punches through T-Bag's
            chest.  He turns to ash even as his fellow vamps dash through
            the disintegrating cloud that used to be his body.  The
            embers melt the snow where they land.

            A super-charged foot chase ensues, with hunter and prey
            moving at speeds in excess of anything a human would ever be
            capable of.  We're talking thirty-five, even forty miles an
            hour.

            ON BLADE

            Running like a bull, condensed vapor streaming from his mouth
            and nostrils.  Splashing through puddles of icy water
            storming through barriers of plywood and razor wire, leaping
            over mountains of garbage bags.

            ON THE VAMPIRES

            as they flatten a length of cyclone fencing like it was crepe
            paper.  They scramble up an obstacle of waste bins, leaping
            into the air --

            BACK TO BLADE

            pulling out his twin-bladed boomerang as he runs.  He flings
            the weapon.  It twirls around, catching --

            ST. CLOUD IN MID-LEAP

            and cutting the vampire completely in half.  As the
            disintegrating halves of St. Cloud fall to the side, Blade
            storms over the waste bin.

            EXT. INNER-CITY - SECOND ALLEY - NIGHT

            The remaining vampires stumble into a narrower alley where a
            GROUP OF BUMS are warming themselves over a series of oil
            drum fires.

            Jigsaw slips, TRIPPING over one of the burning oil drums,
            catching himself ablaze.  He doesn't give a shit.  He keeps
            on running, barreling his way into --

            INT. NOODLE FACTORY - NIGHT

            -- the back entrance of a cramped, sweat-shop.  Some kind of
            noodle factory filled with steam and equipment and YAMMERING
            FOREIGNERS and --

            -- here comes Blade, hot on the vampires' heels, shouldering
            workers aside and --

            EXT. NOODLE FACTORY - NIGHT

            -- Rush and the remaining vamps spill out onto the street
            where a number of motorcycles are waiting for them -- two BMW
            R1200 motorbikes and a tricked-out Panhead Harley chopper
            with ape-hanger handlebars.

            Rush and Segura leap atop their BMWs.  Jigsaw rolls into a
            puddle of water, dousing himself, then jumps onto his
            chopper.  As the vamps peel out --

            BLADE

            Bursts from the factory.  Segura revs his BMW, trying to run
            him down.  At the last second, Blade pivots aside like a
            matador.  Segura circles around for another try.

            Blade leaps, somersaulting through the air, then lands on the
            back of the bike behind Segura.  SHINGGG!  Blade pulls a
            retractable garrotte wire from the sleeve of his jacket and
            wraps it around Segura's throat.

            With a violent twist, Blade decapitates Segura.  As the
            vampire's headless body turns to ash before him, Blade leans
            forward and takes the controls of the speeding motorcycle.

            WHOOSH!  Blade speeds after the other vamps.

            EXT. STREET - NIGHT

            Rush and Jigsaw gun their bikes for all they're worth.  Up
            ahead, a line of construction barricades are blocking the
            way.  The vampires power on through the barricades, then
            abruptly brake --

            THE OVERPASS

            before them is under construction.  There's a twenty-foot gap
            in the road where a portion is missing, pieces of re-bar
            poking out from the ends of the prefabricated sections.

            Rush and Jigsaw consider their options, but then they hear
            the ROAR of Blade's engine as he comes SCREAMING over the
            rise in the road!

            Fuck it.  Rush powers his chopper forward, making the jump,
            burning rubber as he lands on the far side.  Jigsaw torques
            his handle and follows, rocketing towards the gap.

            ON BLADE

            as he snaps his hand up -- a trio of Japanese throwing stars
            appearing between his fingers like a magician's cards.  He
            flings the stars at Jigsaw's bike --

            The throwing stars hit Jigsaw's back tire and the bike goes
            down, vomiting SPARKS as it slides forward.  Jigsaw is flung
            forward like a ragdoll, out over the gap in the overpass and

            -- WHUNK!  Jigsaw is impaled on the protruding re-bar!  He
            HOWLS, instantly disintegrating as Blade makes the jump!

            UP AHEAD

            Rush cuts onto an on-ramp, powering his way onto the freeway.

            EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

            Hyper-speed.  Rush slouches low, trying to cut wind
            resistance and will his bike faster.  He hazards a look back.

            BLADE

            is gaining on him like demon of speed.

            Rush pulls a TEC-9, FIRING back at Blade.  It's no good.
            Blade is nearly upon him, unsheathing his sword from his back
            scabbard --

            Blade JABS his sword forward into Rush's rear-wheel.  The
            bike locks up, flips over, BURSTS INTO FLAMES.  The whole
            screaming wreck slews forward, SHOWERING SPARKS --

            RUSH

            goes flying onto the road, rolling over and over, one of his
            legs SNAPPING at a bone-breaking angle.  As he lies there
            MOANING, Blade circles around, sweeping past Rush's decimated
            bike, retrieving his sward from the burning wreckage.

            Blade kills the engine on his own bike and dismounts.  Rush
            is pathetically trying to drag his broken body to safety.
            Blade approaches, placing his boot heel on the back of Rush's
            neck, forcing his face against the asphalt.  He unholsters
            his MACH, pointing it at the vampire's bleeding head.
            Blade's opening line:

                                BLADE
                      Tell me where he his now and I'll
                      consider you a loose end.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. MOO-COW CREAMERY - MILK FACTORY - NIGHT

            CLOSE ON a peeling wall mural -- smiling 30s cartoon cow
            winking at us, licking her chops.  The logo reads: "TASTY".

            Blade's matte-black Charger RUMBLES into view and parks in
            front of the abandoned milk factory.  Blade steps out,
            heaving an equipment sack onto his shoulder.

            INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

            THREE LACONIC VAMPIRE TOUGHS are playing poker at a card
            table, dealing out novelty nudie cards.  We hear a NOISE.
            One of the vampires approaches a reinforced door.  He slides
            open a viewing slot and peers through.  Nobody outside.  The
            vampire turns back to his poker buddies, shrugging --

                                VAMPIRE
                      Nobody's th--

            Before the vampire can even finish his sentence, Blade's
            SWORD punches straight through the door into his chest.  He
            gasps and turns to ash as the sword disengages back out
            through the door and --

            CRASH!  The door explodes open, sending clouds of burning
            vampire embers every which way.  In walks Blade, grinning
            wickedly, MACH ready --

            As the other two vampires rise - POW!  A silver hollow-point
            hits the first one in the neck.  POW!  Another hollow-point
            takes out the second.  The vampires drop, turning to ash.

            Blade holsters his MACH, striding through vampire ash piles.
            The place is eerily quiet here, in stark contrast to the
            mayhem of the last few minutes.  Just the steady, low-pitched
            HUM of machinery.

            Blade starts forward.  Up ahead, a FAINT GLOW is emitting
            from behind an area that's been sectioned off with canvas
            tarps.  Blade sweeps one of the tarps aside --

            THREE LARGE TANKS

            are hidden inside.  The first two are empty.  A MAN is
            suspended within the third, bobbing weightlessly in a sea of
            red plasma.  His long, gray hair floats about his face,
            shrouding his weathered features.  We're not sure if he's
            sleeping or dead.

                                BLADE
                      Old man, old man, what've they done to
                      you --

            Whistler's ace drifts around into view.  Blade shakes his
            head in sadness.  He looks about for a way to extract
            Whistler, doesn't see any obvious means, then --

            CRASH!  Blade kicks through the glass.  Blood and fluids
            flood out around him as Whistler's limp body tumbles partly
            down, but he's still suspended by the wires and medical
            leads.  Blade unsheathes his sword, severing the wires --

            Whistler falls into his arms.  Blade cradles him, then -- the
            gunsmith's eyes abruptly snap open, flooding with rage.

            Blade staggers back as the HOWLING horror that used to be his
            mentor wraps his hands around Blade's throat, forcing him to
            the ground.  Whistler ROARS, revealing a set of jagged fangs.

                                WHISTLER
                      Why didn't you finish me off?!?!  I told
                      you --

            Whistler SLAMS the back of Blade's head against the concrete
            floor again and again, punctuating his words with each SLAM --

                                WHISTLER (CONT'D)
                      -- TO -- FUCKING -- FINISH -- ME -- OFF!

            Blade knees Whistler in the balls.  Whistler lets go, cupping
            his groin as Blade heaves him aside.
            Blade strips off his gauntlets.  Whistler springs at him
            again.  Blade sinks his fist deep in Whistler's stomach.  As
            Whistler doubles over, Blade twists Whistler's hands behind
            his back, cuffing his wrists together with a pair of titanium
            manacles.

            Blade pulls a restraint hood from his equipment bag and
            quickly slips it over Whistler's head, cinching it tight.

            Another beat.  Whistler doesn't stir.  He's down for the
            count.  Blade pauses a moment, catching his breath as he
            leans on Whistler's still form.  He's exhausted.

                                BLADE
                      Come on, Whistler.

            He rises, heaving Whistler's body over his shoulder.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Let's go home.

            EXT. THE CITY - NIGHT

            Blade's battered Charger knifes through the snow-dusted urban
            blight like a shadow.  Boarded up businesses, tent cities,
            doorways bombed with graffiti throwups -- wherever this
            godforsaken Gomorrah is, it's definitely a notch down on the
            misery scale from the city Blade used to call home.

            Up ahead, the sprawl levels out, giving way to an ice-bound
            harbor wreathed in fog.

            INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT

            Blade drives on, inured to the sqaulor.  He made peace with
            the darkness a long time ago.

            EXT. SHIPYARD - NIGHT

            The Charger weaves its way through a maze of scrap metal and
            rusty shipping containers, homing in on a sprawling warehouse
            that's been cordoned off by cyclone fencing and razor wire.
            Utlra-violent floodlights illuminate the area, while security
            cameras keep a watchful eye.

            INT. WAREHOUSE - INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

            More UV lights flicker on.  We're in a massive loading
            elevator/platform which HUMS as it ascends, eventually
            reaching its destination with a BOOMING CLANG.  The doors at
            the rear glide open.  Blade guides the Charger out.

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

            Santa's workshop by way of Soldier of Fortune.  Industrial
            equipment is strewn everywhere.  Mills, old furnaces, gutted
            vehicles, an ad hoc surgical theater.  We also notice the big
            rig which Scud had been piloting.  Because of various leaking
            overhead pipes, the floor is slick with a sheen of water.
            Blade kills his Charger, looking around as he climbs out.

                                BLADE
                      Scud!

            Blade's voice ECHOES throughout the cavernous room.

                                SCUD (O.S.)
                      Lock up your daughters, people --

            ANGLE ON SCUD

            A handlebar moustached, weed-sucking stoner.  Thrift-store
            chic, wearing a Jimmy Walker "Dyn-O-Mite!" T-shirt.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      The Dark Knight returns.

            Scud is lowering himself down from the ceiling on a rope and
            pulley system where he'd been suspended in a safety harness,
            doing some kind of electrical wiring job.  He reaches the
            floor and unclips himself.  We notice he's wearing a surfer's
            charm around his neck that's been strung with vampire fangs.

            Scud pulls a half-smoked roach from behind his ear, using a
            lighter in the shape of a woman's torso to fire up.  The
            flame jets from a hole in one of her tits.  He takes a
            Spicoli-sized hit and offers the roach to Blade.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      Little toke of the smokage, B?

            Blade slaps it from his hand.

                                BLADE
                      Knock it off.  We've got work to do.

            Blade opens the trunk.  Scud joins him.

            WHISTLER

            is inside.  Blade unfastens the hood, slipping it off.
            Immediately, Whistler sits up, LUNGING at Blade!

                                SCUD
                      Fuck me!

            Blade gets Whistler in a headlock, choking him as he drags
            him out of the trunk.  It's like trying to wrestle a rabid
            pit bull.  He looks to Scud, annoyed.

                                BLADE
                      You going to stand there crapping your
                      pants or are you going to help me?!

            Scud steps forward, tentative.  Together, he and Blade drag
            Whistler kicking and SCREAMING across the workshop, forcing
            him into a small, cell-like room.

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - CELL - NIGHT

            WHAP!  Blade throws Whistler onto the concrete floor, pinning
            him as Scud quickly slips a series of chains around him which
            have been secured to the wall.  The opposite wall is covered
            by a series of steel shutters.  As Whistler continues to
            thrash, Blade affixes a muzzle to the older man's mouth.

                                SCUD
                      You got something in mind, Blade?

                                BLADE
                      Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on
                      heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey
                      in one night.

            Blade pulls out a pneumatic syringe, plunging an ampoule of
            amber-colored fluid into the bottle mount.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Gonna try and OD Whistler on a
                      retroviral cure.

                                SCUD
                      I don't know about this, man --

            Blade injects Whistler with the syringe.  Whistler HOWLS in
            pain, nearly throwing Blade and Scud off him.

                                BLADE
                          (to Scud)
                      Get back!!!

            Scud scurries away.  Whistler's struggles have taken an even
            more violent turn.  Blade beats him back down.

            Finally, Blade steps on Whistler's neck, pinning his head as
            he draws a shotgun from a holster beneath his armpit.  He
            shoves it in Whistler's SNARLING FACE.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      If there's anything of you left in
                      there, Whistler, listen up now.  Come
                      morning, those shutters are going up.
                      Either you'll be cured, or you'll fry.

            Blade raises his foot from Whistler's neck, quickly backing
            out the door.  Whistler THROWS himself at Blade, nearly
            tearing the chains from the wall as --

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

            BOOM!  Blade slams the cell door closed.  The door is heavy
            steel.  Nevertheless, Whistler kicks against it, threatening
            to tear it off its hinges.  Blade throws a heavy cross-bar
            over the door.  Then he steps back, joining Scud.

            WHUMP!WHUMP!WHUMP!  Whistler hammers the door again and again
            and again.  But the crossbar holds.  Blade glances at Scud,
            who's looking winded and shaken by the ordeal.

                                BLADE
                      It's going to be a long night.

            Scud nods and exits.  Blade drags a chair across the floor,
            setting it in front of the door.  He sits down, shotgun
            resting across his knees, holding vigil.  And off that grim,
            stoic image we --

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. CITY DUMP - DAY (20 YEARS AGO)

            Daylight bleaches the image, almost whiting it out.  A WINO
            sifts through refuse, collecting bottles.  Three MUTTS are
            tethered to his side with rope.  He reaches for a bottle,
            cuts himself on a piece of glass.  As he inspects his wound,
            his dogs GROWL.  The Wino looks up --

            A BLACK KID (14) is standing atop a mountain of refuse --
            wiry and intense, perched there like a predator.  The Wino
            glances at his wrist again, the blood, then back up at the
            black kid.  Unnerved, the Wino starts to back away, then
            turns -- BUMPING right into the black kid, who has moved
            beside him with uncanny speed.  (NOTE: this all happens
            within a single, continuous shot.)

            The boy SLAMS the Wino against the trestle wall and SNARLS,
            baring FANGS.  And just as he's about to tear the man's
            throat out --

            A HAND reaches in from off-screen, pulling the boy back.
            It's WHISTLER, twenty years younger and spryer, with a head
            full of RAVEN BLACK hair.

            Whistler throws the boy into the light, forcing him onto the
            ground.  He shoves a .45 against the boy's face and is just
            about to pull the trigger when he stops, NOTICING overhead
            sun reflected in the boy's eyes.  Whistler looks up and SEES
            the sun at high noon, then glances back at the boy in
            understanding.  He smiles.

                                WHISTLER
                      Daylight.  Son of a bitch.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - DAWN

            Blade wakes up, lifts his head.  A shaft of sunlight shines
            directly down onto him, reflecting back at us from his now
            adult eyes.  Blade hasn't moved.  He sits in the chair in
            front of the cell door which is now silent.  He stands,
            unlocking the cell door.  He heaves the cross-bar away.  The
            door GROANS as he opens it.

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - CELL - DAWN

            Blade enters.  It's dark.  We can just make out Whistler's
            figure huddled in the corner like some kind of caged animal,
            his lanky, gray hair obscuring his face.

            Whistler doesn't stir.  Blade crosses over to the steel
            shutters.  For the briefest moments, he hesitates.  Then he
            hits the switch, readying his shotgun.  With a HUM, the
            shutters rise, throwing a SHAFT OF BLINDING SUNLIGHT over
            Whistler.

            Nothing happens.  Blade lowers his shotgun.  Whistler slowly
            raises his head, fixing Blade with a bloodshot eye.

                                BLADE
                      How do you feel?

                                WHISTLER
                      Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my
                      mouth.

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BATHROOM AREA - LATER

            Whistler stands bare-chested before a corroded mirror,
            splashing water from a sink over his face, rinsing off
            shaving cream residue.  He inspects his features -- he's
            cleaned himself up a bit, trimmed his beard, etc.

            He pulls on a fresh shirt, then turns to face Blade, who
            stands behind him.

                                WHISTLER
                      You came back for me.

                                BLADE
                      Did you think I wouldn't?

                                WHISTLER
                      Took you long enough.

            Blade smiles.  That was as close to a thank-you as this old
            junkyard dog is ever going to give.

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BACKSTORAGE AREA - DAY

            Whistler has fired up a Lucky Strike.  He's moving through
            the storage area where much of his old equipment has been
            shelved, pulling tarps off, checking things.  Blade follows.

                                BLADE
                      Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst
                      for good.  I'll be watching you close.
                      You start to back-slide --

                                WHISTLER
                      You put a bullet in my brain.  Wouldn't
                      expect anything else.

            Whistler takes a long drag, expelling the smoke slowly,
            studying the cigarette in his hand.

                                WHISTLER (CONT'D)
                      I'll say one thing for doing time as a
                      suckhead.  Seems to have knocked that
                      cancer of mine back into remission.

            Blade nods.  Then Whistler stops, obviously frustrated.

                                WHISTLER (CONT'D)
                      Where the hell's my lathe?

            Just then we hear the SOUND of an industrial lathe firing up.
            Curious, Whistler exits into --

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - DAY

            The workshop proper.  Scud is working at Whistler's old
            lathe, bopping his head along to MUSIC which is playing on a
            nearby TV.  The them song to SPEED RACER.  Now he's wearing a
            Ron Jeremy T-shirt that says "Daddy".

                                TV (O.S.)
                      Here he comes, here comes Speed Racer!
                      He's a demon on wheels.  He's gaining on
                      you so you better look alive.  He's busy
                      revving up the powerful Mach Five --

            Whistler cocks an incredulous eyebrow at Blade, who has
            fallen in beside him.  Scud kills the lathe and approaches.

                                SCUD
                      Whistler.  Cool beans.  Nice to meet
                      you, man.  Heard a lot.  I'm Josh
                      Frohmeyer.  You can call me Scud,
                      though.  That's what most people do.

            Scud offers his hand.  Whistler doesn't take it.  Scud shoots
            an uneasy glance at Blade, raising an eyebrow in question.
            Is Whistler okay, or not?  Blade nods.  Whistler moves over
            to the Charger which has its hood up.

                                WHISTLER
                      Tell me something, Skid --

                                SCUD
                      Scud.

                                WHISTLER
                      Whatever --
                          (checking the motor)
                      What'd you do to the Charger?

                                SCUD
                      The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after
                      market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide
                      injection system, forged aluminum
                      pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing
                      fuel pump.

                                WHISTLER
                      Gave it a more aggressive exhaust
                      profile ramping.

                                SCUD
                      Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this
                      betty up another three-hundred
                      horsepower.

                                WHISTLER
                          (cutting him off)
                      And you'll burn the damn thing out
                      before your next fucking oil change.

            Whistler just looks to Blade and shakes his head.

                                WHISTLER (CONT'D)
                      Where'd you dig up this shit-bird
                      anyway?

                                SCUD
                      Look, what's your problem?

            Whistler gets in Scud's face.  Scud looks to Blade for help,
            but he just watches, letting the two of them sort things out.

                                WHISTLER
                      My problem, shitbird, is that I tried to
                      blow my fucking head off and wound up
                      sucking blood clots for the last year
                      and a half!  Now you're standing there
                      choking your chicken like we're all
                      walking around some fucking candy-ass
                      vampire sitcom!

            Scud attempts to show some balls, but stammers all the same.

                                SCUD
                      Hey, you think I don't know what's at
                      stake here?  We practically compromised
                      our whole operation to save your
                      puckered old ass!  And for what?

                                WHISTLER
                          (grabs Scud's shirt)
                      Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I
                      built this operation, you fucking turd
                      stain.

            Just then, however, an alarm starts BEEPING.  Scud checks a
            display as Blade readies his MACH.

                                SCUD
                      Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.

                                BLADE
                      Human?

            Scud checks a series of thermal signature displays.

                                SCUD
                      Body temp's fifty so I'll guess suck
                      head.

            Scud looks to a bank of security monitors -- the views break
            into static as a FIGURE rushes past them.  He tries a few
            keyboard commands.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      I don't understand, I'm not getting
                      anything on the surveillance cams.

            Whistler makes a few adjustments on the nearest monitor.

                                WHISTLER
                      They're fried.  Whoever's out there is
                      using magnesium flares.  Seems like
                      they've got your security system stopped
                      out pretty well.

            Whistler moves to a rack of weaponry.  As he reaches for CAR
            15, Scud moves to stop him.

                                SCUD
                      Whoa, whoa, easy cowboy - I'm not
                      trusting you with a weapon just yet.

            Whistler SMACKS Scud in the face with the butt of the CAR-15
            and pushes past him.  We hear a CRASH.

            ANGLE ON

            TWO BLACK, LATEX-CLAD, NINJA LIKE INTRUDERS

            Running on all fours, racing upside down across the ceiling
            at break-neck speed.  Then they drop, somersaulting down
            fifty feet, landing in a cat-like stance.

                                BLADE
                      Hit the God-lights.

            Scud, with his nose now bleeding, activates a series of
            stadium-style lights secured to the ceiling.  The entire
            place goes white with UV light, the image nearly blowing out.

            CLOSE ON FIGURES' FACES

            They are wearing metal goggles with iris shut to mere pin
            prick openings.

            Whistler trains the CAR-15 on --

            THE FIRST LATEX CLAD FIGURE

            Who is now removing something from a satchel.  Whistler
            FIRES.  The Intruder drops the object and cartwheels away.

            In the blink of an eye, the Second Intruder has launched
            himself at Whistler, hand-springing off the floor, then
            kicking him in the mid-section.  As Whistler falls back, the
            Second Intruder presses forward.

            ON BLADE

            Unsheathing his sword, rushing at the First Intruder.

            WHAP!  The Intruder traps Blade's forearm, pivoting, planting
            a boot in Blade's ribcage.  Obviously, the Intruder is a
            serious martial arts student.

            WHAP!WHAP!WHAP!  The two of them go at it, unleashing a
            flurry of kicks, blocks, and punches.  The Intruder gets
            Blade in a back-choke.  He twists out of it, throwing the
            Intruder over his shoulder, who neatly cartwheels, springing
            back off the wall at Blade again --

            Blade ducks beneath one of the Intruder's kicks, then traps
            the Intruder's foot, giving it a savage twist.  CRACK!  Blade
            backhands the intruder with a blow so strong that it knocks
            the Intruder to his knees.  Then the Intruder reaches for a
            short sword.  In a heartbeat, the sword is out and against
            Blade's throat.  Just as Blade's sword is not against the
            Intruder's.  It's a stalemate.

                                SECOND INTRUDER
                      Stop!!!!!

            Blade and the First Intruder freeze.  The Second Intruder
            steps away from Whistler, whom he clearly had the drop on,
            and tosses the CAR-15 to the ground.

                                SECOND INTRUDER (CONT'D)
                      We didn't come here to fight.  We came
                      to deliver a message.

            Blade looks back to the First Intruder.  Then slowly
            withdraws his sword.  The Intruder does the same.  Blade
            turns off the God-lights.  The UVs fade and normal lighting
            returns.  Scud and Whistler pick themselves up off the floor.

                                BLADE
                      Take off your masks.

            The Intruders remove their masks.  The first is ASAD, a
            cautious Sufi Muslim possessing a restrained nobility.

            The second is a woman, NYSSA.  20-something, with emerald
            eyes and strong, darkly exotic features.  Both are Vampire.

                                ASAD
                      My name is Asad.  This is Nyssa.  We
                      represent the Shadow Cabinet.  The
                      ruling body of Vampire nation.  They're
                      offering you a truce.  They want to meet
                      with you.

                                SCUD
                          (wiping blood from his nose)
                      Bullshit.

            Blade holds up his hand, silencing Scud's outburst.  He nods
            for Nyssa and Asad to continue.

            Nyssa slowly crouches and reaches for the object she dropped
            - a CD.  She tosses it to Blade.  Still keeping an eye on
            them, Blade slips the CD into a reader.  We SEE a slide-show
            of video capture shots taken from a surveillance camera.
            Nomak tearing into the blood bank staff, etc.

                                NYSSA
                      For decades you've been the thing we've
                      feared the most.  But there's something
                      else loose on the streets now --

            CLOSE ON

            The final still.  A blurry, horrific shot of Nomak's half
            turned face and back.  We get a sense of distorted, inhuman
            physiognomy.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      Something worse than you.

                                                                 CUT TO:


            EXT. BLADE AND SCUD'S WAREHOUSE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

            Blade, Whistler, and Scud stand near the ledge, while Asad
            stands a few yards off, talking on a phone.  Nyssa stands
            even further away, watching them with distrust.

                                SCUD
                      This whole deal's giving me a serious
                      case of the butt-willies.

                                WHISTLER
                      Look, kid, they obviously found your
                      base of operations.  If it was a trap,
                      why flip their dicks by announcing
                      themselves?

                                BLADE
                      I agree.  We play along for now, we
                      might wind up learning something about
                      how their world ticks.

                                WHISTLER
                          (grinning at Scud)
                      Either that or feeding the worms.

            Asad finishes his call and approaches them.

                                ASAD
                      They're ready to see you now.

            As if on cue, we hear the THRUM of helicopters.  Seconds
            later, two Bell Jet Rangers appear above them, illuminating
            them in their searchlight.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. SKY - NIGHT

            We track the helicopters across the night sky.  We SEE
            Whistler and Asad in one, Blade, Scud and Nyssa in another.

            INT. JET RANGER - NIGHT

            Blade and Nyssa sit in the rear of the first helicopter.
            Nyssa is studying Blade.

                                BLADE
                      What?

                                NYSSA
                      They tell bedtime stories about you.
                      Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly,
                      I'm disappointed.
                          (Blade raises an eyebrow)
                      That you were willing to come along so
                      easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.

            Blade smiles and opens his coat, gesturing to a bandolier of
            plastic explosives secured to his chest.

                                BLADE
                      Semtex explosive.  Enough to level a
                      city block.  How's that for assurance?

            The helicopter abruptly banks right, dropping down low.

            EXT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

            The Bell Jet Rangers touch down outside a terraced, Frank
            Lloyd Wright structure overlooking the ocean.  As Nyssa and
            Asad lead Blade, Whistler and Scud towards the facility we
            SEE a circular crimson logo encircling a double-helix.

            Scud notices a series of RED LIGHT DOTS on his arms and
            chest.  He looks up to see DOZENS OF VAMPIRE MARKSMEN on the
            roofs above, training their weapons on them.

            INT. ELEVATOR CAB - NIGHT

            The group rides down.  The elevator stops.  The doors open.

            INT. DAMASKINO'S STRONGHOLD - 4-WAY INTERSECTION - NIGHT

            Nyssa and Asad lead them into a hub out of which multiple
            corridors project.  They take the central corridor.

            INT. STEEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

            The corridor ends at a pair of steel security doors.  Nyssa
            stands before a biometric scanner, allowing a beam of light
            to play over her face.  The scanner acknowledges her identity
            and the doors HISS open, revealing a series of security doors
            beyond these which successively open into --

            A FINAL DOOR

            Oak, set into a stainless steel wall.  Incalculably ancient,
            elaborately carved.  Brought over from the "Old World."

                                NYSSA
                      The House of Erebus you encountered
                      before were nothing but feudal lords.
                      The true power of the Vampire Nation
                      lies here --

            As they move towards the final door, Whistler shivers.  Scud
            watches as his breath escapes from his mouth in a frosty
            plume.  Asad takes notice.

                                ASAD
                      Few warmbloods have seen what's beyond
                      this door.

            He pushes the doors open into --

            INT. DAMASKINO'S LAIR - NIGHT

            A crescent-shaped room filled with antiquities: quarry
            columns from Middle Kingdom Egypt, stacks of arcane volumes,
            Medieval frontispieces.  A Borgia-esque Renaissance portrait
            staring down at us with a severe gaze.  Towering over all of
            these is a massive Greek Cross carved from stone.  MUSIC
            echoes around them -- Boito's Faust.  Standing in the midst
            of this is OVERLORD ELI DAMASKINOS, wearing a robe of black
            silk.

                                NYSSA
                      Father --

            Damaskinos holds up his hand.  He waits for the music to
            crescendo, then turns, his face still hidden in shadow.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      I hope you don't mind the cold.  When
                      one such as myself reaches an advanced
                      age, certain precautions are needed in
                      order to preserve the flesh.

                                ASAD
                      Blade, this is Overlord Eli Damaskinos.

                                DAMASKINOS
                          (in vampire dialect; subtitled)
                      Welcome, Daywalker.  I thank you for
                      coming.  I've been anxious to meet you
                      for quite some time.

            Damaskinos draws closer now, stepping into the light.  Bright
            eyed with smile like moonlight gleaming off a knife blade.
            His skin is impossibly pale, almost marble-like, with
            traceries of blue blood pulsing underneath.

                                DAMASKINOS (CONT'D)
                      And the late Abraham Whistler.  I trust
                      your time amongst our numbers was
                      agreeable?

            Whistler glares at Damaskinos.  The two men stare at each
            other a moment, sizing one another up.

                                DAMASKINOS (CONT'D)
                          (smiling knowingly)
                      It has been said, you may have enemies
                      whom you hate, but not enemies whom you
                      despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then
                      his success shall be yours, too.  In
                      that regard, I should thank you.

                                BLADE
                      For what?

                                STEVENS (O.S.)
                      Eliminating Deacon Frost.

            CARTER STEVENS, an officious-looking familiar who has been
            quietly watching from the wings now steps forward.

                                STEVENS (CONT'D)
                      All that unseemly business with LaMagra.
                      You did us a favor.
                          (offering his hand to Blade)
                      Carter Stevens.

            As Blade and Stevens shake, Blade notices a vampire glyph
            poking out from beneath the familiar's shirt cuff.

                                BLADE
                      You're human.

                                STEVENS
                          (with a smile)
                      Barely.  I'm a lawyer.

                                ASAD
                      Mr. Stevens works with the National
                      Institute of Health.
                          (off Blade's look)
                      Given that they monitor the nation's
                      blood supply, a strategic alliance
                      seemed prudent.

                                STEVENS
                      We also finance a number of humanitarian
                      organizations -- the National Institute
                      of Infectious Diseases for one, the
                      Human Genome Project...

                                BLADE
                      Why?

                                NYSSA
                      Survival.

            Blade and the others turn to Nyssa, who uses a complex
            mechanical key to activate a holo-projector mounted above the
            table.  As she focuses the image, a 3-D DIORAMA of vampire
            viral nucleocapsids swirls into view.  The nucelocapsids
            begin attacking human red blood cells.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      As you may know, Vampirism is an
                      arbovirus, one that's spread through the
                      saliva of parasitic organisms --
                          (motioning to the hologram)
                      In this case, vampires are the vector.
                      The virus replicates within the human
                      bloodstream, evolving its host into an
                      entirely new life-form.
                          (beat)
                      Unfortunately, viruses evolve too --

            As Nyssa talks, one of the viral nucleocapsids changes,
            mutating from its original, elegant design into a harsher,
            more menacing form.
            The mutated nucleocapsid begins feeding on the original
            vampire capsids, causing a chain-reaction of mutation.  In
            seconds, the holo-image is filled with throbbing, microscopic
            horrors which then mutate into  --

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      We've dubbed this new virus the Reaper
                      Strain.  And like any good pathogen, it
                      appears to have found a carrier -- a
                      "Patient Zero".

            A rotating 3-D image of Jared Nomak's face.  Eyes red, his
            skin in full "blood mode" blush.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      His name is Jared Nomak.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece.
                      The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more.
                      He was born a vampire, but he is an
                      anomaly.
                          (to Blade)
                      Like you.  Unlike the rest of us,
                      however, he feeds on not just humans,
                      but vampires as well.

                                BLADE
                      Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.

                                NYSSA
                      You're missing the point.  Their vampire
                      victims don't die.  They turn.  They
                      become carriers.  If the Reapers
                      continue unchecked, there could be
                      thousands of them before the month is
                      over.  Do the math.

            Blade turns to Damaskinos.

                                BLADE
                          (vampire dialect; subtitled)
                      You want me to hunt them for you.

                                DAMASKINOS
                          (vampire dialect; subtitled)
                      Not alone.

                                ASAD
                      We've been training a small tactical
                      unit -- the Bloodpack.  We want you to
                      lead them.

                                WHISTLER
                      Just how long has this little social
                      club of yours been together?

                                NYSSA
                      Two years.

                                BLADE
                      Then they weren't created to go after
                      your "patient zero".

                                NYSSA
                      No.  They've been training to hunt you.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - DAWN

            Blade, Whistler and Scud enter through the loading elevator.
            Blade turns to Whistler.

                                BLADE
                      What do you think?

                                WHISTLER
                      Sounds like a plan.

                                BLADE
                      What do you really think?

                                WHISTLER
                          (lighting a cigarette)
                      These guys are shitting bricks cause
                      they're no longer on the top of the food
                      chain.  They're going to fuck us the
                      first chance they get.

            Whistler moves away.  Blade shrugs off his jacket, begins
            putting away his weapons.  Scud lingers, apprehensive.

                                SCUD
                      So you're going to do this?

                                BLADE
                      Keep your friends close and your enemies
                      closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?

            Scud follows Blade's gaze, watching Whistler, who has
            collapsed into a chair at the far end of the workshop.  The
            grizzled hunter pulls off his leg brace, then massages his
            bum knee.  Scud nods in Whistler's direction.

                                SCUD
                      I'm worried about him.
                          (off Blade's look)
                      Look, I know he's your friend, but just
                      watch him, okay?  Nobody goes cold
                      Turkey from the Thirst in a night.

            BACK ON WHISTLER

            Surrounded by the salvaged parts and massive gears of long
            discarded machinery, half-hidden in shadow.  A shaft of
            morning sunlight cuts in through one of the windows, slowly
            moving across the floor towards his position.  He shifts in
            his chair, moving slightly --

            Away from the light.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

            It's late.  An ice-encased streetlight HUMS and flickers.
            The pumps are vacant.  A heavy blanket of sooty snow covers
            the grounds of the station.  The fluorescents of the mini
            mart are the only beacon of light in an otherwise fog-bound
            night.

            INT. MINI-MART - NIGHT

            A KOREAN WOMAN (30s) mans the counter.  Her TODDLER sits in a
            circular safety walker nearby.  The kind that rolls and is
            affixed with toys to keep a baby occupied.  The woman glances
            at two surveillance monitors.  On the first monitor we see --

            A CAR

            pull up to the pumps outside.  A MAN gets out, slides his
            credit card through the reader, starts pumping gas.

            ON THE SECOND MONITOR

            We SEE a FIGURE standing at the back by the Slurpee machine.
            The figure turns, approaching.  It's Nomak.  He sets a
            package of gum on the counter, looks to the baby.  He smiles,
            wriggles his finger.  The child COOS and smiles back.

            Unnerved by Nomak, the Korean woman quickly rings the
            transaction, gives him his change.  He removes a stick of gum
            from the pack, carefully unwraps it, slides it into his
            mouth, watching the child all the while.  Finally, he nods to
            the woman and leaves.  The door CHIMES as he exits.

            Beat.  The woman looks to the surveillance monitors again.

            THE FIRST MONITOR

            The car is still there, but the man pumping gas is gone.

            Puzzled, the woman steps from behind the counter and moves to
            the glass doors, looking out --

            HER POV

            The car's driver side door hangs open.  Even more disturbing,
            the hose for the gas pump lies untended on the icy ground,
            spilling fuel from its nozzle.

            EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

            The Korean woman cautiously exits the mini-mart.  No one is
            in sight.  She hurries to the abandoned car, disengaging the
            lock on the pump handle, then setting it back in its cradle.
            She looks to the open driver's door.  A FEW DROPLETS OF BLOOD
            have stained the snow just outside it.  Then she sees --

            A GHOSTLY FIGURE

            Standing off in the fog-bound shadows.  The woman looks back
            to the mini-mart, then back again to where the figure was
            standing.  But the figure is gone!  Growing increasingly
            anxious, the woman hurries back.

            INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

            The woman shuts the door, locks it.  But she's still just a
            target standing inside a well-lit glass box.  She moves to
            the safety walker, scoops up her child.

            After another moment's indecision, she slides the accordion
            style gate down over the doors and windows.  Then she turns
            off the lights.  Feeling somewhat more secure, the woman
            moves back around the counter and SEES --

            An unwrapped stick of gum resting on the tray of the baby
            walker.  It wasn't there before.  With a rising sense of
            dread, the woman backs away, bumping right into --

            NOMAK

            He smiles cruelly, the scar/seam in his chin just beginning
            to part.  The woman gasps, turns to run --

            and bumps into THREE MORE REAPERS.  Gaunt and feral-looking.
            All three with shaved heads.
            No eyebrows, and hairline scar/seams running down their
            chins.  As one, the reapers descend on her.  We hear the
            child's TERRIFIED WAIL and we --

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. THE CITY - NIGHT

            A sulfur-colored moon shines its baleful light down upon the
            icy cityscape as NOMAK'S ROAR echoes through the canyon of
            buildings.

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BLADE'S SLEEPING AREA - NIGHT

            Blade is just finishing injecting himself with serum.  He
            sighs, falling back into the chair he's sitting in, waiting
            for the shakes to subside.  He unwraps a piece of rubbing
            tubing which he'd been using as a tourniquet, flexes his
            hand.

            The door to his room opens.  Scud stands there in silhouette.

                                SCUD
                      Um, we've got company.

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

            Blade emerges into the workshop proper with Whistler and
            Scud.

            NYSSA AND BLOODPACK

            Stand before us.  They represent an assortment of ages and
            races, their one unifying characteristic being a callous,
            almost fanatical disregard for human life.  In short, these
            guys are the most stone-cold motherfuckers we've ever seen.

                                WHISTLER
                      Well if it isn't Snow White and the
                      Seven Suckheads.

            Their leader, DIETER REINHARDT (30s), is a square-jawed,
            chiseled Austrian.  Next to Reinhardt is SNOWMAN, a wire
            albino, LIGHTHAMMER, a massive Blackfoot Indian, and PRIEST,
            a bald-headed modern primitive with copious piercings and
            facial tattoos.  Rounding out the bunch is CHUPA, a blunt
            featured Puerto Rican, and VERLAINE, a familiar-looking
            curvaceous beauty with bee-stung lips that exudes a predatory
            sexuality.

            (NOTE: Verlaine looks familiar because she is the twin sister
            of Raquel, the bodacious vamp played by Traci Lords that
            Blade killed in the opening scene of the first film.)

                                REINHARDT
                      Check it out, troops.  Count Chocula.

            The vampires LAUGH.  Asad quiets them with a look, then
            gestures to them in turn.

                                ASAD
                      Blade, this is Reinhardt.  That's
                      Snowman, Lighthammer, Priest, Chupa and
                      Verlaine.

            Reinhardt advances until he and Blade are nose to nose.

                                REINHARDT
                      Tell me something, Chief.  Can you
                      blush?

            A tense beat.  Then Blade flashes a broad smile.

                                BLADE
                      Alright, you want to play this game?

            Blade pulls out one of his silver stakes.  In response, the
            vampires reach for their weapons.  But Blade merely twirls it
            around his fingers.  Then tosses it to Reinhardt.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      You've been training two years to take
                      me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire
                      hunter.  So do it.

                                NYSSA
                      What the hell are you doing, Blade?

                                BLADE
                      We're going to be working as a unit, you
                      people will be taking orders from me.
                          (spreading his hands wide)
                      So let's get it over with.  I'll give
                      you a free shot, Reinhardt.

            Reinhardt looks to Nyssa, uncomfortable.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Why are you looking at her for?  You
                      need permission?   I'm giving it to you.

                                CHUPA
                      Take him, cabron!

            Blade grabs Reinhardt's wrist, pulling the stake against his
            chest, fixing the vampire with the deadliest of poker gazes.

                                BLADE
                      What's wrong, Reinhardt?  You need a
                      fucking manual?

                                VERLAINE
                      Do it, Reinhardt.  Do it!!!

            Reinhardt tenses, thrusting the stake forward -- but Blade
            has already whirled out of the way, trapping his hand, then
            violently twisting it backwards.

            Before Reinhardt even knows what's happening, Blade swings
            him around into a headlock.  In his free hand he's got a
            tiny, barbed flechette.  The barbs spring open like a tick's
            gripping mandibles as Blade drives the flechette into the
            base of Reinhardt's skull.  Reinhardt HOWLS in pain, but
            Blade just tightens his grip, choking off Reinhardt's air.

                                BLADE
                      Listen up, Adolph, I just popped an
                      explosive charge in the back of your
                      head.  Silver nitrate.  Rigged to blow
                      if anyone tampers with it.  I'll be
                      keeping the detonator on me at all
                      times.  You so much as look at me
                      crosswise and I swear you'll be macking
                      your girlfriend's pie with a fucking
                      neck stump!  Got it?!

            Reinhardt lets loose a choked GRUNT.  Blade releases him,
            dropping the GASPING AUSTRIAN to the floor.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Any questions?

            No one says a word.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            WHISTLER

            Hefting a heavy ordnance case on the table.  Blade and
            company sit on one side, the Bloodpack on the other.

                                WHISTLER
                          (opening a case of bullets)
                      Glaser safety rounds in .38, .45, and
                      9mm caliber.  Foil capsules at the tip
                      filled with silver nitrate grains.  They
                      pack a major kinetic energy dump.  And
                      since you suckheads don't like sunlight,
                      we've modified the entry lights with UV
                      filters --

            Whistler flicks on the entry light.  Then notices that Chupa
            isn't paying attention.  The vampire is looking at Snowman
            who is saying something in sign-language.  Chupa snickers.
            Whistler picks up a massive gun with a modified C-mag
            (hundred round cylindrical mag).  It has a strange electromag
            assembly barrel with shockwave ports running along it.

                                WHISTLER (CONT'D)
                      This puppy here?  Hyper-velocity
                      railgun.  Spits up silver-tipped iron
                      core needles at six thousand butt
                      humping feet per second.  Like this --

            Whistler FIRES -- BA-BANG!  A SONIC BOOM rocks the workshop,
            SHATTERING a number of windows and computer monitor screens
            as a wad of needle rushes just millimeters past Chupa's face,
            embedding in the wall behind him.

                                CHUPA
                      Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!

                                WHISTLER
                      Getting your attention, Paco.

                                CHUPA
                      Well you've got it, warmblood.  Now what
                      the fuck are you gonna do with it?

            Blade clears his throat and stands.

                                BLADE
                      If you girls are finished flirting, I'd
                      like to get started.

            MOMENTS LATER

            Blade, Whistler, and the Bloodpack are silently suiting up
            for war -- strapping on body armor, securing stakes and
            knives, CLICKING ammo cartridges into their various weapons.

            We SEE them lacing up combat boots, checking rifle sights,
            entry lights.  Blade dons one of his EDTA pneumatic
            gauntlets.  Whistler loads custom rounds into a shotgun.
            Then he reaches to clip on an ammo vest.  But his hands are
            shaking slightly and he can't seem to clip the locking
            mechanism together.  After a beat, Blade reaches over and
            does it for Whistler.  Like a son helping his father.  A beat
            passes between them, Whistler and Blade looking at one
            another.  Then Whistler nods, satisfied.

            As Blade crosses towards Asad and Nyssa, he stops by
            Verlaine, sizing her up.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Didn't I kill you already?

                                VERLAINE
                          (cold)
                      That was my sister.

            Beat.  Blade smiles coldly.

                                BLADE
                      This the part where you beat your chest
                      and vow revenge?

                                VERLAINE
                      Something like that.

                                BLADE
                      Save it for the director's cut.

            Blade moves on, stopping before Nyssa.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Where to first?

                                NYSSA
                      The House of Pain.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

            Blade, Whistler, and the Bloodpack are gathered on a rooftop
            overlooking a derelict city block.

            THE HOUSE OF PAIN

            Rises before them, a Gothic Revival hotel marred by graffiti
            scrawls and boarded up windows.  There's a large neon "HOTEL"
            sign on the side of the building.

                                NYSSA
                      From what we can gather, the Reapers
                      hunt in packs, targeting places where
                      vampires congregate.  So far, they've
                      attacked bloodbanks, safehouses,
                      underground clubs like this --

                                WHISTLER
                      I don't see any traffic, no vampire
                      glyphs --

            Whistler lifts up a pair of night-vision binoculars and scans
            the building.

            WHISTLER'S POV (THROUGH BINOCULARS)

            He scans the graffiti scrawls, doesn't see anything.

                                NYSSA
                      Look closer.  Because of your efforts,
                      we've had to re-think our habits,
                      tighten our security.

            WHISTLER'S POV (THROUGH BINOCULARS)

            Whistler switches to infra-red.  A previously unseen Vampire
            GLYPH is now revealed, hidden amongst the haphazard graffiti.
            Just beneath the glyph are a pair of loading doors set flush
            into the concrete sidewalk.

                                WHISTLER
                          (lowering binocs; to Blade)
                      Let's put this clusterfuck in gear.

            Reinhardt reaches for Whistler, stopping him.

                                REINHARDT
                      You're not going anywhere, greenjeans.
                      You won't be able to pass for us.

                                WHISTLER
                      Like I give a shit.

            Before things can escalate, Blade steps between them.

                                BLADE
                          (to Whistler; sotto)
                      He's right.  They'll smell that you're
                      human.  Stay here, watch our backs.

                                WHISTLER
                          (bristling)
                      I don't like it.

                                BLADE
                      I'm not giving you a choice, old man.

            Whistler considers Blade's words, then reluctantly nods.
            Blade rejoins the vampires.  Reinhardt grins.

                                REINHARDT
                      You don't keep that dog of yours curbed,
                      Blade.  We might have to do it for you.

            Blade pulls out the remote for the flechette in Reinhardt's
            head, holding it up for view.

                                BLADE
                      Keep pushing, asshole.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - UNDERGROUND ENTRANCE - NIGHT

            Nyssa leads the group into a loading area.  The only light is
            coming from a series of burning trashcans.  VAMPIRE SENTRIES
            crouch on the steps, watching, smelling Nyssa's group as they
            move past.  Adjacent areas are walled off with sheets of
            vinyl.  We hear the pulsing, bass-heavy beat of MUSIC coming
            from beyond the sheeting, beckoning us onward.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - UNDERGROUND HALLWAY - NIGHT

            The MUSIC is louder.  Neon-lit, corridor-long steel counters
            line both walls, displaying various surgical instruments
            offered as party favors.  As Blade's scans the area, we SEE
            the deadly instruments reflected in his sunglasses.  Nyssa
            looks to him.

                                NYSSA
                      This is our world you're entering.  You
                      may see things -- feeding.
                          (off Blade's inscrutable face)
                      Just remember why you're here.

                                BLADE
                          (cryptic)
                      I haven't forgotten.

            They reach a steel loading door emblazoned with warning signs
            -- the kind that is split horizontally, one-half retracting
            into the ceiling, the other into the floor.

                                PRIEST
                      So what are we looking for, exactly?

                                ASAD
                      Anyone who looks suspicious.

            On that portentous note, Nyssa hits a button.  The hydraulic
            doors open on into --

                                BLADE
                      You gotta be kidding me.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

            A high-ceilinged ballroom packed with SWAYING BODIES.
            Retrofitted into a trance-dance hall.  Off to the sides,
            people are being pierced, tattooed, ritually scarred.  Silver
            trays piled high with razor blades are passed through the
            writhing crowd.  Everyone looks suspicious.

            AN ELABORATE S&M STAGE SHOW

            is under way.  Joel Peter Witkin channeled by Julie Taymor.
            A SHE-VAMPIRE hangs from the ceiling, her body supported by
            steel pins which have been hooked through her flesh.  THREE
            PVC-clad spindly FIGURES minister to her.

            TWO VAMPIRES

            French kiss, exchanging razor blades with their tongues.

                                BLADE
                          (to Nyssa)
                      What is it with you people and pain?

                                NYSSA
                      We need it.  Sensations are addictive
                      and pain cuts the deepest.
                          (off his look)
                      Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring --
                      because we regenerate, none of it's
                      permanent.  So we have to take it to the
                      next level. To remind us we're alive.

            The Bloodpack fans out through the trancing crowd.

            ON BLADE

            Drifting through the press of flesh.  Feral faces flash by
            us, distorted by the stroboscopic lights.  A SHE-VAMPIRE
            latches onto him.  He shoves her aside, keeps scanning faces.
            It takes every ounce of his restraint not to cut loose.

                                BLADE
                      You reading me, Scud?

            EXT. STREET - NIGHT

            A nondescript van with primer blotches is parked nearby.

                                SCUD (O.S.)
                      Loud and clear, B.

            INT. OPERATIONS VAN - NIGHT

            The interior of the van has been outfitted into a mobile "op
            center".  Scud sits in a cluttered nest of electronic
            ephermera, munching on a bag of White Castle hamburgers.
            He's watching a video feed from a camera mounted on Blade's
            gear, listening to the Bloodpack's CHATTER coming in from
            various audio channels.  In the background, he's also got
            Barry White's "Love Machine" playing.

                                SCUD
                      Everything's copacetic in the Mystery
                      Van.  How you doing, Whistler?

            EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

            Whistler is atop the roof of a nearby building, outfitted
            with a sniper rifle on a tripod.

                                WHISTLER
                      Walking on sunshine, toke-boy.

            WHISTLER'S POV (NIGHT VISION BINOCULARS)

            The view pans from the hotel entrance to Scud's van.

            Whistler puts down the binoculars, lights a cigarette.  He
            takes out a knife and slices open his palm.  He stares at the
            blood, his hand slowly trembling.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

            Blade works his way through the crowd.  The beat is getting
            heavier now, the crowd more energized.  He briefly makes eye
            contact with Nyssa, but then she's gone again, disappearing
            into the sea of flesh, ducking past one of the vinyl sheets
            into a corridor beyond.  Chupa, Asad, Snowman and Priest
            remain behind, searching the crowd.

            As Blade walks, he notices a series of grates beneath their
            feet.  We shift our POV --

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - DRAINAGE AREA - NIGHT

            -- and we are below Blade, looking up at him through the
            grate.  We are in a blood-encrusted drainage area just
            beneath the ballroom that slopes inward towards a large,
            octagonal iron culvert.  As we watch, a section of the
            culvert rises, a pair of RED EYES peering out from the
            darkness within.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - STAIRCASE - NIGHT

            Blade follows Nyssa up a narrow staircase into a corridor
            lined with gangrenous, peeling wallpaper.  Some of the room
            doors are shut, some open.  Clearly, many are occupied.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - KITCHEN - NIGHT

            A 1930s industrial kitchen filled with corroded equipment.
            Reinhardt, Verlaine, and Lighthammer work their way inward,
            searching the area.  Lighthammer carries massive war hammer
            like his namesake.
            Reinhardt nods to Verlaine, who opens a walk-in, shining her
            entry light over an assortment of rusting meat hooks.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - FIRST CORRIDOR - NIGHT

            Blade checks more doorways, catching half-glimpses of FLESH,
            LEATHER, and STEEL.  He hears SOBBING, MOANS, WHISPERS.
            Then, a distinctly HUMAN WHIMPER catches his attention.

            Nyssa opens a door onto an empty room.  A vacant stainless
            steel examination table gleams in the center, waiting.

            Blade pushes open another door.  We SEE a fearful YOUNG WOMAN
            crouching in the corner of a soiled room.  A corpulent
            VAMPIRE in a leather apron is hosing down the floor.

                                CORPULENT VAMPIRE
                      Close the fucking door, buddy.

            Blade makes eye-contact with the woman.  She's clearly human.
            Blade tenses.  The corpulent vampire is getting irate when --

                                CORPULENT VAMPIRE (CONT'D)
                      I said, close the f--

            THUNK!  Blade throws a sliver stake into the vampire's
            forehead.  Even as the vampire turns to ash, Blade motions
            for the girl to leave and we're out the hallway again, Nyssa
            turning around.

                                NYSSA
                      What was that?

                                BLADE
                          (poker-faced)
                      Nothing.

            We SEE the woman duck out the room behind him.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - KITCHEN - NIGHT

            Reinhardt, Verlaine, and Lighthammer.  A Styrofoam cup rolls
            across the floor, blown by a breeze.  Reinhardt pauses,
            notices another walk-in freezer door ajar, moves in that
            direction.

            Unseen behind them, a door BEHIND THEM slowly swings open.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

            Chupa, Asad, Snowman and Priest.  THREE SHADOWED FIGURES are
            lurking near one of the exits -- skinhead types, each with a
            hairline scar running down their chin.
            Asad silently motions to snowman and the others, indicating
            figures.  Snowman signs something back.  The vampire trio
            starts towards them.

            INT. OPERATIONS VAN - NIGHT

            Bored to shit, Scud plucks a joint from behind his ear.  As
            he fires up his woman torso lighter we HEAR SOMETHING just
            outside the van.  Scud kills the Barry White, listening.
            Silence.  Then, a FAINT SKITTERING.

                                SCUD
                      Um, Whistler, you out there?

            No response.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                          (more urgently)
                      Whistler?

            Still no response.  Scud reaches for a handgun and creeps
            into the front of the van.  He looks out the windshield --
            nothing.  He looks left, then right - nothing.

            Unnerved, Scud returns to the back of the van.  He reaches
            for the handle of the rear door and abruptly jerks the door
            open, aiming the gun out --

            There's nothing outside the van.  But then Scud hears the
            SKITTERING AGAIN.  His eyes shift apprehensively to the floor
            of the van below him.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - FIRST CORRIDOR - NIGHT

            As they near the end of the hall, Blade notices a drop-down
            attic door in the ceiling above.  He unsheathes his sword and
            uses the tip to unlatch the trapdoor.  The counter-weighted
            door CREAKS and LOWERS, unfolding a sectioned ladder.  We see
            darkness beyond.  As Blade cautiously mounts the stairs --

            Nyssa's attention is drawn to a billowing piece of vinyl.  A
            BLURRY FIGURE is visible behind it.  Then it moves away.
            Nyssa ducks past the vinyl.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

            As the music reaches a crescendo, Asad notices MORE SHADOWY
            FIGURES by another exit.  And even MORE by a third.  Snowman
            signs to Asad again, more urgently this time, as the first
            potential Reaper begins to turn and we are --

            INT. OPERATIONS VAN - NIGHT

            -- back with Scud.  He ducks his head outside, looking
            beneath the van.  Nothing there.  Relieved, Scud shuts the
            rear door, laughs to himself.

            A PAIR OF CLAWED HANDS

            Suddenly rip down through the ceiling of the van, peeling it
            up and back like it was tinfoil!  A REAPER with a bloody
            bandage covering his eye SNARLS down at us.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

            The first skinhead figure spins towards us.  It's a Reaper.
            All three of them are, eyes wide with bloodlust as they leap
            at Asad and the others.

            Suddenly, the Reapers are everywhere, blocking the exits,
            ripping into their vampire victims, tossing them aside like
            toys.  Vampires scream and run, some taking to the walls as a
            means of escape, some racing across the ceiling.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - FIRST CORRIDOR - NIGHT

            Blade stops half-way up the ladder as he hears GUNFIRE.  He
            drops back to the floor, then notices that Nyssa is gone.  HE
            pushes through the vinyl curtain and finds -- Nyssa forced
            back against the wall, wrestling with --

                                SCUD (O.S.)
                          (filtered; panicked)
                      They're here!!!!

            -- Nomak, who swings his head around towards Blade!  Blade
            FIRES his MACH pistol point-blank into Nomak's face, blasting
            the Reaper backwards --

            But Nomak is back on his feet in a split-second, SMASHING
            through a window onto the fire escape beyond.  Blade rushes
            to the window, looks out --

            BLADE'S POV

            Nomak is scaling his way straight up the neon hotel sign,
            jumping from one letter to the next with lightning speed.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - KITCHEN - NIGHT

            A Reaper EXPLODES out from the walk-in, rather than the door
            behind them.  He leaps atop Reinhardt, SLAMMING him to the
            floor.  Lighthammer swings his hammer, missing the Reaper,
            taking out a chunk of the wall instead.
            Lighthammer swings and misses again, taking a chunk out of
            the floor.  Verlaine empties her automatic rifle into the
            Reaper even as --

            The Reaper turns on Lighthammer, catching the war hammer,
            Reaper's lower jaw disengages and splits open, revealing a
            freakishly enlarged esophagus lined with serrated, sharklike
            teeth.

            All of this takes a split-second.  No time for Lighthammer to
            react as the Reaper latches its grossly expanded mouth onto
            his throat and begins draining him before our eyes.  The
            Reaper SHUDDERS and the whites of his eyes bleed red as an
            ecstatic wave washes over him.  His pale flesh, pulsing with
            engorged veinwork, becomes flushed, turning crimson as --

                                LIGHTHAMMER
                      Ohmygodhe'sfuckingkillingmehe's --

            Lighthammer's face becomes increasingly pallid!  His face
            begins caving inward, shrinking as every millimeter of blood
            is vacuumed out of him.

            BLOOD VESSELS

            Are popping up beneath the Reaper's briefly translucent skin,
            becoming engorged and dilated.  The veins continue to swell,
            racing up his neck, then branching out over his face, chest,
            and arms -- like an instant network of varicose veins.

            Verlaine retreats, horrified.  Reinhardt scurries backwards,
            then scrambles to his feet, running for his life into --

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

            Chaos.  Vampire patrons flee.  The Bloodpack FIRE, unleashing
            a hailstorm of bullets, cutting into vampires and Reapers
            alike as --

            EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

            Blade steps out onto the icy fire escape.  CRASH!  Nomak has
            dislodged the "H" from the hotel sign.  It comes HURTLING
            towards Blade, who ducks back into the center of the "O" to
            avoid being hit.  The "H" continues falling, SMASHING down
            into the street near the Mystery Van where --

            INT/EXT. OPERATIONS VAN - NIGHT

            Scud unloads his handgun into the Reaper atop the van.  The
            Reaper should turn to ash, but it doesn't!  Scud flees,
            DIVING into the front of the van, ducking behind the wheel.
            He keys the ignition --

            WHAM!  Now the Reaper is atop the hood, SMASHING his feet
            through the windshield.  Scud SCREAMS as he slams the van
            into the drive and floors the pedal --

            WK-KRUNCH!  Scud CRASHES the van against the side of a
            building, pinning the Reaper between the van's front bumper
            and the crumbling wall.  He keeps his foot on the gas pedal,
            GRINDING the van's wheels.

            This gambit should cut the Reaper in half, or at the very
            least, fatally wound it -- but it only enrages it further.
            The Reaper stretches forward across the van's crumpled hood
            and resumes BATTERING away at the cracked windshield --

                                SCUD
                      UV headlights, c'mon, come on!!!

            Scud fumbles for the headlights.  They won't go on!  Then he
            notices a mess of wiring haphazardly duct-taped together.  He
            reaches for the wiring, fiddling with it --

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      FuckmefuckmefuckmeFUCKME!!!!

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

            The Reaper nearest Priest turns in his direction.  We
            recognize her as the Nurse from the bloodbank.  She LEAPS at
            Priest --

            Priest fires a Glaser round through the she-Reaper's head.
            The Reaper twists in mid-leap, falls to the floor, then picks
            herself up again.  Like Scud's Reaper, she seems unaffected
            by the custom-made ammo.

            ON THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE BLOODPACK

            Having similarly disastrous results.  The Reapers are
            shrugging off their firepower.  Asad leaps, snapping a
            Reaper's neck with a spinning heel kick, but the Reaper keeps
            coming!

            BACK TO THE PRIEST

            Alarmed, reaching for a specialized shotgun instead.  The
            Reaper continues forward, moving so fast she almost seems a
            blur as BA-BOOM! BA-BOOM!  Priest pumps his shotgun
            repeatedly.  Two projectiles fire out, chained together by a
            length of titanium cable.  The cable catches the Reaper in
            the mid-section, cutting it clean in half!

            The upper half of the Reaper falls, then rights itself,
            landing on its clawed hands.
            Impossibly, the she-Reaper keeps coming!  She skitters
            towards Priest on his hands like the half-man from Todd
            Browning's "FREAKS".

            The half-Reaper launches itself at Priest, hitting him in the
            chest, knocking him back to the floor.  Priest panics as he
            struggles with the thing, trying to fend off its claws and
            fangs as it locks its mouth into his arm.  He SCREAMS.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. VAN - NIGHT

            As Scud continues to fiddle with the faulty headlight wiring,
            the windshield finally SHATTERS beneath the Reaper's pounding
            fists.  It latches onto Scud's collar and pulls him forward
            over the wheel even as the seam/scar in its chin splits apart
            and the Reaper's enlarged maw flowers open.  Scud is just
            centimeters away from having his face being bitten off when --

            -- the wires SPARK and the headlights come on, illuminating
            the Reaper in a wash of UV light!  The effect is
            instantaneous.  The Reaper HOWLS and lets go, then promptly
            BURSTS INTO FLAMES.

            Scud cups his ear, shouting via the comm system.

                                SCUD
                      Use your entry lights!  They can't stand
                      the UV!!!

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BASEMENT - NIGHT

            Asad hears Scud's message as he continues fending off a
            Reaper's attack.  Then he manages to get hold of his rifle.
            He FLICKS on the UV entry light, aiming it at the Reaper's
            face.  The Reaper's head catches fire.  Asad SHOUTS to the
            others --

                                ASAD
                      Use your entry lights!

            One by one, the members of the Bloodpack CLICK ON the entry
            lights mounted atop their guns.  It's working -- the UV beams
            are the only thing that seems to be driving the Reapers back.

            EXT. HOUSE OF PAIN - ROOF - DAWN

            BOOM!  Blade kicks open the roof access door.  He hurries
            outside, followed by Nyssa, who hesitates when she SEES --

            THE SUN

            beginning to rise beyond the cityscape horizon.  Nomak is
            already at the opposite side of the building, moving fast.

                                BLADE
                          (into com-link)
                      Whistler!  He's heading across the roof!
                      Take him!

            Nyssa falls back into the shadows as Blade continues onward,
            unsheathing his sword.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Whistler!!!

            EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

            Whistler's sniper rifle and binoculars have been abandoned
            and --

            EXT. HOUSE OF PAIN - ROOFTOP - DAWN

            We're back with Blade as he chases Nomak across the roof.

            UP AHEAD

            Nomak abruptly stops, having reached the end of the roof.
            The nearest neighboring rooftop is too far away and the drop
            from this last ledge looks unsurvivable, even for someone
            like Nomak.

            As Blade cautiously advances, Nomak turns around and smiles --
            a wolfish grin, unnaturally wide.  The Reaper's face is
            beginning to smoke beneath the rising sun's rays.  In
            response, a polarized nictomembrane slides down over Nomak's
            irises -- like something you'd see on a crocodile to protect
            its eyes from harsh light.

                                NOMAK
                      Is the enemy of my enemy my friend or my
                      enemy?  What do you think, Blade?  What
                      am I to you?

            Nomak LAUGHS, then LUNGES, scooping up a rusty iron bar that
            lies nearby.  He swings it at Blade.  Blade parries and steps
            backward, taking a blow to the head in the process, then
            another to the side.

            The two of them exchange a flurry of blows back and forth
            until their weapons lock and they are face to face.  Nomak's
            back is to the rising sun, now.  His whole body is beginning
            to lightly smoke.

            Both men are trembling, straining against their weapons,
            using every ounce of strength to keep the other at bay.  And
            just when it looks like Nomak is gaining the upper hand --

                                NOMAK (CONT'D)
                      Athelfiki singenia ex amato.

            -- Blade pivots the flat edge of his sword upwards, catching
            the light of the rising sun, reflecting it directly into
            Nomak's eyes!

            Nomak SCREAMS and rears back, his face catching fire.  Then
            he stumbles backwards and falls -- right off the ledge of the
            roof!  Blade hurries to the roof's ledge and looks down --

            But the Reaper is nowhere in sight.  Dumbfounded, Blade
            retreats, haunted by the conviction that Nomak is still
            alive.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - DAWN

            Blade has returned to the scene of the melee.  The Reapers
            have fled, leaving Nyssa and the others to lick their wounds
            and survey the carnage.  Quite a few full-body ash outlines
            marking the passing of various vampires.  Blade approaches
            Nyssa.  She notices his wounds.

                                NYSSA
                      You're hurt.

                                BLADE
                          (brushing off her concern)
                      I'll heal.

                                NYSSA
                      What about Nomak?

                                BLADE
                      He escaped.  You didn't tell me they
                      were immune to silver and garlic.

                                NYSSA
                      I didn't know.

            Beat.  Tense.  Does he trust this woman?  No way.

                                BLADE
                      We lose anybody?

                                NOMAK
                      Lighthammer and --

            Just then, we hear an unearthly SCREAM.

            ANGLE ON

            Priest, being held down by Chupa and Snowman.  He's thrashing
            about, clutching his wounded, infected arm.

                                PRIEST
                      Oh god, oh God it hurts!  It hurts, it
                      hurts, fuck, it hurts.  Ugh!

            Priest lets loose an agonized SCREAM as Blade and the others
            gather around him.  He's undergoing a horrific change, taking
            on the gaunt, vein-engorged features of a proper Reaper.  He
            SNARLS and WAILS, GNASHING his teeth like a rabid animal.

            Reinhardt and his team look uneasy.  Shaken by their
            teammate's downward progression.

                                BLADE
                      how long since he was bitten?

                                NYSSA
                      Minutes.

            Blade draws closer.  Already, the flesh on Priest's chin is
            splitting as a seam begins to form.

                                BLADE
                      It's already changing him --

            Reinhardt paces, annoyed by Priest's WAILING.

                                REINHARDT
                      Jesus, can't you get him to shut the
                      fuck up!?

                                NYSSA
                          (gravely)
                      His blood cells aren't producing oxygen
                      anymore.  His own body is suffocating
                      him.  These things are like crack
                      addicts.  If they don't feed every few
                      hours, they'll feed on themselves.

            As if in response, Priest starts convulsing.  His flesh
            tightens, drawing taut around his increasingly skeletal form.
            His screams become unbearable, twisting into a high-pitched
            ululation that's making the Bloodpack's skin crawl.

                                REINHARDT
                      Somebody put him out of his misery for
                      fuck's sake!

                                VERLAINE
                      You kill him!  I'm not killing him!

            Asad pulls out his handgun and empties the clip into Priest's
            body -- but Priest keeps SHRIEKING.

            Unnerved, Reinhardt unsheathes a machete, decapitating Priest
            even as the others protest.

            The headless body continues thrashing, still making noise
            from it's open throat!  If anything, it seems to be
            redoubling its efforts.  It LURCHES forward, jerking itself
            free from Chupa and Snowman's restraining arms.

                                CHUPA
                      Mierda!!

            The juddering horror that used to be Priest staggers to its
            feet.  Reinhardt and his men panic, stumbling backwards.  The
            headless monstrosity LUNGES STRAIGHT AT --

            BLADE

            Without batting an eye, he draws his MACH pistol, briefly
            aiming at the on-rushing creature's chest, then adjusting his
            aim to one of the blacked-out windows above and behind it.

            BAM!BAM!BAM!  Blade shoots out the window and BLAZING SHAFT
            OF SUNLIGHT slices down through the darkness, spotlighting
            Priest like an ant beneath a magnifying glass.

            FWASH!!!  The headless body is incinerated in mid-step.  It
            collapses to the floor, just inches before Blade.  One of its
            blackened claws feebly grabs Blade's boot, then grows still.

            Beat.  You could hear the pin drop in the silence that
            follows, every one of the Bloodpack thinking some variation
            of "there but for the grace of God go I".  Asad lays a hand
            on Nyssa's shoulder, steadying her.

            Blade shifts his foot, causing the cinder-like hand gripping
            his boot to crumble to dust.

                                WHISTLER (O.S.)
                      If this is the best you turd-stains have
                      to offer, I'm not impressed.

            Blade looks over to see Whistler, who is just entering.  He
            moves over to him, angry.  Chupa follows, equally pissed.

                                BLADE
                      I thought you were supposed to be
                      watching our backs.

                                WHISTLER
                      Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.

                                CHUPA
                          (approaching, hostile)
                      Oh yeah?  Like how little?  In case you
                      hadn't noticed, we lost two men while
                      you were out farting around.

                                WHISTLER
                          (poking Chupa in the chest)
                      You need to ratchet those 'nads of yours
                      down a few notches, paco.

            Chupa flushes with anger and flicks his knife across
            Whistler's shoulder, opening a gash.  Whistler goes ballistic
            and PUNCHES Chupa in the face.  A brief tussle ensues before
            Blade and the others can separate them.  As Chupa is pulled
            away by Asad, he looks back at Whistler.

                                CHUPA
                      Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair
                      away from cowboy heaven.

                                WHISTLER
                      Ain't no thing but a chicken wing,
                      buttercup.

                                BLADE
                          (still suspicious)
                      Where were you, Whistler?

                                WHISTLER
                      I'll show you.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - DRAINAGE AREA - CONTINUOUS

            Whistler, Blade and the surviving members of the Bloodpack
            are now gathered around the octagonal iron culvert just
            beneath the ballroom.  Whistler turns on a flashlight.  We
            HEAR something moving in the darkness.  The group tenses,
            then Whistler's flashlight beam reveals --

            A REAPER

            Cowering by the culvert.  One we recognize.  The other
            vampire guard from the bloodbank, now transformed.  He's
            shrunken and emaciated, pale.  And although he's obviously
            dying, he still HISSES, his fanged mouth snapping
            ineffectually at them.  His arm has been trapped -- pinned
            under one of the sectional culvert coverings.  It looks like
            he's been trying to gnaw it off in order to escape.

                                REINHARDT
                      What the hell?

                                WHISTLER
                      I found him like this.  I think he was
                      trying to crawl back into that culvert.

            Blade looks to the culvert in question.  He pulls back one of
            the sectioned covers.  The opening is about two feet wide,
            just large enough for a man to gain access.

            INT. SEWER/OUTFLOW AREA - CONTINUOUS

            Blade drops into the sewer line.  The area is claustrophobic,
            damp.  There are torn pieces of insulation hanging from the
            ceiling, saturated and dripping with blood.

            Blade crouch-walks further in.  We hear WIND.  He shines his
            FLASHLIGHT.  A portion of the brick wall looks like it's been
            clawed open.

                                NYSSA
                          (calling down)
                      Everything okay?

            Blade retreats back to the drain-pipe, pulling himself back
            up.  We HOLD for a beat, then drift up to the blood-saturated
            strips of insulation.  SOMEONE is crouched in the shadows
            there, clinging to the ceiling upside down.

            It's NOMAK, red-eyes shining in the darkness.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. DAMASKINO'S LAIR - BATHHOUSE - DAY

            We are in a previously unseen portion of Damaskino's vast
            bedroom.  An elegantly tiled pool area has been partitioned
            off by a series of latticed screens.  In the counterpoint to
            this are a series of muted monitors tuned to the pulse of the
            world -- CNN, MSNBC, C-SPAN, etc.

            Damaskinos sits in a robe, finishing a meal, his eyes
            flicking over the monitors -- tracking current events, market
            fluctuations.  We get the sense that the man is a true
            polymath.  That he owes his five thousand-plus years of
            existence to resourcefulness rather than luck.

            Stevens enters, waiting to be acknowledged.

                                DAMASKINOS
                          (vampire dialect; subtitled)
                      Yes?

                                STEVENS
                          (vampire dialect; subtitled)
                      They've made contact with the Reapers.

                                DAMASKINOS
                          (vampire dialect; subtitled)
                      Any casualties?

                                STEVENS
                          (vampire dialect; subtitled)
                      Two so far.

            Unconcerned, Damaskinos slices into a piece of raw meat.

                                DAMASKINOS
                          (reverting to English)
                      An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was
                      not among them, I trust.

                                STEVENS
                      No.  This is a dangerous game, you're
                      playing, Damaskinos.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      Any game worthy of being played is.  One
                      must be patient.  In this way, I have
                      outlived my enemies.  All of them.

            Damaskinos steps beyond the screens now, into the pool area --
            and although we can't see the water from this angle, we can
            see patterns of ruby light flickering off the tiled walls.
            Stevens follows, uncomfortable.

                                STEVENS
                      Blade's too volatile.  You're not going
                      to be able to keep manipulating him --

            Damaskinos steps into the steaming liquid, which we now see
            is BLOOD.  His robe spreads out, floating on the surface.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      You worry too much, Stevens.  I have
                      assurance from our friend inside that
                      events are unfolding as scripted.

                                STEVENS
                      As scripted?  You've already lost two of
                      your own.  How many more are you willing
                      to sacrifice?

            Damaskinos sinks until he's waist-deep in the crimson fluid.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      As many as it takes.
                          (pointing)
                      Do you see that jar over there?

            Stevens looks to a shelf where a gold and crystal Coptic jar
            rests.  A HUMAN HEART floats within.

                                DAMASKINOS (CONT'D)
                      It contains my human heart --
                          (touching a pale scar on his
                           chest)
                      Something I relinquished a long time
                      ago.  Only a fool would appeal to it
                      now.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - CELL - NIGHT

            The dying Reaper has now been chained inside the cell.  It
            WHEEZES and MOANS, clearly in agony.  Blade and Nyssa stand
            watch.  Blade grips the Reaper beneath its jaw, turning its
            face towards us.

                                BLADE
                      Recognize him?

                                NYSSA
                          (nodding)
                      From the surveillance footage in the
                      bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's
                      Nomak attacked.

                                BLADE
                      Which means he turned about seventy-two
                      hours ago.

                                NYSSA
                      Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't
                      appear to have any broken bones, no
                      entry wounds of any kind -- what's
                      killing him?

                                BLADE
                      Time.

            Blade nicks the Reaper's carotid artery with a knife.  CLEAR
            SERUM oozes out, no red blood cells at all.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      No hemoglobin left.
                      Their metabolisms are too fast.  They
                      burn out.  That's why they're having to
                      feed so often.  Their systems are self
                      destructing.

                                NYSSA
                      If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's
                      been alive longer than the others.

                                BLADE
                      Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.
                          (shaking his head)
                      There's something driving him beyond the
                      Thirst.  Something we're missing.

            As they watch, the Reaper shakes through its final death
            throes, then grows still, the nictomembranes over its eyes
            slowly sliding down.

            MOMENTS LATER - A SERIES OF ISOLATED CLOSE-UPS

            A pair of GLOVED HANDS spreads apart the Reaper's eyelids.
            In response, the protective nictomembrane slides mechanically
            down over the pupil.

                                NYSSA (O.S.)
                      They appear to have a nictating membrane
                      here, like you'd see on a crocodile or
                      camel.  Shields the eyes from sunlight.

            The hands now part the Reaper's mouth, probing the seam in
            the chin, then splitting the mandible apart to reveal the
            enlarged esophagus.  The fingers push back on the gums and
            the pressure-sensitive fangs extend even further in response.

                                NYSSA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                      A bifurcated mandible.  More developed
                      masseter muscles and zygomatic bones
                      around the mouth allowing for a much
                      larger, stronger bite --

            PULL BACK TO REVEAL

            Blade, Nyssa, and Scud are gathered around the autopsy table.
            The rest of the crew linger further back.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      Epidermal layers are thicker, tougher --

            Nyssa begins the Y-incision along the chest.  Once again,
            CLEAR SERUM oozes out.  She cracks open the thoracic cavity.

                                SCUD
                      Ho-lee shit.

            We SEE inside the abdominal cavity.  A complex, pinkish/gray
            parasitic organism has taken over every organ visible.

                                NYSSA
                      I've never seen anything like this.  The
                      Reapers are as different from us as we
                      are from you.
                          (probing the organism)
                      It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring
                      their bodies, creating new, parasitic
                      organs which consume the old ones.

                                BLADE
                      Like cancer with a purpose.

                                NYSSA
                      Exactly.  Look at the digestive system.
                      It's been drastically simplified.  Super
                      charged.  And this --

            She pulls back the lungs -- a calcified structure encasing a
            fibrous mass rests where the heart would normally be.  She
            taps the calcified structure with a scalpel.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      The heart is completely encased in bone.

            She tries to cut into the bony shell and the scalpel snaps.
            Scud WHISTLES, impressed.

                                SCUD
                      Good luck getting a stake through that.

            Blade studies the Reaper corpse, then looks to the Bloodpack.

                                BLADE
                      We've got six hours till sunrise.  Be
                      ready by then.

                                ASAD
                      What happens at sunrise?

                                BLADE
                      We take up the hunt again.

                                CHUPA
                      You gotta be fucking joking.

                                BLADE
                      You've seen what we're up against.
                      Daylight's the only advantage we've got.
                      They'll be more vulnerable then.

                                REINHARDT
                          (pointedly)
                      And so will we.

                                BLADE
                      Look, I care about the humans who are
                      dying, not you, got it?

                                REINHARDT
                          (snarling)
                      Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not
                      going out into the sun.  It's too risky.

                                BLADE
                      You don't have a choice.  You're just
                      going to have to protect yourselves as
                      best you can.

            Blade spins and leaves.  Whistler follows.  Nyssa watches
            them disappear into Blade's room.  Reinhardt and the other
            vampires approach her.

                                REINHARDT
                      You buying any of this chocolate Elvis
                      bullshit?

            Nyssa just stares him down, obviously conflicted.

                                CHUPA
                      This guy doesn't know what the fuck he's
                      doing.  We already lost Priest and
                      Lighthammer, who's gonna be next?  Fuck
                      him.  Fuck his rules.  First chance I
                      get, I'm chowing down on that fucking
                      HeeHaw sidekick of his.

            Snowman signs something to Verlaine.

                                VERLAINE
                      What do you think, Asad?

                                ASAD
                          (pointedly)
                      I don't think.  I follow orders.

            Asad looks to Nyssa once more -- perhaps he's even concerned
            now.  She's still staring in the direction Blade left.


            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BLADE'S SLEEPING AREA - NIGHT

            Blade sits in the shadows, wrapping a piece of rubber tubing
            around his arm, injecting himself with pneumatic syringe of
            serum.  He shivers, convulses violently, then throws back his
            head in relief.  When he does so, he SEES --

            Whistler standing in the doorway.  They eye each other a
            moment as Blade unwraps the tubing from his arm, puts away
            his syringe and serum.  Whistler lights a cigarette, then
            nods through a window towards Nyssa and the others.

                                WHISTLER
                      You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are
                      getting a mite too cozy for my taste.

                                BLADE
                      I wouldn't worry about it.

            Blade moves to walk away, but Whistler stops him.

                                WHISTLER
                      I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're
                      starting to get confused as to which
                      side of the line you're standing on.

                                BLADE
                      Pretty hollow words coming from a man
                      who spent the last year running with the
                      enemy.

                                WHISTLER
                      What the hell is that supposed to mean?

                                BLADE
                      It means I'm starting to wonder if the
                      vampires still have their hooks in you.
                      You've been acting strange ever since I
                      gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to
                      anger --
                          (beat)
                      You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those
                      vampires knew our defense system
                      backwards and forwards.  Where'd they
                      get their intel?

            Whistler steps closer, his voice dropping to a lethal,
            whisper.

                                WHISTLER
                      I'm compromised?!  Me?!  I'm not the one
                      playing stink-finger with Vampirella out
                      there!

            Blade stares back at Whistler, calm as a viper.

                                BLADE
                      You're out of line, old man.

            The two comrades in arms stare each other down.  Then,
            finally, Whistler backs away.

                                WHISTLER
                          (quietly)
                      We'll see.

            Whistler turns and strides exits.  We HOLD ON Blade, torn,
            conflicted, watching Whistler retreat.

            EXT. BLADE'S WAREHOUSE/SHIPYARD - NIGHT

            We SEE a FIGURE emerge from the shadows -- CHUPA.

            EXT. CITY SLUM - NIGHT

            Chupa walks the night, scanning shadows.

            CHUPA'S POV (VAMPIRE VISION)

            Like heat-vision, only tinged with crimson.  There are DRUG
            DEALERS and bottom feeding WHORES trolling for tricks out
            here, BEATING HEARTS and BRANCHING ARTERIES highlighted on
            their ghostly silhouettes.

            Chupa moves to the mouth of an alley, nodding to a DEALER.

                                DEALER
                      Lookin' to get hooked up?

                                CHUPA
                      What you got?

            As the dealer glances around to see if anyone's watching --

                                DEALER
                      Horse, Hawaiian ice.  Whatever you want.

            Chupa sniffs the air, glancing at a pulsating vein on the
            dealer's neck, and smiles.

                                CHUPA
                      Whatever, huh?  Well I'm all off the
                      hook on that bitch.

            Chupa steps into the alley with the dealer.

                                DEALER
                      So what's it gonna be?

                                CHUPA
                      Fear.

            Chupa is at the dealer's throat before he can finish,
            flashing his fangs, shoving him backwards.  Then --

                                CHUPA (CONT'D)
                      I like a little adrenaline chaser.

            WHAP!  A HAND

            Grabs a fistful of Chupa's hair, jerking his head back.  It's
            Blade.  He yanks Chupa off the dealer.

                                BLADE
                      What do you think you're doing?

                                CHUPA
                      Trying to feed, puto baboso!

            The dealer takes off as Blade swings Chupa around.  They
            exchange a couple of blows, then Blade knees him in the
            balls, twisting him around by his arm, dislocating it.

            Blade releases Chupa, shoving him forward.  Chupa's broken
            arm dangles awkwardly.  Furious, Chupa reaches for his .45
            with his good hand -- only to hear the CLICK of another gun
            as it's placed against the back of his head.

            ANGLE ON NYSSA

            Standing behind him, looking grim and determined.

                                NYSSA
                      Do it and you die.
                          (Chupa considers options)
                      You heard Asad.  Until this is over,
                      these people are our allies.

                                CHUPA
                      Oh I haven't forgotten about Asad.  I'm
                      just wondering if you have.

            Chupa re-holsters his gun, then jams his dislocated arm up
            against the wall and resets it.  He backs away.  Nyssa
            watches him leave, looks to Blade.

                                NYSSA
                      He's right about one thing.  We do have
                      to survive.

                                BLADE
                      You don't have to hunt to do it.

                                NYSSA
                      Really?  What are we supposed to do,
                      then?  Starve ourselves because we fee
                      on others in order to live?  What about
                      that scumbag you just let off the hook?
                      A nothing.  A drug-dealer.  How do you
                      justify saving people like that?

            Blade doesn't answer, just moves away.  She follows.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      You know the Thirst better than any of
                      us.  You're barely managing to tread
                      water yourself.  Living in a constant
                      state of pain, having to shoot up that
                      serum of yours.  That's not what I call
                      surviving, Blade.

            Off Blade's stony expression we --

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

            The back of the workshop.  Scud takes a hit of weed then
            resumes working on one of the UV entry lights -- it's been
            taken half-apart and tweaked-out with cables and a crystal
            prism.  Whistler is there too, loading magazines.

                                WHISTLER
                          (observing Scud)
                      The hell are you fiddling with there?

                                SCUD
                          (proud, succinct)
                      Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the
                      collimated beam, wanna concentrate the
                      light, get something like a UV laser
                      going.

                                WHISTLER
                          (shaking his head)
                      You're wasting your time, already been
                      tried.

                                SCUD
                      Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster
                      working on it, did you?

                                WHISTLER
                          (testy)
                      Nope.  Back then we did not.

                                SCUD
                          (unfazed)
                      So how long have you known Blade,
                      anyway?

                                WHISTLER
                      Going on twenty years now.

                                SCUD
                      Blade doesn't talk about the old days
                      much.

                                WHISTLER
                      Blade doesn't talk about anything much.
                          (nodding to Scud)
                      What about you, though?

            Scud pulls up his T-shirt.  His abdomen is covered in a
            network of horrific scars.  Like something you'd see on the
            survivor of a shark attack.

                                WHISTLER (CONT'D)
                      Pretty.

                                SCUD
                      I was backpacking.  Hooked up with these
                      two chicks who were off to see the
                      Burning Man festival.  We were gonna
                      take "E", have ourselves a little
                      freeball out in the desert.  You know
                      the riff, "Dear Penthouse, I never
                      thought this would happen to me, but --"

            Scud takes a Phillip and adjust some screws on the laser.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      Anyway, halfway through our Three's
                      Company marathon, Janet and Chrissy
                      started taking chunks out of me.  Woulda
                      died too if Blade hadn't shown up and
                      staked those mamacitas a new honeyhole.
                          (shrugging)
                      Things kinda fell in place after that.

            Scud jiggles the necklace of fangs around his neck.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      Took myself a few souvenirs, though.

            Scud triggers the modified entry light.  The light PULSES
            like a series of flash-bulbs going off, creating a
            stroboscopic effect as a wafer-thin, super-concentrated BLUE
            BEAM OF LIGHT slices through the shadows.  Scud looks to
            Whistler and smiles.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      Mmm-mmm.  Poppa's got a brand new bag.

            EXT. CITYSCAPE - PRE-DAWN

            Beyond the shadowed skyline of monolithic buildings, the
            night is beginning to give way to dawn.

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - PRE-DAWN

            Scud stands before the others.  He looks bleary-eyed but
            pleased with the night's work.  The fruit of their efforts
            are laid on a work table before them -- a half-dozen UV laser
            guns, along with a collection of UV flashbang grenades and a
            much bigger explosive device secured into a backpack carrier.

            Blade picks up one of the UV lasers.  He sights down the
            length of it.  Scud takes a power pack and slaps into the
            base of Blade's gun.

                                SCUD
                      The powerpacks have a limited charge,
                      maybe ten minutes of continuous use at
                      most.

            Nyssa gestures to the flashbang grenades.

                                NYSSA
                      What are these?

                                SCUD
                      UV flashbang grenades with plug-in
                      phosphor sticks --
                          (pointing to a backpack
                           carrier)
                      This is for the grand finale.  Wired
                      together a couple-dozen of those
                      puppies.  But I'd be careful where you
                      pop your load.  Might end up frying
                      yourselves in the process.

                                WHISTLER
                      What about you?  You're not coming?

                                SCUD
                      After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover,
                      not a fighter.

            Asad looks to Blade.

                                ASAD
                      What good is all this firepower if we
                      don't know where they're hiding?

                                BLADE
                      We won't need to.  They'll come to us.

                                REINHARDT
                      How?

            Blade looks to Nyssa, who tosses Reinhardt an aerosol
            cannister.  He sprays a little, then wrinkles his nose in
            disgust, gagging.

                                REINHARDT (CONT'D)
                      This is fucking foul!

                                NYSSA
                      They're pheromones.  I infused them from
                      that Reaper's adrenal glands.  All
                      mammals use them to mark their
                      territory.  Even vampires.

                                CHUPA
                      Fuck that!  I'm not spraying some gash
                      hound's nut-juice on me!

                                NYSSA
                      Trust me, the Reapers will key to it.
                      If we use this, we'll draw them out.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - DRAINAGE AREA - DAWN

            Beneath the ballroom gratings.  A high-angle shot looking
            down at the octagonal iron culvert around which Blade,
            Whistler, and the remainder of the Bloodpack are gathered.
            The mechanized, sectional portions of the culvert covering
            are GRINDING UPWARD, flowering open and apart like some blood
            and rust-encrusted gateway to Hell.

            INT. SEWER/OUTFLOW AREA - DAWN

            One by one, the group of hunters descend into the
            claustrophobic chamber.  Verlaine is lugs the UV bomb on her
            back.  Blade leads them to the clawed-open portion of the
            brick wall, then on through.

            INT. SEWER LINE - CONTINUOUS

            Blade leads the group along a grime-encrusted line which
            slopes gradually downward, sloshing through ankle-deep run
            off water collected from the city above them.  Tendrils of
            mist drift about, cutting their field of vision even further.
            Here and there, thin SHAFTS of SUNLIGHT cut down through
            cracks in the street above, requiring the vampires to
            cautiously circumvent them.

            They reach a four-way intersection of tunnels.  Blade pauses.

                                BLADE
                      Time for Nyssa's pheromones.

            Blade opens a statchel.  Inside are a dozen distinctive
            aluminum atomizers.  He hands them out to the others.
            Whistler triggers a can, spraying a thin mist over his face,
            wrinkling his noses in disgust.

                                WHISTLER
                      Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.

                                BLADE
                      We'll split into three units.  First
                      team that makes contact wins the prize.
                      Try to maintain radio silence from here
                      on out.

            Blade points to Chupa and Whistler, indicating the Eastern
            tunnel.  They head off.  Next, Blade directs Nyssa, Asad,
            Snowman, and Verlaine down the Western tunnel.  Blade nods to
            Reinhardt and starts down the Northern branch.

            INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY

            It's darker here, no shafts of sunlight slicing down from
            above.  Whistler turns on his UV entry light.  Chupa reaches
            out with his hand, partially blocking the beam.

                                CHUPA
                      Turn it off.

            As the shifting patterns of light and shadow play across
            Chupa's face we SEE his pupils contract and dilate
            unnaturally large in response.

                                CHUPA (CONT'D)
                      We want to attract them, not scare them
                      off.

                                WHISTLER
                      Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark.
                      What am I supposed to do?

            Chupa tosses Whistler a pair of night-vision goggles.

                                CHUPA
                      Bifocals, grandpa.  And try to keep up.

            Chupa heads into the darkness, moving with uncanny speed.

            INT. TUNNELS - VARIOUS

            We intercut between the three teams now, back and forth as
            they progress deeper into the city's bowels.

            INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Blade and Reinhardt trudge along.  The tunnel slopes inward,
            forming a V-shaped channel where a trickle of water flows.
            Blade notices SOMETHING bobbing in the water.  He nudges it
            with his foot and knocks it free.  It's a broken HUMAN TIBIA
            which twirls around, then flows past their legs.

            A few steps later on, Reinhardt notices SOMETHING ELSE.  He
            stoops into waist-deep water, picking up what he thinks is an
            isolated HUMAN RIB -- but ends up snagging a tangled mass of
            hair, mud, and bones.

            INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Whistler and Chupa move side by side.  Chupa is anxious, eyes
            darting about.  Occasionally, they come upon a transection
            with smaller conduits leading off to the right and the left.
            Then they reach a stooped, narrower tunnel and have to move
            single file.

            Suddenly, a BLAST of LIGHT and THUNDEROUS SOUND explodes
            above them.  They look up --

                                WHISTLER
                          (startled)
                      Shit!

            A subway TRAIN rockets by on a track just above them,
            pummeling them with soot and dust.

            Unseen by them, briefly illuminated by the flashing subway
            lights we see three Reaper faces, pale and haunting, hanging
            upside down.

            INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Blade and Reinhardt reach a dead-end where the tunnel has
            caved in.  A BERM OF HUMAN BONES slopes upward from the water
            -- skulls and ribs, vertebrae, tibias, metatarsi.  Blade
            kneels, inspecting them.  There are gnaw marks on them.

                                BLADE
                      Must be hundreds of these skeletons
                      here.

                                REINHARDT
                      So?

                                BLADE
                      So I think you people may have
                      underestimated how many Reapers you're
                      dealing with.

            INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY

            As Nyssa, Snowman, Verlaine, and Asad cautiously move
            forward, Nyssa GASPS, startled by --

            HALF A DOZEN REAPERS laying on the tunnel floor before them
            in a stagnant pool of sewage water.  Dead.

            INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Back with Whistler and Chupa, Whistler is in the lead.

                                CHUPA (O.S.)
                      Hey,hillbilly.

            As Whistler turns around, Chupa SLAMS Whistler in the side of
            the head, swiping his night-vision goggles off.  As Whistler
            vainly searches for his goggles.

                                WHISTLER
                      What the fuck you doing?

                                CHUPA
                      Ain't nobody here but you and me,
                      chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a
                      time as any to settle up.

            Chupa moves stealthily in darkness, violently KICKING the
            older man.  Whistler tries to crawl away, then reaches for
            his pheromone atomizer and locks it in the "on-position".  As
            Chupa continues to lay into Whistler we SEE the atomizer roll
            away, dispensing its contents.

            INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Blade and Reinhardt by the berm of human bones.

                                NYSSA (O.S.)
                          (filtered; over comm.)
                      Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're
                      all dead.

                                BLADE
                      Fry 'em.

            INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Nyssa nods to Asad and Verlaine.  They train their UV lasers
            on the area where the Reaper corpses were -- but the Reaper
            bodies are gone.  And so is Snowman for that matter.

                                ASAD
                      What?  Where did they go?

                                VERLAINE
                      Screw that, where did Snowman go?

            Just then, we hear a NOISE from above.  Nyssa and the others
            whip their UV lasers in that direction.

                                NYSSA
                      Jesus, they were playing possum!

            THEIR POV

            A HORDE OF REAPERS skitter away from the lights.

            INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY

            CLOSE ON the pheromone atomizer, the spray petering out.
            Whistler is beat to shit, bleeding from his mouth.  Chupa
            reaches for his handgun, whipping it out just as --

            Whistler's hands brush the damaged night vision goggles.  He
            swings them upward.

            WHISTLER'S POV (THROUGH GOGGLES)

            Whistler has just enough time to register Chupa, the handgun
            pointed directly at him/us before noticing SOMETHING ELSE
            just beyond Chupa.

            A DOZEN REAPERS

            Clinging to the ceiling above.  They drop down on Chupa like
            a pack of rabid dogs, literally tearing him in half.

            INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY (20 YEARS AGO)

            Hearing GUNFIRE and SCREAMS, Blade charges back in Whistler's
            direction as --

            THE BERM OF HUMAN BONES

            EXPLODE apart.  Reapers CHARGE towards them, hitting Blade in
            the chest, driving him backwards.  As Blade falls, his entry
            light swings upward, illuminating.

            ANOTHER REAPER

            Drops down atop Reinhardt, knocking his UV gun into the
            water.  We SEE even MORE REAPERS converging in on them from
            the side tunnels in a cacophony of SHADOW and NOISE.

            INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY (20 YEARS AGO)

            Verlaine, Nyssa and Asad are FIRING their UV lasers.  The
            pumping flashes of their guns throw crazy shadows in every
            direction.  Adding to the unbridled chaos of strobing light
            and NOISE.  More and more Reapers are swarming towards them,
            moving towards us at an unearthly clip!  Nyssa and her
            compatriots retreat, running for their lives.

            A REAPER

            Leaps, landing on Verlaine's back.  It grabs her head and
            deftly SNAPS her spine in half with a sickening CRUNCH!

            INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY (20 YEARS AGO)

            Whistler panics, backing away from the SOUNDS of the reapers
            slaughtering Chupa.  He finds his gun, flicks on the UV entry
            light --

            And just like that, the attacking reapers have vanished.
            Whistler whirls about, sweeping the UV beam around, but all
            he SEES is darkness.

            Then, a bone-chilling WHISPER cuts through the shadows.

                                NOMAK (O.S.)
                      Whistler.

            Whistler spins.  NOMAK RIGHT BEHIND HIM.  As Whistler whips
            the UV gun up, Nomak stops it.  The beam is mere millimeters
            from the Reaper's face -- close enough to illuminate his
            nightmarish features, but not close enough to burn.

                                NOMAK (CONT'D)
                      If you survive this, tell your master.
                      My end is my beginning.

            In an eyeblink, Nomak is gone.  Whistler spins, shining the
            UV this way and that.  Alone in the dark.

            INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Blade FIRES his UV into a Reaper's torso.  As the Reaper
            incinerates, Blade spins, FIRING at a second Reaper --

            ON REINHARDT

            Firing his non-UV weapon.  Two Reapers are closing in on him.

                                BLADE
                      Take mine!

            Blade throws Reinhardt his UV laser and unsheathes his sword.
            Reinhardt sweeps the lethal beam over the two reapers.

            Blade retreats back into the water, calm, letting the
            creatures comes to him.  As they close in on him, he slips
            the tip of the sword beneath the surface of the water,
            waiting --

            As one, the Reapers converge on Blade.  He swings his sword
            up from the water, hacking away at them, using their own
            momentum against them.

            Reinhardt considers his options.  He decides to run for it --

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Reinhardt!

            Reinhardt races away, abandoning Blade.  Blade reaches for
            one of the UV flashbangs clipped to his harness.  He pulls
            the pin with his teeth and shoves it into an on-rushing
            Reaper's mouth as --

            Reinhardt slips on the wet concrete and --

            BANG!  Searing LIGHT fills the tunnel, instantly incinerating
            the Reaper.

            Reinhardt's unprotected face CATCHES FIRE.   He SCREAMS,
            falling back into the water, trying to douse the flames.
            ANOTHER REAPER lands atop him, dragging him down as --

            INT. NORTHERN AND WESTERN TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

            We hear GUNFIRE and SCREAMS coming from all directions.
            Blade retreats.  A reaper, fully ON FIRE from the UV
            explosion, races towards him.  As Blade decapitates it:

                                BLADE
                          (shouting into radio)
                      Re-group!  Re-group!

            Asad and Nyssa also retreat.  Nyssa pulls a pin on a UV
            flashbang, throws it behind her.  BA-BANG!  UV light fills
            the tunnels and --

            INT. SEWER LINE - FOUR-WAY INTERSECTION - DAY

            Blade, Nyssa, Whistler and Asad abruptly find themselves back
            in the four-way juncture, knee-deep in water.  They quickly
            regroup, out of breath, riding adrenaline highs.

                                NYSSA
                      Where's Chupa?

                                WHISTLER
                      Forget him, he's chunk-style.

                                ASAD
                      Same with Snowman and Verlaine.

                                WHISTLER
                      Guess that perfume of yours did the
                      trick after all?

                                BLADE
                          (quietly)
                      A little too well, I'd say.

            The others turn to look in Blade's direction.

            DOZENS OF RED EYES

            are staring out at them from the darkness of the Eastern
            Tunnel.  Then we hear a HISSING SOUND coming from the
            opposite direction.  Blade and the others spin around --

            MORE RED-EYED REAPERS

            are closing in on them from the West.  AND THE NORTH.  AND
            THE SOUTH!  There must be forty of them in all.

                                WHISTLER
                      Perfect.  We got the whole fucking
                      Partridge family here.

            They retreat until they are back to back, each one of them
            covering their respective tunnel opening.

            A REAPER

            Lunges at them from the North.  Asad triggers his UV laser,
            scorching the creature.  It HOWLS and slinks backwards.

            TWO MORE REAPERS

            Attack from the East and the West.  Blade and Nyssa respond
            in kind, burning their assailants in mid-air.  But even as
            they fire, their UV beams weaken, the flashes of light coming
            from their barrels pulsing less frequently.

                                WHISTLER (CONT'D)
                      Unless anybody has any bright ideas, I'd
                      say we're about half a battery away from
                      a reaper gang-bang.

            The foursome are managing to keep the Reapers at bay, but
            just barely.  Blade motions to Nyssa.

                                BLADE
                      Give me the rest of the pheromones.

            Nyssa reaches inside her harness, handing Blade the remaining
            atomizers.  He crushes them in his fist, letting the fluid
            within spill over his face and chest.

                                ASAD
                      What are you doing?

            The Reapers become even more agitated, HISSING loudly,
            pressing in on them closer and closer.  Blade nods his head
            back down the Western tunnel.

                                BLADE
                      Verlaine's body is back there somewhere
                      with the UV bomb.  If you train your
                      guns in that direction, you'll drive an
                      opening in their ranks.  I'll run for
                      it.  When the Reapers come after me, you
                      make a break for it the other way.

            Asad studies Blade with newfound respect.

                                ASAD
                      You won't make it.

                                BLADE
                          (hefting his UV gun)
                      Then I'll die trying, won't I?

                                NYSSA
                      Blade.

                                BLADE
                      Save it.  I don't want to hear your
                      words.  Let's do this NOW!!!

            The foursome spin, FIRING their UV lasers down the Western
            tunnel.  The Reapers SHRIEK, falling to either side, their
            bodies burning --

            Blade CHARGES FORWARD, firing his dying UV laser.  As he
            makes it past the line of Reapers, they start after him,
            driven into a frenzy by the pheromones.  The Reapers in the
            Northern and Eastern tunnels flood after Blade too, leaving --

            Nyssa, Whistler and Asad to contend with the Reapers in the
            Southern tunnel.  They discharge their weapons, shouldering
            Reapers aside, making a mad dash for freedom.

            INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Blade runs, splashing and stumbling through the water, just a
            hair's breadth ahead of the HOWLING Reaper horde.  Suddenly,
            the tunnel widens out into a larger chamber.

            INT. SOUTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Whistler and the others FIRE BACK at the small group of
            Reapers which have followed them, rather than Blade.

            ON WHISTLER

            cut off from Nyssa and Asad.  He spots a maintenance ladder
            and runs for it, dragging himself up the rungs.  A Reaper
            leaps up the ladder after him --

            Whistler reaches the top of the ladder, but his exit is
            blocked by a manhole cover!  It's STUCK!  Whistler swings up
            his shotgun, FIRING into the cover.

            The cover is BLOWN UPWARDS, sending a shaft of blinding
            sunlight down on the Reaper below him.  As the Reaper
            incinerates, Whistler scurries upwards to safety.

            INT. WESTERN TUNNEL/CHAMBER - DAY

            Blade reaches Verlaine's half-submerged body.  He tears the
            backpack carrier off the dead vampire and hefts it onto his
            shoulder, charging up an elevated concrete embankment as --

            INT. SOUTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Nyssa and Asad find themselves cornered.  Their UV lasers are
            shot.  The Reapers are closing in and we're --


            INT. WESTERN TUNNEL/CHAMBER - DAY

            Back with Blade, the Reapers overrunning him.  They pile atop
            one another in a frenzied effort to get to him.  Dozens and
            dozens of them.  And still Blade struggles upward, lifting
            the UV cluster bomb triumphantly above his head, triggering
            the device.

            The world goes white.

            No explosions.  Just BLINDING, PURIFYING LIGHT leaving us
            with a retina-burn image of Blade's silhouette surrounded by
            Reapers.  In that brief instant, the Reapers are frozen,
            revealed as WRAITH-LIKE X-RAY IMAGES of bone and muscle.

            INT. SOUTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

            A BLAST-WAVE of LIGHT fills the tunnel, chasing its way
            towards Nyssa and Asad, overtaking the Reapers before them.
            Asad throws himself at Nyssa, knocking her into the knee-deep
            water, shielding her body with his own.

            BENEATH THE WATER

            Asad still burns, flaring up and disintegrating from the
            surface on downward like a piece of liquid-drenched
            magnesium, bubbles streaming from his writing body.

            INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Darkness, then patterns of subtle shadow and light as our
            vision slowly returns.  FWASH!  Blade strikes a FLARE.  In
            the sputtering aureole, the aftermath is slowly revealed.

            Blade crouches, unscathed, as if he were standing ground zero
            in the aftermath of Hiroshima.  Scores of Reaper ash-outlines
            radiate out from him, some of them flash-seared into the
            surrounding brickwork walls like permanent shadows.

            INT. SOUTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Blade slowly makes his way down the tunnel, using the
            sputtering flare to guide him.  As before, he sees nothing
            but Reaper ash outlines.  But then, Blade sees --

            NYSSA

            Bleeding and horribly burned despite Asad's sacrifice.  Blade
            crouches, scooping her up into his arms.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. HOSPITAL - INNER-CITY TRAUMA WARD - DAY

            BANG!  Blade kicks open a pair of doors, hurrying Nyssa
            inside.  He's carrying her limp form in his arms, having
            wrapped her in a blanket.  Blade himself looks like hell
            warmed over -- covered in blood, ash, and grime.

            He rushes her towards the ER, navigating through a maze of
            PATIENTS and VISITORS.  An ER NURSE approaches.

                                ER NURSE
                      Sir, you can't just --

            WHAM!  Blade shoulders the ER NURSE aside, barreling into the
            triage where bewildered DOCTORS and ORDERLIES wait.

                                DOCTOR
                      What?!

                                BLADE
                      She needs a hypertransfusion.  NOW!

            Blade sets Nyssa down on an operating table, pulling off the
            blanket.  She's badly burned and she's lost an enormous
            amount of blood.  As we watch, she GROANS, revealing her
            fangs.

                                DOCTOR
                          (aghast)
                      God in Heaven.

            Just then, a POLICEMAN enters, gun drawn.

                                POLICEMAN
                      Alright, buddy, step away if --

            WHAP!  Blade slaps the cop's gun away and KICKS him in the
            chest.  The cop flies backwards, SLAMS into a bank of
            equipment, falls.  A NURSE SCREAMS.  In a near blur, Blade
            has his MACH out and pressed against the Doctor's forehead.

                                BLADE
                      Do you want to die?

                                DOCTOR
                      Not particularly.

                                BLADE
                          (holstering his MACH)
                      Then get your fucking team in gear.

            Blade unsheathes his sword, deftly drawing the edge across
            his wrist, opening a vein.  He cradles Nyssa's head, pulling
            her mouth to the wound on his wrist.  And as she starts to
            feed we pull back and --

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. THE CITY - DUSK

            The sun dips towards the horizon.  The shadows of the urban
            landscape lengthen and darken in time-lapse.

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - SHOWERS - DUSK

            Blade stands beneath the showerhead, turning his face up into
            the scalding spray, rinsing the blood from his chiseled
            physique.  Crimson water circles the drain.

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BLADE'S SLEEPING AREA - DUSK

            Nyssa now rests on a cot.  Peaceful, the color having
            somewhat returned to her features.  After a moment, her eyes
            flutter open and she takes in her surroundings.  She is in
            Blade's austere bedroom -- there are tatami mats, a basin for
            water, a well-thumbed volume of Zen koans.

            A SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT

            cuts through an icy window pane above, angling down near
            Nyssa's cot.  Dust motes swirl about it.

            Nyssa focuses on it.  Longingly.  Then she raises her arm and
            reaches towards it.  Closer, closer -- just barely extending
            her hand into the light.  Her fingertips blacken and smoke,
            yet Nyssa endures the pain for another moment.  Finally, she
            withdraws her hand, inspecting the damage -- then notices
            Blade watching her from the doorway.

                                NYSSA
                      Each day is a little life.

                                BLADE
                      What?

                                NYSSA
                      "Each day is a little life.  Every
                      waking and rising a little birth, every
                      fresh morning a little youth, every
                      going to rest and sleep a little death."

            She looks back to the sunlight, wistful, sits herself up.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      Anyone else make it?

                                BLADE
                      I don't think so.

            Blade enters, kneeling by the edge of the cot, inspecting her
            wounds.  Studiously avoiding her gaze.

                                NYSSA
                      Thank you.

                                BLADE
                      For what?

                                NYSSA
                      It would've been easy for you to let me
                      die back there today, but you didn't.

                                BLADE
                          (shrugging)
                      I wouldn't read too much into it.

            She reaches for his face.  Blade stops her hand.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      You don't want to go there.

                                NYSSA
                      Why?

                                BLADE
                      Because one of us is going to kill the
                      other before this ends.

                                NYSSA
                      It doesn't have to be like that.  We
                      don't have to be enemies.

                                BLADE
                      Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as
                      long as the hunt was still on.  Now that
                      it's over, all bets are off.

                                NYSSA
                          (pointedly)
                      If that's true, then why'd you save me?

            Blade stands now, moving to the ice-covered window, troubled
            by the question.  Damned if he knows the answer.  After a
            beat, Nyssa rises too, keeping to the shadows.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      Why do you hate us so much?

                                BLADE
                      I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I
                      do.  It's in my blood.

                                NYSSA
                      Well it's in mine, too.  I'm a
                      pureblood.  I wasn't turned.  I was born
                      this way.  Just like you.  Am I evil
                      because I want to survive?
                          (beat)
                      What about a wolf?  What about any
                      predator?

            Nyssa pursues Blade, circling around in front of him so he
            has to face her again.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      The only difference between you and me
                      is that I made peace with who I was a
                      long time ago.  I'm not ashamed of what
                      I am.
                          (beat)
                      You haven't been hunting us all these
                      years.  You've been hunting yourself.

            Blade moves away.  She reaches for his shoulder.  He whirls
            on her, angry, traps her hand.  She tires to pull it free but
            he grips her wrist tightly, pulling her closer --

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      You're hurting me.

                                BLADE
                      Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what
                      you said?

            And closer, their faces are just inches apart now --

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Reminds you you're alive?

            And Blade kisses her, hungrily.  Nyssa responds in kind.  Her
            head drops low, her mouth finding the cords of his neck --
            sucking at his flesh, then sinking her teeth in deep and --

            WHAM!  Blade clamps a hand around her throat, slamming her
            head back.  A droplet of blood dribbles from her lips as she
            lets loose a breathless shudder.  She's in the ecstatic
            throes of the Thirst now, all reason gone.

            Blade reaches his other hand to her shirt, ripping it open as
            he runs his fingers across her breasts, then over her exposed
            rib cage.  He turns her around, forcing her against the wall,
            sinking his own fangs into the back of her neck.  She groans
            as we --

                                                                 CUT TO:

            THE TWO OF THEM

            Naked on the tatami mats upon which Blade sleeps.  Skin
            beaded with sweat.  Breath steaming in the chill air.  He's
            atop her, moving inside her with measured thrusts.

            Nyssa's limbs are wrapped around him.  She claws at the
            expanse of his back with her fingernails.  Her mouth is
            locked on Blade's throat, then his is locked on hers.
            Together they drink, leeching blood from one another.

            PULLING BACK AGAIN

            Nyssa clutching greedily at Blade like she never wants to let
            go.  Her soul is gone -- transported to that place we drift
            to when the euphoria overtake us and we're somehow able to
            transcend the horror of our fleeting lives.

            Finally, Nyssa GASPS, climaxing as she retracts her fangs
            from Blade.  Her head rolls to the side as her pupil --
            focused on nothing short of eternity -- dilate unnaturally
            large.

            LATER

            Blade and Nyssa lie in each other's arms, awash in moonlight,
            blissfully dead to the world until --

            SOMETHING MAKES BLADE STIR

            He sits up, listening.  Nyssa stirs beside him.  She moves to
            speak but Blade holds up a hand, silencing her.  Together,
            they slowly creep towards a nearby window where --

            JARED NOMAK'S NIGHTMARE FACE

            is pressed up against the icy glass, staring back at them!
            Nyssa GASPS.  Blade draws back with a start.  But in the time
            it takes to blink, Nomak is gone.  Just then, we hear a
            NOISE.  Scud appears in a doorway, groggy.

                                SCUD
                      What's going on?

                                BLADE
                      He was here.  Watching us.

                                SCUD
                      Nomak?

                                BLADE
                      He wants us to know he's hunting us now.

            MOMENTS LATER

            Blade is at the computer workstation.  He activates the
            footage of Nomak he was viewing earlier.  He fast-forwards to
            a specific moment, then plays it back at normal speed.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Nomak said something to me before he
                      disappeared the first time --

            Blade points to the screen, saying the words as Nomak
            silently mouths them.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  At first I
                      thought he might've been using one of
                      the vampire dialects.  But it turns out,
                      it's Greek.  Do you know what it means?

            Nyssa shakes her head.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      It means "bloodbrother."

                                NYSSA
                      I don't understand.

                                WHISTLER (O.S.)
                      Well maybe I do.

            Blade spins, his MACH pistol up and ready to fire.  Whistler
            sits on the opposite side of the room, watching them as he
            smokes.

                                WHISTLER (CONT'D)
                          (to Scud)
                      Your security's for shit, kid.

                                BLADE
                      Where the hell have you been?

                                WHISTLER
                      Just out connecting a few dots.

            Whistler rises from his chair.  He flicks his cigarette butt
            into the shadows and fixes Blade with a heavy stares.

                                WHISTLER (CONT'D)
                      Bangin' some vampire chick.  Kind of a
                      faux pas in our line of work, wouldn't
                      you say?  Hope you double bagged it, at
                      least.

            Blade is still guarded, not yet ready to lower his MACH.

                                BLADE
                      What's your problem, Whistler?

                                WHISTLER
                      Why don't you ask your girlfriend?

            Blade looks to Nyssa, but she seems equally perplexed.

                                WHISTLER (CONT'D)
                      I did some checking on that Carter
                      Stevens character.  That familiar of
                      theirs who claimed he was with the NIH?
                      Turns out he used to work for them, but
                      he doesn't anymore.

                                BLADE
                      Then who does he work for?

            Whistler gives Nyssa a rueful stare, then tosses Blade a
            research folder.  On the cover is the same red, double-helix
            logo we saw at Damaskinos' facility.

                                WHISTLER
                      Some biotech outfit called Caliban
                      Industries.  They've been lying to us
                      since day one.  This Nomak fucker didn't
                      evolve.  He was designed.

            Nyssa look to Blade, imploring.

                                NYSSA
                      I don't know what he's talking about.

                                WHISTLER
                      You expect us to believe that?
                          (to Blade)
                      Who you going to trust, Blade?  Me or
                      her?

            EXT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - NIGHT

            A high-tech, heavily guarded industrial complex nestled
            within an expanse of unassuming wooded acreage overlooking
            the ocean.

            INT. DAMASKINOS' LAIR - NIGHT

            Carter Stevens shuts down his computer workstation, then
            moves to the heavy oak door, glancing at a medical chart as
            he opens it.  When he looks up --

                                STEVENS
                      You?

            A fist PUNCHES Stevens in the face.

            BLADE

            Stands in the entry way.  Whistler is behind him, holding a
            gun to Nyssa.  Scud is there, too.

                                BLADE
                          (mobing in on Stevens)
                      Start talking, bitch.

                                STEVENS
                      I don't know what you --

            Blade spins Stevens around, shoving his face against a glass
            case, crushing the man's nose, spiderwebbing the glass.

                                BLADE
                      Nomak!  You created him!

            Blade clamps his fingers around Stevens' broken nose and
            twists it with a sickening CRUNCH.  Stevens SCREAMS, caving.

                                STEVENS
                      Ohgodohgodohgod...
                          (in agony)
                      Alright, alright.  Yes, we did...
                          (gasping)
                      PLEASE!  PLEASE!!!

            Blade releases him.  Stevens sinks to the floor, cradling his
            brutalized face.

                                BLADE
                      Keep talking, Stevens.  Tell me why.

                                STEVENS
                          (sputtering)
                      The Shadow Cabinet.  For decades they've
                      been trying to find a way to rid
                      themselves of their hereditary
                      weaknesses.  Viral epidemiology,
                      immunochemistry.  Recombinant DNA was
                      the next logical step.

                                NYSSA
                          (genuinely horrified)
                      No, that's not possible.  They wouldn't
                      keep something like this from me...

                                STEVENS
                      Your father didn't want you to know.
                          (haltingly)
                      Something went wrong.  The Reaper strain
                      was too aggressive.  Then Nomak escaped.

                                WHISTLER
                      And we're supposed to clean up your
                      mess.  Fucking perfect.

                                STEVENS
                          (defensive)
                      Look, the fact that Nomak was
                      artificially created didn't make the
                      threat any less urgent.  He was still
                      out there, spreading the Reaper virus.

            But Blade's not concerned about that now.  He's got something
            more pressing on his mind.

                                BLADE
                      The genetic material you spliced into
                      Nomak --
                          (beat; almost fearful)
                      Where did you get it?

                                DAMASKINOS (O.S.)
                      I should think that would be obvious at
                      this point.

            ANGLE ON DAMASKINOS

            Standing behind them.

                                DAMASKINOS (CONT'D)
                      We took the genetic material from you.

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - ELEVATED CORRIDOR - NIGHT

            Damaskinos leads them down a corridor.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      Jared Nomak is your genetic brother.
                      And I suppose if you follow that line of
                      reasoning to its logical conclusion,
                      then these are your offspring.

            Damaskinos reaches to a nearby control panel, pressing a
            button.  A pair of massive doors slide apart, revealing:

            THE EUGENICS CHAMBER

            We are in a vast, multitiered, temperature-controlled chamber
            -- equal parts 21st century medical facility and Hammer House
            of Horror.

            A network of catwalks look down upon the circular chamber,
            the center of which is dominated by a massive, steel cask,
            which is in turn ringed by a safety railing.  The operation
            looks not unlike a small-scale water purification plant, or
            perhaps a futuristic distillery.  Only in this instance, the
            liquid churning within the cask is HUMAN BLOOD.

            TINY EMBRYOS

            Each no bigger than a thumbnail, line the walls of the
            chamber, preserved in credit card sized cryo-cases.  There
            are thousands of them, resting atop one another in racks with
            stretch from the floor on upwards.

            As Damaskinos removes an embryo from the rack, we see ANOTHER
            EMBRYO behind it.  That cryo-case now slides forward with a
            WHIR, taking the place of the one which Damaskinos removed.
            Like some kind of perverse vending machine.  God knows how
            deep they're stacked.  If thousands are visible, there could
            be tens of thousands in total.

            Damaskinos holds the translucent cryo-case up to the light.
            The Embryo within shudders, its tiny heart beating.

                                DAMASKINOS (CONT'D)
                          (proudly)
                      A new breed, begotten from your own
                      flesh.  Immune to silver, even sunlight.
                          (stepping towards Blade)
                      The wolves have lain with the sheep long
                      enough.  No more compromises.  No more
                      deals.  Only closure.

            BOOM!  We hear the tread of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS approaching.  All
            eyes turn towards a side corridor.

            REINHARDT

            enters from the shadows, holding Scud's rail-gun.  Much of
            his face has been burnt away, leaving him with a ghastly
            death's head mask of blackened muscle and exposed bone.

                                REINHARDT
                      Put it back in park, Blade.

                                BLADE
                      Thought you were dead.

                                REINHARDT
                      Seems like there's a lot of that going
                      around these days.

            As Reinhardt aims the rail gun at Blade, a DOZEN VAMPIRE
            GUARDS appear on the catwalks above, also taking aim.

                                REINHARDT (CONT'D)
                      Six-thousand feet per second, isn't that
                      what Whistler said?  Let's see you dodge
                      this one --

            Blade does his level best, pulling his MACH, squeezing off a
            SHOT even as Reinhardt FIRES.  BA-BANG!  Blade is hit in the
            side, spun clear around.  His shot goes wild, hitting one of
            the Guards in the head, turning him to ash as Blade himself
            falls to the floor.

                                NYSSA
                      Blade!

            Blade GASPS in shock.  The rail-gun needles have ripped a
            brutal hole through the side of his chest-plate.  He clutches
            at his flank, trying to staunch the blood that's seeping
            between his fingers.  As he sits forward, we see MORE
            FLECHETTES have embedded in the wall behind him, having torn
            completely through him.

            Whistler steps forward.  One of the vampire sentries LASHES
            OUT, striking him in the face with the butt of his rifle.
            Whistler sinks to his knees, stunned.  The guard disarms him.

            ON BLADE

            Gritting his teeth against the pain.  He reaches inside his
            combat harness, pulling out the remote detonator for the
            explosive flechette in Reinhardt's skull.

                                BLADE
                      Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.

                                SCUD
                      You're wasting your time, Blade.  The
                      flechette's a dud.

            Scud crosses over to Reinhardt's side.  Whistler stares at
            him in disbelief.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      It was never supposed to explode.  All
                      it was supposed to do was make you feel
                      like you were in control.

            Blade's eyes darken with hatred.  Reinhardt laughs.

                                REINHARDT
                      Thought you had me on a short leash,
                      didn't you, chief?  Only it turns out,
                      you're the one that's been on the leash.

            Reinhardt digs his claws into his scalp and tugs the barbed
            flechette from his skull.  As he does so, Blade's remote
            detonator BEEPS to indicate it's being tempered with.
            Reinhardt finishes removing it and sighs contentedly.

                                REINHARDT (CONT'D)
                      That's better.

            Reinhardt tosses the fletchette to Scud, who grins, flipping
            down his lower lip to reveal a vampire glyph tattooed on it.

                                SCUD
                      See, I'm one of Damaskinos' familiars.

            Blade looks to Nyssa who averts her gaze.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      Yeah, your little cootchie knew.

                                WHISTLER
                      You little shit.  When did they get to
                      you?

                                SCUD
                      Back when Blade had me hunting down your
                      puckered old ass.  What's up with your
                      hair, anyway?  Fucking Willie Nelson
                      look-a-like?

            Scud punches Whistler in the face.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      Man, I so wanted to do that.

            Scud shakes his hand, which is smarting from the blow.  He
            looks to Blade now, angry.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      And you.  You never cared about me.  I
                      gave you everything.  All you cared
                      about was digging up the old fuck!  You
                      think they scoped out my security
                      system?
                          (chuckling)
                      I let them in.  Dude, I practically gave
                      'em the fucking keys.  I've been feeding
                      Damaskinos information the whole time.
                      Providing them with samples of your
                      genetic material -- helping them with
                      the Reaper program.  They're close,
                      Blade.  Right up against it.  Any day
                      now, they're all going to be Daywalkers.
                      And when that happens, well, let's just
                      say, I don't want to be on the losing
                      team.  You may be strong, you may be
                      fast, but in the end, you're just too
                      human, B.

            He pinches Blade's cheek.  Then he stands up.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      So that's down and dirty.  Got anything
                      to say for yourself?

                                BLADE
                          (weak, but defiant)
                      Two things.  One, I was on to you the
                      moment they turned you.  And two --
                          (raising the detonator;
                           smiling)
                      I switched that dud of yours back with
                      the real one.

            Scud has a split-second of terrified, wide-eyed realization
            before Blade pushes the button and BOOM!  The flechette in
            Scud's hand EXPLODES, blowing his body apart, spraying those
            nearest him with blood.  Primarily Reinhardt.

                                REINHARDT
                      Son of a bitch!

            As the others react with varying degrees of surprise and
            horror, Reinhardt savagely KICKS Blade across the face.  He
            HITS Blade again and again, driving him down to the floor.
            Then he bends and tugs the sword from Blade's back-scabbard,
            preparing to cut his throat.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      Reinhardt!

            Reinhardt hesitates.  Nyssa takes a step towards Blade, but
            Damaskinos stops her.  Damaskinos gestures to his guards.
            They haul Blade up and drag him from the lab.  Reinhardt
            gestures to Whistler.

                                REINHARDT
                      What about him, then?
                          (crossing to Whistler,
                           handcuffing him)
                      Me and Hobo Kelly here have a little
                      unfinished business.

            Damaskinos waves dismissively.  Reinhardt takes Whistler
            away.

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

            Blade is dragged into a large autopsy room.  The vampire
            guards lay him on a steel autopsy table.  He struggles
            against them, but he's just too weak from loss of blood.
            Eventually they get him secured, clamping his wrists and
            ankles into steel manacles which are affixed to the table.

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

            CLOSE ON

            Blade's sword pommel as the booby-trap blades in the handle
            spring out.

                                REINHARDT (O.S.)
                      Nice.

            PULL BACK to reveal Reinhardt holding Blade's sword.  He
            gives it a few practiced swings, then runs his thumb along
            the blade.

                                REINHARDT (CONT'D)
                      How many vampires do you think he's
                      killed with this thing?

            ON WHISTLER

            Sitting in the corner, his hands cuffed behind his back.  We
            are in a security station filled with surveillance monitors
            offering various views of the laboratory complex.

                                WHISTLER
                      Not nearly enough, Fritz.

                                REINHARDT
                      Keep talking, warmblood.

            Reinhardt KICKS Whistler in the face.

                                REINHARDT (CONT'D)
                      When I'm through with you, you'll be
                      begging for a dirt nap.

            Whistler spits blood and glares up at Reinhardt.

                                WHISTLER
                      Been dead before.  Didn't much cotton to
                      it.  Tell you what, chicken shit.  You
                      do your worst.  We'll settle up after.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - EUGENICS CHAMBER - NIGHT

            Nyssa stands before the banks of vampire embryos, clearly
            troubled.  Damaskinos regards her.

                                DAMASKINOS
                          (vampire dialect; subtitled)
                      My child --

            Damaskinos moves in close to her, running a finger along her
            throat.  She doesn't acknowledge it.

                                DAMASKINOS (CONT'D)
                          (in English)
                      I would hate to think you were losing
                      your perspective.  Who do you think God
                      favors in the web?  The spider or the
                      fly?

                                NYSSA
                      Nomak said something to Blade in Greek.
                      Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did
                      he learn that?

                                DAMASKINOS
                      From his father, of course.

                                NYSSA
                          (horrified)
                      You experimented on your own, son?

            Damaskinos slowly tightens his hand around Nyssa's throat.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      I have fathered thousands of children in
                      centuries since I first walked this
                      earth.  Make no mistake, Nyssa.  Those
                      blood-ties mean nothing to me when
                      measured against the ascendancy of our
                      race.  Nothing.
                          (giving her an extra squeeze)
                      If you have any interest in remaining
                      alive, you would do well to remember
                      that.

            Damaskinos releases Nyssa.  She falls, GASPING for breath.
            He stares down at her with disdain, then exits.

                                                                 CUT TO:


            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

            Damaskinos enters, followed by Carter Stevens.  The guards
            remain posted at the main entrance of the room.  Damaskinos
            approaches, looking down at Blade.

            Blade stares back at him, still defiant, but fighting a
            losing battle.  He's dying and he knows it.  His breathing is
            shallow.  It's an effort just to keep his eyes open.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      With every century, humans become more
                      repulsive to me.  Once, you were souls
                      to be taken, corrupted.  But you have
                      disgraced yourselves to being nothing
                      more than blood and meat.

            TWO SURGEONS snap on surgical gloves.  Stevens is enjoying
            seeing Blade helpless.

                                STEVENS
                      We're going to harvest you, Blade.
                          (injecting fluid into Blade)
                      Bone marrow, organs, everything.  Your
                      tissue's too valuable to let go to
                      waste.

                                BLADE
                          (weakly)
                      Nomak is still out there.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      True, but thanks to you, we know his
                      weakness.  We can keep him contained.
                      It's just a matter of time before we
                      hunt him down.

                                BLADE
                      Too bad you're out of it.

            Damaskinos is amused by Blade's seeming lack of concern.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      And why is that?

                                BLADE
                      Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all
                      along.  To pay back the people who
                      created him.

                                STEVENS
                      You may be right.  Fortunately for us,
                      he has no idea where this facility is
                      located.

            Blade smiles, laughing tiredly.

                                BLADE
                      He does now.
                          (off their concerned looks)
                      He's been watching me since the tunnels.
                      Following me.  I led him right to you.

            Blade lifts up his hand, unfurling his previously closed
            fist.  There is a deep gash in his palms.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Just like a trail of bread crumbs.

            Damaskinos stares at Blade's hand, then looks to the floor.
            A line of blood droplets lead back to the doors through which
            he entered.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            A SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS

            Various hallways, the helipad outside Caliban industries,
            etc.  In rapid succession, we SEE more TRAILS OF BLOOD
            DROPLETS.  Then, just as quickly, we are back --

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

            With Damaskinos and company.  Suddenly, the lights above them
            flicker then go out.  As emergency lights kick on --

            BANG!  BANG!BANG!BANG!  All eyes turn towards a steel
            security door which is shuddering -- bulging and bending
            inwards as Nomak throws himself against it.

            Damaskinos looks to a bank of security monitors which are
            flickering back to life now.  We see Nomak's blurred
            silhouette from various angles, pummeling the door.  Then --

            RIPPPPPP!!!  A portion of the door is clawed open and we see
            a glimpse of Nomak's SNARLING FACE.

                                NOMAK
                          (roaring)
                      FATHER!

            Damaskinos' eyes widen in terror as he stumbles backwards,
            activating an ALARM.  He looks to the guards, SCREAMING.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      Stop him!

            Damaskinos runs for his life, rushing out the opposite door,
            quickly followed by Stevens as we --

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

            Nyssa hears the ALARMS and moves into a corridor lit by red,
            strobing emergency lights.  VAMPIRE GUARDS are rushing past.

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

            Reinhardt also hears the ALARMS.  He looks to the
            surveillance monitors where he SEES Nomak.

                                REINHARDT
                      Shit!

            Behind him, we see Whistler taking advantage of the
            distraction.  He folds his legs up under him, working his
            cuffed hands over his feet.  When Reinhardt spins back away
            from the security monitors --

            Whistler is GONE.  A steel grating in the floor lies half
            open.  The obvious means of exit.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

            As Nomak continues tearing down the autopsy door, BULLETS
            hammer into his back.  He turns, sees a DOZEN GUARDS FIRING
            at him, their gunfire chewing the shit out of the concrete
            walls around him.  Nomak staggers, but doesn't go down as
            CLEAR BLOOD sprays from the body hits.

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - MAINTENANCE CONDUIT - NIGHT

            Whistler shuffles forward through the narrow conduit on his
            elbows.  We hear footsteps.  Through the metal gratings
            above, we glimpse TWO FIGURES rushing past --

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT

            Damaskinos and Stevens round a corner, spilling into several
            GUARDS.  He shoves his fellow vampires aside.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      Get out of the way.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

            CLOSE ON a grate moving up from the floor.  Whistler emerges,
            rushing to Blade's side.  As he starts frantically releasing
            Blade from his bonds, he looks to the ravaged door --

            WHISTLER'S POV (THROUGH THE V-SHAPED GAP IN DOOR)

            Nomak savages the guards, flinging them into the air.  A
            guard's body hits the V-gap in the door and obscures our view
            as --

            Whistler redoubles his efforts, finally freeing Blade.  He
            helps him from the autopsy table.  Blade is sinking, starting
            to fade.  Whistler slaps his face, shaking him.

                                WHISTLER
                      Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!

                                BLADE
                          (weakly)
                      Blood...

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT

            Carnage.  A frazetta painting come to life.  Nomak atop dead
            guards, draining the last of his victims' blood.  He whips
            his face in our direction and ROARS, charging the door --

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

            WHAM!  The door gives way and Nomak enters.  To the right, he
            SEES Whistler and Blade exiting.  To the left, he SEES the
            security monitors.  Damaskinos and Stevens can be glimpsed in
            one of these monitors.

            Nomak moves to the left.

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - THIRD CORRIDOR - NIGHT

            Blade clutches his bleeding side, staggering down the
            corridor towards a door marked "Eugenics" with Whistler's
            help.  By all rights, Blade should be dead.  But he continues
            on, moving towards the door with determination.

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - 4-WAY INTERSECTION - NIGHT

            CLOSE ON a hand twisting a safety lever on the floor.  PULL
            BACK to reveal Stevens manually activating a series of
            hydraulic lock-down latches.

            CHINK!CHINK!CHINK!  The doors of the Eastern, Northern, and
            Western corridors are sealing, lock-down latches clamping
            down for extra security.  Even as the Western door seals, we
            glimpse Nomak rushing towards it with inhuman speed.

            ON STEVENS

            panicked, turning towards the open elevator cab where --

            DAMASKINOS

            is waiting.  But even as Stevens starts towards the elevator,
            Damaskinos dispassionately presses the "CLOSE DOOR" button.

                                STEVENS
                      What are you doing?!!

            Stevens rushes towards the closing elevator doors, but it's
            too late.  He pounds his fist against them.  Behind him, we
            hear a terrible RENDING OF METAL as the Western door gives.
            Stevens looks in that direction --

            In an eyeblink, Nomak is upon him, SLAMMING his hand over
            Stevens' face, crushing it.

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - ELEVATOR CAB - NIGHT

            As Damaskinos slides a security card through a reader and
            punches in a code, a thin SPRAY OF BLOOD jets across his pale
            forearm.  He looks to the elevator doors.  The spray of blood
            is coming through the vertical door seal.  The metal doors
            SHUDDER violently and then the cab begins to ascend.
            Damaskinos retreats to the far corner of the elevator,
            breathing a sigh of relief.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - EUGENICS CHAMBER - NIGHT

            WHOOSH!  A pneumatic door slides open.  Blade and Whistler
            enter.  They are on the second level now, up amongst the
            catwalks.  Below them is the churning cask of purified blood.
            They have almost reached the end of the catwalk when --

            REINHARDT AND HIS MEN

            converge on the lab from two directions at once.  Some of the
            vampires spill through the door on the second level with
            Reinhardt, while others enter on the ground floor.

                                REINHARDT
                      Stop him!!!

            As Reinhardt takes aim at Blade with the shotgun, the other
            vampires FIRE.  Whistler is HIT in the leg.  He goes down,
            CRYING OUT, then grips Blade's arm, shoving him onward --

                                WHISTLER
                      GO!!!

            ON BLADE

            gripping the guard rail for support, dragging himself along.
            Reinhardt fires.  A SHOTGUN BLAST hits Blade, grazing him but
            otherwise missing him.  As Reinhardt curses and prepares to
            fire again --

            Blade makes it to the end of the catwalk, pitching himself
            out into open space.  Time slows to a crawl as Blade tumbles
            downward, plummeting into --

            THE BLOOD CASK BELOW

            Blade sinks from view, disappearing beneath the churning
            slurry of crimson.  A beat passes as Reinhardt and his men
            draw closer, apprehensive.  Then, an explosion of BLOOD
            gushes over Reinhardt and the others.  They fall backwards,
            blinded, slipping --

            BLADE

            surfaces from the cask in morbidly glorious slow-motion.
            Think of Sheen in the end-sequence of Apocalypse Now, only
            instead of a river of mud, Blade is covered head-to-toe in
            crimson.  Majestic and glistening.  A primordial god.  He
            rears back his head, letting loose a triumphal ROAR.

            Reinhardt's men hesitate.  One look at Blade's eyes and we
            can see he's tapped into a well-spring of fury even he never
            knew he had.  The man is super-charged and ready for war.

            Blade tears into the vampires, unleashing a blizzard of
            martial arts moves.  He powers a right hook into the first
            vampire's face, then pivots, launching a devastating spinning
            back-fist into the face of a second.  At the same time, he
            rips the second guard's security belt from his waist,
            twirling it around nanchadku-style to blind a third guard and
            capture the wrist of a fourth.

            Some vampires FIRE their guns, but Blade is a whirlwind,
            shifting and dodging.  BULLETS go wild, hitting circuitry,
            EXPLODING APART cannisters of combustible chemicals.  In
            seconds, FLAMES are licking across the laboratory floor.

            Blade drops, causing a pair of vampires to FIRE their guns at
            one another.

            Then Blade knocks two more vampires onto their asses with a
            foot sweep.  Then he's up again.  Slamming the bridge of a
            fifth vampire's nose into his brain with a palm heel strike.

            A snap kick, an overhand elbow strike, a knee stamp that
            shatter's the vampire's knee cap.  An upward block, a jab, a
            cross, a shin kick aimed at a vamp's quadriceps.

            Overhand punches, rising punches, parallel punches, spinning
            rear elbows, deep kicks, on and on and on and on in an orgy
            of super-hero violence until --

            WHAM!  Blade cuts the last of the vampire soldiers down,
            turning from the creature's disintegrating body to face --

            REINHARDT

            The vampire mercenary clutches Blade's sword in his hand, but
            the weapon provides him with little sense of security given
            that he's just seen a dozen of his men slaughtered.  The
            automatic sprinkler system is on now, spraying water down
            upon Blade and Reinhardt alike.  Blade advances.

            Reinhardt's been cornered.  There's nowhere else for him to
            run.  Refusing to be cowed, Reinhardt SCREAMS and brings the
            sword down at Blade's head when WHOOSH --

            But Blade swings his hands upward, slapping them on either
            side of the blade, trapping the sword on its downward arc.

            Reinhardt strains, trying to tear the sword away from Blade's
            grip.  The vampire's eyes widen in fear.  And during that
            split-second in which the two men are frozen, connected by
            the weapon which vibrates between them, Blade says:

                                BLADE
                      Tell me something, chief.  Can you
                      blush?

            TWHISH!  The sword twists free from Reinhardt's grasp,
            spinning upward into the air.  Reinhardt stumbles backwards
            against the blood cask railing as --

            Blade catches the sword on its way down, swinging it around
            in one fluid motion, slicing Reinhardt's torso in half, along
            with a diagonal axis!  Reinhardt sinks to his knees as the
            TWO HALVES split apart, turning to ash before they hit floor.

            Beat.  Blade stands beneath the spray of the overhead
            sprinklers, rinsing the blood from his body.  He turns
            towards the exit, sword in hand.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - LOBBY - NIGHT

            A set of elevator doors open, disgorging Damaskinos.  Beyond
            the lobby windows we can SEE a waiting helicopter, VAMPIRE
            SOLDIERS readying it for take-off.  Damaskinos rushes across
            the lobby and is almost at the exit when --

            CHUNK!CHUNK!CHUNK! A series of steel shutters slam down over
            the doors and windows.  Damaskinos tries to tug one of the
            shutters upwards, then moves to a keypad nearby.  He starts
            hurriedly tapping in a numeric sequence when we hear:

                                NYSSA (O.S.)
                      I overrode the security codes.

            Damaskinos spins around.  Nyssa stands behind him.  She's got
            Whistler's rail-gun in her hands.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      We're locked in.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!

                                NYSSA
                      Maybe it's better that way.

            AS if in response, a GRINDING SHUDDER comes from the elevator
            doors.  Damaskinos spins in wide-eyed horror, then --

                                BLADE (O.S.)
                      What's it going to be, Damaskinos?
                      Thiavolos.  The devil you know --

            BLADE

            enters the lobby from a mezzanine above, sword in hand.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      -- or the devil you don't?

            Damaskinos turns back to his daughter, making a last appeal.

                                DAMASKINOS
                          (vampire dialect; subtitled)
                      For God's sake, Nyssa!  Let us out of
                      here!

            WHAM!WHAM!WHAM!  Nomak pounds away.  The elevator doors are
            starting to buckle, then they tear apart completely --

            NOMAK

            bursts into the lobby, ROARING.  If anything, he is even more
            animalistic now, his features having become grossly
            distorted.

                                NOMAK
                          (in vampire dialect)
                      Why are you frightened, father?  The
                      prodigal son has returned.

            Damaskinos scurries backwards, but there's nowhere left to
            run.  Nomak descends on him, lifting the vampire into a rib
            crushing embrace, chomping his elongated canines into
            Damaskinos' throat.

            Damaskinos SQUEALS like a child as his life-blood is sucked
            out of him.  His body begins to cave inward, shrinking and
            twisting until there's nothing left but shriveled husk.

            Nyssa hefts the rail-gun and FIRES at Nomak's back.  Nomak
            HOWLS, releasing Damaskinos' body, then turns, focusing his
            blood-drunk gaze on Nomak.

                                BLADE
                          (alarmed)
                      Get out of here!

            But Nyssa stands her ground, rachetting back the slide on the
            rail-gun, readying to unleash another barrage of needles.
            Nomak CHARGES, moving at unbelievable speed.  She FIRES
            AGAIN, aiming at Nomak's chest --

            but then Nomak is upon her.  He slaps the rail-gun from her
            hands, SMASHING IT TO PIECES.
            Then he wraps his hand around her throat, pulling her
            forward, sinking his teeth into her neck.  Nyssa SCREAMS.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Nyssa!!!

            ON BLADE

            as he leaps from the mezzanine level, sword extended, like
            Beowulf diving to slay Grendel.  He PLUNGES the sword deep
            into Nomak's upper torso.  Then DRIVES it in even further --

            Nomak releases Nyssa and back-hands Blade across the face,
            sending him sailing through the air.  He lands, skids across
            the floor --

            ON NOMAK

            stumbling backwards into the wall.  The sword has sunk so
            deep that the tip is actually protruding out his back,
            SCRAPING a gash across the wall as Nomak slides towards the
            floor.

            Nomak GRUNTS, then reaches for the pomeel with his ruined
            hand.  He grips the pommel and SNAPS the sword-blade in half.
            Then he SLAMS against the wall, forcing the half of the
            broken blade that's still embedded in him out back through
            the front of his chest.  As Nomak rises to his feet --

            Blade is on him again, snap-kicking the Reaper in the chest.
            Nomak retaliates.  Blade somersaults out of the way, then
            springs back again, KICKING Nomak in the face, BREAKING
            Nomak's NECK.  Nomak's head lolls unnaturally sideways for a
            heartbeat and then Nomak swings his head around, somehow
            righting his neck vertebrae with a snap of his head.

            They trade blows, a brutal death-match that seems to defy
            gravity.  Blade moves in for a round-house punch, but Nomak
            catches his fist, holding it for a split-second, then bending
            Blade's hand at an unnatural angle, SNAPPING his wrist bones.
            The pain is enormous.

            Nomak starts beating the living shit out of Blade, pummeling
            him with his fists, gripped by an uncontrollable rage.  He
            SMASHES Blade against a marble column, cracking it.  Then he
            flings Blade against one of the brushed steel walls - so hard
            that Blade's body actually leaves an indentation.

            Before Blade can recover, Nomak is in front of him, launching
            another kick.  Blade rolls his head out of the way, barely
            avoiding Nomak's boot heel which dents the wall.  Nomak kicks
            a second time.  Blade avoids Nomak, but third time's the
            charm and Nomak lands one squarely in Blade's gut.
            Blade falls beneath a flurry of blows, unable to defend
            himself any longer.  Blood stains his eyes, obscuring his
            vision.  He strikes out blindly, but Nomak has forced him to
            the ground, pinning him there.  As Blade struggles to free
            himself --

            NOMAK

            lowers his head towards Blade's face.  The scar/seam in
            Nomak's chin splits open and Nomak's lower jaw flares apart,
            distending and widening to reveal the awful, glistening hell
            maw -- the hollow inner fangs and striated cartilage which
            are closing about Blade's face.  Blade twists his head
            violently to the right, then glimpses the broken tip of his
            sword resting a few feet away.  He reaches for it in
            desperation, plunging it up into Nomak's chest.  Nomak HOWLS.
            Because the hilt has been broken off, Blade is forced to grip
            the cutting edge of the weapon with his bare hands.  It
            slices into his fingers --

            but Blade just grips the broken sword tighter, ignoring the
            pain, driving it deeper and deeper -- until, suddenly, it
            penetrates the cartilaginous shell around Nomak's heart and --

                                NOMAK
                          (in vampire dialect)
                      Blood brother.

            Nomak smiles, covering Blade's hands with his own.  He looks
            blade in the eye, then drives the broken sword home.

            Nomak's body stiffens, his eyes grow unseeing, an oddly
            serene look spreading across his tortured face.  A patch of
            BLACKNESS begins radiating outward from his chest, moving
            over his body, carbonizing him from within.  As his blackened
            flesh begins to crack, BLUE FLAMES flicker out from the
            fissures.  In seconds, Nomak is gone.

            Beat.  Blade stands, exhausted.  Then he looks to where Nyssa
            rests.  He moves to her side, kneeling beside her.  She
            smiles up at him, bravely, but frightened all the same.
            Blade inspects the wound on her neck.  It's clearly fatal.

                                NYSSA
                      How does it look?

                                BLADE
                          (with genuine sadness)
                      Not good.

            Nyssa nods.  Blade has only confirmed her existing fears.

                                NYSSA
                      It won't be long now.  I can already
                      feel it burning inside me --

            She grips Blade's arm, her eyes welling with tears.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      I don't want to become what Nomak was --
                          (beat; straining)
                      I can't.  I want to die while I'm still
                      vampire.

            Blade sighs.  The burden is all to familiar to him.

                                BLADE
                      What do you want me to do?

                                NYSSA
                      I want to see the sun rise.

            ON BLADE

            his face a mask of sad resignation.  He lifts Nyssa into his
            arms.  She closes her eyes, resting her head on his chest.

            EXT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - JUST BEFORE DAWN

            The shutters over the doors and windows slowly rise.  Blade
            shoulders open the front door, moving across the lawn towards
            a bluff overlooking the ocean.  A moment later, Whistler
            emerges into the light, watching as Blade sets Nysa down on
            the grass.  Her eyes flutter open and she looks into --

            THE HORIZON

            where the faintest glimmer of pre-dawn light brightens the
            cloud-swept sky.  It's peaceful.  We can hear the SURF
            crashing on the shore below.

            Together they wait.

            A GLIMMER OF LIGHT emerges over the earth's curvature,
            spreading its dazzling radiance out across the skyline.
            Nyssa's eyes widen in expectation, her breath catching.  She
            looks up at Blade, stroking his face, smiling.

                                NYSSA
                      Each day is a little life.  Remember?

            Blade nods, he's strong for her.  Despite his best efforts, a
            tear slides down his cheek.  They kiss then as the sun rises
            in full glory, flooding the world with its brilliance.

            Blade holds Nyssa tightly to his chest, refusing to
            relinquish his grip as her body catches fire.  The end is
            blessedly quick -- not a slow-burn of blazing agony, but a
            nearly seamless transition from life --

            To ash...  Nyssa collapses apart in Blade's arms, billowing
            out around him in a cloud of glowing embers.  One moment
            she's there, the next she's gone.  Blade remains where he is,
            kneeling on the bluff, the wind carrying the last traces of
            Nyssa aloft into the sky.  He shuts his eyes.  Turns his face
            to the warmth of the sun, surrendering himself to acceptance.

            WE RISE UP

            isolating Blade alone on the windswept bluff.  After a
            moment, Whistler moves to Blade's side.  He rests a hand on
            Blade's shoulder, but doesn't say a word.  We keep moving up
            and up until the two of them are just a pair of tiny figures
            on the rolling coastline.  Then we --

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            A SERIES OF CLOSEUPS

            Images of a weapon being forged, all filtered through
            shimmering convection waves of intense heat.  We SEE a HAMMER
            CLANGING DOWN.  The FIRES of a ROARING furnace.  SPARKS
            showering up from titanium slowly being given shape.  Molten
            silver.  Acid etching.  And then we PULL BACK to reveal --

            INT. BLADE'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

            Blade works before a forge by moonlight, his body dripping
            with sweat.  He slips his hand in a protective glove and
            grips the red-hot weapon, dousing it in a quench bucket.  As
            a cloud of steam envelops Blade, he lifts it up for view.

            A NEW SWORD

            perfect.  Lethal.  Wrought from titanium, plated in sliver.
            As Blade inspects the sword, we hear his earlier words again:

                                BLADE (V.O.)
                      I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I
                      do.  It's in my blood...

            Satisfied with his work, Blade smiles --

            EXT. FUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT

            A shit-hole porno emporium offering the latest in bagged-for
            your-pleasure Euro-raunch.

            INT. FUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT

            Rush, the vampire brother wanna-be from the opening of the
            film, is up at the register, exchanging a twenty for a
            handful of tokens.  He's humming along to that old E-Rotic
            song "Voulez-vous couchez avec moi".

                                RUSH
                      -- yelling for your tender touch, you
                      can never get enough --

            We FOLLOW HIM down a hall lined with video booths, serenaded
            all the while by the cheesy SYNTH SOUNDTRACKS and faked
            ORGASMOGROANS coming from beyond the doors.

                                RUSH (CONT'D)
                      -- cover me with your love --

            Rush stops at "Buddy Booth No. 3 - HOT ONE-ON-ONE ACTION."

            INT. BUDDY BOOTH - NIGHT

            Rush steps inside.  There's a chair set in front of a
            Plexiglas window, an intercom with a phone receiver, box of
            Kleenex, and a slot for the tokens.

            Rush gets himself situated, picks up the receiver, then
            eagerly pops some tokens in the slot.

                                RUSH
                      Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir!
                      Voulez-vous coucher AVEC MOI!!!

            With a HUM, the screen in front of the window rises, offering
            us a view of the booth on the other side of the Plexiglas.
            Only instead of a skanked out booth girl, Rush finds himself
            staring in open-mouthed astonishment at --

            BLADE

            Who flashes an evil smile at us.

                                BLADE
                      What?  You think I forgot about you?

            In a near blur, Blade draws his new sword from his back
            scabbard and stabs it RIGHT INTO CAMERA, SMASHING apart the
            Plexiglas window as we --

                                                          FADE TO BLACK.
BLADE II -- By David Goyer

            EXT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - NIGHT

            PULL BACK from a neon red cross ablaze in the cold December
            night to REVEAL an inner-city, store-front clinic.  Trash and
            leaves blow over wet, snowy pavement.

            ANGLE ON a PALE FIGURE standing across the street.  He looks
            feverish and strung-out, in serious need of a fix.  This is
            JARED NOMAK, 20s.  He starts towards the clinic.

            INT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

            Potential DONORS sit in a waiting area, filling out forms,
            leafing through informational material.  A sign in the window
            reads: "Se habla Espanol".  Others read: "YOU ARE MAKING A
            DIFFERENCE", "GIVE LIFE", and "BECOME A PLATELET DONOR".  We
            overhear a bored-looking EMPLOYEE behind the information desk
            quizzing someone over the phone:

                                EMPLOYEE
                      Have you recently visited a tropical
                      country?  Uh-huh?  In the past twelve
                      months have you gotten a tattoo, non
                      sterile acupuncture, or undergone any
                      ear, skin or body piercing?

            We MOVE PAST the employee to Nomak, waiting.

                                NURSE (O.S.)
                      Jared Nomak?

            Nomak looks up.  We get a better look at his face now - he
            has a thin scar running from his lower lip down his chin.  A
            childhood accident, perhaps.  A NURSE smiles and motions for
            him to join her.  She's carrying a clipboard.

                                NURSE (CONT'D)
                      Hi.  We're ready for you now.

            INT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - HALLWAY - NIGHT

            Nomak follows the Nurse into a dimly-lit hallway.  We track
            their progress in a convex safety mirror suspended from the
            hallway ceiling as they pass all manner of medical supplies --
            centrifuges, an apheresis device, etc.

                                NURSE
                          (referring to her clipboard)
                      I see from your questionnaire that you
                      don't have any immediate next of kin?

                                NOMAK
                      Not that I'm in contact with.

                                NURSE
                      Nobody to call in case of an emergency?

                                NOMAK
                      No --
                          (apprehensive)
                      Does that mean I can't be a donor?

                                NURSE
                      It depends.  We came up with some
                      unusual results on your blood test.

            Nomak follows the Nurse to a steel door were TWO SECURITY
            GUARDS await them.  Both look bored, paying little attention
            to the monitor which offers a view of the examining room
            beyond.  There is also a small window with safety glass.
            GUARD #1 opens the door, following Nomak and the Nurse
            inside.  GUARD #2 remains behind, manning the hallway.

            INT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT

            The Nurse ushers Nomak into the room, indicating he should
            sit in a kind of reclining dental chair with arm and
            headrests.  Nomak notices a security camera mounted above.

                                NOMAK
                          (anxious)
                      How unusual?

            Beat.  The Nurse sets aside Nomak's file, looking
            uncomfortable.

                                NURSE
                      Your blood has a very rare phenotype,
                      one that's quite valuable to people like
                      us.

                                NOMAK
                      Us?  What are you talking about?

            A kind-faced DOCTOR enters, nodding to Guard #1.

                                DOCTOR
                      It's a good news-bad news scenario,
                      Jared.  Good news for us, bad for you.

            The Doctor and Nurse smile, BARING FANGS.  We realize now
            that they are both vampires.  The Guard, too.  He grips Nomak
            by the throat, forcing him back into the restraint chair.  As
            the vampire Guard does so, his hand brushes against Nomak's
            jaw.  The flesh on Nomak's chin briefly separates along the
            scar - almost as if it were a seam.

            The guard pauses - and Nomak LAUGHS.  Definitely NOT the
            reaction the vampires were expecting from a potential victim.
            Nomak starts to shake and twitch, like he's going into some
            kind of seizure.  The whites of his eyes bleed red.  He
            throws his head back, opening his mouth as a PAIR OF RAZOR
            SHARP CANINES extrude from his gums.  These are longer, much
            more lethal-looking than the fangs of the vampires and --

            Nomak lashes out, knocking the Guard backwards.  The Nurse
            SCREAMS.  Nomak clamps his mouth onto her throat, SLAMMING
            her back against the wall.

            The vampire Doctor rushes to the door, scrambling to unbolt
            it.  Nomak reaches for him, HOWLING with blood-drunk laughter
            as he lifts the Doctor up.  Nomak flings the Doctor about
            like a toy, using his body to SMASH the lights, then the
            security camera above.

            INT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - HALLWAY - NIGHT

            We hear SCREAMS and HORRIBLE NOISES coming from the examining
            room.  Guard #2 draws a gun and looks to the security monitor
            with alarm.  The screen goes black.  He looks to the small
            window, trying to peer into the now-darkened room beyond --

            SPLASH!  A wave of blood smears across a window.  A HAND
            wipes a patch of blood away, revealing Nomak's baleful,
            distorted eyes.  Guard #2 starts to back away when --

            BANG!  Nomak slams against the other side of the steel door.
            BANG!BANG!BANG!  The door begins to bend, hand-shaped
            impressions bulging outward as Nomak starts to peel the door
            apart like it was an aluminum can.

            Guard #2 has seen enough.  He turns and runs even as the door
            CAVES INWARD off its hinges.  Forward momentum sends the door
            sliding across the hallway floor where it trips up the Guard.

            ON THE DOORWAY

            as Nomak steps into the hallway.  Because of the lights
            above, there are alternating pools of light and shadow in the
            hall.  Nomak advances towards us, his face coming in and out
            of darkness.

                                NOMAK
                      Vampires --

            With each pool of light, his awful smile seems to distort
            further and further, until his mouth seems to be widening all
            the way back to his ears.

                                NOMAK (CONT'D)
                      I fucking hate vampires.

            On the floor, the vampire Guard CRIES OUT in fear, helplessly
            raising his hands to defend himself.  Nomak HOWLS and leaps
            towards him/us, blacking out the screen with his hurtling
            form as we --

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. INNER-CITY BACK-ALLEY - NIGHT

            BOOM!  A second-story door flies open and FIVE VAMPIRE thug
            wannabes come spilling out.  They race down a flight of
            stairs, tripping and tumbling over themselves.  In descending
            order, they are: RUSH, a pimped-out Vanilla Ice clone wearing
            Karl Kani gear, followed by JIGSAW, ST. CLOUD, T-BAG and
            SEGURA.

            BLADE

            exits just behind them, eschewing the stairs completely and
            vaulting over the railing.  He unholsters his MACH pistol as
            he drops, FIRING it as he lands in a cat-like stance on the
            snowy ground below --

            BA-BANG!  A silver-tipped bullet punches through T-Bag's
            chest.  He turns to ash even as his fellow vamps dash through
            the disintegrating cloud that used to be his body.  The
            embers melt the snow where they land.

            A super-charged foot chase ensues, with hunter and prey
            moving at speeds in excess of anything a human would ever be
            capable of.  We're talking thirty-five, even forty miles an
            hour.

            ON BLADE

            Running like a bull, condensed vapor streaming from his mouth
            and nostrils.  Splashing through puddles of icy water
            storming through barriers of plywood and razor wire, leaping
            over mountains of garbage bags.

            ON THE VAMPIRES

            as they flatten a length of cyclone fencing like it was crepe
            paper.  They scramble up an obstacle of waste bins, leaping
            into the air --

            BACK TO BLADE

            pulling out his twin-bladed boomerang as he runs.  He flings
            the weapon.  It twirls around, catching --

            ST. CLOUD IN MID-LEAP

            and cutting the vampire completely in half.  As the
            disintegrating halves of St. Cloud fall to the side, Blade
            storms over the waste bin.

            EXT. INNER-CITY - SECOND ALLEY - NIGHT

            The remaining vampires stumble into a narrower alley where a
            GROUP OF BUMS are warming themselves over a series of oil
            drum fires.

            Jigsaw slips, TRIPPING over one of the burning oil drums,
            catching himself ablaze.  He doesn't give a shit.  He keeps
            on running, barreling his way into --

            INT. NOODLE FACTORY - NIGHT

            -- the back entrance of a cramped, sweat-shop.  Some kind of
            noodle factory filled with steam and equipment and YAMMERING
            FOREIGNERS and --

            -- here comes Blade, hot on the vampires' heels, shouldering
            workers aside and --

            EXT. NOODLE FACTORY - NIGHT

            -- Rush and the remaining vamps spill out onto the street
            where a number of motorcycles are waiting for them -- two BMW
            R1200 motorbikes and a tricked-out Panhead Harley chopper
            with ape-hanger handlebars.

            Rush and Segura leap atop their BMWs.  Jigsaw rolls into a
            puddle of water, dousing himself, then jumps onto his
            chopper.  As the vamps peel out --

            BLADE

            Bursts from the factory.  Segura revs his BMW, trying to run
            him down.  At the last second, Blade pivots aside like a
            matador.  Segura circles around for another try.

            Blade leaps, somersaulting through the air, then lands on the
            back of the bike behind Segura.  SHINGGG!  Blade pulls a
            retractable garrotte wire from the sleeve of his jacket and
            wraps it around Segura's throat.

            With a violent twist, Blade decapitates Segura.  As the
            vampire's headless body turns to ash before him, Blade leans
            forward and takes the controls of the speeding motorcycle.

            WHOOSH!  Blade speeds after the other vamps.

            EXT. STREET - NIGHT

            Rush and Jigsaw gun their bikes for all they're worth.  Up
            ahead, a line of construction barricades are blocking the
            way.  The vampires power on through the barricades, then
            abruptly brake --

            THE OVERPASS

            before them is under construction.  There's a twenty-foot gap
            in the road where a portion is missing, pieces of re-bar
            poking out from the ends of the prefabricated sections.

            Rush and Jigsaw consider their options, but then they hear
            the ROAR of Blade's engine as he comes SCREAMING over the
            rise in the road!

            Fuck it.  Rush powers his chopper forward, making the jump,
            burning rubber as he lands on the far side.  Jigsaw torques
            his handle and follows, rocketing towards the gap.

            ON BLADE

            as he snaps his hand up -- a trio of Japanese throwing stars
            appearing between his fingers like a magician's cards.  He
            flings the stars at Jigsaw's bike --

            The throwing stars hit Jigsaw's back tire and the bike goes
            down, vomiting SPARKS as it slides forward.  Jigsaw is flung
            forward like a ragdoll, out over the gap in the overpass and

            -- WHUNK!  Jigsaw is impaled on the protruding re-bar!  He
            HOWLS, instantly disintegrating as Blade makes the jump!

            UP AHEAD

            Rush cuts onto an on-ramp, powering his way onto the freeway.

            EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

            Hyper-speed.  Rush slouches low, trying to cut wind
            resistance and will his bike faster.  He hazards a look back.

            BLADE

            is gaining on him like demon of speed.

            Rush pulls a TEC-9, FIRING back at Blade.  It's no good.
            Blade is nearly upon him, unsheathing his sword from his back
            scabbard --

            Blade JABS his sword forward into Rush's rear-wheel.  The
            bike locks up, flips over, BURSTS INTO FLAMES.  The whole
            screaming wreck slews forward, SHOWERING SPARKS --

            RUSH

            goes flying onto the road, rolling over and over, one of his
            legs SNAPPING at a bone-breaking angle.  As he lies there
            MOANING, Blade circles around, sweeping past Rush's decimated
            bike, retrieving his sward from the burning wreckage.

            Blade kills the engine on his own bike and dismounts.  Rush
            is pathetically trying to drag his broken body to safety.
            Blade approaches, placing his boot heel on the back of Rush's
            neck, forcing his face against the asphalt.  He unholsters
            his MACH, pointing it at the vampire's bleeding head.
            Blade's opening line:

                                BLADE
                      Tell me where he his now and I'll
                      consider you a loose end.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. MOO-COW CREAMERY - MILK FACTORY - NIGHT

            CLOSE ON a peeling wall mural -- smiling 30s cartoon cow
            winking at us, licking her chops.  The logo reads: "TASTY".

            Blade's matte-black Charger RUMBLES into view and parks in
            front of the abandoned milk factory.  Blade steps out,
            heaving an equipment sack onto his shoulder.

            INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

            THREE LACONIC VAMPIRE TOUGHS are playing poker at a card
            table, dealing out novelty nudie cards.  We hear a NOISE.
            One of the vampires approaches a reinforced door.  He slides
            open a viewing slot and peers through.  Nobody outside.  The
            vampire turns back to his poker buddies, shrugging --

                                VAMPIRE
                      Nobody's th--

            Before the vampire can even finish his sentence, Blade's
            SWORD punches straight through the door into his chest.  He
            gasps and turns to ash as the sword disengages back out
            through the door and --

            CRASH!  The door explodes open, sending clouds of burning
            vampire embers every which way.  In walks Blade, grinning
            wickedly, MACH ready --

            As the other two vampires rise - POW!  A silver hollow-point
            hits the first one in the neck.  POW!  Another hollow-point
            takes out the second.  The vampires drop, turning to ash.

            Blade holsters his MACH, striding through vampire ash piles.
            The place is eerily quiet here, in stark contrast to the
            mayhem of the last few minutes.  Just the steady, low-pitched
            HUM of machinery.

            Blade starts forward.  Up ahead, a FAINT GLOW is emitting
            from behind an area that's been sectioned off with canvas
            tarps.  Blade sweeps one of the tarps aside --

            THREE LARGE TANKS

            are hidden inside.  The first two are empty.  A MAN is
            suspended within the third, bobbing weightlessly in a sea of
            red plasma.  His long, gray hair floats about his face,
            shrouding his weathered features.  We're not sure if he's
            sleeping or dead.

                                BLADE
                      Old man, old man, what've they done to
                      you --

            Whistler's ace drifts around into view.  Blade shakes his
            head in sadness.  He looks about for a way to extract
            Whistler, doesn't see any obvious means, then --

            CRASH!  Blade kicks through the glass.  Blood and fluids
            flood out around him as Whistler's limp body tumbles partly
            down, but he's still suspended by the wires and medical
            leads.  Blade unsheathes his sword, severing the wires --

            Whistler falls into his arms.  Blade cradles him, then -- the
            gunsmith's eyes abruptly snap open, flooding with rage.

            Blade staggers back as the HOWLING horror that used to be his
            mentor wraps his hands around Blade's throat, forcing him to
            the ground.  Whistler ROARS, revealing a set of jagged fangs.

                                WHISTLER
                      Why didn't you finish me off?!?!  I told
                      you --

            Whistler SLAMS the back of Blade's head against the concrete
            floor again and again, punctuating his words with each SLAM --

                                WHISTLER (CONT'D)
                      -- TO -- FUCKING -- FINISH -- ME -- OFF!

            Blade knees Whistler in the balls.  Whistler lets go, cupping
            his groin as Blade heaves him aside.
            Blade strips off his gauntlets.  Whistler springs at him
            again.  Blade sinks his fist deep in Whistler's stomach.  As
            Whistler doubles over, Blade twists Whistler's hands behind
            his back, cuffing his wrists together with a pair of titanium
            manacles.

            Blade pulls a restraint hood from his equipment bag and
            quickly slips it over Whistler's head, cinching it tight.

            Another beat.  Whistler doesn't stir.  He's down for the
            count.  Blade pauses a moment, catching his breath as he
            leans on Whistler's still form.  He's exhausted.

                                BLADE
                      Come on, Whistler.

            He rises, heaving Whistler's body over his shoulder.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Let's go home.

            EXT. THE CITY - NIGHT

            Blade's battered Charger knifes through the snow-dusted urban
            blight like a shadow.  Boarded up businesses, tent cities,
            doorways bombed with graffiti throwups -- wherever this
            godforsaken Gomorrah is, it's definitely a notch down on the
            misery scale from the city Blade used to call home.

            Up ahead, the sprawl levels out, giving way to an ice-bound
            harbor wreathed in fog.

            INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT

            Blade drives on, inured to the sqaulor.  He made peace with
            the darkness a long time ago.

            EXT. SHIPYARD - NIGHT

            The Charger weaves its way through a maze of scrap metal and
            rusty shipping containers, homing in on a sprawling warehouse
            that's been cordoned off by cyclone fencing and razor wire.
            Utlra-violent floodlights illuminate the area, while security
            cameras keep a watchful eye.

            INT. WAREHOUSE - INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

            More UV lights flicker on.  We're in a massive loading
            elevator/platform which HUMS as it ascends, eventually
            reaching its destination with a BOOMING CLANG.  The doors at
            the rear glide open.  Blade guides the Charger out.

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

            Santa's workshop by way of Soldier of Fortune.  Industrial
            equipment is strewn everywhere.  Mills, old furnaces, gutted
            vehicles, an ad hoc surgical theater.  We also notice the big
            rig which Scud had been piloting.  Because of various leaking
            overhead pipes, the floor is slick with a sheen of water.
            Blade kills his Charger, looking around as he climbs out.

                                BLADE
                      Scud!

            Blade's voice ECHOES throughout the cavernous room.

                                SCUD (O.S.)
                      Lock up your daughters, people --

            ANGLE ON SCUD

            A handlebar moustached, weed-sucking stoner.  Thrift-store
            chic, wearing a Jimmy Walker "Dyn-O-Mite!" T-shirt.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      The Dark Knight returns.

            Scud is lowering himself down from the ceiling on a rope and
            pulley system where he'd been suspended in a safety harness,
            doing some kind of electrical wiring job.  He reaches the
            floor and unclips himself.  We notice he's wearing a surfer's
            charm around his neck that's been strung with vampire fangs.

            Scud pulls a half-smoked roach from behind his ear, using a
            lighter in the shape of a woman's torso to fire up.  The
            flame jets from a hole in one of her tits.  He takes a
            Spicoli-sized hit and offers the roach to Blade.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      Little toke of the smokage, B?

            Blade slaps it from his hand.

                                BLADE
                      Knock it off.  We've got work to do.

            Blade opens the trunk.  Scud joins him.

            WHISTLER

            is inside.  Blade unfastens the hood, slipping it off.
            Immediately, Whistler sits up, LUNGING at Blade!

                                SCUD
                      Fuck me!

            Blade gets Whistler in a headlock, choking him as he drags
            him out of the trunk.  It's like trying to wrestle a rabid
            pit bull.  He looks to Scud, annoyed.

                                BLADE
                      You going to stand there crapping your
                      pants or are you going to help me?!

            Scud steps forward, tentative.  Together, he and Blade drag
            Whistler kicking and SCREAMING across the workshop, forcing
            him into a small, cell-like room.

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - CELL - NIGHT

            WHAP!  Blade throws Whistler onto the concrete floor, pinning
            him as Scud quickly slips a series of chains around him which
            have been secured to the wall.  The opposite wall is covered
            by a series of steel shutters.  As Whistler continues to
            thrash, Blade affixes a muzzle to the older man's mouth.

                                SCUD
                      You got something in mind, Blade?

                                BLADE
                      Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on
                      heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey
                      in one night.

            Blade pulls out a pneumatic syringe, plunging an ampoule of
            amber-colored fluid into the bottle mount.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Gonna try and OD Whistler on a
                      retroviral cure.

                                SCUD
                      I don't know about this, man --

            Blade injects Whistler with the syringe.  Whistler HOWLS in
            pain, nearly throwing Blade and Scud off him.

                                BLADE
                          (to Scud)
                      Get back!!!

            Scud scurries away.  Whistler's struggles have taken an even
            more violent turn.  Blade beats him back down.

            Finally, Blade steps on Whistler's neck, pinning his head as
            he draws a shotgun from a holster beneath his armpit.  He
            shoves it in Whistler's SNARLING FACE.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      If there's anything of you left in
                      there, Whistler, listen up now.  Come
                      morning, those shutters are going up.
                      Either you'll be cured, or you'll fry.

            Blade raises his foot from Whistler's neck, quickly backing
            out the door.  Whistler THROWS himself at Blade, nearly
            tearing the chains from the wall as --

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

            BOOM!  Blade slams the cell door closed.  The door is heavy
            steel.  Nevertheless, Whistler kicks against it, threatening
            to tear it off its hinges.  Blade throws a heavy cross-bar
            over the door.  Then he steps back, joining Scud.

            WHUMP!WHUMP!WHUMP!  Whistler hammers the door again and again
            and again.  But the crossbar holds.  Blade glances at Scud,
            who's looking winded and shaken by the ordeal.

                                BLADE
                      It's going to be a long night.

            Scud nods and exits.  Blade drags a chair across the floor,
            setting it in front of the door.  He sits down, shotgun
            resting across his knees, holding vigil.  And off that grim,
            stoic image we --

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. CITY DUMP - DAY (20 YEARS AGO)

            Daylight bleaches the image, almost whiting it out.  A WINO
            sifts through refuse, collecting bottles.  Three MUTTS are
            tethered to his side with rope.  He reaches for a bottle,
            cuts himself on a piece of glass.  As he inspects his wound,
            his dogs GROWL.  The Wino looks up --

            A BLACK KID (14) is standing atop a mountain of refuse --
            wiry and intense, perched there like a predator.  The Wino
            glances at his wrist again, the blood, then back up at the
            black kid.  Unnerved, the Wino starts to back away, then
            turns -- BUMPING right into the black kid, who has moved
            beside him with uncanny speed.  (NOTE: this all happens
            within a single, continuous shot.)

            The boy SLAMS the Wino against the trestle wall and SNARLS,
            baring FANGS.  And just as he's about to tear the man's
            throat out --

            A HAND reaches in from off-screen, pulling the boy back.
            It's WHISTLER, twenty years younger and spryer, with a head
            full of RAVEN BLACK hair.

            Whistler throws the boy into the light, forcing him onto the
            ground.  He shoves a .45 against the boy's face and is just
            about to pull the trigger when he stops, NOTICING overhead
            sun reflected in the boy's eyes.  Whistler looks up and SEES
            the sun at high noon, then glances back at the boy in
            understanding.  He smiles.

                                WHISTLER
                      Daylight.  Son of a bitch.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - DAWN

            Blade wakes up, lifts his head.  A shaft of sunlight shines
            directly down onto him, reflecting back at us from his now
            adult eyes.  Blade hasn't moved.  He sits in the chair in
            front of the cell door which is now silent.  He stands,
            unlocking the cell door.  He heaves the cross-bar away.  The
            door GROANS as he opens it.

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - CELL - DAWN

            Blade enters.  It's dark.  We can just make out Whistler's
            figure huddled in the corner like some kind of caged animal,
            his lanky, gray hair obscuring his face.

            Whistler doesn't stir.  Blade crosses over to the steel
            shutters.  For the briefest moments, he hesitates.  Then he
            hits the switch, readying his shotgun.  With a HUM, the
            shutters rise, throwing a SHAFT OF BLINDING SUNLIGHT over
            Whistler.

            Nothing happens.  Blade lowers his shotgun.  Whistler slowly
            raises his head, fixing Blade with a bloodshot eye.

                                BLADE
                      How do you feel?

                                WHISTLER
                      Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my
                      mouth.

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BATHROOM AREA - LATER

            Whistler stands bare-chested before a corroded mirror,
            splashing water from a sink over his face, rinsing off
            shaving cream residue.  He inspects his features -- he's
            cleaned himself up a bit, trimmed his beard, etc.

            He pulls on a fresh shirt, then turns to face Blade, who
            stands behind him.

                                WHISTLER
                      You came back for me.

                                BLADE
                      Did you think I wouldn't?

                                WHISTLER
                      Took you long enough.

            Blade smiles.  That was as close to a thank-you as this old
            junkyard dog is ever going to give.

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BACKSTORAGE AREA - DAY

            Whistler has fired up a Lucky Strike.  He's moving through
            the storage area where much of his old equipment has been
            shelved, pulling tarps off, checking things.  Blade follows.

                                BLADE
                      Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst
                      for good.  I'll be watching you close.
                      You start to back-slide --

                                WHISTLER
                      You put a bullet in my brain.  Wouldn't
                      expect anything else.

            Whistler takes a long drag, expelling the smoke slowly,
            studying the cigarette in his hand.

                                WHISTLER (CONT'D)
                      I'll say one thing for doing time as a
                      suckhead.  Seems to have knocked that
                      cancer of mine back into remission.

            Blade nods.  Then Whistler stops, obviously frustrated.

                                WHISTLER (CONT'D)
                      Where the hell's my lathe?

            Just then we hear the SOUND of an industrial lathe firing up.
            Curious, Whistler exits into --

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - DAY

            The workshop proper.  Scud is working at Whistler's old
            lathe, bopping his head along to MUSIC which is playing on a
            nearby TV.  The them song to SPEED RACER.  Now he's wearing a
            Ron Jeremy T-shirt that says "Daddy".

                                TV (O.S.)
                      Here he comes, here comes Speed Racer!
                      He's a demon on wheels.  He's gaining on
                      you so you better look alive.  He's busy
                      revving up the powerful Mach Five --

            Whistler cocks an incredulous eyebrow at Blade, who has
            fallen in beside him.  Scud kills the lathe and approaches.

                                SCUD
                      Whistler.  Cool beans.  Nice to meet
                      you, man.  Heard a lot.  I'm Josh
                      Frohmeyer.  You can call me Scud,
                      though.  That's what most people do.

            Scud offers his hand.  Whistler doesn't take it.  Scud shoots
            an uneasy glance at Blade, raising an eyebrow in question.
            Is Whistler okay, or not?  Blade nods.  Whistler moves over
            to the Charger which has its hood up.

                                WHISTLER
                      Tell me something, Skid --

                                SCUD
                      Scud.

                                WHISTLER
                      Whatever --
                          (checking the motor)
                      What'd you do to the Charger?

                                SCUD
                      The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after
                      market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide
                      injection system, forged aluminum
                      pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing
                      fuel pump.

                                WHISTLER
                      Gave it a more aggressive exhaust
                      profile ramping.

                                SCUD
                      Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this
                      betty up another three-hundred
                      horsepower.

                                WHISTLER
                          (cutting him off)
                      And you'll burn the damn thing out
                      before your next fucking oil change.

            Whistler just looks to Blade and shakes his head.

                                WHISTLER (CONT'D)
                      Where'd you dig up this shit-bird
                      anyway?

                                SCUD
                      Look, what's your problem?

            Whistler gets in Scud's face.  Scud looks to Blade for help,
            but he just watches, letting the two of them sort things out.

                                WHISTLER
                      My problem, shitbird, is that I tried to
                      blow my fucking head off and wound up
                      sucking blood clots for the last year
                      and a half!  Now you're standing there
                      choking your chicken like we're all
                      walking around some fucking candy-ass
                      vampire sitcom!

            Scud attempts to show some balls, but stammers all the same.

                                SCUD
                      Hey, you think I don't know what's at
                      stake here?  We practically compromised
                      our whole operation to save your
                      puckered old ass!  And for what?

                                WHISTLER
                          (grabs Scud's shirt)
                      Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I
                      built this operation, you fucking turd
                      stain.

            Just then, however, an alarm starts BEEPING.  Scud checks a
            display as Blade readies his MACH.

                                SCUD
                      Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.

                                BLADE
                      Human?

            Scud checks a series of thermal signature displays.

                                SCUD
                      Body temp's fifty so I'll guess suck
                      head.

            Scud looks to a bank of security monitors -- the views break
            into static as a FIGURE rushes past them.  He tries a few
            keyboard commands.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      I don't understand, I'm not getting
                      anything on the surveillance cams.

            Whistler makes a few adjustments on the nearest monitor.

                                WHISTLER
                      They're fried.  Whoever's out there is
                      using magnesium flares.  Seems like
                      they've got your security system stopped
                      out pretty well.

            Whistler moves to a rack of weaponry.  As he reaches for CAR
            15, Scud moves to stop him.

                                SCUD
                      Whoa, whoa, easy cowboy - I'm not
                      trusting you with a weapon just yet.

            Whistler SMACKS Scud in the face with the butt of the CAR-15
            and pushes past him.  We hear a CRASH.

            ANGLE ON

            TWO BLACK, LATEX-CLAD, NINJA LIKE INTRUDERS

            Running on all fours, racing upside down across the ceiling
            at break-neck speed.  Then they drop, somersaulting down
            fifty feet, landing in a cat-like stance.

                                BLADE
                      Hit the God-lights.

            Scud, with his nose now bleeding, activates a series of
            stadium-style lights secured to the ceiling.  The entire
            place goes white with UV light, the image nearly blowing out.

            CLOSE ON FIGURES' FACES

            They are wearing metal goggles with iris shut to mere pin
            prick openings.

            Whistler trains the CAR-15 on --

            THE FIRST LATEX CLAD FIGURE

            Who is now removing something from a satchel.  Whistler
            FIRES.  The Intruder drops the object and cartwheels away.

            In the blink of an eye, the Second Intruder has launched
            himself at Whistler, hand-springing off the floor, then
            kicking him in the mid-section.  As Whistler falls back, the
            Second Intruder presses forward.

            ON BLADE

            Unsheathing his sword, rushing at the First Intruder.

            WHAP!  The Intruder traps Blade's forearm, pivoting, planting
            a boot in Blade's ribcage.  Obviously, the Intruder is a
            serious martial arts student.

            WHAP!WHAP!WHAP!  The two of them go at it, unleashing a
            flurry of kicks, blocks, and punches.  The Intruder gets
            Blade in a back-choke.  He twists out of it, throwing the
            Intruder over his shoulder, who neatly cartwheels, springing
            back off the wall at Blade again --

            Blade ducks beneath one of the Intruder's kicks, then traps
            the Intruder's foot, giving it a savage twist.  CRACK!  Blade
            backhands the intruder with a blow so strong that it knocks
            the Intruder to his knees.  Then the Intruder reaches for a
            short sword.  In a heartbeat, the sword is out and against
            Blade's throat.  Just as Blade's sword is not against the
            Intruder's.  It's a stalemate.

                                SECOND INTRUDER
                      Stop!!!!!

            Blade and the First Intruder freeze.  The Second Intruder
            steps away from Whistler, whom he clearly had the drop on,
            and tosses the CAR-15 to the ground.

                                SECOND INTRUDER (CONT'D)
                      We didn't come here to fight.  We came
                      to deliver a message.

            Blade looks back to the First Intruder.  Then slowly
            withdraws his sword.  The Intruder does the same.  Blade
            turns off the God-lights.  The UVs fade and normal lighting
            returns.  Scud and Whistler pick themselves up off the floor.

                                BLADE
                      Take off your masks.

            The Intruders remove their masks.  The first is ASAD, a
            cautious Sufi Muslim possessing a restrained nobility.

            The second is a woman, NYSSA.  20-something, with emerald
            eyes and strong, darkly exotic features.  Both are Vampire.

                                ASAD
                      My name is Asad.  This is Nyssa.  We
                      represent the Shadow Cabinet.  The
                      ruling body of Vampire nation.  They're
                      offering you a truce.  They want to meet
                      with you.

                                SCUD
                          (wiping blood from his nose)
                      Bullshit.

            Blade holds up his hand, silencing Scud's outburst.  He nods
            for Nyssa and Asad to continue.

            Nyssa slowly crouches and reaches for the object she dropped
            - a CD.  She tosses it to Blade.  Still keeping an eye on
            them, Blade slips the CD into a reader.  We SEE a slide-show
            of video capture shots taken from a surveillance camera.
            Nomak tearing into the blood bank staff, etc.

                                NYSSA
                      For decades you've been the thing we've
                      feared the most.  But there's something
                      else loose on the streets now --

            CLOSE ON

            The final still.  A blurry, horrific shot of Nomak's half
            turned face and back.  We get a sense of distorted, inhuman
            physiognomy.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      Something worse than you.

                                                                 CUT TO:


            EXT. BLADE AND SCUD'S WAREHOUSE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

            Blade, Whistler, and Scud stand near the ledge, while Asad
            stands a few yards off, talking on a phone.  Nyssa stands
            even further away, watching them with distrust.

                                SCUD
                      This whole deal's giving me a serious
                      case of the butt-willies.

                                WHISTLER
                      Look, kid, they obviously found your
                      base of operations.  If it was a trap,
                      why flip their dicks by announcing
                      themselves?

                                BLADE
                      I agree.  We play along for now, we
                      might wind up learning something about
                      how their world ticks.

                                WHISTLER
                          (grinning at Scud)
                      Either that or feeding the worms.

            Asad finishes his call and approaches them.

                                ASAD
                      They're ready to see you now.

            As if on cue, we hear the THRUM of helicopters.  Seconds
            later, two Bell Jet Rangers appear above them, illuminating
            them in their searchlight.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. SKY - NIGHT

            We track the helicopters across the night sky.  We SEE
            Whistler and Asad in one, Blade, Scud and Nyssa in another.

            INT. JET RANGER - NIGHT

            Blade and Nyssa sit in the rear of the first helicopter.
            Nyssa is studying Blade.

                                BLADE
                      What?

                                NYSSA
                      They tell bedtime stories about you.
                      Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly,
                      I'm disappointed.
                          (Blade raises an eyebrow)
                      That you were willing to come along so
                      easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.

            Blade smiles and opens his coat, gesturing to a bandolier of
            plastic explosives secured to his chest.

                                BLADE
                      Semtex explosive.  Enough to level a
                      city block.  How's that for assurance?

            The helicopter abruptly banks right, dropping down low.

            EXT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

            The Bell Jet Rangers touch down outside a terraced, Frank
            Lloyd Wright structure overlooking the ocean.  As Nyssa and
            Asad lead Blade, Whistler and Scud towards the facility we
            SEE a circular crimson logo encircling a double-helix.

            Scud notices a series of RED LIGHT DOTS on his arms and
            chest.  He looks up to see DOZENS OF VAMPIRE MARKSMEN on the
            roofs above, training their weapons on them.

            INT. ELEVATOR CAB - NIGHT

            The group rides down.  The elevator stops.  The doors open.

            INT. DAMASKINO'S STRONGHOLD - 4-WAY INTERSECTION - NIGHT

            Nyssa and Asad lead them into a hub out of which multiple
            corridors project.  They take the central corridor.

            INT. STEEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

            The corridor ends at a pair of steel security doors.  Nyssa
            stands before a biometric scanner, allowing a beam of light
            to play over her face.  The scanner acknowledges her identity
            and the doors HISS open, revealing a series of security doors
            beyond these which successively open into --

            A FINAL DOOR

            Oak, set into a stainless steel wall.  Incalculably ancient,
            elaborately carved.  Brought over from the "Old World."

                                NYSSA
                      The House of Erebus you encountered
                      before were nothing but feudal lords.
                      The true power of the Vampire Nation
                      lies here --

            As they move towards the final door, Whistler shivers.  Scud
            watches as his breath escapes from his mouth in a frosty
            plume.  Asad takes notice.

                                ASAD
                      Few warmbloods have seen what's beyond
                      this door.

            He pushes the doors open into --

            INT. DAMASKINO'S LAIR - NIGHT

            A crescent-shaped room filled with antiquities: quarry
            columns from Middle Kingdom Egypt, stacks of arcane volumes,
            Medieval frontispieces.  A Borgia-esque Renaissance portrait
            staring down at us with a severe gaze.  Towering over all of
            these is a massive Greek Cross carved from stone.  MUSIC
            echoes around them -- Boito's Faust.  Standing in the midst
            of this is OVERLORD ELI DAMASKINOS, wearing a robe of black
            silk.

                                NYSSA
                      Father --

            Damaskinos holds up his hand.  He waits for the music to
            crescendo, then turns, his face still hidden in shadow.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      I hope you don't mind the cold.  When
                      one such as myself reaches an advanced
                      age, certain precautions are needed in
                      order to preserve the flesh.

                                ASAD
                      Blade, this is Overlord Eli Damaskinos.

                                DAMASKINOS
                          (in vampire dialect; subtitled)
                      Welcome, Daywalker.  I thank you for
                      coming.  I've been anxious to meet you
                      for quite some time.

            Damaskinos draws closer now, stepping into the light.  Bright
            eyed with smile like moonlight gleaming off a knife blade.
            His skin is impossibly pale, almost marble-like, with
            traceries of blue blood pulsing underneath.

                                DAMASKINOS (CONT'D)
                      And the late Abraham Whistler.  I trust
                      your time amongst our numbers was
                      agreeable?

            Whistler glares at Damaskinos.  The two men stare at each
            other a moment, sizing one another up.

                                DAMASKINOS (CONT'D)
                          (smiling knowingly)
                      It has been said, you may have enemies
                      whom you hate, but not enemies whom you
                      despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then
                      his success shall be yours, too.  In
                      that regard, I should thank you.

                                BLADE
                      For what?

                                STEVENS (O.S.)
                      Eliminating Deacon Frost.

            CARTER STEVENS, an officious-looking familiar who has been
            quietly watching from the wings now steps forward.

                                STEVENS (CONT'D)
                      All that unseemly business with LaMagra.
                      You did us a favor.
                          (offering his hand to Blade)
                      Carter Stevens.

            As Blade and Stevens shake, Blade notices a vampire glyph
            poking out from beneath the familiar's shirt cuff.

                                BLADE
                      You're human.

                                STEVENS
                          (with a smile)
                      Barely.  I'm a lawyer.

                                ASAD
                      Mr. Stevens works with the National
                      Institute of Health.
                          (off Blade's look)
                      Given that they monitor the nation's
                      blood supply, a strategic alliance
                      seemed prudent.

                                STEVENS
                      We also finance a number of humanitarian
                      organizations -- the National Institute
                      of Infectious Diseases for one, the
                      Human Genome Project...

                                BLADE
                      Why?

                                NYSSA
                      Survival.

            Blade and the others turn to Nyssa, who uses a complex
            mechanical key to activate a holo-projector mounted above the
            table.  As she focuses the image, a 3-D DIORAMA of vampire
            viral nucleocapsids swirls into view.  The nucelocapsids
            begin attacking human red blood cells.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      As you may know, Vampirism is an
                      arbovirus, one that's spread through the
                      saliva of parasitic organisms --
                          (motioning to the hologram)
                      In this case, vampires are the vector.
                      The virus replicates within the human
                      bloodstream, evolving its host into an
                      entirely new life-form.
                          (beat)
                      Unfortunately, viruses evolve too --

            As Nyssa talks, one of the viral nucleocapsids changes,
            mutating from its original, elegant design into a harsher,
            more menacing form.
            The mutated nucleocapsid begins feeding on the original
            vampire capsids, causing a chain-reaction of mutation.  In
            seconds, the holo-image is filled with throbbing, microscopic
            horrors which then mutate into  --

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      We've dubbed this new virus the Reaper
                      Strain.  And like any good pathogen, it
                      appears to have found a carrier -- a
                      "Patient Zero".

            A rotating 3-D image of Jared Nomak's face.  Eyes red, his
            skin in full "blood mode" blush.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      His name is Jared Nomak.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece.
                      The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more.
                      He was born a vampire, but he is an
                      anomaly.
                          (to Blade)
                      Like you.  Unlike the rest of us,
                      however, he feeds on not just humans,
                      but vampires as well.

                                BLADE
                      Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.

                                NYSSA
                      You're missing the point.  Their vampire
                      victims don't die.  They turn.  They
                      become carriers.  If the Reapers
                      continue unchecked, there could be
                      thousands of them before the month is
                      over.  Do the math.

            Blade turns to Damaskinos.

                                BLADE
                          (vampire dialect; subtitled)
                      You want me to hunt them for you.

                                DAMASKINOS
                          (vampire dialect; subtitled)
                      Not alone.

                                ASAD
                      We've been training a small tactical
                      unit -- the Bloodpack.  We want you to
                      lead them.

                                WHISTLER
                      Just how long has this little social
                      club of yours been together?

                                NYSSA
                      Two years.

                                BLADE
                      Then they weren't created to go after
                      your "patient zero".

                                NYSSA
                      No.  They've been training to hunt you.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - DAWN

            Blade, Whistler and Scud enter through the loading elevator.
            Blade turns to Whistler.

                                BLADE
                      What do you think?

                                WHISTLER
                      Sounds like a plan.

                                BLADE
                      What do you really think?

                                WHISTLER
                          (lighting a cigarette)
                      These guys are shitting bricks cause
                      they're no longer on the top of the food
                      chain.  They're going to fuck us the
                      first chance they get.

            Whistler moves away.  Blade shrugs off his jacket, begins
            putting away his weapons.  Scud lingers, apprehensive.

                                SCUD
                      So you're going to do this?

                                BLADE
                      Keep your friends close and your enemies
                      closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?

            Scud follows Blade's gaze, watching Whistler, who has
            collapsed into a chair at the far end of the workshop.  The
            grizzled hunter pulls off his leg brace, then massages his
            bum knee.  Scud nods in Whistler's direction.

                                SCUD
                      I'm worried about him.
                          (off Blade's look)
                      Look, I know he's your friend, but just
                      watch him, okay?  Nobody goes cold
                      Turkey from the Thirst in a night.

            BACK ON WHISTLER

            Surrounded by the salvaged parts and massive gears of long
            discarded machinery, half-hidden in shadow.  A shaft of
            morning sunlight cuts in through one of the windows, slowly
            moving across the floor towards his position.  He shifts in
            his chair, moving slightly --

            Away from the light.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

            It's late.  An ice-encased streetlight HUMS and flickers.
            The pumps are vacant.  A heavy blanket of sooty snow covers
            the grounds of the station.  The fluorescents of the mini
            mart are the only beacon of light in an otherwise fog-bound
            night.

            INT. MINI-MART - NIGHT

            A KOREAN WOMAN (30s) mans the counter.  Her TODDLER sits in a
            circular safety walker nearby.  The kind that rolls and is
            affixed with toys to keep a baby occupied.  The woman glances
            at two surveillance monitors.  On the first monitor we see --

            A CAR

            pull up to the pumps outside.  A MAN gets out, slides his
            credit card through the reader, starts pumping gas.

            ON THE SECOND MONITOR

            We SEE a FIGURE standing at the back by the Slurpee machine.
            The figure turns, approaching.  It's Nomak.  He sets a
            package of gum on the counter, looks to the baby.  He smiles,
            wriggles his finger.  The child COOS and smiles back.

            Unnerved by Nomak, the Korean woman quickly rings the
            transaction, gives him his change.  He removes a stick of gum
            from the pack, carefully unwraps it, slides it into his
            mouth, watching the child all the while.  Finally, he nods to
            the woman and leaves.  The door CHIMES as he exits.

            Beat.  The woman looks to the surveillance monitors again.

            THE FIRST MONITOR

            The car is still there, but the man pumping gas is gone.

            Puzzled, the woman steps from behind the counter and moves to
            the glass doors, looking out --

            HER POV

            The car's driver side door hangs open.  Even more disturbing,
            the hose for the gas pump lies untended on the icy ground,
            spilling fuel from its nozzle.

            EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

            The Korean woman cautiously exits the mini-mart.  No one is
            in sight.  She hurries to the abandoned car, disengaging the
            lock on the pump handle, then setting it back in its cradle.
            She looks to the open driver's door.  A FEW DROPLETS OF BLOOD
            have stained the snow just outside it.  Then she sees --

            A GHOSTLY FIGURE

            Standing off in the fog-bound shadows.  The woman looks back
            to the mini-mart, then back again to where the figure was
            standing.  But the figure is gone!  Growing increasingly
            anxious, the woman hurries back.

            INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

            The woman shuts the door, locks it.  But she's still just a
            target standing inside a well-lit glass box.  She moves to
            the safety walker, scoops up her child.

            After another moment's indecision, she slides the accordion
            style gate down over the doors and windows.  Then she turns
            off the lights.  Feeling somewhat more secure, the woman
            moves back around the counter and SEES --

            An unwrapped stick of gum resting on the tray of the baby
            walker.  It wasn't there before.  With a rising sense of
            dread, the woman backs away, bumping right into --

            NOMAK

            He smiles cruelly, the scar/seam in his chin just beginning
            to part.  The woman gasps, turns to run --

            and bumps into THREE MORE REAPERS.  Gaunt and feral-looking.
            All three with shaved heads.
            No eyebrows, and hairline scar/seams running down their
            chins.  As one, the reapers descend on her.  We hear the
            child's TERRIFIED WAIL and we --

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. THE CITY - NIGHT

            A sulfur-colored moon shines its baleful light down upon the
            icy cityscape as NOMAK'S ROAR echoes through the canyon of
            buildings.

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BLADE'S SLEEPING AREA - NIGHT

            Blade is just finishing injecting himself with serum.  He
            sighs, falling back into the chair he's sitting in, waiting
            for the shakes to subside.  He unwraps a piece of rubbing
            tubing which he'd been using as a tourniquet, flexes his
            hand.

            The door to his room opens.  Scud stands there in silhouette.

                                SCUD
                      Um, we've got company.

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

            Blade emerges into the workshop proper with Whistler and
            Scud.

            NYSSA AND BLOODPACK

            Stand before us.  They represent an assortment of ages and
            races, their one unifying characteristic being a callous,
            almost fanatical disregard for human life.  In short, these
            guys are the most stone-cold motherfuckers we've ever seen.

                                WHISTLER
                      Well if it isn't Snow White and the
                      Seven Suckheads.

            Their leader, DIETER REINHARDT (30s), is a square-jawed,
            chiseled Austrian.  Next to Reinhardt is SNOWMAN, a wire
            albino, LIGHTHAMMER, a massive Blackfoot Indian, and PRIEST,
            a bald-headed modern primitive with copious piercings and
            facial tattoos.  Rounding out the bunch is CHUPA, a blunt
            featured Puerto Rican, and VERLAINE, a familiar-looking
            curvaceous beauty with bee-stung lips that exudes a predatory
            sexuality.

            (NOTE: Verlaine looks familiar because she is the twin sister
            of Raquel, the bodacious vamp played by Traci Lords that
            Blade killed in the opening scene of the first film.)

                                REINHARDT
                      Check it out, troops.  Count Chocula.

            The vampires LAUGH.  Asad quiets them with a look, then
            gestures to them in turn.

                                ASAD
                      Blade, this is Reinhardt.  That's
                      Snowman, Lighthammer, Priest, Chupa and
                      Verlaine.

            Reinhardt advances until he and Blade are nose to nose.

                                REINHARDT
                      Tell me something, Chief.  Can you
                      blush?

            A tense beat.  Then Blade flashes a broad smile.

                                BLADE
                      Alright, you want to play this game?

            Blade pulls out one of his silver stakes.  In response, the
            vampires reach for their weapons.  But Blade merely twirls it
            around his fingers.  Then tosses it to Reinhardt.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      You've been training two years to take
                      me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire
                      hunter.  So do it.

                                NYSSA
                      What the hell are you doing, Blade?

                                BLADE
                      We're going to be working as a unit, you
                      people will be taking orders from me.
                          (spreading his hands wide)
                      So let's get it over with.  I'll give
                      you a free shot, Reinhardt.

            Reinhardt looks to Nyssa, uncomfortable.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Why are you looking at her for?  You
                      need permission?   I'm giving it to you.

                                CHUPA
                      Take him, cabron!

            Blade grabs Reinhardt's wrist, pulling the stake against his
            chest, fixing the vampire with the deadliest of poker gazes.

                                BLADE
                      What's wrong, Reinhardt?  You need a
                      fucking manual?

                                VERLAINE
                      Do it, Reinhardt.  Do it!!!

            Reinhardt tenses, thrusting the stake forward -- but Blade
            has already whirled out of the way, trapping his hand, then
            violently twisting it backwards.

            Before Reinhardt even knows what's happening, Blade swings
            him around into a headlock.  In his free hand he's got a
            tiny, barbed flechette.  The barbs spring open like a tick's
            gripping mandibles as Blade drives the flechette into the
            base of Reinhardt's skull.  Reinhardt HOWLS in pain, but
            Blade just tightens his grip, choking off Reinhardt's air.

                                BLADE
                      Listen up, Adolph, I just popped an
                      explosive charge in the back of your
                      head.  Silver nitrate.  Rigged to blow
                      if anyone tampers with it.  I'll be
                      keeping the detonator on me at all
                      times.  You so much as look at me
                      crosswise and I swear you'll be macking
                      your girlfriend's pie with a fucking
                      neck stump!  Got it?!

            Reinhardt lets loose a choked GRUNT.  Blade releases him,
            dropping the GASPING AUSTRIAN to the floor.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Any questions?

            No one says a word.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            WHISTLER

            Hefting a heavy ordnance case on the table.  Blade and
            company sit on one side, the Bloodpack on the other.

                                WHISTLER
                          (opening a case of bullets)
                      Glaser safety rounds in .38, .45, and
                      9mm caliber.  Foil capsules at the tip
                      filled with silver nitrate grains.  They
                      pack a major kinetic energy dump.  And
                      since you suckheads don't like sunlight,
                      we've modified the entry lights with UV
                      filters --

            Whistler flicks on the entry light.  Then notices that Chupa
            isn't paying attention.  The vampire is looking at Snowman
            who is saying something in sign-language.  Chupa snickers.
            Whistler picks up a massive gun with a modified C-mag
            (hundred round cylindrical mag).  It has a strange electromag
            assembly barrel with shockwave ports running along it.

                                WHISTLER (CONT'D)
                      This puppy here?  Hyper-velocity
                      railgun.  Spits up silver-tipped iron
                      core needles at six thousand butt
                      humping feet per second.  Like this --

            Whistler FIRES -- BA-BANG!  A SONIC BOOM rocks the workshop,
            SHATTERING a number of windows and computer monitor screens
            as a wad of needle rushes just millimeters past Chupa's face,
            embedding in the wall behind him.

                                CHUPA
                      Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!

                                WHISTLER
                      Getting your attention, Paco.

                                CHUPA
                      Well you've got it, warmblood.  Now what
                      the fuck are you gonna do with it?

            Blade clears his throat and stands.

                                BLADE
                      If you girls are finished flirting, I'd
                      like to get started.

            MOMENTS LATER

            Blade, Whistler, and the Bloodpack are silently suiting up
            for war -- strapping on body armor, securing stakes and
            knives, CLICKING ammo cartridges into their various weapons.

            We SEE them lacing up combat boots, checking rifle sights,
            entry lights.  Blade dons one of his EDTA pneumatic
            gauntlets.  Whistler loads custom rounds into a shotgun.
            Then he reaches to clip on an ammo vest.  But his hands are
            shaking slightly and he can't seem to clip the locking
            mechanism together.  After a beat, Blade reaches over and
            does it for Whistler.  Like a son helping his father.  A beat
            passes between them, Whistler and Blade looking at one
            another.  Then Whistler nods, satisfied.

            As Blade crosses towards Asad and Nyssa, he stops by
            Verlaine, sizing her up.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Didn't I kill you already?

                                VERLAINE
                          (cold)
                      That was my sister.

            Beat.  Blade smiles coldly.

                                BLADE
                      This the part where you beat your chest
                      and vow revenge?

                                VERLAINE
                      Something like that.

                                BLADE
                      Save it for the director's cut.

            Blade moves on, stopping before Nyssa.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Where to first?

                                NYSSA
                      The House of Pain.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

            Blade, Whistler, and the Bloodpack are gathered on a rooftop
            overlooking a derelict city block.

            THE HOUSE OF PAIN

            Rises before them, a Gothic Revival hotel marred by graffiti
            scrawls and boarded up windows.  There's a large neon "HOTEL"
            sign on the side of the building.

                                NYSSA
                      From what we can gather, the Reapers
                      hunt in packs, targeting places where
                      vampires congregate.  So far, they've
                      attacked bloodbanks, safehouses,
                      underground clubs like this --

                                WHISTLER
                      I don't see any traffic, no vampire
                      glyphs --

            Whistler lifts up a pair of night-vision binoculars and scans
            the building.

            WHISTLER'S POV (THROUGH BINOCULARS)

            He scans the graffiti scrawls, doesn't see anything.

                                NYSSA
                      Look closer.  Because of your efforts,
                      we've had to re-think our habits,
                      tighten our security.

            WHISTLER'S POV (THROUGH BINOCULARS)

            Whistler switches to infra-red.  A previously unseen Vampire
            GLYPH is now revealed, hidden amongst the haphazard graffiti.
            Just beneath the glyph are a pair of loading doors set flush
            into the concrete sidewalk.

                                WHISTLER
                          (lowering binocs; to Blade)
                      Let's put this clusterfuck in gear.

            Reinhardt reaches for Whistler, stopping him.

                                REINHARDT
                      You're not going anywhere, greenjeans.
                      You won't be able to pass for us.

                                WHISTLER
                      Like I give a shit.

            Before things can escalate, Blade steps between them.

                                BLADE
                          (to Whistler; sotto)
                      He's right.  They'll smell that you're
                      human.  Stay here, watch our backs.

                                WHISTLER
                          (bristling)
                      I don't like it.

                                BLADE
                      I'm not giving you a choice, old man.

            Whistler considers Blade's words, then reluctantly nods.
            Blade rejoins the vampires.  Reinhardt grins.

                                REINHARDT
                      You don't keep that dog of yours curbed,
                      Blade.  We might have to do it for you.

            Blade pulls out the remote for the flechette in Reinhardt's
            head, holding it up for view.

                                BLADE
                      Keep pushing, asshole.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - UNDERGROUND ENTRANCE - NIGHT

            Nyssa leads the group into a loading area.  The only light is
            coming from a series of burning trashcans.  VAMPIRE SENTRIES
            crouch on the steps, watching, smelling Nyssa's group as they
            move past.  Adjacent areas are walled off with sheets of
            vinyl.  We hear the pulsing, bass-heavy beat of MUSIC coming
            from beyond the sheeting, beckoning us onward.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - UNDERGROUND HALLWAY - NIGHT

            The MUSIC is louder.  Neon-lit, corridor-long steel counters
            line both walls, displaying various surgical instruments
            offered as party favors.  As Blade's scans the area, we SEE
            the deadly instruments reflected in his sunglasses.  Nyssa
            looks to him.

                                NYSSA
                      This is our world you're entering.  You
                      may see things -- feeding.
                          (off Blade's inscrutable face)
                      Just remember why you're here.

                                BLADE

                      I haven't forgotten.

            They reach a steel loading door emblazoned with warning signs
            -- the kind that is split horizontally, one-half retracting
            into the ceiling, the other into the floor.

                                PRIEST
                      So what are we looking for, exactly?

                                ASAD
                      Anyone who looks suspicious.

            On that portentous note, Nyssa hits a button.  The hydraulic
            doors open on into --

                                BLADE
                      You gotta be kidding me.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

            A high-ceilinged ballroom packed with SWAYING BODIES.
            Retrofitted into a trance-dance hall.  Off to the sides,
            people are being pierced, tattooed, ritually scarred.  Silver
            trays piled high with razor blades are passed through the
            writhing crowd.  Everyone looks suspicious.

            AN ELABORATE S&M STAGE SHOW

            is under way.  Joel Peter Witkin channeled by Julie Taymor.
            A SHE-VAMPIRE hangs from the ceiling, her body supported by
            steel pins which have been hooked through her flesh.  THREE
            PVC-clad spindly FIGURES minister to her.

            TWO VAMPIRES

            French kiss, exchanging razor blades with their tongues.

                                BLADE
                          (to Nyssa)
                      What is it with you people and pain?

                                NYSSA
                      We need it.  Sensations are addictive
                      and pain cuts the deepest.
                          (off his look)
                      Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring --
                      because we regenerate, none of it's
                      permanent.  So we have to take it to the
                      next level. To remind us we're alive.

            The Bloodpack fans out through the trancing crowd.

            ON BLADE

            Drifting through the press of flesh.  Feral faces flash by
            us, distorted by the stroboscopic lights.  A SHE-VAMPIRE
            latches onto him.  He shoves her aside, keeps scanning faces.
            It takes every ounce of his restraint not to cut loose.

                                BLADE
                      You reading me, Scud?

            EXT. STREET - NIGHT

            A nondescript van with primer blotches is parked nearby.

                                SCUD (O.S.)
                      Loud and clear, B.

            INT. OPERATIONS VAN - NIGHT

            The interior of the van has been outfitted into a mobile "op
            center".  Scud sits in a cluttered nest of electronic
            ephermera, munching on a bag of White Castle hamburgers.
            He's watching a video feed from a camera mounted on Blade's
            gear, listening to the Bloodpack's CHATTER coming in from
            various audio channels.  In the background, he's also got
            Barry White's "Love Machine" playing.

                                SCUD
                      Everything's copacetic in the Mystery
                      Van.  How you doing, Whistler?

            EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

            Whistler is atop the roof of a nearby building, outfitted
            with a sniper rifle on a tripod.

                                WHISTLER
                      Walking on sunshine, toke-boy.

            WHISTLER'S POV (NIGHT VISION BINOCULARS)

            The view pans from the hotel entrance to Scud's van.

            Whistler puts down the binoculars, lights a cigarette.  He
            takes out a knife and slices open his palm.  He stares at the
            blood, his hand slowly trembling.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

            Blade works his way through the crowd.  The beat is getting
            heavier now, the crowd more energized.  He briefly makes eye
            contact with Nyssa, but then she's gone again, disappearing
            into the sea of flesh, ducking past one of the vinyl sheets
            into a corridor beyond.  Chupa, Asad, Snowman and Priest
            remain behind, searching the crowd.

            As Blade walks, he notices a series of grates beneath their
            feet.  We shift our POV --

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - DRAINAGE AREA - NIGHT

            -- and we are below Blade, looking up at him through the
            grate.  We are in a blood-encrusted drainage area just
            beneath the ballroom that slopes inward towards a large,
            octagonal iron culvert.  As we watch, a section of the
            culvert rises, a pair of RED EYES peering out from the
            darkness within.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - STAIRCASE - NIGHT

            Blade follows Nyssa up a narrow staircase into a corridor
            lined with gangrenous, peeling wallpaper.  Some of the room
            doors are shut, some open.  Clearly, many are occupied.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - KITCHEN - NIGHT

            A 1930s industrial kitchen filled with corroded equipment.
            Reinhardt, Verlaine, and Lighthammer work their way inward,
            searching the area.  Lighthammer carries massive war hammer
            like his namesake.
            Reinhardt nods to Verlaine, who opens a walk-in, shining her
            entry light over an assortment of rusting meat hooks.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - FIRST CORRIDOR - NIGHT

            Blade checks more doorways, catching half-glimpses of FLESH,
            LEATHER, and STEEL.  He hears SOBBING, MOANS, WHISPERS.
            Then, a distinctly HUMAN WHIMPER catches his attention.

            Nyssa opens a door onto an empty room.  A vacant stainless
            steel examination table gleams in the center, waiting.

            Blade pushes open another door.  We SEE a fearful YOUNG WOMAN
            crouching in the corner of a soiled room.  A corpulent
            VAMPIRE in a leather apron is hosing down the floor.

                                CORPULENT VAMPIRE
                      Close the fucking door, buddy.

            Blade makes eye-contact with the woman.  She's clearly human.
            Blade tenses.  The corpulent vampire is getting irate when --

                                CORPULENT VAMPIRE (CONT'D)
                      I said, close the f--

            THUNK!  Blade throws a sliver stake into the vampire's
            forehead.  Even as the vampire turns to ash, Blade motions
            for the girl to leave and we're out the hallway again, Nyssa
            turning around.

                                NYSSA
                      What was that?

                                BLADE
                          (poker-faced)
                      Nothing.

            We SEE the woman duck out the room behind him.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - KITCHEN - NIGHT

            Reinhardt, Verlaine, and Lighthammer.  A Styrofoam cup rolls
            across the floor, blown by a breeze.  Reinhardt pauses,
            notices another walk-in freezer door ajar, moves in that
            direction.

            Unseen behind them, a door BEHIND THEM slowly swings open.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

            Chupa, Asad, Snowman and Priest.  THREE SHADOWED FIGURES are
            lurking near one of the exits -- skinhead types, each with a
            hairline scar running down their chin.
            Asad silently motions to snowman and the others, indicating
            figures.  Snowman signs something back.  The vampire trio
            starts towards them.

            INT. OPERATIONS VAN - NIGHT

            Bored to shit, Scud plucks a joint from behind his ear.  As
            he fires up his woman torso lighter we HEAR SOMETHING just
            outside the van.  Scud kills the Barry White, listening.
            Silence.  Then, a FAINT SKITTERING.

                                SCUD
                      Um, Whistler, you out there?

            No response.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                          (more urgently)
                      Whistler?

            Still no response.  Scud reaches for a handgun and creeps
            into the front of the van.  He looks out the windshield --
            nothing.  He looks left, then right - nothing.

            Unnerved, Scud returns to the back of the van.  He reaches
            for the handle of the rear door and abruptly jerks the door
            open, aiming the gun out --

            There's nothing outside the van.  But then Scud hears the
            SKITTERING AGAIN.  His eyes shift apprehensively to the floor
            of the van below him.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - FIRST CORRIDOR - NIGHT

            As they near the end of the hall, Blade notices a drop-down
            attic door in the ceiling above.  He unsheathes his sword and
            uses the tip to unlatch the trapdoor.  The counter-weighted
            door CREAKS and LOWERS, unfolding a sectioned ladder.  We see
            darkness beyond.  As Blade cautiously mounts the stairs --

            Nyssa's attention is drawn to a billowing piece of vinyl.  A
            BLURRY FIGURE is visible behind it.  Then it moves away.
            Nyssa ducks past the vinyl.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

            As the music reaches a crescendo, Asad notices MORE SHADOWY
            FIGURES by another exit.  And even MORE by a third.  Snowman
            signs to Asad again, more urgently this time, as the first
            potential Reaper begins to turn and we are --

            INT. OPERATIONS VAN - NIGHT

            -- back with Scud.  He ducks his head outside, looking
            beneath the van.  Nothing there.  Relieved, Scud shuts the
            rear door, laughs to himself.

            A PAIR OF CLAWED HANDS

            Suddenly rip down through the ceiling of the van, peeling it
            up and back like it was tinfoil!  A REAPER with a bloody
            bandage covering his eye SNARLS down at us.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

            The first skinhead figure spins towards us.  It's a Reaper.
            All three of them are, eyes wide with bloodlust as they leap
            at Asad and the others.

            Suddenly, the Reapers are everywhere, blocking the exits,
            ripping into their vampire victims, tossing them aside like
            toys.  Vampires scream and run, some taking to the walls as a
            means of escape, some racing across the ceiling.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - FIRST CORRIDOR - NIGHT

            Blade stops half-way up the ladder as he hears GUNFIRE.  He
            drops back to the floor, then notices that Nyssa is gone.  HE
            pushes through the vinyl curtain and finds -- Nyssa forced
            back against the wall, wrestling with --

                                SCUD (O.S.)
                          (filtered; panicked)
                      They're here!!!!

            -- Nomak, who swings his head around towards Blade!  Blade
            FIRES his MACH pistol point-blank into Nomak's face, blasting
            the Reaper backwards --

            But Nomak is back on his feet in a split-second, SMASHING
            through a window onto the fire escape beyond.  Blade rushes
            to the window, looks out --

            BLADE'S POV

            Nomak is scaling his way straight up the neon hotel sign,
            jumping from one letter to the next with lightning speed.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - KITCHEN - NIGHT

            A Reaper EXPLODES out from the walk-in, rather than the door
            behind them.  He leaps atop Reinhardt, SLAMMING him to the
            floor.  Lighthammer swings his hammer, missing the Reaper,
            taking out a chunk of the wall instead.
            Lighthammer swings and misses again, taking a chunk out of
            the floor.  Verlaine empties her automatic rifle into the
            Reaper even as --

            The Reaper turns on Lighthammer, catching the war hammer,
            Reaper's lower jaw disengages and splits open, revealing a
            freakishly enlarged esophagus lined with serrated, sharklike
            teeth.

            All of this takes a split-second.  No time for Lighthammer to
            react as the Reaper latches its grossly expanded mouth onto
            his throat and begins draining him before our eyes.  The
            Reaper SHUDDERS and the whites of his eyes bleed red as an
            ecstatic wave washes over him.  His pale flesh, pulsing with
            engorged veinwork, becomes flushed, turning crimson as --

                                LIGHTHAMMER
                      Ohmygodhe'sfuckingkillingmehe's --

            Lighthammer's face becomes increasingly pallid!  His face
            begins caving inward, shrinking as every millimeter of blood
            is vacuumed out of him.

            BLOOD VESSELS

            Are popping up beneath the Reaper's briefly translucent skin,
            becoming engorged and dilated.  The veins continue to swell,
            racing up his neck, then branching out over his face, chest,
            and arms -- like an instant network of varicose veins.

            Verlaine retreats, horrified.  Reinhardt scurries backwards,
            then scrambles to his feet, running for his life into --

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

            Chaos.  Vampire patrons flee.  The Bloodpack FIRE, unleashing
            a hailstorm of bullets, cutting into vampires and Reapers
            alike as --

            EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

            Blade steps out onto the icy fire escape.  CRASH!  Nomak has
            dislodged the "H" from the hotel sign.  It comes HURTLING
            towards Blade, who ducks back into the center of the "O" to
            avoid being hit.  The "H" continues falling, SMASHING down
            into the street near the Mystery Van where --

            INT/EXT. OPERATIONS VAN - NIGHT

            Scud unloads his handgun into the Reaper atop the van.  The
            Reaper should turn to ash, but it doesn't!  Scud flees,
            DIVING into the front of the van, ducking behind the wheel.
            He keys the ignition --

            WHAM!  Now the Reaper is atop the hood, SMASHING his feet
            through the windshield.  Scud SCREAMS as he slams the van
            into the drive and floors the pedal --

            WK-KRUNCH!  Scud CRASHES the van against the side of a
            building, pinning the Reaper between the van's front bumper
            and the crumbling wall.  He keeps his foot on the gas pedal,
            GRINDING the van's wheels.

            This gambit should cut the Reaper in half, or at the very
            least, fatally wound it -- but it only enrages it further.
            The Reaper stretches forward across the van's crumpled hood
            and resumes BATTERING away at the cracked windshield --

                                SCUD
                      UV headlights, c'mon, come on!!!

            Scud fumbles for the headlights.  They won't go on!  Then he
            notices a mess of wiring haphazardly duct-taped together.  He
            reaches for the wiring, fiddling with it --

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      FuckmefuckmefuckmeFUCKME!!!!

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

            The Reaper nearest Priest turns in his direction.  We
            recognize her as the Nurse from the bloodbank.  She LEAPS at
            Priest --

            Priest fires a Glaser round through the she-Reaper's head.
            The Reaper twists in mid-leap, falls to the floor, then picks
            herself up again.  Like Scud's Reaper, she seems unaffected
            by the custom-made ammo.

            ON THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE BLOODPACK

            Having similarly disastrous results.  The Reapers are
            shrugging off their firepower.  Asad leaps, snapping a
            Reaper's neck with a spinning heel kick, but the Reaper keeps
            coming!

            BACK TO THE PRIEST

            Alarmed, reaching for a specialized shotgun instead.  The
            Reaper continues forward, moving so fast she almost seems a
            blur as BA-BOOM! BA-BOOM!  Priest pumps his shotgun
            repeatedly.  Two projectiles fire out, chained together by a
            length of titanium cable.  The cable catches the Reaper in
            the mid-section, cutting it clean in half!

            The upper half of the Reaper falls, then rights itself,
            landing on its clawed hands.
            Impossibly, the she-Reaper keeps coming!  She skitters
            towards Priest on his hands like the half-man from Todd
            Browning's "FREAKS".

            The half-Reaper launches itself at Priest, hitting him in the
            chest, knocking him back to the floor.  Priest panics as he
            struggles with the thing, trying to fend off its claws and
            fangs as it locks its mouth into his arm.  He SCREAMS.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. VAN - NIGHT

            As Scud continues to fiddle with the faulty headlight wiring,
            the windshield finally SHATTERS beneath the Reaper's pounding
            fists.  It latches onto Scud's collar and pulls him forward
            over the wheel even as the seam/scar in its chin splits apart
            and the Reaper's enlarged maw flowers open.  Scud is just
            centimeters away from having his face being bitten off when --

            -- the wires SPARK and the headlights come on, illuminating
            the Reaper in a wash of UV light!  The effect is
            instantaneous.  The Reaper HOWLS and lets go, then promptly
            BURSTS INTO FLAMES.

            Scud cups his ear, shouting via the comm system.

                                SCUD
                      Use your entry lights!  They can't stand
                      the UV!!!

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BASEMENT - NIGHT

            Asad hears Scud's message as he continues fending off a
            Reaper's attack.  Then he manages to get hold of his rifle.
            He FLICKS on the UV entry light, aiming it at the Reaper's
            face.  The Reaper's head catches fire.  Asad SHOUTS to the
            others --

                                ASAD
                      Use your entry lights!

            One by one, the members of the Bloodpack CLICK ON the entry
            lights mounted atop their guns.  It's working -- the UV beams
            are the only thing that seems to be driving the Reapers back.

            EXT. HOUSE OF PAIN - ROOF - DAWN

            BOOM!  Blade kicks open the roof access door.  He hurries
            outside, followed by Nyssa, who hesitates when she SEES --

            THE SUN

            beginning to rise beyond the cityscape horizon.  Nomak is
            already at the opposite side of the building, moving fast.

                                BLADE
                          (into com-link)
                      Whistler!  He's heading across the roof!
                      Take him!

            Nyssa falls back into the shadows as Blade continues onward,
            unsheathing his sword.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Whistler!!!

            EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

            Whistler's sniper rifle and binoculars have been abandoned
            and --

            EXT. HOUSE OF PAIN - ROOFTOP - DAWN

            We're back with Blade as he chases Nomak across the roof.

            UP AHEAD

            Nomak abruptly stops, having reached the end of the roof.
            The nearest neighboring rooftop is too far away and the drop
            from this last ledge looks unsurvivable, even for someone
            like Nomak.

            As Blade cautiously advances, Nomak turns around and smiles --
            a wolfish grin, unnaturally wide.  The Reaper's face is
            beginning to smoke beneath the rising sun's rays.  In
            response, a polarized nictomembrane slides down over Nomak's
            irises -- like something you'd see on a crocodile to protect
            its eyes from harsh light.

                                NOMAK
                      Is the enemy of my enemy my friend or my
                      enemy?  What do you think, Blade?  What
                      am I to you?

            Nomak LAUGHS, then LUNGES, scooping up a rusty iron bar that
            lies nearby.  He swings it at Blade.  Blade parries and steps
            backward, taking a blow to the head in the process, then
            another to the side.

            The two of them exchange a flurry of blows back and forth
            until their weapons lock and they are face to face.  Nomak's
            back is to the rising sun, now.  His whole body is beginning
            to lightly smoke.

            Both men are trembling, straining against their weapons,
            using every ounce of strength to keep the other at bay.  And
            just when it looks like Nomak is gaining the upper hand --

                                NOMAK (CONT'D)
                      Athelfiki singenia ex amato.

            -- Blade pivots the flat edge of his sword upwards, catching
            the light of the rising sun, reflecting it directly into
            Nomak's eyes!

            Nomak SCREAMS and rears back, his face catching fire.  Then
            he stumbles backwards and falls -- right off the ledge of the
            roof!  Blade hurries to the roof's ledge and looks down --

            But the Reaper is nowhere in sight.  Dumbfounded, Blade
            retreats, haunted by the conviction that Nomak is still
            alive.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - DAWN

            Blade has returned to the scene of the melee.  The Reapers
            have fled, leaving Nyssa and the others to lick their wounds
            and survey the carnage.  Quite a few full-body ash outlines
            marking the passing of various vampires.  Blade approaches
            Nyssa.  She notices his wounds.

                                NYSSA
                      You're hurt.

                                BLADE
                          (brushing off her concern)
                      I'll heal.

                                NYSSA
                      What about Nomak?

                                BLADE
                      He escaped.  You didn't tell me they
                      were immune to silver and garlic.

                                NYSSA
                      I didn't know.

            Beat.  Tense.  Does he trust this woman?  No way.

                                BLADE
                      We lose anybody?

                                NOMAK
                      Lighthammer and --

            Just then, we hear an unearthly SCREAM.

            ANGLE ON

            Priest, being held down by Chupa and Snowman.  He's thrashing
            about, clutching his wounded, infected arm.

                                PRIEST
                      Oh god, oh God it hurts!  It hurts, it
                      hurts, fuck, it hurts.  Ugh!

            Priest lets loose an agonized SCREAM as Blade and the others
            gather around him.  He's undergoing a horrific change, taking
            on the gaunt, vein-engorged features of a proper Reaper.  He
            SNARLS and WAILS, GNASHING his teeth like a rabid animal.

            Reinhardt and his team look uneasy.  Shaken by their
            teammate's downward progression.

                                BLADE
                      how long since he was bitten?

                                NYSSA
                      Minutes.

            Blade draws closer.  Already, the flesh on Priest's chin is
            splitting as a seam begins to form.

                                BLADE
                      It's already changing him --

            Reinhardt paces, annoyed by Priest's WAILING.

                                REINHARDT
                      Jesus, can't you get him to shut the
                      fuck up!?

                                NYSSA
                          (gravely)
                      His blood cells aren't producing oxygen
                      anymore.  His own body is suffocating
                      him.  These things are like crack
                      addicts.  If they don't feed every few
                      hours, they'll feed on themselves.

            As if in response, Priest starts convulsing.  His flesh
            tightens, drawing taut around his increasingly skeletal form.
            His screams become unbearable, twisting into a high-pitched
            ululation that's making the Bloodpack's skin crawl.

                                REINHARDT
                      Somebody put him out of his misery for
                      fuck's sake!

                                VERLAINE
                      You kill him!  I'm not killing him!

            Asad pulls out his handgun and empties the clip into Priest's
            body -- but Priest keeps SHRIEKING.

            Unnerved, Reinhardt unsheathes a machete, decapitating Priest
            even as the others protest.

            The headless body continues thrashing, still making noise
            from it's open throat!  If anything, it seems to be
            redoubling its efforts.  It LURCHES forward, jerking itself
            free from Chupa and Snowman's restraining arms.

                                CHUPA
                      Mierda!!

            The juddering horror that used to be Priest staggers to its
            feet.  Reinhardt and his men panic, stumbling backwards.  The
            headless monstrosity LUNGES STRAIGHT AT --

            BLADE

            Without batting an eye, he draws his MACH pistol, briefly
            aiming at the on-rushing creature's chest, then adjusting his
            aim to one of the blacked-out windows above and behind it.

            BAM!BAM!BAM!  Blade shoots out the window and BLAZING SHAFT
            OF SUNLIGHT slices down through the darkness, spotlighting
            Priest like an ant beneath a magnifying glass.

            FWASH!!!  The headless body is incinerated in mid-step.  It
            collapses to the floor, just inches before Blade.  One of its
            blackened claws feebly grabs Blade's boot, then grows still.

            Beat.  You could hear the pin drop in the silence that
            follows, every one of the Bloodpack thinking some variation
            of "there but for the grace of God go I".  Asad lays a hand
            on Nyssa's shoulder, steadying her.

            Blade shifts his foot, causing the cinder-like hand gripping
            his boot to crumble to dust.

                                WHISTLER (O.S.)
                      If this is the best you turd-stains have
                      to offer, I'm not impressed.

            Blade looks over to see Whistler, who is just entering.  He
            moves over to him, angry.  Chupa follows, equally pissed.

                                BLADE
                      I thought you were supposed to be
                      watching our backs.

                                WHISTLER
                      Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.

                                CHUPA
                          (approaching, hostile)
                      Oh yeah?  Like how little?  In case you
                      hadn't noticed, we lost two men while
                      you were out farting around.

                                WHISTLER
                          (poking Chupa in the chest)
                      You need to ratchet those 'nads of yours
                      down a few notches, paco.

            Chupa flushes with anger and flicks his knife across
            Whistler's shoulder, opening a gash.  Whistler goes ballistic
            and PUNCHES Chupa in the face.  A brief tussle ensues before
            Blade and the others can separate them.  As Chupa is pulled
            away by Asad, he looks back at Whistler.

                                CHUPA
                      Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair
                      away from cowboy heaven.

                                WHISTLER
                      Ain't no thing but a chicken wing,
                      buttercup.

                                BLADE
                          (still suspicious)
                      Where were you, Whistler?

                                WHISTLER
                      I'll show you.

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - DRAINAGE AREA - CONTINUOUS

            Whistler, Blade and the surviving members of the Bloodpack
            are now gathered around the octagonal iron culvert just
            beneath the ballroom.  Whistler turns on a flashlight.  We
            HEAR something moving in the darkness.  The group tenses,
            then Whistler's flashlight beam reveals --

            A REAPER

            Cowering by the culvert.  One we recognize.  The other
            vampire guard from the bloodbank, now transformed.  He's
            shrunken and emaciated, pale.  And although he's obviously
            dying, he still HISSES, his fanged mouth snapping
            ineffectually at them.  His arm has been trapped -- pinned
            under one of the sectional culvert coverings.  It looks like
            he's been trying to gnaw it off in order to escape.

                                REINHARDT
                      What the hell?

                                WHISTLER
                      I found him like this.  I think he was
                      trying to crawl back into that culvert.

            Blade looks to the culvert in question.  He pulls back one of
            the sectioned covers.  The opening is about two feet wide,
            just large enough for a man to gain access.

            INT. SEWER/OUTFLOW AREA - CONTINUOUS

            Blade drops into the sewer line.  The area is claustrophobic,
            damp.  There are torn pieces of insulation hanging from the
            ceiling, saturated and dripping with blood.

            Blade crouch-walks further in.  We hear WIND.  He shines his
            FLASHLIGHT.  A portion of the brick wall looks like it's been
            clawed open.

                                NYSSA
                          (calling down)
                      Everything okay?

            Blade retreats back to the drain-pipe, pulling himself back
            up.  We HOLD for a beat, then drift up to the blood-saturated
            strips of insulation.  SOMEONE is crouched in the shadows
            there, clinging to the ceiling upside down.

            It's NOMAK, red-eyes shining in the darkness.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. DAMASKINO'S LAIR - BATHHOUSE - DAY

            We are in a previously unseen portion of Damaskino's vast
            bedroom.  An elegantly tiled pool area has been partitioned
            off by a series of latticed screens.  In the counterpoint to
            this are a series of muted monitors tuned to the pulse of the
            world -- CNN, MSNBC, C-SPAN, etc.

            Damaskinos sits in a robe, finishing a meal, his eyes
            flicking over the monitors -- tracking current events, market
            fluctuations.  We get the sense that the man is a true
            polymath.  That he owes his five thousand-plus years of
            existence to resourcefulness rather than luck.

            Stevens enters, waiting to be acknowledged.

                                DAMASKINOS
                          (vampire dialect; subtitled)
                      Yes?

                                STEVENS
                          (vampire dialect; subtitled)
                      They've made contact with the Reapers.

                                DAMASKINOS
                          (vampire dialect; subtitled)
                      Any casualties?

                                STEVENS
                          (vampire dialect; subtitled)
                      Two so far.

            Unconcerned, Damaskinos slices into a piece of raw meat.

                                DAMASKINOS
                          (reverting to English)
                      An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was
                      not among them, I trust.

                                STEVENS
                      No.  This is a dangerous game, you're
                      playing, Damaskinos.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      Any game worthy of being played is.  One
                      must be patient.  In this way, I have
                      outlived my enemies.  All of them.

            Damaskinos steps beyond the screens now, into the pool area --
            and although we can't see the water from this angle, we can
            see patterns of ruby light flickering off the tiled walls.
            Stevens follows, uncomfortable.

                                STEVENS
                      Blade's too volatile.  You're not going
                      to be able to keep manipulating him --

            Damaskinos steps into the steaming liquid, which we now see
            is BLOOD.  His robe spreads out, floating on the surface.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      You worry too much, Stevens.  I have
                      assurance from our friend inside that
                      events are unfolding as scripted.

                                STEVENS
                      As scripted?  You've already lost two of
                      your own.  How many more are you willing
                      to sacrifice?

            Damaskinos sinks until he's waist-deep in the crimson fluid.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      As many as it takes.
                          (pointing)
                      Do you see that jar over there?

            Stevens looks to a shelf where a gold and crystal Coptic jar
            rests.  A HUMAN HEART floats within.

                                DAMASKINOS (CONT'D)
                      It contains my human heart --
                          (touching a pale scar on his
                           chest)
                      Something I relinquished a long time
                      ago.  Only a fool would appeal to it
                      now.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - CELL - NIGHT

            The dying Reaper has now been chained inside the cell.  It
            WHEEZES and MOANS, clearly in agony.  Blade and Nyssa stand
            watch.  Blade grips the Reaper beneath its jaw, turning its
            face towards us.

                                BLADE
                      Recognize him?

                                NYSSA
                          (nodding)
                      From the surveillance footage in the
                      bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's
                      Nomak attacked.

                                BLADE
                      Which means he turned about seventy-two
                      hours ago.

                                NYSSA
                      Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't
                      appear to have any broken bones, no
                      entry wounds of any kind -- what's
                      killing him?

                                BLADE
                      Time.

            Blade nicks the Reaper's carotid artery with a knife.  CLEAR
            SERUM oozes out, no red blood cells at all.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      No hemoglobin left.
                      Their metabolisms are too fast.  They
                      burn out.  That's why they're having to
                      feed so often.  Their systems are self
                      destructing.

                                NYSSA
                      If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's
                      been alive longer than the others.

                                BLADE
                      Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.
                          (shaking his head)
                      There's something driving him beyond the
                      Thirst.  Something we're missing.

            As they watch, the Reaper shakes through its final death
            throes, then grows still, the nictomembranes over its eyes
            slowly sliding down.

            MOMENTS LATER - A SERIES OF ISOLATED CLOSE-UPS

            A pair of GLOVED HANDS spreads apart the Reaper's eyelids.
            In response, the protective nictomembrane slides mechanically
            down over the pupil.

                                NYSSA (O.S.)
                      They appear to have a nictating membrane
                      here, like you'd see on a crocodile or
                      camel.  Shields the eyes from sunlight.

            The hands now part the Reaper's mouth, probing the seam in
            the chin, then splitting the mandible apart to reveal the
            enlarged esophagus.  The fingers push back on the gums and
            the pressure-sensitive fangs extend even further in response.

                                NYSSA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                      A bifurcated mandible.  More developed
                      masseter muscles and zygomatic bones
                      around the mouth allowing for a much
                      larger, stronger bite --

            PULL BACK TO REVEAL

            Blade, Nyssa, and Scud are gathered around the autopsy table.
            The rest of the crew linger further back.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      Epidermal layers are thicker, tougher --

            Nyssa begins the Y-incision along the chest.  Once again,
            CLEAR SERUM oozes out.  She cracks open the thoracic cavity.

                                SCUD
                      Ho-lee shit.

            We SEE inside the abdominal cavity.  A complex, pinkish/gray
            parasitic organism has taken over every organ visible.

                                NYSSA
                      I've never seen anything like this.  The
                      Reapers are as different from us as we
                      are from you.
                          (probing the organism)
                      It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring
                      their bodies, creating new, parasitic
                      organs which consume the old ones.

                                BLADE
                      Like cancer with a purpose.

                                NYSSA
                      Exactly.  Look at the digestive system.
                      It's been drastically simplified.  Super
                      charged.  And this --

            She pulls back the lungs -- a calcified structure encasing a
            fibrous mass rests where the heart would normally be.  She
            taps the calcified structure with a scalpel.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      The heart is completely encased in bone.

            She tries to cut into the bony shell and the scalpel snaps.
            Scud WHISTLES, impressed.

                                SCUD
                      Good luck getting a stake through that.

            Blade studies the Reaper corpse, then looks to the Bloodpack.

                                BLADE
                      We've got six hours till sunrise.  Be
                      ready by then.

                                ASAD
                      What happens at sunrise?

                                BLADE
                      We take up the hunt again.

                                CHUPA
                      You gotta be fucking joking.

                                BLADE
                      You've seen what we're up against.
                      Daylight's the only advantage we've got.
                      They'll be more vulnerable then.

                                REINHARDT
                          (pointedly)
                      And so will we.

                                BLADE
                      Look, I care about the humans who are
                      dying, not you, got it?

                                REINHARDT
                          (snarling)
                      Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not
                      going out into the sun.  It's too risky.

                                BLADE
                      You don't have a choice.  You're just
                      going to have to protect yourselves as
                      best you can.

            Blade spins and leaves.  Whistler follows.  Nyssa watches
            them disappear into Blade's room.  Reinhardt and the other
            vampires approach her.

                                REINHARDT
                      You buying any of this chocolate Elvis
                      bullshit?

            Nyssa just stares him down, obviously conflicted.

                                CHUPA
                      This guy doesn't know what the fuck he's
                      doing.  We already lost Priest and
                      Lighthammer, who's gonna be next?  Fuck
                      him.  Fuck his rules.  First chance I
                      get, I'm chowing down on that fucking
                      HeeHaw sidekick of his.

            Snowman signs something to Verlaine.

                                VERLAINE
                      What do you think, Asad?

                                ASAD
                          (pointedly)
                      I don't think.  I follow orders.

            Asad looks to Nyssa once more -- perhaps he's even concerned
            now.  She's still staring in the direction Blade left.


            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BLADE'S SLEEPING AREA - NIGHT

            Blade sits in the shadows, wrapping a piece of rubber tubing
            around his arm, injecting himself with pneumatic syringe of
            serum.  He shivers, convulses violently, then throws back his
            head in relief.  When he does so, he SEES --

            Whistler standing in the doorway.  They eye each other a
            moment as Blade unwraps the tubing from his arm, puts away
            his syringe and serum.  Whistler lights a cigarette, then
            nods through a window towards Nyssa and the others.

                                WHISTLER
                      You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are
                      getting a mite too cozy for my taste.

                                BLADE
                      I wouldn't worry about it.

            Blade moves to walk away, but Whistler stops him.

                                WHISTLER
                      I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're
                      starting to get confused as to which
                      side of the line you're standing on.

                                BLADE
                      Pretty hollow words coming from a man
                      who spent the last year running with the
                      enemy.

                                WHISTLER
                      What the hell is that supposed to mean?

                                BLADE
                      It means I'm starting to wonder if the
                      vampires still have their hooks in you.
                      You've been acting strange ever since I
                      gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to
                      anger --
                          (beat)
                      You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those
                      vampires knew our defense system
                      backwards and forwards.  Where'd they
                      get their intel?

            Whistler steps closer, his voice dropping to a lethal,
            whisper.

                                WHISTLER
                      I'm compromised?!  Me?!  I'm not the one
                      playing stink-finger with Vampirella out
                      there!

            Blade stares back at Whistler, calm as a viper.

                                BLADE
                      You're out of line, old man.

            The two comrades in arms stare each other down.  Then,
            finally, Whistler backs away.

                                WHISTLER
                          (quietly)
                      We'll see.

            Whistler turns and strides exits.  We HOLD ON Blade, torn,
            conflicted, watching Whistler retreat.

            EXT. BLADE'S WAREHOUSE/SHIPYARD - NIGHT

            We SEE a FIGURE emerge from the shadows -- CHUPA.

            EXT. CITY SLUM - NIGHT

            Chupa walks the night, scanning shadows.

            CHUPA'S POV (VAMPIRE VISION)

            Like heat-vision, only tinged with crimson.  There are DRUG
            DEALERS and bottom feeding WHORES trolling for tricks out
            here, BEATING HEARTS and BRANCHING ARTERIES highlighted on
            their ghostly silhouettes.

            Chupa moves to the mouth of an alley, nodding to a DEALER.

                                DEALER
                      Lookin' to get hooked up?

                                CHUPA
                      What you got?

            As the dealer glances around to see if anyone's watching --

                                DEALER
                      Horse, Hawaiian ice.  Whatever you want.

            Chupa sniffs the air, glancing at a pulsating vein on the
            dealer's neck, and smiles.

                                CHUPA
                      Whatever, huh?  Well I'm all off the
                      hook on that bitch.

            Chupa steps into the alley with the dealer.

                                DEALER
                      So what's it gonna be?

                                CHUPA
                      Fear.

            Chupa is at the dealer's throat before he can finish,
            flashing his fangs, shoving him backwards.  Then --

                                CHUPA (CONT'D)
                      I like a little adrenaline chaser.

            WHAP!  A HAND

            Grabs a fistful of Chupa's hair, jerking his head back.  It's
            Blade.  He yanks Chupa off the dealer.

                                BLADE
                      What do you think you're doing?

                                CHUPA
                      Trying to feed, puto baboso!

            The dealer takes off as Blade swings Chupa around.  They
            exchange a couple of blows, then Blade knees him in the
            balls, twisting him around by his arm, dislocating it.

            Blade releases Chupa, shoving him forward.  Chupa's broken
            arm dangles awkwardly.  Furious, Chupa reaches for his .45
            with his good hand -- only to hear the CLICK of another gun
            as it's placed against the back of his head.

            ANGLE ON NYSSA

            Standing behind him, looking grim and determined.

                                NYSSA
                      Do it and you die.
                          (Chupa considers options)
                      You heard Asad.  Until this is over,
                      these people are our allies.

                                CHUPA
                      Oh I haven't forgotten about Asad.  I'm
                      just wondering if you have.

            Chupa re-holsters his gun, then jams his dislocated arm up
            against the wall and resets it.  He backs away.  Nyssa
            watches him leave, looks to Blade.

                                NYSSA
                      He's right about one thing.  We do have
                      to survive.

                                BLADE
                      You don't have to hunt to do it.

                                NYSSA
                      Really?  What are we supposed to do,
                      then?  Starve ourselves because we fee
                      on others in order to live?  What about
                      that scumbag you just let off the hook?
                      A nothing.  A drug-dealer.  How do you
                      justify saving people like that?

            Blade doesn't answer, just moves away.  She follows.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      You know the Thirst better than any of
                      us.  You're barely managing to tread
                      water yourself.  Living in a constant
                      state of pain, having to shoot up that
                      serum of yours.  That's not what I call
                      surviving, Blade.

            Off Blade's stony expression we --

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

            The back of the workshop.  Scud takes a hit of weed then
            resumes working on one of the UV entry lights -- it's been
            taken half-apart and tweaked-out with cables and a crystal
            prism.  Whistler is there too, loading magazines.

                                WHISTLER
                          (observing Scud)
                      The hell are you fiddling with there?

                                SCUD
                          (proud, succinct)
                      Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the
                      collimated beam, wanna concentrate the
                      light, get something like a UV laser
                      going.

                                WHISTLER
                          (shaking his head)
                      You're wasting your time, already been
                      tried.

                                SCUD
                      Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster
                      working on it, did you?

                                WHISTLER
                          (testy)
                      Nope.  Back then we did not.

                                SCUD
                          (unfazed)
                      So how long have you known Blade,
                      anyway?

                                WHISTLER
                      Going on twenty years now.

                                SCUD
                      Blade doesn't talk about the old days
                      much.

                                WHISTLER
                      Blade doesn't talk about anything much.
                          (nodding to Scud)
                      What about you, though?

            Scud pulls up his T-shirt.  His abdomen is covered in a
            network of horrific scars.  Like something you'd see on the
            survivor of a shark attack.

                                WHISTLER (CONT'D)
                      Pretty.

                                SCUD
                      I was backpacking.  Hooked up with these
                      two chicks who were off to see the
                      Burning Man festival.  We were gonna
                      take "E", have ourselves a little
                      freeball out in the desert.  You know
                      the riff, "Dear Penthouse, I never
                      thought this would happen to me, but --"

            Scud takes a Phillip and adjust some screws on the laser.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      Anyway, halfway through our Three's
                      Company marathon, Janet and Chrissy
                      started taking chunks out of me.  Woulda
                      died too if Blade hadn't shown up and
                      staked those mamacitas a new honeyhole.
                          (shrugging)
                      Things kinda fell in place after that.

            Scud jiggles the necklace of fangs around his neck.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      Took myself a few souvenirs, though.

            Scud triggers the modified entry light.  The light PULSES
            like a series of flash-bulbs going off, creating a
            stroboscopic effect as a wafer-thin, super-concentrated BLUE
            BEAM OF LIGHT slices through the shadows.  Scud looks to
            Whistler and smiles.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      Mmm-mmm.  Poppa's got a brand new bag.

            EXT. CITYSCAPE - PRE-DAWN

            Beyond the shadowed skyline of monolithic buildings, the
            night is beginning to give way to dawn.

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - PRE-DAWN

            Scud stands before the others.  He looks bleary-eyed but
            pleased with the night's work.  The fruit of their efforts
            are laid on a work table before them -- a half-dozen UV laser
            guns, along with a collection of UV flashbang grenades and a
            much bigger explosive device secured into a backpack carrier.

            Blade picks up one of the UV lasers.  He sights down the
            length of it.  Scud takes a power pack and slaps into the
            base of Blade's gun.

                                SCUD
                      The powerpacks have a limited charge,
                      maybe ten minutes of continuous use at
                      most.

            Nyssa gestures to the flashbang grenades.

                                NYSSA
                      What are these?

                                SCUD
                      UV flashbang grenades with plug-in
                      phosphor sticks --
                          (pointing to a backpack
                           carrier)
                      This is for the grand finale.  Wired
                      together a couple-dozen of those
                      puppies.  But I'd be careful where you
                      pop your load.  Might end up frying
                      yourselves in the process.

                                WHISTLER
                      What about you?  You're not coming?

                                SCUD
                      After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover,
                      not a fighter.

            Asad looks to Blade.

                                ASAD
                      What good is all this firepower if we
                      don't know where they're hiding?

                                BLADE
                      We won't need to.  They'll come to us.

                                REINHARDT
                      How?

            Blade looks to Nyssa, who tosses Reinhardt an aerosol
            cannister.  He sprays a little, then wrinkles his nose in
            disgust, gagging.

                                REINHARDT (CONT'D)
                      This is fucking foul!

                                NYSSA
                      They're pheromones.  I infused them from
                      that Reaper's adrenal glands.  All
                      mammals use them to mark their
                      territory.  Even vampires.

                                CHUPA
                      Fuck that!  I'm not spraying some gash
                      hound's nut-juice on me!

                                NYSSA
                      Trust me, the Reapers will key to it.
                      If we use this, we'll draw them out.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - DRAINAGE AREA - DAWN

            Beneath the ballroom gratings.  A high-angle shot looking
            down at the octagonal iron culvert around which Blade,
            Whistler, and the remainder of the Bloodpack are gathered.
            The mechanized, sectional portions of the culvert covering
            are GRINDING UPWARD, flowering open and apart like some blood
            and rust-encrusted gateway to Hell.

            INT. SEWER/OUTFLOW AREA - DAWN

            One by one, the group of hunters descend into the
            claustrophobic chamber.  Verlaine is lugs the UV bomb on her
            back.  Blade leads them to the clawed-open portion of the
            brick wall, then on through.

            INT. SEWER LINE - CONTINUOUS

            Blade leads the group along a grime-encrusted line which
            slopes gradually downward, sloshing through ankle-deep run
            off water collected from the city above them.  Tendrils of
            mist drift about, cutting their field of vision even further.
            Here and there, thin SHAFTS of SUNLIGHT cut down through
            cracks in the street above, requiring the vampires to
            cautiously circumvent them.

            They reach a four-way intersection of tunnels.  Blade pauses.

                                BLADE
                      Time for Nyssa's pheromones.

            Blade opens a statchel.  Inside are a dozen distinctive
            aluminum atomizers.  He hands them out to the others.
            Whistler triggers a can, spraying a thin mist over his face,
            wrinkling his noses in disgust.

                                WHISTLER
                      Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.

                                BLADE
                      We'll split into three units.  First
                      team that makes contact wins the prize.
                      Try to maintain radio silence from here
                      on out.

            Blade points to Chupa and Whistler, indicating the Eastern
            tunnel.  They head off.  Next, Blade directs Nyssa, Asad,
            Snowman, and Verlaine down the Western tunnel.  Blade nods to
            Reinhardt and starts down the Northern branch.

            INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY

            It's darker here, no shafts of sunlight slicing down from
            above.  Whistler turns on his UV entry light.  Chupa reaches
            out with his hand, partially blocking the beam.

                                CHUPA
                      Turn it off.

            As the shifting patterns of light and shadow play across
            Chupa's face we SEE his pupils contract and dilate
            unnaturally large in response.

                                CHUPA (CONT'D)
                      We want to attract them, not scare them
                      off.

                                WHISTLER
                      Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark.
                      What am I supposed to do?

            Chupa tosses Whistler a pair of night-vision goggles.

                                CHUPA
                      Bifocals, grandpa.  And try to keep up.

            Chupa heads into the darkness, moving with uncanny speed.

            INT. TUNNELS - VARIOUS

            We intercut between the three teams now, back and forth as
            they progress deeper into the city's bowels.

            INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Blade and Reinhardt trudge along.  The tunnel slopes inward,
            forming a V-shaped channel where a trickle of water flows.
            Blade notices SOMETHING bobbing in the water.  He nudges it
            with his foot and knocks it free.  It's a broken HUMAN TIBIA
            which twirls around, then flows past their legs.

            A few steps later on, Reinhardt notices SOMETHING ELSE.  He
            stoops into waist-deep water, picking up what he thinks is an
            isolated HUMAN RIB -- but ends up snagging a tangled mass of
            hair, mud, and bones.

            INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Whistler and Chupa move side by side.  Chupa is anxious, eyes
            darting about.  Occasionally, they come upon a transection
            with smaller conduits leading off to the right and the left.
            Then they reach a stooped, narrower tunnel and have to move
            single file.

            Suddenly, a BLAST of LIGHT and THUNDEROUS SOUND explodes
            above them.  They look up --

                                WHISTLER
                          (startled)
                      Shit!

            A subway TRAIN rockets by on a track just above them,
            pummeling them with soot and dust.

            Unseen by them, briefly illuminated by the flashing subway
            lights we see three Reaper faces, pale and haunting, hanging
            upside down.

            INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Blade and Reinhardt reach a dead-end where the tunnel has
            caved in.  A BERM OF HUMAN BONES slopes upward from the water
            -- skulls and ribs, vertebrae, tibias, metatarsi.  Blade
            kneels, inspecting them.  There are gnaw marks on them.

                                BLADE
                      Must be hundreds of these skeletons
                      here.

                                REINHARDT
                      So?

                                BLADE
                      So I think you people may have
                      underestimated how many Reapers you're
                      dealing with.

            INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY

            As Nyssa, Snowman, Verlaine, and Asad cautiously move
            forward, Nyssa GASPS, startled by --

            HALF A DOZEN REAPERS laying on the tunnel floor before them
            in a stagnant pool of sewage water.  Dead.

            INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Back with Whistler and Chupa, Whistler is in the lead.

                                CHUPA (O.S.)
                      Hey,hillbilly.

            As Whistler turns around, Chupa SLAMS Whistler in the side of
            the head, swiping his night-vision goggles off.  As Whistler
            vainly searches for his goggles.

                                WHISTLER
                      What the fuck you doing?

                                CHUPA
                      Ain't nobody here but you and me,
                      chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a
                      time as any to settle up.

            Chupa moves stealthily in darkness, violently KICKING the
            older man.  Whistler tries to crawl away, then reaches for
            his pheromone atomizer and locks it in the "on-position".  As
            Chupa continues to lay into Whistler we SEE the atomizer roll
            away, dispensing its contents.

            INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Blade and Reinhardt by the berm of human bones.

                                NYSSA (O.S.)
                          (filtered; over comm.)
                      Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're
                      all dead.

                                BLADE
                      Fry 'em.

            INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Nyssa nods to Asad and Verlaine.  They train their UV lasers
            on the area where the Reaper corpses were -- but the Reaper
            bodies are gone.  And so is Snowman for that matter.

                                ASAD
                      What?  Where did they go?

                                VERLAINE
                      Screw that, where did Snowman go?

            Just then, we hear a NOISE from above.  Nyssa and the others
            whip their UV lasers in that direction.

                                NYSSA
                      Jesus, they were playing possum!

            THEIR POV

            A HORDE OF REAPERS skitter away from the lights.

            INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY

            CLOSE ON the pheromone atomizer, the spray petering out.
            Whistler is beat to shit, bleeding from his mouth.  Chupa
            reaches for his handgun, whipping it out just as --

            Whistler's hands brush the damaged night vision goggles.  He
            swings them upward.

            WHISTLER'S POV (THROUGH GOGGLES)

            Whistler has just enough time to register Chupa, the handgun
            pointed directly at him/us before noticing SOMETHING ELSE
            just beyond Chupa.

            A DOZEN REAPERS

            Clinging to the ceiling above.  They drop down on Chupa like
            a pack of rabid dogs, literally tearing him in half.

            INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY (20 YEARS AGO)

            Hearing GUNFIRE and SCREAMS, Blade charges back in Whistler's
            direction as --

            THE BERM OF HUMAN BONES

            EXPLODE apart.  Reapers CHARGE towards them, hitting Blade in
            the chest, driving him backwards.  As Blade falls, his entry
            light swings upward, illuminating.

            ANOTHER REAPER

            Drops down atop Reinhardt, knocking his UV gun into the
            water.  We SEE even MORE REAPERS converging in on them from
            the side tunnels in a cacophony of SHADOW and NOISE.

            INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY (20 YEARS AGO)

            Verlaine, Nyssa and Asad are FIRING their UV lasers.  The
            pumping flashes of their guns throw crazy shadows in every
            direction.  Adding to the unbridled chaos of strobing light
            and NOISE.  More and more Reapers are swarming towards them,
            moving towards us at an unearthly clip!  Nyssa and her
            compatriots retreat, running for their lives.

            A REAPER

            Leaps, landing on Verlaine's back.  It grabs her head and
            deftly SNAPS her spine in half with a sickening CRUNCH!

            INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY (20 YEARS AGO)

            Whistler panics, backing away from the SOUNDS of the reapers
            slaughtering Chupa.  He finds his gun, flicks on the UV entry
            light --

            And just like that, the attacking reapers have vanished.
            Whistler whirls about, sweeping the UV beam around, but all
            he SEES is darkness.

            Then, a bone-chilling WHISPER cuts through the shadows.

                                NOMAK (O.S.)
                      Whistler.

            Whistler spins.  NOMAK RIGHT BEHIND HIM.  As Whistler whips
            the UV gun up, Nomak stops it.  The beam is mere millimeters
            from the Reaper's face -- close enough to illuminate his
            nightmarish features, but not close enough to burn.

                                NOMAK (CONT'D)
                      If you survive this, tell your master.
                      My end is my beginning.

            In an eyeblink, Nomak is gone.  Whistler spins, shining the
            UV this way and that.  Alone in the dark.

            INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Blade FIRES his UV into a Reaper's torso.  As the Reaper
            incinerates, Blade spins, FIRING at a second Reaper --

            ON REINHARDT

            Firing his non-UV weapon.  Two Reapers are closing in on him.

                                BLADE
                      Take mine!

            Blade throws Reinhardt his UV laser and unsheathes his sword.
            Reinhardt sweeps the lethal beam over the two reapers.

            Blade retreats back into the water, calm, letting the
            creatures comes to him.  As they close in on him, he slips
            the tip of the sword beneath the surface of the water,
            waiting --

            As one, the Reapers converge on Blade.  He swings his sword
            up from the water, hacking away at them, using their own
            momentum against them.

            Reinhardt considers his options.  He decides to run for it --

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Reinhardt!

            Reinhardt races away, abandoning Blade.  Blade reaches for
            one of the UV flashbangs clipped to his harness.  He pulls
            the pin with his teeth and shoves it into an on-rushing
            Reaper's mouth as --

            Reinhardt slips on the wet concrete and --

            BANG!  Searing LIGHT fills the tunnel, instantly incinerating
            the Reaper.

            Reinhardt's unprotected face CATCHES FIRE.   He SCREAMS,
            falling back into the water, trying to douse the flames.
            ANOTHER REAPER lands atop him, dragging him down as --

            INT. NORTHERN AND WESTERN TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

            We hear GUNFIRE and SCREAMS coming from all directions.
            Blade retreats.  A reaper, fully ON FIRE from the UV
            explosion, races towards him.  As Blade decapitates it:

                                BLADE
                          (shouting into radio)
                      Re-group!  Re-group!

            Asad and Nyssa also retreat.  Nyssa pulls a pin on a UV
            flashbang, throws it behind her.  BA-BANG!  UV light fills
            the tunnels and --

            INT. SEWER LINE - FOUR-WAY INTERSECTION - DAY

            Blade, Nyssa, Whistler and Asad abruptly find themselves back
            in the four-way juncture, knee-deep in water.  They quickly
            regroup, out of breath, riding adrenaline highs.

                                NYSSA
                      Where's Chupa?

                                WHISTLER
                      Forget him, he's chunk-style.

                                ASAD
                      Same with Snowman and Verlaine.

                                WHISTLER
                      Guess that perfume of yours did the
                      trick after all?

                                BLADE
                          (quietly)
                      A little too well, I'd say.

            The others turn to look in Blade's direction.

            DOZENS OF RED EYES

            are staring out at them from the darkness of the Eastern
            Tunnel.  Then we hear a HISSING SOUND coming from the
            opposite direction.  Blade and the others spin around --

            MORE RED-EYED REAPERS

            are closing in on them from the West.  AND THE NORTH.  AND
            THE SOUTH!  There must be forty of them in all.

                                WHISTLER
                      Perfect.  We got the whole fucking
                      Partridge family here.

            They retreat until they are back to back, each one of them
            covering their respective tunnel opening.

            A REAPER

            Lunges at them from the North.  Asad triggers his UV laser,
            scorching the creature.  It HOWLS and slinks backwards.

            TWO MORE REAPERS

            Attack from the East and the West.  Blade and Nyssa respond
            in kind, burning their assailants in mid-air.  But even as
            they fire, their UV beams weaken, the flashes of light coming
            from their barrels pulsing less frequently.

                                WHISTLER (CONT'D)
                      Unless anybody has any bright ideas, I'd
                      say we're about half a battery away from
                      a reaper gang-bang.

            The foursome are managing to keep the Reapers at bay, but
            just barely.  Blade motions to Nyssa.

                                BLADE
                      Give me the rest of the pheromones.

            Nyssa reaches inside her harness, handing Blade the remaining
            atomizers.  He crushes them in his fist, letting the fluid
            within spill over his face and chest.

                                ASAD
                      What are you doing?

            The Reapers become even more agitated, HISSING loudly,
            pressing in on them closer and closer.  Blade nods his head
            back down the Western tunnel.

                                BLADE
                      Verlaine's body is back there somewhere
                      with the UV bomb.  If you train your
                      guns in that direction, you'll drive an
                      opening in their ranks.  I'll run for
                      it.  When the Reapers come after me, you
                      make a break for it the other way.

            Asad studies Blade with newfound respect.

                                ASAD
                      You won't make it.

                                BLADE
                          (hefting his UV gun)
                      Then I'll die trying, won't I?

                                NYSSA
                      Blade.

                                BLADE
                      Save it.  I don't want to hear your
                      words.  Let's do this NOW!!!

            The foursome spin, FIRING their UV lasers down the Western
            tunnel.  The Reapers SHRIEK, falling to either side, their
            bodies burning --

            Blade CHARGES FORWARD, firing his dying UV laser.  As he
            makes it past the line of Reapers, they start after him,
            driven into a frenzy by the pheromones.  The Reapers in the
            Northern and Eastern tunnels flood after Blade too, leaving --

            Nyssa, Whistler and Asad to contend with the Reapers in the
            Southern tunnel.  They discharge their weapons, shouldering
            Reapers aside, making a mad dash for freedom.

            INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Blade runs, splashing and stumbling through the water, just a
            hair's breadth ahead of the HOWLING Reaper horde.  Suddenly,
            the tunnel widens out into a larger chamber.

            INT. SOUTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Whistler and the others FIRE BACK at the small group of
            Reapers which have followed them, rather than Blade.

            ON WHISTLER

            cut off from Nyssa and Asad.  He spots a maintenance ladder
            and runs for it, dragging himself up the rungs.  A Reaper
            leaps up the ladder after him --

            Whistler reaches the top of the ladder, but his exit is
            blocked by a manhole cover!  It's STUCK!  Whistler swings up
            his shotgun, FIRING into the cover.

            The cover is BLOWN UPWARDS, sending a shaft of blinding
            sunlight down on the Reaper below him.  As the Reaper
            incinerates, Whistler scurries upwards to safety.

            INT. WESTERN TUNNEL/CHAMBER - DAY

            Blade reaches Verlaine's half-submerged body.  He tears the
            backpack carrier off the dead vampire and hefts it onto his
            shoulder, charging up an elevated concrete embankment as --

            INT. SOUTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Nyssa and Asad find themselves cornered.  Their UV lasers are
            shot.  The Reapers are closing in and we're --


            INT. WESTERN TUNNEL/CHAMBER - DAY

            Back with Blade, the Reapers overrunning him.  They pile atop
            one another in a frenzied effort to get to him.  Dozens and
            dozens of them.  And still Blade struggles upward, lifting
            the UV cluster bomb triumphantly above his head, triggering
            the device.

            The world goes white.

            No explosions.  Just BLINDING, PURIFYING LIGHT leaving us
            with a retina-burn image of Blade's silhouette surrounded by
            Reapers.  In that brief instant, the Reapers are frozen,
            revealed as WRAITH-LIKE X-RAY IMAGES of bone and muscle.

            INT. SOUTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

            A BLAST-WAVE of LIGHT fills the tunnel, chasing its way
            towards Nyssa and Asad, overtaking the Reapers before them.
            Asad throws himself at Nyssa, knocking her into the knee-deep
            water, shielding her body with his own.

            BENEATH THE WATER

            Asad still burns, flaring up and disintegrating from the
            surface on downward like a piece of liquid-drenched
            magnesium, bubbles streaming from his writing body.

            INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Darkness, then patterns of subtle shadow and light as our
            vision slowly returns.  FWASH!  Blade strikes a FLARE.  In
            the sputtering aureole, the aftermath is slowly revealed.

            Blade crouches, unscathed, as if he were standing ground zero
            in the aftermath of Hiroshima.  Scores of Reaper ash-outlines
            radiate out from him, some of them flash-seared into the
            surrounding brickwork walls like permanent shadows.

            INT. SOUTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

            Blade slowly makes his way down the tunnel, using the
            sputtering flare to guide him.  As before, he sees nothing
            but Reaper ash outlines.  But then, Blade sees --

            NYSSA

            Bleeding and horribly burned despite Asad's sacrifice.  Blade
            crouches, scooping her up into his arms.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. HOSPITAL - INNER-CITY TRAUMA WARD - DAY

            BANG!  Blade kicks open a pair of doors, hurrying Nyssa
            inside.  He's carrying her limp form in his arms, having
            wrapped her in a blanket.  Blade himself looks like hell
            warmed over -- covered in blood, ash, and grime.

            He rushes her towards the ER, navigating through a maze of
            PATIENTS and VISITORS.  An ER NURSE approaches.

                                ER NURSE
                      Sir, you can't just --

            WHAM!  Blade shoulders the ER NURSE aside, barreling into the
            triage where bewildered DOCTORS and ORDERLIES wait.

                                DOCTOR
                      What?!

                                BLADE
                      She needs a hypertransfusion.  NOW!

            Blade sets Nyssa down on an operating table, pulling off the
            blanket.  She's badly burned and she's lost an enormous
            amount of blood.  As we watch, she GROANS, revealing her
            fangs.

                                DOCTOR
                          (aghast)
                      God in Heaven.

            Just then, a POLICEMAN enters, gun drawn.

                                POLICEMAN
                      Alright, buddy, step away if --

            WHAP!  Blade slaps the cop's gun away and KICKS him in the
            chest.  The cop flies backwards, SLAMS into a bank of
            equipment, falls.  A NURSE SCREAMS.  In a near blur, Blade
            has his MACH out and pressed against the Doctor's forehead.

                                BLADE
                      Do you want to die?

                                DOCTOR
                      Not particularly.

                                BLADE
                          (holstering his MACH)
                      Then get your fucking team in gear.

            Blade unsheathes his sword, deftly drawing the edge across
            his wrist, opening a vein.  He cradles Nyssa's head, pulling
            her mouth to the wound on his wrist.  And as she starts to
            feed we pull back and --

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. THE CITY - DUSK

            The sun dips towards the horizon.  The shadows of the urban
            landscape lengthen and darken in time-lapse.

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - SHOWERS - DUSK

            Blade stands beneath the showerhead, turning his face up into
            the scalding spray, rinsing the blood from his chiseled
            physique.  Crimson water circles the drain.

            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BLADE'S SLEEPING AREA - DUSK

            Nyssa now rests on a cot.  Peaceful, the color having
            somewhat returned to her features.  After a moment, her eyes
            flutter open and she takes in her surroundings.  She is in
            Blade's austere bedroom -- there are tatami mats, a basin for
            water, a well-thumbed volume of Zen koans.

            A SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT

            cuts through an icy window pane above, angling down near
            Nyssa's cot.  Dust motes swirl about it.

            Nyssa focuses on it.  Longingly.  Then she raises her arm and
            reaches towards it.  Closer, closer -- just barely extending
            her hand into the light.  Her fingertips blacken and smoke,
            yet Nyssa endures the pain for another moment.  Finally, she
            withdraws her hand, inspecting the damage -- then notices
            Blade watching her from the doorway.

                                NYSSA
                      Each day is a little life.

                                BLADE
                      What?

                                NYSSA
                      "Each day is a little life.  Every
                      waking and rising a little birth, every
                      fresh morning a little youth, every
                      going to rest and sleep a little death."

            She looks back to the sunlight, wistful, sits herself up.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      Anyone else make it?

                                BLADE
                      I don't think so.

            Blade enters, kneeling by the edge of the cot, inspecting her
            wounds.  Studiously avoiding her gaze.

                                NYSSA
                      Thank you.

                                BLADE
                      For what?

                                NYSSA
                      It would've been easy for you to let me
                      die back there today, but you didn't.

                                BLADE
                          (shrugging)
                      I wouldn't read too much into it.

            She reaches for his face.  Blade stops her hand.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      You don't want to go there.

                                NYSSA
                      Why?

                                BLADE
                      Because one of us is going to kill the
                      other before this ends.

                                NYSSA
                      It doesn't have to be like that.  We
                      don't have to be enemies.

                                BLADE
                      Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as
                      long as the hunt was still on.  Now that
                      it's over, all bets are off.

                                NYSSA
                          (pointedly)
                      If that's true, then why'd you save me?

            Blade stands now, moving to the ice-covered window, troubled
            by the question.  Damned if he knows the answer.  After a
            beat, Nyssa rises too, keeping to the shadows.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      Why do you hate us so much?

                                BLADE
                      I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I
                      do.  It's in my blood.

                                NYSSA
                      Well it's in mine, too.  I'm a
                      pureblood.  I wasn't turned.  I was born
                      this way.  Just like you.  Am I evil
                      because I want to survive?
                          (beat)
                      What about a wolf?  What about any
                      predator?

            Nyssa pursues Blade, circling around in front of him so he
            has to face her again.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      The only difference between you and me
                      is that I made peace with who I was a
                      long time ago.  I'm not ashamed of what
                      I am.
                          (beat)
                      You haven't been hunting us all these
                      years.  You've been hunting yourself.

            Blade moves away.  She reaches for his shoulder.  He whirls
            on her, angry, traps her hand.  She tires to pull it free but
            he grips her wrist tightly, pulling her closer --

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      You're hurting me.

                                BLADE
                      Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what
                      you said?

            And closer, their faces are just inches apart now --

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Reminds you you're alive?

            And Blade kisses her, hungrily.  Nyssa responds in kind.  Her
            head drops low, her mouth finding the cords of his neck --
            sucking at his flesh, then sinking her teeth in deep and --

            WHAM!  Blade clamps a hand around her throat, slamming her
            head back.  A droplet of blood dribbles from her lips as she
            lets loose a breathless shudder.  She's in the ecstatic
            throes of the Thirst now, all reason gone.

            Blade reaches his other hand to her shirt, ripping it open as
            he runs his fingers across her breasts, then over her exposed
            rib cage.  He turns her around, forcing her against the wall,
            sinking his own fangs into the back of her neck.  She groans
            as we --

                                                                 CUT TO:

            THE TWO OF THEM

            Naked on the tatami mats upon which Blade sleeps.  Skin
            beaded with sweat.  Breath steaming in the chill air.  He's
            atop her, moving inside her with measured thrusts.

            Nyssa's limbs are wrapped around him.  She claws at the
            expanse of his back with her fingernails.  Her mouth is
            locked on Blade's throat, then his is locked on hers.
            Together they drink, leeching blood from one another.

            PULLING BACK AGAIN

            Nyssa clutching greedily at Blade like she never wants to let
            go.  Her soul is gone -- transported to that place we drift
            to when the euphoria overtake us and we're somehow able to
            transcend the horror of our fleeting lives.

            Finally, Nyssa GASPS, climaxing as she retracts her fangs
            from Blade.  Her head rolls to the side as her pupil --
            focused on nothing short of eternity -- dilate unnaturally
            large.

            LATER

            Blade and Nyssa lie in each other's arms, awash in moonlight,
            blissfully dead to the world until --

            SOMETHING MAKES BLADE STIR

            He sits up, listening.  Nyssa stirs beside him.  She moves to
            speak but Blade holds up a hand, silencing her.  Together,
            they slowly creep towards a nearby window where --

            JARED NOMAK'S NIGHTMARE FACE

            is pressed up against the icy glass, staring back at them!
            Nyssa GASPS.  Blade draws back with a start.  But in the time
            it takes to blink, Nomak is gone.  Just then, we hear a
            NOISE.  Scud appears in a doorway, groggy.

                                SCUD
                      What's going on?

                                BLADE
                      He was here.  Watching us.

                                SCUD
                      Nomak?

                                BLADE
                      He wants us to know he's hunting us now.

            MOMENTS LATER

            Blade is at the computer workstation.  He activates the
            footage of Nomak he was viewing earlier.  He fast-forwards to
            a specific moment, then plays it back at normal speed.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Nomak said something to me before he
                      disappeared the first time --

            Blade points to the screen, saying the words as Nomak
            silently mouths them.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  At first I
                      thought he might've been using one of
                      the vampire dialects.  But it turns out,
                      it's Greek.  Do you know what it means?

            Nyssa shakes her head.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      It means "bloodbrother."

                                NYSSA
                      I don't understand.

                                WHISTLER (O.S.)
                      Well maybe I do.

            Blade spins, his MACH pistol up and ready to fire.  Whistler
            sits on the opposite side of the room, watching them as he
            smokes.

                                WHISTLER (CONT'D)
                          (to Scud)
                      Your security's for shit, kid.

                                BLADE
                      Where the hell have you been?

                                WHISTLER
                      Just out connecting a few dots.

            Whistler rises from his chair.  He flicks his cigarette butt
            into the shadows and fixes Blade with a heavy stares.

                                WHISTLER (CONT'D)
                      Bangin' some vampire chick.  Kind of a
                      faux pas in our line of work, wouldn't
                      you say?  Hope you double bagged it, at
                      least.

            Blade is still guarded, not yet ready to lower his MACH.

                                BLADE
                      What's your problem, Whistler?

                                WHISTLER
                      Why don't you ask your girlfriend?

            Blade looks to Nyssa, but she seems equally perplexed.

                                WHISTLER (CONT'D)
                      I did some checking on that Carter
                      Stevens character.  That familiar of
                      theirs who claimed he was with the NIH?
                      Turns out he used to work for them, but
                      he doesn't anymore.

                                BLADE
                      Then who does he work for?

            Whistler gives Nyssa a rueful stare, then tosses Blade a
            research folder.  On the cover is the same red, double-helix
            logo we saw at Damaskinos' facility.

                                WHISTLER
                      Some biotech outfit called Caliban
                      Industries.  They've been lying to us
                      since day one.  This Nomak fucker didn't
                      evolve.  He was designed.

            Nyssa look to Blade, imploring.

                                NYSSA
                      I don't know what he's talking about.

                                WHISTLER
                      You expect us to believe that?
                          (to Blade)
                      Who you going to trust, Blade?  Me or
                      her?

            EXT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - NIGHT

            A high-tech, heavily guarded industrial complex nestled
            within an expanse of unassuming wooded acreage overlooking
            the ocean.

            INT. DAMASKINOS' LAIR - NIGHT

            Carter Stevens shuts down his computer workstation, then
            moves to the heavy oak door, glancing at a medical chart as
            he opens it.  When he looks up --

                                STEVENS
                      You?

            A fist PUNCHES Stevens in the face.

            BLADE

            Stands in the entry way.  Whistler is behind him, holding a
            gun to Nyssa.  Scud is there, too.

                                BLADE
                          (mobing in on Stevens)
                      Start talking, bitch.

                                STEVENS
                      I don't know what you --

            Blade spins Stevens around, shoving his face against a glass
            case, crushing the man's nose, spiderwebbing the glass.

                                BLADE
                      Nomak!  You created him!

            Blade clamps his fingers around Stevens' broken nose and
            twists it with a sickening CRUNCH.  Stevens SCREAMS, caving.

                                STEVENS
                      Ohgodohgodohgod...
                          (in agony)
                      Alright, alright.  Yes, we did...
                          (gasping)
                      PLEASE!  PLEASE!!!

            Blade releases him.  Stevens sinks to the floor, cradling his
            brutalized face.

                                BLADE
                      Keep talking, Stevens.  Tell me why.

                                STEVENS
                          (sputtering)
                      The Shadow Cabinet.  For decades they've
                      been trying to find a way to rid
                      themselves of their hereditary
                      weaknesses.  Viral epidemiology,
                      immunochemistry.  Recombinant DNA was
                      the next logical step.

                                NYSSA
                          (genuinely horrified)
                      No, that's not possible.  They wouldn't
                      keep something like this from me...

                                STEVENS
                      Your father didn't want you to know.
                          (haltingly)
                      Something went wrong.  The Reaper strain
                      was too aggressive.  Then Nomak escaped.

                                WHISTLER
                      And we're supposed to clean up your
                      mess.  Fucking perfect.

                                STEVENS
                          (defensive)
                      Look, the fact that Nomak was
                      artificially created didn't make the
                      threat any less urgent.  He was still
                      out there, spreading the Reaper virus.

            But Blade's not concerned about that now.  He's got something
            more pressing on his mind.

                                BLADE
                      The genetic material you spliced into
                      Nomak --
                          (beat; almost fearful)
                      Where did you get it?

                                DAMASKINOS (O.S.)
                      I should think that would be obvious at
                      this point.

            ANGLE ON DAMASKINOS

            Standing behind them.

                                DAMASKINOS (CONT'D)
                      We took the genetic material from you.

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - ELEVATED CORRIDOR - NIGHT

            Damaskinos leads them down a corridor.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      Jared Nomak is your genetic brother.
                      And I suppose if you follow that line of
                      reasoning to its logical conclusion,
                      then these are your offspring.

            Damaskinos reaches to a nearby control panel, pressing a
            button.  A pair of massive doors slide apart, revealing:

            THE EUGENICS CHAMBER

            We are in a vast, multitiered, temperature-controlled chamber
            -- equal parts 21st century medical facility and Hammer House
            of Horror.

            A network of catwalks look down upon the circular chamber,
            the center of which is dominated by a massive, steel cask,
            which is in turn ringed by a safety railing.  The operation
            looks not unlike a small-scale water purification plant, or
            perhaps a futuristic distillery.  Only in this instance, the
            liquid churning within the cask is HUMAN BLOOD.

            TINY EMBRYOS

            Each no bigger than a thumbnail, line the walls of the
            chamber, preserved in credit card sized cryo-cases.  There
            are thousands of them, resting atop one another in racks with
            stretch from the floor on upwards.

            As Damaskinos removes an embryo from the rack, we see ANOTHER
            EMBRYO behind it.  That cryo-case now slides forward with a
            WHIR, taking the place of the one which Damaskinos removed.
            Like some kind of perverse vending machine.  God knows how
            deep they're stacked.  If thousands are visible, there could
            be tens of thousands in total.

            Damaskinos holds the translucent cryo-case up to the light.
            The Embryo within shudders, its tiny heart beating.

                                DAMASKINOS (CONT'D)
                          (proudly)
                      A new breed, begotten from your own
                      flesh.  Immune to silver, even sunlight.
                          (stepping towards Blade)
                      The wolves have lain with the sheep long
                      enough.  No more compromises.  No more
                      deals.  Only closure.

            BOOM!  We hear the tread of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS approaching.  All
            eyes turn towards a side corridor.

            REINHARDT

            enters from the shadows, holding Scud's rail-gun.  Much of
            his face has been burnt away, leaving him with a ghastly
            death's head mask of blackened muscle and exposed bone.

                                REINHARDT
                      Put it back in park, Blade.

                                BLADE
                      Thought you were dead.

                                REINHARDT
                      Seems like there's a lot of that going
                      around these days.

            As Reinhardt aims the rail gun at Blade, a DOZEN VAMPIRE
            GUARDS appear on the catwalks above, also taking aim.

                                REINHARDT (CONT'D)
                      Six-thousand feet per second, isn't that
                      what Whistler said?  Let's see you dodge
                      this one --

            Blade does his level best, pulling his MACH, squeezing off a
            SHOT even as Reinhardt FIRES.  BA-BANG!  Blade is hit in the
            side, spun clear around.  His shot goes wild, hitting one of
            the Guards in the head, turning him to ash as Blade himself
            falls to the floor.

                                NYSSA
                      Blade!

            Blade GASPS in shock.  The rail-gun needles have ripped a
            brutal hole through the side of his chest-plate.  He clutches
            at his flank, trying to staunch the blood that's seeping
            between his fingers.  As he sits forward, we see MORE
            FLECHETTES have embedded in the wall behind him, having torn
            completely through him.

            Whistler steps forward.  One of the vampire sentries LASHES
            OUT, striking him in the face with the butt of his rifle.
            Whistler sinks to his knees, stunned.  The guard disarms him.

            ON BLADE

            Gritting his teeth against the pain.  He reaches inside his
            combat harness, pulling out the remote detonator for the
            explosive flechette in Reinhardt's skull.

                                BLADE
                      Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.

                                SCUD
                      You're wasting your time, Blade.  The
                      flechette's a dud.

            Scud crosses over to Reinhardt's side.  Whistler stares at
            him in disbelief.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      It was never supposed to explode.  All
                      it was supposed to do was make you feel
                      like you were in control.

            Blade's eyes darken with hatred.  Reinhardt laughs.

                                REINHARDT
                      Thought you had me on a short leash,
                      didn't you, chief?  Only it turns out,
                      you're the one that's been on the leash.

            Reinhardt digs his claws into his scalp and tugs the barbed
            flechette from his skull.  As he does so, Blade's remote
            detonator BEEPS to indicate it's being tempered with.
            Reinhardt finishes removing it and sighs contentedly.

                                REINHARDT (CONT'D)
                      That's better.

            Reinhardt tosses the fletchette to Scud, who grins, flipping
            down his lower lip to reveal a vampire glyph tattooed on it.

                                SCUD
                      See, I'm one of Damaskinos' familiars.

            Blade looks to Nyssa who averts her gaze.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      Yeah, your little cootchie knew.

                                WHISTLER
                      You little shit.  When did they get to
                      you?

                                SCUD
                      Back when Blade had me hunting down your
                      puckered old ass.  What's up with your
                      hair, anyway?  Fucking Willie Nelson
                      look-a-like?

            Scud punches Whistler in the face.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      Man, I so wanted to do that.

            Scud shakes his hand, which is smarting from the blow.  He
            looks to Blade now, angry.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      And you.  You never cared about me.  I
                      gave you everything.  All you cared
                      about was digging up the old fuck!  You
                      think they scoped out my security
                      system?
                          (chuckling)
                      I let them in.  Dude, I practically gave
                      'em the fucking keys.  I've been feeding
                      Damaskinos information the whole time.
                      Providing them with samples of your
                      genetic material -- helping them with
                      the Reaper program.  They're close,
                      Blade.  Right up against it.  Any day
                      now, they're all going to be Daywalkers.
                      And when that happens, well, let's just
                      say, I don't want to be on the losing
                      team.  You may be strong, you may be
                      fast, but in the end, you're just too
                      human, B.

            He pinches Blade's cheek.  Then he stands up.

                                SCUD (CONT'D)
                      So that's down and dirty.  Got anything
                      to say for yourself?

                                BLADE
                          (weak, but defiant)
                      Two things.  One, I was on to you the
                      moment they turned you.  And two --
                          (raising the detonator;
                           smiling)
                      I switched that dud of yours back with
                      the real one.

            Scud has a split-second of terrified, wide-eyed realization
            before Blade pushes the button and BOOM!  The flechette in
            Scud's hand EXPLODES, blowing his body apart, spraying those
            nearest him with blood.  Primarily Reinhardt.

                                REINHARDT
                      Son of a bitch!

            As the others react with varying degrees of surprise and
            horror, Reinhardt savagely KICKS Blade across the face.  He
            HITS Blade again and again, driving him down to the floor.
            Then he bends and tugs the sword from Blade's back-scabbard,
            preparing to cut his throat.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      Reinhardt!

            Reinhardt hesitates.  Nyssa takes a step towards Blade, but
            Damaskinos stops her.  Damaskinos gestures to his guards.
            They haul Blade up and drag him from the lab.  Reinhardt
            gestures to Whistler.

                                REINHARDT
                      What about him, then?
                          (crossing to Whistler,
                           handcuffing him)
                      Me and Hobo Kelly here have a little
                      unfinished business.

            Damaskinos waves dismissively.  Reinhardt takes Whistler
            away.

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

            Blade is dragged into a large autopsy room.  The vampire
            guards lay him on a steel autopsy table.  He struggles
            against them, but he's just too weak from loss of blood.
            Eventually they get him secured, clamping his wrists and
            ankles into steel manacles which are affixed to the table.

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

            CLOSE ON

            Blade's sword pommel as the booby-trap blades in the handle
            spring out.

                                REINHARDT (O.S.)
                      Nice.

            PULL BACK to reveal Reinhardt holding Blade's sword.  He
            gives it a few practiced swings, then runs his thumb along
            the blade.

                                REINHARDT (CONT'D)
                      How many vampires do you think he's
                      killed with this thing?

            ON WHISTLER

            Sitting in the corner, his hands cuffed behind his back.  We
            are in a security station filled with surveillance monitors
            offering various views of the laboratory complex.

                                WHISTLER
                      Not nearly enough, Fritz.

                                REINHARDT
                      Keep talking, warmblood.

            Reinhardt KICKS Whistler in the face.

                                REINHARDT (CONT'D)
                      When I'm through with you, you'll be
                      begging for a dirt nap.

            Whistler spits blood and glares up at Reinhardt.

                                WHISTLER
                      Been dead before.  Didn't much cotton to
                      it.  Tell you what, chicken shit.  You
                      do your worst.  We'll settle up after.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - EUGENICS CHAMBER - NIGHT

            Nyssa stands before the banks of vampire embryos, clearly
            troubled.  Damaskinos regards her.

                                DAMASKINOS
                          (vampire dialect; subtitled)
                      My child --

            Damaskinos moves in close to her, running a finger along her
            throat.  She doesn't acknowledge it.

                                DAMASKINOS (CONT'D)
                          (in English)
                      I would hate to think you were losing
                      your perspective.  Who do you think God
                      favors in the web?  The spider or the
                      fly?

                                NYSSA
                      Nomak said something to Blade in Greek.
                      Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did
                      he learn that?

                                DAMASKINOS
                      From his father, of course.

                                NYSSA
                          (horrified)
                      You experimented on your own, son?

            Damaskinos slowly tightens his hand around Nyssa's throat.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      I have fathered thousands of children in
                      centuries since I first walked this
                      earth.  Make no mistake, Nyssa.  Those
                      blood-ties mean nothing to me when
                      measured against the ascendancy of our
                      race.  Nothing.
                          (giving her an extra squeeze)
                      If you have any interest in remaining
                      alive, you would do well to remember
                      that.

            Damaskinos releases Nyssa.  She falls, GASPING for breath.
            He stares down at her with disdain, then exits.

                                                                 CUT TO:


            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

            Damaskinos enters, followed by Carter Stevens.  The guards
            remain posted at the main entrance of the room.  Damaskinos
            approaches, looking down at Blade.

            Blade stares back at him, still defiant, but fighting a
            losing battle.  He's dying and he knows it.  His breathing is
            shallow.  It's an effort just to keep his eyes open.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      With every century, humans become more
                      repulsive to me.  Once, you were souls
                      to be taken, corrupted.  But you have
                      disgraced yourselves to being nothing
                      more than blood and meat.

            TWO SURGEONS snap on surgical gloves.  Stevens is enjoying
            seeing Blade helpless.

                                STEVENS
                      We're going to harvest you, Blade.
                          (injecting fluid into Blade)
                      Bone marrow, organs, everything.  Your
                      tissue's too valuable to let go to
                      waste.

                                BLADE
                          (weakly)
                      Nomak is still out there.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      True, but thanks to you, we know his
                      weakness.  We can keep him contained.
                      It's just a matter of time before we
                      hunt him down.

                                BLADE
                      Too bad you're out of it.

            Damaskinos is amused by Blade's seeming lack of concern.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      And why is that?

                                BLADE
                      Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all
                      along.  To pay back the people who
                      created him.

                                STEVENS
                      You may be right.  Fortunately for us,
                      he has no idea where this facility is
                      located.

            Blade smiles, laughing tiredly.

                                BLADE
                      He does now.
                          (off their concerned looks)
                      He's been watching me since the tunnels.
                      Following me.  I led him right to you.

            Blade lifts up his hand, unfurling his previously closed
            fist.  There is a deep gash in his palms.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Just like a trail of bread crumbs.

            Damaskinos stares at Blade's hand, then looks to the floor.
            A line of blood droplets lead back to the doors through which
            he entered.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            A SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS

            Various hallways, the helipad outside Caliban industries,
            etc.  In rapid succession, we SEE more TRAILS OF BLOOD
            DROPLETS.  Then, just as quickly, we are back --

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

            With Damaskinos and company.  Suddenly, the lights above them
            flicker then go out.  As emergency lights kick on --

            BANG!  BANG!BANG!BANG!  All eyes turn towards a steel
            security door which is shuddering -- bulging and bending
            inwards as Nomak throws himself against it.

            Damaskinos looks to a bank of security monitors which are
            flickering back to life now.  We see Nomak's blurred
            silhouette from various angles, pummeling the door.  Then --

            RIPPPPPP!!!  A portion of the door is clawed open and we see
            a glimpse of Nomak's SNARLING FACE.

                                NOMAK
                          (roaring)
                      FATHER!

            Damaskinos' eyes widen in terror as he stumbles backwards,
            activating an ALARM.  He looks to the guards, SCREAMING.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      Stop him!

            Damaskinos runs for his life, rushing out the opposite door,
            quickly followed by Stevens as we --

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

            Nyssa hears the ALARMS and moves into a corridor lit by red,
            strobing emergency lights.  VAMPIRE GUARDS are rushing past.

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

            Reinhardt also hears the ALARMS.  He looks to the
            surveillance monitors where he SEES Nomak.

                                REINHARDT
                      Shit!

            Behind him, we see Whistler taking advantage of the
            distraction.  He folds his legs up under him, working his
            cuffed hands over his feet.  When Reinhardt spins back away
            from the security monitors --

            Whistler is GONE.  A steel grating in the floor lies half
            open.  The obvious means of exit.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

            As Nomak continues tearing down the autopsy door, BULLETS
            hammer into his back.  He turns, sees a DOZEN GUARDS FIRING
            at him, their gunfire chewing the shit out of the concrete
            walls around him.  Nomak staggers, but doesn't go down as
            CLEAR BLOOD sprays from the body hits.

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - MAINTENANCE CONDUIT - NIGHT

            Whistler shuffles forward through the narrow conduit on his
            elbows.  We hear footsteps.  Through the metal gratings
            above, we glimpse TWO FIGURES rushing past --

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT

            Damaskinos and Stevens round a corner, spilling into several
            GUARDS.  He shoves his fellow vampires aside.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      Get out of the way.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

            CLOSE ON a grate moving up from the floor.  Whistler emerges,
            rushing to Blade's side.  As he starts frantically releasing
            Blade from his bonds, he looks to the ravaged door --

            WHISTLER'S POV (THROUGH THE V-SHAPED GAP IN DOOR)

            Nomak savages the guards, flinging them into the air.  A
            guard's body hits the V-gap in the door and obscures our view
            as --

            Whistler redoubles his efforts, finally freeing Blade.  He
            helps him from the autopsy table.  Blade is sinking, starting
            to fade.  Whistler slaps his face, shaking him.

                                WHISTLER
                      Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!

                                BLADE
                          (weakly)
                      Blood...

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT

            Carnage.  A frazetta painting come to life.  Nomak atop dead
            guards, draining the last of his victims' blood.  He whips
            his face in our direction and ROARS, charging the door --

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

            WHAM!  The door gives way and Nomak enters.  To the right, he
            SEES Whistler and Blade exiting.  To the left, he SEES the
            security monitors.  Damaskinos and Stevens can be glimpsed in
            one of these monitors.

            Nomak moves to the left.

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - THIRD CORRIDOR - NIGHT

            Blade clutches his bleeding side, staggering down the
            corridor towards a door marked "Eugenics" with Whistler's
            help.  By all rights, Blade should be dead.  But he continues
            on, moving towards the door with determination.

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - 4-WAY INTERSECTION - NIGHT

            CLOSE ON a hand twisting a safety lever on the floor.  PULL
            BACK to reveal Stevens manually activating a series of
            hydraulic lock-down latches.

            CHINK!CHINK!CHINK!  The doors of the Eastern, Northern, and
            Western corridors are sealing, lock-down latches clamping
            down for extra security.  Even as the Western door seals, we
            glimpse Nomak rushing towards it with inhuman speed.

            ON STEVENS

            panicked, turning towards the open elevator cab where --

            DAMASKINOS

            is waiting.  But even as Stevens starts towards the elevator,
            Damaskinos dispassionately presses the "CLOSE DOOR" button.

                                STEVENS
                      What are you doing?!!

            Stevens rushes towards the closing elevator doors, but it's
            too late.  He pounds his fist against them.  Behind him, we
            hear a terrible RENDING OF METAL as the Western door gives.
            Stevens looks in that direction --

            In an eyeblink, Nomak is upon him, SLAMMING his hand over
            Stevens' face, crushing it.

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - ELEVATOR CAB - NIGHT

            As Damaskinos slides a security card through a reader and
            punches in a code, a thin SPRAY OF BLOOD jets across his pale
            forearm.  He looks to the elevator doors.  The spray of blood
            is coming through the vertical door seal.  The metal doors
            SHUDDER violently and then the cab begins to ascend.
            Damaskinos retreats to the far corner of the elevator,
            breathing a sigh of relief.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - EUGENICS CHAMBER - NIGHT

            WHOOSH!  A pneumatic door slides open.  Blade and Whistler
            enter.  They are on the second level now, up amongst the
            catwalks.  Below them is the churning cask of purified blood.
            They have almost reached the end of the catwalk when --

            REINHARDT AND HIS MEN

            converge on the lab from two directions at once.  Some of the
            vampires spill through the door on the second level with
            Reinhardt, while others enter on the ground floor.

                                REINHARDT
                      Stop him!!!

            As Reinhardt takes aim at Blade with the shotgun, the other
            vampires FIRE.  Whistler is HIT in the leg.  He goes down,
            CRYING OUT, then grips Blade's arm, shoving him onward --

                                WHISTLER
                      GO!!!

            ON BLADE

            gripping the guard rail for support, dragging himself along.
            Reinhardt fires.  A SHOTGUN BLAST hits Blade, grazing him but
            otherwise missing him.  As Reinhardt curses and prepares to
            fire again --

            Blade makes it to the end of the catwalk, pitching himself
            out into open space.  Time slows to a crawl as Blade tumbles
            downward, plummeting into --

            THE BLOOD CASK BELOW

            Blade sinks from view, disappearing beneath the churning
            slurry of crimson.  A beat passes as Reinhardt and his men
            draw closer, apprehensive.  Then, an explosion of BLOOD
            gushes over Reinhardt and the others.  They fall backwards,
            blinded, slipping --

            BLADE

            surfaces from the cask in morbidly glorious slow-motion.
            Think of Sheen in the end-sequence of Apocalypse Now, only
            instead of a river of mud, Blade is covered head-to-toe in
            crimson.  Majestic and glistening.  A primordial god.  He
            rears back his head, letting loose a triumphal ROAR.

            Reinhardt's men hesitate.  One look at Blade's eyes and we
            can see he's tapped into a well-spring of fury even he never
            knew he had.  The man is super-charged and ready for war.

            Blade tears into the vampires, unleashing a blizzard of
            martial arts moves.  He powers a right hook into the first
            vampire's face, then pivots, launching a devastating spinning
            back-fist into the face of a second.  At the same time, he
            rips the second guard's security belt from his waist,
            twirling it around nanchadku-style to blind a third guard and
            capture the wrist of a fourth.

            Some vampires FIRE their guns, but Blade is a whirlwind,
            shifting and dodging.  BULLETS go wild, hitting circuitry,
            EXPLODING APART cannisters of combustible chemicals.  In
            seconds, FLAMES are licking across the laboratory floor.

            Blade drops, causing a pair of vampires to FIRE their guns at
            one another.

            Then Blade knocks two more vampires onto their asses with a
            foot sweep.  Then he's up again.  Slamming the bridge of a
            fifth vampire's nose into his brain with a palm heel strike.

            A snap kick, an overhand elbow strike, a knee stamp that
            shatter's the vampire's knee cap.  An upward block, a jab, a
            cross, a shin kick aimed at a vamp's quadriceps.

            Overhand punches, rising punches, parallel punches, spinning
            rear elbows, deep kicks, on and on and on and on in an orgy
            of super-hero violence until --

            WHAM!  Blade cuts the last of the vampire soldiers down,
            turning from the creature's disintegrating body to face --

            REINHARDT

            The vampire mercenary clutches Blade's sword in his hand, but
            the weapon provides him with little sense of security given
            that he's just seen a dozen of his men slaughtered.  The
            automatic sprinkler system is on now, spraying water down
            upon Blade and Reinhardt alike.  Blade advances.

            Reinhardt's been cornered.  There's nowhere else for him to
            run.  Refusing to be cowed, Reinhardt SCREAMS and brings the
            sword down at Blade's head when WHOOSH --

            But Blade swings his hands upward, slapping them on either
            side of the blade, trapping the sword on its downward arc.

            Reinhardt strains, trying to tear the sword away from Blade's
            grip.  The vampire's eyes widen in fear.  And during that
            split-second in which the two men are frozen, connected by
            the weapon which vibrates between them, Blade says:

                                BLADE
                      Tell me something, chief.  Can you
                      blush?

            TWHISH!  The sword twists free from Reinhardt's grasp,
            spinning upward into the air.  Reinhardt stumbles backwards
            against the blood cask railing as --

            Blade catches the sword on its way down, swinging it around
            in one fluid motion, slicing Reinhardt's torso in half, along
            with a diagonal axis!  Reinhardt sinks to his knees as the
            TWO HALVES split apart, turning to ash before they hit floor.

            Beat.  Blade stands beneath the spray of the overhead
            sprinklers, rinsing the blood from his body.  He turns
            towards the exit, sword in hand.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - LOBBY - NIGHT

            A set of elevator doors open, disgorging Damaskinos.  Beyond
            the lobby windows we can SEE a waiting helicopter, VAMPIRE
            SOLDIERS readying it for take-off.  Damaskinos rushes across
            the lobby and is almost at the exit when --

            CHUNK!CHUNK!CHUNK! A series of steel shutters slam down over
            the doors and windows.  Damaskinos tries to tug one of the
            shutters upwards, then moves to a keypad nearby.  He starts
            hurriedly tapping in a numeric sequence when we hear:

                                NYSSA (O.S.)
                      I overrode the security codes.

            Damaskinos spins around.  Nyssa stands behind him.  She's got
            Whistler's rail-gun in her hands.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      We're locked in.

                                DAMASKINOS
                      Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!

                                NYSSA
                      Maybe it's better that way.

            AS if in response, a GRINDING SHUDDER comes from the elevator
            doors.  Damaskinos spins in wide-eyed horror, then --

                                BLADE (O.S.)
                      What's it going to be, Damaskinos?
                      Thiavolos.  The devil you know --

            BLADE

            enters the lobby from a mezzanine above, sword in hand.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      -- or the devil you don't?

            Damaskinos turns back to his daughter, making a last appeal.

                                DAMASKINOS
                          (vampire dialect; subtitled)
                      For God's sake, Nyssa!  Let us out of
                      here!

            WHAM!WHAM!WHAM!  Nomak pounds away.  The elevator doors are
            starting to buckle, then they tear apart completely --

            NOMAK

            bursts into the lobby, ROARING.  If anything, he is even more
            animalistic now, his features having become grossly
            distorted.

                                NOMAK
                          (in vampire dialect)
                      Why are you frightened, father?  The
                      prodigal son has returned.

            Damaskinos scurries backwards, but there's nowhere left to
            run.  Nomak descends on him, lifting the vampire into a rib
            crushing embrace, chomping his elongated canines into
            Damaskinos' throat.

            Damaskinos SQUEALS like a child as his life-blood is sucked
            out of him.  His body begins to cave inward, shrinking and
            twisting until there's nothing left but shriveled husk.

            Nyssa hefts the rail-gun and FIRES at Nomak's back.  Nomak
            HOWLS, releasing Damaskinos' body, then turns, focusing his
            blood-drunk gaze on Nomak.

                                BLADE
                          (alarmed)
                      Get out of here!

            But Nyssa stands her ground, rachetting back the slide on the
            rail-gun, readying to unleash another barrage of needles.
            Nomak CHARGES, moving at unbelievable speed.  She FIRES
            AGAIN, aiming at Nomak's chest --

            but then Nomak is upon her.  He slaps the rail-gun from her
            hands, SMASHING IT TO PIECES.
            Then he wraps his hand around her throat, pulling her
            forward, sinking his teeth into her neck.  Nyssa SCREAMS.

                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                      Nyssa!!!

            ON BLADE

            as he leaps from the mezzanine level, sword extended, like
            Beowulf diving to slay Grendel.  He PLUNGES the sword deep
            into Nomak's upper torso.  Then DRIVES it in even further --

            Nomak releases Nyssa and back-hands Blade across the face,
            sending him sailing through the air.  He lands, skids across
            the floor --

            ON NOMAK

            stumbling backwards into the wall.  The sword has sunk so
            deep that the tip is actually protruding out his back,
            SCRAPING a gash across the wall as Nomak slides towards the
            floor.

            Nomak GRUNTS, then reaches for the pomeel with his ruined
            hand.  He grips the pommel and SNAPS the sword-blade in half.
            Then he SLAMS against the wall, forcing the half of the
            broken blade that's still embedded in him out back through
            the front of his chest.  As Nomak rises to his feet --

            Blade is on him again, snap-kicking the Reaper in the chest.
            Nomak retaliates.  Blade somersaults out of the way, then
            springs back again, KICKING Nomak in the face, BREAKING
            Nomak's NECK.  Nomak's head lolls unnaturally sideways for a
            heartbeat and then Nomak swings his head around, somehow
            righting his neck vertebrae with a snap of his head.

            They trade blows, a brutal death-match that seems to defy
            gravity.  Blade moves in for a round-house punch, but Nomak
            catches his fist, holding it for a split-second, then bending
            Blade's hand at an unnatural angle, SNAPPING his wrist bones.
            The pain is enormous.

            Nomak starts beating the living shit out of Blade, pummeling
            him with his fists, gripped by an uncontrollable rage.  He
            SMASHES Blade against a marble column, cracking it.  Then he
            flings Blade against one of the brushed steel walls - so hard
            that Blade's body actually leaves an indentation.

            Before Blade can recover, Nomak is in front of him, launching
            another kick.  Blade rolls his head out of the way, barely
            avoiding Nomak's boot heel which dents the wall.  Nomak kicks
            a second time.  Blade avoids Nomak, but third time's the
            charm and Nomak lands one squarely in Blade's gut.
            Blade falls beneath a flurry of blows, unable to defend
            himself any longer.  Blood stains his eyes, obscuring his
            vision.  He strikes out blindly, but Nomak has forced him to
            the ground, pinning him there.  As Blade struggles to free
            himself --

            NOMAK

            lowers his head towards Blade's face.  The scar/seam in
            Nomak's chin splits open and Nomak's lower jaw flares apart,
            distending and widening to reveal the awful, glistening hell
            maw -- the hollow inner fangs and striated cartilage which
            are closing about Blade's face.  Blade twists his head
            violently to the right, then glimpses the broken tip of his
            sword resting a few feet away.  He reaches for it in
            desperation, plunging it up into Nomak's chest.  Nomak HOWLS.
            Because the hilt has been broken off, Blade is forced to grip
            the cutting edge of the weapon with his bare hands.  It
            slices into his fingers --

            but Blade just grips the broken sword tighter, ignoring the
            pain, driving it deeper and deeper -- until, suddenly, it
            penetrates the cartilaginous shell around Nomak's heart and --

                                NOMAK
                          (in vampire dialect)
                      Blood brother.

            Nomak smiles, covering Blade's hands with his own.  He looks
            blade in the eye, then drives the broken sword home.

            Nomak's body stiffens, his eyes grow unseeing, an oddly
            serene look spreading across his tortured face.  A patch of
            BLACKNESS begins radiating outward from his chest, moving
            over his body, carbonizing him from within.  As his blackened
            flesh begins to crack, BLUE FLAMES flicker out from the
            fissures.  In seconds, Nomak is gone.

            Beat.  Blade stands, exhausted.  Then he looks to where Nyssa
            rests.  He moves to her side, kneeling beside her.  She
            smiles up at him, bravely, but frightened all the same.
            Blade inspects the wound on her neck.  It's clearly fatal.

                                NYSSA
                      How does it look?

                                BLADE
                          (with genuine sadness)
                      Not good.

            Nyssa nods.  Blade has only confirmed her existing fears.

                                NYSSA
                      It won't be long now.  I can already
                      feel it burning inside me --

            She grips Blade's arm, her eyes welling with tears.

                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
                      I don't want to become what Nomak was --
                          (beat; straining)
                      I can't.  I want to die while I'm still
                      vampire.

            Blade sighs.  The burden is all to familiar to him.

                                BLADE
                      What do you want me to do?

                                NYSSA
                      I want to see the sun rise.

            ON BLADE

            his face a mask of sad resignation.  He lifts Nyssa into his
            arms.  She closes her eyes, resting her head on his chest.

            EXT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - JUST BEFORE DAWN

            The shutters over the doors and windows slowly rise.  Blade
            shoulders open the front door, moving across the lawn towards
            a bluff overlooking the ocean.  A moment later, Whistler
            emerges into the light, watching as Blade sets Nysa down on
            the grass.  Her eyes flutter open and she looks into --

            THE HORIZON

            where the faintest glimmer of pre-dawn light brightens the
            cloud-swept sky.  It's peaceful.  We can hear the SURF
            crashing on the shore below.

            Together they wait.

            A GLIMMER OF LIGHT emerges over the earth's curvature,
            spreading its dazzling radiance out across the skyline.
            Nyssa's eyes widen in expectation, her breath catching.  She
            looks up at Blade, stroking his face, smiling.

                                NYSSA
                      Each day is a little life.  Remember?

            Blade nods, he's strong for her.  Despite his best efforts, a
            tear slides down his cheek.  They kiss then as the sun rises
            in full glory, flooding the world with its brilliance.

            Blade holds Nyssa tightly to his chest, refusing to
            relinquish his grip as her body catches fire.  The end is
            blessedly quick -- not a slow-burn of blazing agony, but a
            nearly seamless transition from life --

            To ash...  Nyssa collapses apart in Blade's arms, billowing
            out around him in a cloud of glowing embers.  One moment
            she's there, the next she's gone.  Blade remains where he is,
            kneeling on the bluff, the wind carrying the last traces of
            Nyssa aloft into the sky.  He shuts his eyes.  Turns his face
            to the warmth of the sun, surrendering himself to acceptance.

            WE RISE UP

            isolating Blade alone on the windswept bluff.  After a
            moment, Whistler moves to Blade's side.  He rests a hand on
            Blade's shoulder, but doesn't say a word.  We keep moving up
            and up until the two of them are just a pair of tiny figures
            on the rolling coastline.  Then we --

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            A SERIES OF CLOSEUPS

            Images of a weapon being forged, all filtered through
            shimmering convection waves of intense heat.  We SEE a HAMMER
            CLANGING DOWN.  The FIRES of a ROARING furnace.  SPARKS
            showering up from titanium slowly being given shape.  Molten
            silver.  Acid etching.  And then we PULL BACK to reveal --

            INT. BLADE'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

            Blade works before a forge by moonlight, his body dripping
            with sweat.  He slips his hand in a protective glove and
            grips the red-hot weapon, dousing it in a quench bucket.  As
            a cloud of steam envelops Blade, he lifts it up for view.

            A NEW SWORD

            perfect.  Lethal.  Wrought from titanium, plated in sliver.
            As Blade inspects the sword, we hear his earlier words again:

                                BLADE (V.O.)
                      I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I
                      do.  It's in my blood...

            Satisfied with his work, Blade smiles --

            EXT. FUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT

            A shit-hole porno emporium offering the latest in bagged-for
            your-pleasure Euro-raunch.

            INT. FUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT

            Rush, the vampire brother wanna-be from the opening of the
            film, is up at the register, exchanging a twenty for a
            handful of tokens.  He's humming along to that old E-Rotic
            song "Voulez-vous couchez avec moi".

                                RUSH
                      -- yelling for your tender touch, you
                      can never get enough --

            We FOLLOW HIM down a hall lined with video booths, serenaded
            all the while by the cheesy SYNTH SOUNDTRACKS and faked
            ORGASMOGROANS coming from beyond the doors.

                                RUSH (CONT'D)
                      -- cover me with your love --

            Rush stops at "Buddy Booth No. 3 - HOT ONE-ON-ONE ACTION."

            INT. BUDDY BOOTH - NIGHT

            Rush steps inside.  There's a chair set in front of a
            Plexiglas window, an intercom with a phone receiver, box of
            Kleenex, and a slot for the tokens.

            Rush gets himself situated, picks up the receiver, then
            eagerly pops some tokens in the slot.

                                RUSH
                      Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir!
                      Voulez-vous coucher AVEC MOI!!!

            With a HUM, the screen in front of the window rises, offering
            us a view of the booth on the other side of the Plexiglas.
            Only instead of a skanked out booth girl, Rush finds himself
            staring in open-mouthed astonishment at --

            BLADE

            Who flashes an evil smile at us.

                                BLADE
                      What?  You think I forgot about you?

            In a near blur, Blade draws his new sword from his back
            scabbard and stabs it RIGHT INTO CAMERA, SMASHING apart the
            Plexiglas window as we --

                                ****************

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION LOCKER ROOM - DAY               1

        THE EYE                                                 2

        It's magnified and deeply revealed.  Flecks of green
        and yellow in a field of milky blue.  Icy filaments
        surround the undulating center.

        The eye is brown in a tiny screen.  On the metallic
        surface below, the words VOIGHT-KAMPFF are finely
        etched.  There's a touch-light panel across the top
        and on the side of the screen, a dial that registers
        fluctuations of the iris.

        The instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits
        on a table between two men.  The man talking is big,
        looks like an over-stuffed kid.  "LEON" it says on
        his breast pocket.  He's dressed in a warehouseman's
        uniform and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in
        his lap.  Despite the obvious heat, he looks very cool.

        The man facing him is lean, hollow cheeked and dressed
        in gray.  Detached and efficient, he looks like a cop
        or an accountant.  His name is HOLDEN and he's all
        business, except for the sweat on his face.

        The room is large and humid.  Rows of salvaged junk
        are stacked neatly against the walls.  Two large fans
        whir above their heads.

                                LEON
                  Okay if I talk?

        Holden doesn't answer.  He's centering Leon's eye on
        the machine.

                                LEON
                  I kinda get nervous when I
                  take tests.

                                HOLDEN
                  Don't move.

                                LEON
                  Sorry.

        He tries not to move but finally his lips can't help
        a sheepish smile.

                                LEON
                  Already had I.Q. test this year --
                  but I don't think I never had a...

                                HOLDEN
                         (cutting in)
                  Reaction time is a factor in this,
                  so please pay attention.  Answer
                  quickly as you can.

        Leon compresses his lips and nods his big head eagerly.
        Holden's voice is cold, geared to intimidate and evoke
        response.

                                HOLDEN
                  You're in a desert, walking along
                  in the sand when all of a sudden
                  you look down and see a...

                                LEON
                  What one?

        It was a timid interruption, hardly audible.

                                HOLDEN
                  What?

                                LEON
                  What desert?

                                HOLDEN
                  Doesn't make any difference what
                  desert -- it's completely
                  hypothetical.

                                LEON
                  But how come I'd be there?

                                HOLDEN
                  Maybe you're fed up, maybe you
                  want to be by yourself -- who
                  knows.  So you look down and
                  see a tortoise.  It's crawling
                  towards you...

                                LEON
                  A tortoise.  What's that?

                                HOLDEN
                  Know what a turtle is?

                                LEON
                  Of course.

                                HOLDEN
                  Same thing.

                                LEON
                  I never seen a turtle.

        He sees Holden's patience is wearing thin.

                                LEON
                  But I understand what you mean.

                                HOLDEN
                  You reach down and flip the
                  tortoise over on its back, Leon.

        Keeping an eye on his subject, Holden notes the dials
        in the Voight-Kampff.  One of the needles quivers
        slightly.

                                LEON
                  You make these questions, Mr.
                  Holden, or they write 'em down
                  for you?

        Disregarding the question, Holden continues, picking
        up the pace.

                                HOLDEN
                  The tortoise lays on its back,
                  its belly baking in the hot sun,
                  beating its legs trying to turn
                  itself over.  But it can't.  Not
                  without your help.  But you're
                  not helping.

        Leon's upper lip is quivering.

                                LEON
                  Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?

                                HOLDEN
                  I mean you're not helping!
                  Why is that, Leon?

        Leon looks shocked, surprised.  But the needles in
        the computer barely move.  Holden goes for the inside
        of his coat.  But big Leon is faster.  His LASER BURNS
        a hole the size of a nickel through Holden's stomach.
        Unlike a bullet, a laser causes no impact.  It goes
        through Holden's spine and comes out his back, clean
        as a whistle.  Like a rag doll he falls back off the
        bench from the waist up.  By the time he hits the
        floor, big slow Leon is already walking away.  But he
        stops, turns and with a little smile of satisfaction,
        FIRES at the machine on the table.

        There's a flash and a puff of smoke.  The Voight-Kampff
        is hit dead center, crippled but not destroyed; as
        Leon walks out of the room, one of its lights begins
        to blink, faint but steady.

        EXT. DESERT - NIGHT                                     3

        The horizon marked by a thin copper line that maybe
        the end, of the beginning of a day.

        The train that follows, cuts through the night at 400
        miles an hour.

        INT. TRAIN - NIGHT                                      4

        No clickitty-clack of track-bound noise, it's a long,
        insulated Pullman of contoured seats and low-keyed
        lighting, coloured to soothe,and empty, except for
        the passenger half way down.

        His eyes closed, head rested against the glass.  Ten
        years ago, DECKARD might have been an athlete, a
        track man or a welter-weight.  The body looks it, but
        the face has seen some time -- not all of it good.

        INT. TRAIN - REFRESHMENT DISPENSER - NIGHT              5

        Deckard comes down the aisle, slips a coin into the
        mechanism, receives a beer and returns to his seat.

        INT. TRAIN - NIGHT                                      6

        Tired of the program, he takes off the headset and
        drops it next to three empty beer bottles and a
        sandwich wrapper, adjusts his position and winds up
        staring at his reflection in the window.  Runs a
        hand over his face, it could use a shave.  He leans
        closer and peers through the glass.

        Out there in the black a sign flashes past:  SAN
        ANGELES, THREE MINUTES.

        EXT. PLATFORM - NIGHT                                   7

        The train slides in, smooth as an eel, and stops with-
        out a sound.  Carrying a bag and umbrella, Deckard
        disembarks ahead of the other passengers and into the
        sweltering night.

        INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                   8

        Deckard has got his coat swung over his shoulder, his
        shirt already damp, as he walks down the long, hollow
        passage under orbs of yellow light.

        EXT. TERMINAL - NIGHT                                   9

        Deckard unlocks his car and gets in.  Turns the ig-
        nition and hits a sensor.  The dash console glows
        and Deckard sits back waiting for the air unit to cool
        things off.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  It was 97 degrees in the city and
                  no hope of improvement.  Not bad
                  if you're a lizard.  But two hours
                  earlier I was drinking Acquavit
                  with an Eskimo lady in North East
                  Alaska.  That's a tough change to
                  make.  It was so good, I didn't
                  want to leave, so I left a day
                  early.

        A little detached, Deckard taps another sensor on the
        panel, lights up a cigarette and watches as his mes-
        sages flash across the viewer stating date, time and
        caller.  The last one is repeated five times.  Deckard
        sighs, switches off the viewer and gets on the radio.

                                DECKARD
                  Contact.  This is Blade Runner One
                  calling Com-fast 27.

        The SOUND OF A CHIME precedes the mechanical female
        voice that answers.

                                VOICE
                  Blade Runner One, stand by please.

        A pause.  Followed by a husky male voice.

                                VOICE
                  Deckard.

                                DECKARD
                  Yah, Gaff.

                                GAFF (VOICE)
                  Where the hell you been?

                                DECKARD
                  You know where I been.  I been on
                  vacation.

                                GAFF
                  Next time you go on vacation,
                  do me a favor, let us know where
                  it is.

                                DECKARD
                  What's up?

                                GAFF
                  Holden got hit.

        There is a pause.  That was bad news.

                                DECKARD
                  Bad?

                                GAFF
                  Severed spine.  You'd better get
                  in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.

                                DECKARD
                  I'll see you in a minute.

        The ENGINE REVS, the wipers rake two weeks of dust off
        the windshield and Deckard jams out of the lot.

        INT. THE HALL OF JUSTICE - NIGHT                        10

        An enormous grey vault of a building.  A businesslike
        Deckard strides down a long corridor with his brief-
        case and police ID pinned to his coat.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  I-X-4-P-D referred to as a Nexus-6,
                  The Tyrell Corporation's new pride
                  and joy.  Holden was administering
                  the Voight-Kampff test when one
                  nailed him.

        The door in front of Deckard slides open and he walks
        through.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  The Nexus-6 must be fast because
                  Holden was as quick as they come.
                  The report said there were six of
                  them.  Three males and three female.
                  Led by a combat model called Roy
                  Batty.

        INT. INSPECTOR BRYANT'S OFFICE - NIGHT                  11

        The INSPECTOR is in his fifties.  The deep creases in
        his face, the broken capillaries in his nose say
        brawler, spoiler, drinker, but the diplomas on the
        wall say something else.  Bryant's kneeled at his safe
        trying to open it.  Deckard it sitting on the edge of
        the desk reading the print-out.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  They escaped from the colonies
                  two weeks ago.  Killed twenty-
                  three people and jumped a shuttle.
                  An aerial patrol found the ship
                  in the desert.  No crew.

        Bryant gets the safe open and brings out a bottle of
        whiskey.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  Bryant's got a liver problem.  A
                  couple years back he handed me a
                  bottle and said have a drink for
                  another man.  I been drinking
                  for him ever since.

        Deckard sets down the report and takes the shot Bryant
        just poured for him.

                                DECKARD
                  Six, huh?

                                BRYANT
                  Five.  Three nights ago one of
                  them managed to break into the
                  Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two
                  guards and got as far as the
                  Genetic Sector before he got
                  fried going through an electro-
                  field.

                                DECKARD
                  What was he after?

                                BRYANT
                  There wasn't much left of him,
                  so we can't be sure.  But bio-
                  chemical data and morphology records
                  of the Nexus-6 were reported
                  missing.  Going on the possibility
                  they might try to infiltrate we
                  send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff
                  tests on the new employees.  Guess
                  he found himself one.

        A grim pause.

                                DECKARD
                  You got a machine on it yet?

                                BRYANT
                  We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that
                  picked up Holden's alarm.  Its
                  guess is that all five are in
                  the city.

                                DECKARD
                  Where do we start?

        Bryant's back at the safe locking up his bottle.

                                BRYANT
                  The Tyrell Corporation has a
                  demo model.  Check it out on the
                  Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance
                  the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability
                  to detect.  If that's the case,
                  everybody's up shit creek.

                                DECKARD
                  What was the cover on the one that
                  got Holden?

                                BRYANT
                  Industrial refuse.

                                DECKARD
                  Garbage man?

        Bryant nods.

                                DECKARD
                  Did personnel have an address on
                  him?

        Bryant fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket,
        copies down a number and hands it over.

                                DECKARD
                  I'll go take a look.

        Deckard stands and holds up his drink.

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

        Like a sick boy looking out of the window, Bryant
        watches Deckard down the whiskey.  Deckard puts down
        the glass and turns to leave.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  The big incentive to emigrate was
                  still free labor.  If the public
                  found out that their door-prizes
                  might kill them, they might not be
                  so hot to go up there.  This was
                  one of the worst one's we had and
                  Bryant was worried.  He wanted to
                  tell me to be discrete or something.
                  But I didn't give him a chance.

        EXT. LEON'S HOTEL ENTRANCE - NIGHT                      12

        An electrical storm is brewing.  Deckard stands out-
        side the entrance to an old hotel holding an umbrella,
        as people scuttle into doorways to avoid the sudden
        downpour.

        INT. LEON'S HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT                         13

        A heavy metal maze of cubicles and perilous iron
        balconies, peopled with rejects from the surface world;
        Mato Grosso Indians in white man's clothes and other
        lower echelon welfare recipients.  Drop city is crowded,
        cramped and darkly alive.

        Deckard steps out of an elevator and moves through the
        crowd.  A cloud of steam drifts up through  a grating
        as two old men, clad in towels descend a flight of
        stairs under a neon sign that says bath house.

        A musty subterranean wind ripples Deckard's clothes as
        he turns into an alcove.  He stops in front of a door
        that says, MANAGER and pushes the buzzer.  It's opened
        by an emphysema victim with an oxygen tank lashed to
        his hip.  Deckard flashes his ID and speaks some words
        which are inaudible due to the TUBA MUSIC down the hall.
        The man grabs a key from his wall, hands it over and
        shuts the door.

        INT. LEON'S HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT                      14

        The companion ways below deck of a big ship are no
        more bewildering than the ups and downs and ins and
        outs of this establishment.  But Deckard finds the door
        he's looking for.  He pauses a moment, listens, then
        knocks.  He inserts the key and with a hand on his gun
        opens it.

        INT. LEON'S ROOM - NIGHT                                15

        An empty room.  A cot and not much else.  He steps in
        and stands quiet as a hunter sensing the signs.  For a
        place surrounded by greasy hovels it is surprisingly
        clean.  Spartan in fact.  The towel by the spotless
        basin is perfectly folded.

        Deckard runs two fingers over a shelf.  No dust.  He
        looks in the waste basket.  Wadded up candy wrappers.
        The bed by the window is neatly made.  Deckard looks
        under it, then runs his hands along both sides of the
        mattress.

        The closet.  There's one suit in it.  He pats it down.
        Nothing. A show box on the floor.  He stoops, takes
        out what looks like a pen from his pocket and care-
        fully traces it over the box.  Assured of its harm-
        lessness, he lifts off the lid.

        It contains a little stack of photos bound with a
        rubber band.  Deckard removes them, goes to the lamp
        by the balcony window and turns it on.

        A touching collection of family snapshots.  The kind of
        anonymous stuff sold by the bunch in dusty junk shops.
        The family dog.  Junior on the pony squinting in the
        sun.  Uncle Ben clowning with the kids.  The faded
        polaroid of Christmas morning.  Simple pictures of
        simple folks celebrating the family bond.  A curious
        collection for the likes of Leon and Deckard studies
        them with interest.

        EXT. STREET BELOW - NIGHT                               16

        Oblivious to the cloudburst, a blue-eyed albino stands
        in the doorway, peddling candy and artificial flowers
        looking like he'd never been touched by the light of
        day.

        Leon is standing behind him, staring up at his room,
        watching Deckard at the window.  He's still wearing
        his coveralls, but he looks different.  His face is
        more intent, smarter and angry.

        EXT. STREET BELOW - NIGHT                               17

        For one seething moment it looks like Leon might mash
        something, but suddenly he swings away and disappears
        into the crowd.

        INT. LEON'S ROOM - NIGHT                                18

        Deckard pockets the pictures and moves away from the
        window.

        EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                      19

        Leon's got a neck like a fire hydrant and legs to
        match, but he's a graceful runner.  Looks like he could
        do it for days.  And he could.  He's put a lot of alley
        behind him and he's not out of breath.

        EXT. CHINATOWN - NIGHT                                  20

        Slowing down he cuts into an opening and comes out onto
        a narrow street.  The Asian Quarter.

        INT. CHOP SUEY HOUSE - NIGHT                            21

        A seamy as well as steamy little place.  Counter and
        small tables.  Old slant-eyed enders humped over their
        fuming bowls jabbering and slurping.

        The only voice coming out clear is from the big three-
        D TV on the back wall.  As the mellow-mouthed TV
        announcer delivers the message, a Latin-looking beauty
        in a well-fitted maids uniform does a twirl, flashes
        a beguiling smile and glides OUT OF FRAME.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  Choose from a variety of seventy
                  nine different personality types.
                  Each and every one a loyal trouble-
                  free companion given to you upon
                  your arrival absolutely free...

        The Latin beauty is replaced by an impeccable Ray
        Bolger type gentleman's gentleman who clicks his heels,
        snaps to attention and struts off to make room for the
        next.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  To use as personal body servant
                  to tireless field hand -- the
                  custom tailored humanoid robot,
                  designed especially for your
                  needs.

        The Chinese are paying no attention, but the man and
        the woman seated at the table by the window are.

        The woman is pretty, a touch of gray in her hair, kind
        and blue-eyed.  MARY looks like an American dream mom,
        right out of "Father Knows Best."

        The man also resembles a tradition: the gym instructor,
        short cropped hair with the body of a drill sergeant,
        but the eyes are grey and chilling.  ROY BATTY is a
        presence of force with a lazy, but acute sense of what
        goes on around him.

        Leon has just come through the door behind them.  Try-
        ing not to be the bull in a china shop, he approaches
        their table and kneels .  Batty doesn't bother to look
        at him, which amplifies the note of sarcasm in his
        quiet voice.

                                BATTY
                  Did you get your precious 'things'?

                                LEON
                  Somebody was already there.

                                BATTY
                  Police.

                                LEON
                  Just a man.

                                BATTY
                  Police man.

        Leon looks sullen.

                                BATTY
                  Why don't you have a seat.

        There's one next to him.  Leon pulls it over and sits.

                                BATTY
                  Enjoy the view.

        From the pot on the table, Mary pours tea and they sit
        so quiet and still in this noisy place that they seem
        almost invisible.  The view they're "enjoying" is
        through the window.  Outside the neon side in the win-
        dow directly across the street says:  HANNIBAL CHEW,
        MEMBERS.

        INT. HANNIBAL CHEW'S SHOP - NIGHT                       22

        Chew is a spindly old man of precision, his veiled
        eyes are shrewd and Chinese, but the rest of him
        looks like a Charles Dickens invention.

        He's got a jewelers' glass stuck in his eye, lurched
        over a lamp, squinting at something in his hand.  After
        a moment his lips peal back into a sour, belligerent
        smile.

                                CHEW
                  Well, you're right.  This little
                  honey has a couple of defective cones.

        He snaps off the lamp and swings round to face his
        client.

        SEBASTIAN'S face is almost young, but something has
        gone too far, too fast.  Premature old age has made
        his bones brittle and his co-ordination slow.  The
        house may be dark but there's a light on in it.  Se-
        bastian is a closet genius.

                                CHEW
                  You're a regular perfectionist,
                  Sebastian.

        Sebastian's apologetic, especially around the acerbic
        Mr. Chew.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  It's gotta be right for my
                  customer.

                                CHEW
                  Your customer, eh?

        Chew snickers and beckons.  Sebastian follows his down
        a high narrow hall to a heavy insulated door.  There's
        a moth-eaten full length fur coat hanging by it.  Chew
        tugs it on and they go through.  The big door slams
        shut behind them.

        INT. COLD STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT                          23

        Except for the work table with its sharp gleaming in-
        struments, the room is as barren and sterile as a
        morgue.  The glass-doored compartments in the walls
        look like crypts.  Some of them small as post office
        boxes.  From one of the Chew removes a vacuum, packed
        box.  Carefully separating the seal, he reaches into
        the purple jell and with a pair of tweezers extracts
        an eye.

        Through the jeweler's glass, which he has not bothered
        to remove, Chew holds the eye up to the light and
        studies it a moment.  His other hand searches through
        his pockets.

                                CHEW
                  You got a pocket-charger, boy?

        Quick to accommodate, Sebastian removes a pencil-like
        device from a row of such things in his breast pocket
        and steps closer.  The back of the eye is touched with
        the pencil and the pupil moves.  Suddenly its staring
        back at them.

                                CHEW
                  Is that good enough for your
                  customer?

        Anxious to leave, Sebastian nods.  Chew reseals the
        eye taking his time.  He can afford to, he's wearing
        his coat.

                                CHEW
                  How much is he paying you?

        In place of an answer, Sebastian clears his throat,
        stares at the bag like he didn't hear.

                                CHEW
                  Well, when do you get paid?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Soon as I finish the job.

                                CHEW
                  When might that be?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Day after tomorrow.

                                CHEW
                  Oh!  Day after tomorrow.

        Sebastian nods.  Chew stares at the poor bastard, con-
        cerned in spite of himself.

                                CHEW
                  The rich hate to pay, Sebastian.
                  A guy like Tyrell keeps you waiting.
                  Pay the little guy last.  You should
                  charge twice as much.  It'll make
                  him feel better.

        Sebastian nods his head like that's exactly what he'll
        do.  Chew sees it's hopeless and hands him the bag.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Thanks, Mr. Chew.

        Chew pulls the door open for him and Sebastian goes
        through quick as a dog.

        EXT. HANNIBAL CHEW'S STORE - STREET - NIGHT             24

        Sebastian may lack co-ordination but he got what he
        came for and there's a hopeful spring to his walk as
        he heads for his truck.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S AMBULANCE - NIGHT                      25

        It's an old panel job with ambulance siren and lights.
        The lettering on the side reads "J.R. SEBASTIAN -
        ANIMOID EXPRESS."  Sebastian gets in, starts up the
        engine and suddenly realizes he's not alone.  It's a
        jolt that causes him to yelp.

        PRIS is sprawled on the seat next to him, and wakes up
        with a yelp of her own.  They stare at one another for
        a startled instant, and she jumps out and starts walk-
        ing.

        But she's forgotten her little beat-up overnight case.
        Sebastian puts the truck in gear, drives next to her
        and opens the door.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Hey!  You forgot your...

        He holds up the bag.  Hesitantly she reaches for it.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  How come you were in my truck?

                                PRIS
                  I was tired and didn't have any
                  place to go.

        She stares at him, hand on her case, looking lost.
        Sebastian isn't good at this, but he tries.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You can get back in if you want...

        She can't make up her mind.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

        She gets in.  Both of them are silent.  People are not
        Sebastian's medium -- usually he's too shy, but this
        girl is shyer still, plus they're about the same age --
        it gives him courage.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What's your name?

                                PRIS
                  Pris.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

                                PRIS
                  Hi.

        So pleased with the way that went, he forgets for a
        while what comes next.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh!  Where do you want to go?

        She shrugs.  That leaves him a lot of responsibility.
        He throws her side-long glances, but she's not helping.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You want to go home?

                                PRIS
                  I don't have one.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh.

        What do you do with a teenage beauty who looks like
        she's lost out of some "Welcome to Sunny Arizona"
        poster?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Where are your folks?

                                PRIS
                  They left.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What about friends?

                                PRIS
                  I have some, but I have to find
                  out where they are staying.

        She leans forward and rests her elbows on the dash.
        Her body would win prizes, from any angle.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Well, where should I take you?

        She looks at him,a shadow of enticement in her clear
        blue eyes.

                                PRIS
                  We scared each other pretty good
                  didn't we?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  We sure did.

        She giggles and laughs.

                                PRIS
                  I'm hungry, J.F.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I've got stuff.  If you wanna go
                  to my place?

                                PRIS
                  I was hoping you'd say that.

        Sebastian's face is normally on the grey side, but it
        just turned red.  He turns on the ignition and they
        pull away from the curb.

        INT. DECKARD'S CAR - FREEWAY - NIGHT                    26

        Speeding along the freeway.  The terminal in the com-
        munications console lit.  Deckard's right hand just
        finished a punch-up.  The screen flashes back.

        REQUEST

        Deckard punches up.  Letters flash across the screen:

        ESPER

        Screen flashes back:

        CLEARANCE

        Deckard punches up.

        BLADE RUNNER ONE CODE ML-33

        Pause.

        Screen flashes:

        STAND BY.

        Deckard's voice has been heard over the preceding.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  Machines can be helpful sometimes,
                  but they can also be a pain in the
                  ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger
                  and you might wind up at a steel-
                  mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once
                  in a while -- it's their personalities
                  that usually get me.  Somebody once
                  said that man makes machines in his own
                  image.  If that's true, whoever made
                  Esper should have been shot.

                                ESPER
                  This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go
                  ahead please.

        Esper's deep melodious voice is anxious to please, and
        oiled with a touch of self-pity.

                                DECKARD
                  You equipped for random questions?

                                ESPER
                  Why, yes, of course.

                                DECKARD
                  You start.

                                ESPER
                  The five in question are third
                  generation Nexus Sixes, constructed
                  of skin-flesh culture, selected
                  enogenic transfer conversion
                  capable of self-perpetuating
                  thought, para-physical abilities
                  and developed for emigration
                  program.  Are you with me?

                                DECKARD
                  How do I stop one?

                                ESPER
                  Unlike a five, they can sustain
                  massive traumas to several parts
                  of the body without debilitating
                  another.  Sever a leg and it will
                  perform quicker on the remaining leg
                  than the fastest man can run,

                                DECKARD
                  Okay, but...

                                ESPER
                  I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable
                  zone is the base of the skull,
                  the occipital bone.  A direct hit
                  is a positive retirement.

        The communication is interrupted by a BELL which is
        immediately followed by a stern, MECHANICAL VOICE.

                                VOICE
                  You are in violation of traffic
                  ordinance M-139 statutory freeway
                  limit restricted by one-hundred
                  and eighty kilometers.

        In his rear view mirror Deckard sees two black-clad
        motorcycle cops coming up behind him like the hounds
        of hell.  They draw silently alongside.  Deckard
        presses his I.D. to the window.

        The cop tosses a salute to Deckard and he and his
        partner accelerate, vanish in the night.  And Deckard's
        car does too.

        EXT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT                              27

        A district of silence and ruin.  The street is strewn
        with refuse.  The building looks vacant.  A ten storey
        condo gone to shit.  The vandals have come and gone
        long ago.

        Sebastian's little white ambulance parked at the curb.
        MR. DEETCHUM, the old Watchman, sitting in the building
        entry in a straight backed chair, is reading a comic
        book.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                      28

        Well stocked with items of survival, all labeled and
        stacked.  And shelved along the walls and hung from the
        ceiling is a menagerie of animoids.  Like so many broken
        toys awaiting resurrection from Sebastian's wise hands.
        
        Sebastian is seated at a large work-table, bent over a
        stereo scope.  The tool in his right hand is a sensor
        probe and he's using it with the delicacy of an en-
        graver.

        The object of his concentration is a maze-like chip
        configuration no bigger than a thumbnail, but magnified
        under the scope, it looks like an aerial view of a
        large city.  The needle-like sensor probe moves care-
        fully over the contours of the configuration, testing
        the bonds.

        Suddenly a blue flash erupts from one of the junctures.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh!

        Pris is light on her feet.  She's standing behind him
        with a half-eaten sandwich in her hand.

                                PRIS
                  Whatcha doin'?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You scared me.

        But he's happy to see her.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I'm working.

        She's changed her dress and made up her face.  Looks a
        little older and sexier.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You look... better.

                                PRIS
                  Just better.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Beautiful.

                                PRIS
                  Thanks.

        He watches her as she prowls around the room, looking
        at this and that, eating her sandwich.

                                PRIS
                  And you live in this building all
                  by yourself?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yeah, I live here pretty much
                  alone right now...

        Trying to make light of it.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  No housing shortage around here...
                  plenty of room for everybody.

        She sprawls on the couch studying him.

                                PRIS
                  How old are you?

        He can't meet her eyes.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Twenty.

                                PRIS
                  What's your problem?

        It's not an easy subject.  His voice is barely audible.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Methuselah Syndrome.

                                PRIS
                  What's that?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  My glands.  They grow old too fast.

                                PRIS
                  Is that why you're still here?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.

        There is a silence.  He steals a glance at her.

                                PRIS
                  I like you just the way you are.

        Under the desk he bats his knees together.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Ah, you get hold of your friends?

                                PRIS
                  As a matter of fact I did.  They've
                  got some work to do tonight, but
                  they're gonna come tomorrow.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Good.

        The implications catch up.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I can sleep on the couch.

        A little gray mouse on the shelf above his head bobs
        up.

                                MOUSE
                  Don't let the bed bugs bite!

        Taking their cue from the mouse, some of the more
        talented animoids toot, flap and wheel about.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        29

        It's dark except for the glow of the terminal.  A tired
        Deckard sits in front of it.  Esper sounds like he's
        been talking for hours.

        A long pause.

                                ESPER
                  Here's something you might find
                  interesting.  They have been built
                  to emulate the human in every way
                  except in its emotional spectrum.
                  However, after a period of time
                  it is only logical that such a
                  'mechanism' would create its own
                  emotional responses, hate, love,
                  fear, anger, envy.

                                DECKARD
                  I know all that.

                                ESPER
                  What about a summary then.

                                DECKARD
                  I think we're through for the night.

        Deckard starts to reach for the panel.

                                ESPER
                  Mr. Deckard.

        Hesitates.

                                DECKARD
                  Yes?

                                ESPER
                  Do you have something against
                  science?

                                DECKARD
                  Not if it works.

                                ESPER
                  And what in your estimation works?

                                DECKARD
                  The umbrella.

        Deckard picks up the umbrella and with it stabs the
        terminal off button before Esper can respond and the
        machine goes dead.  He sits there for a moment then
        flips on the lamp.  Leon's snap-shots are spread out
        before him.

        INT. SPINNER - DAY                                      30

        A police marked spinner makes a sharp bank, drops into
        a steep curve and slides towards the Tyrell Corporation.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  Every government that could was
                  racing to populate their colonial
                  territory.  But emigrants needed
                  incentive.  Over-population and
                  the greenhouse factor didn't seem
                  to be enough; but owning a human
                  look-a-like had lots of appeal.
                  It was big industry, the competition
                  was stiff and Tyrell was top of the
                  line.

        EXT. TYRELL CORPORATION - DAY                           31

        The spinner gently touches down.  The hatch drops open
        and Deckard steps out.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  His claim to fame was making a
                  product more human than human and
                  sometimes the 'more' turned out to
                  be a problem.  This wasn't just an
                  escaped andy who broke his owner's
                  arm -- there were twenty-eight
                  people dead and the pressure was
                  on.

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION - DAY                           32

        Deckard walks up to a desk, hands his I.D. to a guard
        who checks it against a list on a screen.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  But so far they'd always managed
                  to keep it quiet.  Not to say
                  that once in a while there wasn't
                  bad publicity.  Some fanatic
                  bitching about equal rights for
                  andies or an occasional trade union
                  proclaiming it was aun-American for
                  automatons to take jobs away from
                  humans on the colony.

        The guard hands Deckard back his I.D., pushed a button
        and Deckard walks away.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  But what's more American than good
                  old supply and demand?  The
                  Government needed them, industry
                  made them and the church backed
                  them.  The big religious boys
                  said that Androids, no matter how
                  human, were objects; only God
                  could make people. I'm not religious,
                  but I was inclined to agree.
                  Otherwise I'd be out of a job.

        The elevator door slides open.  The young lady inside
        would look right standing on a cliff, hair blowing in
        the wind, looking out to sea in a 19th Century painting.

                                RACHAEL
                  Hello, Mr. Deckard.  My name is
                  Rachael.

        Deckard tips his head to her and steps in.

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION ELEVATOR - DAY                  33

        No woman can be all things to all men, the Rachael comes
        closer than most.  The only trouble is she's all busi-
        ness.  Formidable without really trying.  Some beauty
        is better avoided and Deckard looks straight ahead.

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION CORRIDOR - DAY                  33A

        The door slides open and they continue down the corri-
        dor.

                                 RACHAEL
                  It seems your department doesn't
                  believe out new unit is to the
                  public benefit.

                                 DECKARD
                  A humanoid robot is like any other
                  machine, it can be a benefit or a
                  hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's
                  not our problem.

                                 RACHAEL
                  But because your department can't
                  do an adequate job in detecting
                  the miniscule number at large,
                  it's a problem.  Correct, Mr.
                  Deckard?

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION - AIR-FILTERED CORRIDOR - DAY   33B

        They pass into a canopied, air-filtered corridor.
        Deckard doesn't answer the question because he's looking
        at the animals.  Small northern animals in neat "en-
        vironmental" cages.  He looks at the rabbit, the raccoon
        and the squirrel, but the owl asleep on its perch stops
        him.  The armed guard at the exit never takes his eyes
        off them.

                                RACHAEL
                  You like our owl?

        Deckard nods.  Rachael claps her hands.  The owl opens
        its yellow eyes and blinks at them.

                                DECKARD
                  It's artificial?

                                RACHAEL
                  Of course not.

        Hands thrust in her pockets, she strides off towards
        the exit without looking back.

        The exit is another tube.  Just big enough for two.  No
        room for excess.  He tries to ignore her cool appraising
        stare.

                                RACHAEL
                  You're in a very unique position,
                  Mr. Deckard.  You could affect the
                  future of this entire organization
                  according to how you work your
                  little test.

        Deckard has nothing to say.

                                RACHAEL
                  Are you apprehensive?

                                DECKARD
                  Why should I be?

                                RACHAEL
                  For the responsibility of your
                  power.  Being a police bureaucrat,
                  you've got more than your share.

        The door slides open.  Deckard looks down at her.

                                DECKARD
                  You got it wrong, girl.  I work
                  with the bureau not for them.

        He lets it sink in.

                                DECKARD
                  My job isn't to detect
                  malfunctioning andies, it's to
                  eliminate them.  The more the
                  better.

        He walks out of the elevator first.

        INT. INNER SANCTUM OF DR. TYRELL - DAY                  34

        The office is dimly lit, but highlights of resilience
        reside in the luster of the antique furnishings, like
        glimmers of gold in a darkened mine.  Dr. Tyrell is a
        fragile man of power, with that look of "youth" obtained
        from steroids and surgery.  Dapper and trim, he leans
        against the desk looking at an old fashioned pocket
        watch.  The only sound is the insidious PERKING of COFFEE
        BREWING in the background.

        Tyrell taps a sensor on his desk.  The door in front of
        Deckard and Rachael slides open.  They enter a vestibule
        and face another door, this one befitting the decor of
        the office, Tyrell slips the watch into his pocket as
        they enter.

                                RACHAEL
                  Mr. Deckard.  Dr. Eldon Tyrell.

                                TYRELL
                  How do you do, Mr. Deckard.  Please
                  sit down.  Would you care for a cup
                  of coffee?

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

                                TYRELL
                  Black?

                                DECKARD
                  Please.

        Tyrell pours from an old time sylex into small china
        cups and hands one to Deckard.  The congenial light in
        his eyes could almost pass for warmth -- dragon warmth.

                                TYRELL
                  Somehow, I didn't expect that the
                  man who did the dirty work would
                  be the man to do the technical
                  work.  Here you are, Mr. Deckard.

        He hands Deckard a cup of coffee.

                                TYRELL
                  Is this to be an empathy test?

                                DECKARD
                  Yes.

                                TYRELL
                  Capillary dilation of the so-called
                  blush response?  Plus fluctuation
                  of the pupil, plus involuntary
                  dilation of the iris?

        Deckard nods.

                                TYRELL
                  May I ask a personal question?

                                DECKARD
                  Go ahead.

                                TYRELL
                  Have you ever retired a human by
                  mistake?

                                DECKARD
                  No.

                                TYRELL
                  But in your profession that is a
                  risk.

                                DECKARD
                  Nothing is infallible, but so far
                  the Voight-Kampff scale bas been
                  foolproof.

                                TYRELL
                  Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a
                  machine can be a hazard.  The
                  Voight-Kampff scale is a machine,
                  isn't it?

                                DECKARD
                  One that relies on human
                  interpretation.  Where's the
                  subject?

                                TYRELL
                  Sitting next to you.

        Deckard stares at Rachael, then back at Tyrell.  Delighted,
        Tyrell takes a cup of coffee.

        Accepting the challenge, Deckard opens his briefcase and
        starts fishing out the apparatus.

        THE VOIGHT-KAMPFF                                       35

        Rachael's eye fills the screen, the iris brilliant, shot
        with light, the pupil contracting.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  Ready.

                                RACHAEL
                  Go ahead.

        In the soft green glow of the dials, the needles in both
        gauges are at rest.  Dr. Tyrell stands silhouetted behind
        Deckard, who sits in front of Rachael, a pencil beam
        trained on her eye.  Wire mesh discs are attached to her
        cheeks.

                                DECKARD
                  You're given a calfskin wallet
                  for your birthday.

        The needles in both gauges swing violently past green to
        red, then subside.

                                RACHAEL
                  I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd
                  report the person who gave it to
                  me to the police.

                                DECKARD
                  You have a little boy.  He shows
                  you his butterfly collection, plus
                  the killing jar.

        Again the gauges register, but not so far.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'd take him to the doctor.

                                DECKARD
                  You're watching T.V. and suddenly
                  you notice a wasp crawling on your
                  wrist.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'd kill it.

        Both needles go to red.  Deckard makes a note, takes a
        sip of coffee and continues.

                                DECKARD
                  In a magazine you come across a
                  full-page photo of a nude girl.

                                RACHAEL
                  Is this testing whether I'm an
                  android or a lesbian?

                                DECKARD
                  You show the picture to your husband.
                  He likes it and hangs it on the wall.
                  The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.

                                RACHEL
                  I wouldn't let him.

                                DECKARD
                  Why not?

                                RACHAEL
                  I should be enough for him.

        Deckard frowns, then smiles.  His smile looks a little
        like a grimace or the other way around.

                                DECKARD
                  You become pregnant by a man who
                  runs off with your best friend,
                  and you decide to get an abortion.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'd never get an abortion.

                                DECKARD
                  Why not?

                                RACHAEL
                  That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.

                                DECKARD
                  In your opinion.

                                RACHAEL
                  It would be my child.

                                DECKARD
                  Sounds like you speaks from
                  experience.

        He notes the needles.  One goes green and the other
        remains inert.

                                DECKARD
                  Last question.  You're watching
                  an old movie.  It shows a banquet in
                  progress, the guests are enjoying
                  raw oysters.

                                RACHAEL
                  Ugh.

        Both needles swing swiftly.

                                DECKARD
                  The entree consists of boiled
                  dog stuffed with rice.

        Needles move less.

                                DECKARD
                  The raw oysters are less acceptable
                  to you than a dish of boiled dog.

        Deckard moves the adhesive discs from her cheeks and
        switches off his beam.

                                DECKARD
                  Lights please.

        The lights come on.

                                TYRELL
                  Well?

                                DECKARD
                  If she is, the machine works.

                                TYRELL
                  The machine works.  She is.

        Rachael sits very still.  Except her eyes -- they go to
        Tyrell and hang on.  He stares back at her as he speaks.

                                TYRELL
                  How many questions did it take?

                                DECKARD
                  Thirteen.

        Rachael sits rigidly in her chair, as the ground crumbles
        around her, her big mermaid eyes locked with Tyrell.
        His voice is quiet and strong, mesmerizing.  She's hang-
        ing by a thread.

        Deckard watches with a bas taste in his mouth.

                                DECKARD
                  She didn't know?

                                TYRELL
                  Memory implant.  She was programmed.
                  But I think she has transcended
                  her conditioning.  I think she was
                  beginning to suspect.

        Rachael nods fixedly.  Careful not to let go her grasp.

                                TYRELL
                  How many questions does it usually
                  take, Mr. Deckard?

                                DECKARD
                  Five, maybe six.

        Slowly, carefully, Tyrell unlocks his gaze from Rachael
        and turns towards Deckard, who is starting to put away
        his equipment.

                                TYRELL
                  You're going to have to be on your
                  toes, my friend.

        Deckard glances back at him.

                                TYRELL
                  It's a complex problem and we
                  wouldn't want anything to happen
                  to you.

        Less of a man might shrink at the end of Deckard's look,
        but not Tyrell.

                                TYRELL
                  For the good of all, I recommend
                  you take Rachael with you.
                  Considering her uniqueness, I'm
                  sure she could prove quite helpful.

        Deckard almost smiles at the nasty power of Tyrell's
        style.  He turns away and starts packing up the Voight-
        Kampff.

                                DECKARD
                  No thanks.

        Deckard is ready to go.

                                TYRELL
                  And how is it one man will be able
                  to cover so much ground?

                                DECKARD
                  Discreetly.

                                TYRELL
                  All pertinent information is
                  being fed into your departmental
                  computer, an Esper 231 -- I
                  believe -- and a photo over-lay
                  packet is being produced.

        Deckard opens the door.

                                TYRELL
                  Mr. Deckard, I think it would be
                  wise to reconsider my offer.

        Rachael sits there very pale and expressionless, her
        feet flat on the floor, alone is the word.

        Trying to keep the fury out of it, Deckard's voice
        comes out in a whisper.

                                DECKARD
                  I work alone.

        On the last word, Rachael glances up at him and Deckard
        turns away. The outer door slides open and he goes
        through it.

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     36

        As seen through the windshield from the passenger side
        of a vintage Dusenberg.  The headlights cut through the
        dark, illuminating a narrow strip of mountain road.  A
        downgrade.

        A sign slides by stating:  "Caution Curves Ahead."
        Good advice considering the sheer nightmare of a drop
        to the right and the wall of solid rock to the left.

        The steady HUM of the ENGINE and the HISS of the TIRES
        will remain, but the location suddenly changes to:

        INT. ROOM - NIGHT                                       37

        A pleasant place of soft light and domestic charm.  The
        young lady in the short dress is vacuuming the rug.
        Her back to the viewer.  As she bends over to vacuum
        beneath the couch, exposing her beautiful ass, an
        admonishment from a resonant and slightly tired MALE
        VOICE intercedes.

                                VOICE
                  Let's keep our eyes on the road,
                  Deckard.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  Sorry.

        Abruptly the VIEW FLASHES BACK TO:

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     38

        The moon is up there slicing through the trees, strobing
        over the hood of the car.  The road is getting steeper
        and the corners sharper.  Rags of mist skim by as the
        Dusenberg picks up speed.  It is becoming a riveting
        ride, but the passenger's mind moves elsewhere.

        EXT. WOODS - DAY                                        39

        Swift, soft clouds overhead.  In the cold shine of
        the icy light,the viewer walks down an aisle of maples
        and beeches, their clean hard limbs deflecting the
        frosty light, and underfoot the crisp, blue-white snow,
        melted through in spots, exposing soggy patches of rich
        brown earth.

                                VOICE
                  Come on, stay with the machine.

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     40

        The Dusenberg is going faster now, headlights eating
        up the road.  Rushing the corners in gut wrenching four-
        wheel drifts.  Not a pleasant sensation if you don't
        like roller-coasters.

        The Dusenberg slides out of a corner and faces a couple
        hundred yards of straightway leading to the next bend.

        Good place for a breather, but the driver shifts into
        high and screws on.

        EXT. LAKE - DAY                                         41

        Cold and gray.  The current running strong.  The nose
        of a kayak points through the swells, the viewer paddling
        for the shore.

        This is cold remote country, wild and untouched.  A sky
        bluer than the Madonna's cloak.  The kayak banks and
        the viewer steps out, moving over the sandy beach
        towards a little camp.

                                VOICE
                  We're going to have to start the
                  sequence again if you don't stay
                  with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  How do you know I'm not?

                                VOICE
                  You're not responding to the
                  stimulus.  I can see right here,
                  I'm not getting a reading.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  I'm tired of this.

                                VOICE
                  Almost through.

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     42

        In the Dusenberg the driver turns to look at the passen-
        ger, his specter-like face obscured by shadow, but by
        the glint of teeth, he must have just smiled.  And the
        passenger's view snaps back to the road.

        Suddenly another pair of headlights round the approach-
        ing bend.  Large ones, of a bus or a truck.  Blinding.

        The Dusenberg is going too fast to stop.  No room to
        pass.  HORNS BLAST.  The Dusenberg brakes, goes into a
        broadside skid.  The hands of the passenger reach out
        and grip the mahogany dash.  Brakes locked, TIRES
        SCREAMING, skidding.  The Dusenberg tears through the
        railing and plunges into space.  The last view of the
        passenger is pure vertigo.  Silence.

        INT. DOCTOR WHEELER'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON                43

        The good doctor is bending over his glass-top desk which
        resembles a pin-ball machine.  Displayed under its
        surface is a network of crisp electronic symbols and
        read-outs indicating the results of the test.

        Deckard detached the patches from his forehead, which
        it a little damp, but other than that, he looks no
        worse for wear, stands up to stretch and walks over to
        the doctor's desk.

                                DECKARD
                  So how did I do?

        Dr. Wheeler is a thin boney man, aloof but a promise
        of compassion in his sunken eyes.

                                WHEELER
                  Nerves of steel.

                                DECKARD
                  No rust?

                                WHEELER
                  I didn't say that.  Your motivity
                  rate checked out a little slower
                  than last time.

                                DECKARD
                  Meaning?

                                WHEELER
                  Meaning you don't run as fast as
                  you used to.

        Deckard starts to dress.

                                WHEELER
                  During the road test...

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah?

                                WHEELER
                  Your mind kept wandering.  That
                  bothered me.

                                DECKARD
                  Huh huh.

                                WHEELER
                  Considering the nature of your
                  work, that could be unhealthy.

                                DECKARD
                  True.

        Wheeler studies his "desk" for a moment and his finger
        comes down on the section illuminating Deckard's simple
        statistics.

                                WHEELER
                  You got a birthday coming up.

        Deckard bends over slipping on his shoes.  Wheeler looks
        up, concerned.

                                WHEELER
                  But you haven't put in for
                  emigration.

                                DECKARD
                  Nope.

                                WHEELER
                  You're going to be over the limit.

                                DECKARD
                  Listen, I could make you a long
                  list of complaints about this
                  fucken city but I still rather be
                  here than up there.

                                WHEELER
                  What if you change your mind?

                                DECKARD
                  They'll change the limit before
                  I change my mind.

                                WHEELER
                  You sure?

                                DECKARD
                  Never been more sure of anything
                  in my life.

        Deckard is ready to go.  Looking at Wheeler, a little
        touched with his concern.

                                DECKARD
                  Why didn't you go?

                                WHEELER
                  Too old.

                                DECKARD
                  But if you could?

        Wheeler considers it a moment, smiles and shakes his head.

                                WHEELER
                  My job is here.

                                DECKARD
                  Me too.

        They shake hands and Deckard walks.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON             44

        The referee is bouncing around the ring, trying to keep
        up with the two Mexican light-weights pounding the shit
        out of each other.  If not for the fuzz and the silence,
        the audio on the holoscope is off, you might think
        you were ringside at the Garden.  It's a good fight but
        Pris isn't watching.

        She's got her feet up on the couch painting her toe
        nails.  The room is so quiet you can almost hear the
        polish.  She starts on her fourth toe when a NOISE
        form above STOPS HER

        It sounded like a CREAKING of a FLOOR, but so quiet,
        sudden and over so fast it's hard to be sure.  She
        stares at the ceiling a moment, then glances at
        Sebastian.

        On the other side of the room, in his own world,
        Sebastian is peering into his magnifier, soldering
        gossamer strands with a laser.

        Pris has crossed the floor and is closing the door
        quietly behind her.  If the animoids nestled around
        the ledges of the room are capable of noticing, they'd
        be the only ones in the room who did.

        INT. CORRIDOR - SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTER-     45
        NOON

        Pris moving smoothly past the doors, some of them open
        and warped offering sights and shadow and decay.

        INT. FIRE STAIRS - SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTER-  46
        NOON

        The gloom in here is like the light of the empty well.
        Her feet against the metal steps reverberate in the
        hollow silence.

        INT. THE FLOOR ABOVE SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE       47
        AFTERNOON

        She's running now, down the hall, stops at the apart-
        ment directly above Sebastian's and opens the door.

        INT. APARTMENT ABOVE SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE       48
        AFTERNOON

        Mary turns her head as Pris comes in.  She's sitting in
        a chair.  The only piece of furniture in the room.
        It's broken and tilts at a funny angle.  She nods and
        Pris nods back.

        Batty is lying on his back, rolling his head slightly
        from side to side like he's soothing a stiff neck.

                                BATTY
                  What's going on down there?

                                PRIS
                  He's not ready yet.

                                BATTY
                  When?

                                PRIS
                  Tomorrow, he says.

        Batty nods he can't wait.  Pris glances at Mary and
        gives a frigid little smile.  Pris backs out and closes
        the door behind her.  Batty blows air through his
        nostrils.  Like an animal.

        EXT. DECKARD'S CAR - FREEWAY - NIGHT                    49

        The sky is streaked with remnants of a lingering dusk.
        Prisms of light flash over the sheen of Deckard's car
        as he cuts off the freeway and sweeps down the off-
        ramp curve.

        EXT./INT. CAR - STREETS - NIGHT                         50

        Moving through the dark city streets.  Deckard turns a
        corner and guns it up a long, steep hill.

        EXT. STREET - DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT               51

        At the top of the hill the car pulls into a drive and
        disappears into the subterranean garage of a high-rise.

        INT. CORRIDOR DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT               52

        He's coming down the hall carrying a foil wrapped
        plastic plate and stops in front of his door.  It's
        riddled with locks.  He slips a small device out of
        his pocket, aims it at the door and the locks unlock,
        the bolts slide open.  He walks in and kicks the door
        shut behind him.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        53

        He slips on the light and crosses the front room.
        Deckard is a pack rat -- hard to tell if he just moved
        in or is just moving out.

        As he enters the kitchen, the SOUND of SOMEBODY BEHIND
        him causes him to whirl around fast, hand snapped out
        in front of him, gun already in it.  Rachael almost got
        shot.  But she's unruffled, a little pale maybe, but
        direct as ever.  There's a long, chilly moment, then
        she almost smiles as her eyes move to the plate on the
        floor.

                                RACHAEL
                  Was that your dinner?

        Deckard looks down at the over-turned plate and nods.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'm sorry.  I called and found out
                  you were on your way home.  These
                  were already delivered to your
                  department but I thought you
                  should have copies as soon as
                  possible.

        She's holding out a cassette the size of a cigarette
        pack.  But it's taking Deckard's adrenalin time to
        recede.

                                RACHAEL
                  It's the Nexus information you
                  wanted.

        He takes the cassette, but a man with so many locks
        must be wondering how they were gotten through so easily.
        He doesn't even want to ask.

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

        He realizes he's still got the gun aimed at her and
        sticks it back in his belt and they're left staring
        at each other.  The situation makes awkward silence.
        At least for him.  She's looking at him like she's
        got something to say but isn't saying it.

                                DECKARD
                  Is there anything else?

                                RACHAEL
                  I know you think it complicates
                  your work, but I'm here to help.

                                DECKARD
                  I've already got more help than
                  I need.

                                RACHAEL
                  I think you need more help than
                  you've got.

        He doesn't, but she's not backing off.

                                RACHAEL
                  There's two reasons a man rejects
                  help.  Either because he's so good
                  at what he does he doesn't think
                  he needs it, or he's so insecure
                  he can't admit it.

                                DECKARD
                  Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either
                  way, but the answer is still no.

                                RACHAEL
                  Two of us might be more effective
                  than one.

                                DECKARD
                  I work alone.

        She smiles.

                                RACHAEL
                  No you don't.

        She lets it sink in.

                                RACHAEL
                  You use your equipment, don't you?

                                DECKARD
                  So?

                                RACHAEL
                  So, I'm a piece of equipment.
                  Use me.

        It's a strong look that passes between them -- a long
        one.  Maybe if he were on firmer ground he might do
        something about such an offer but...

        Deckard's eyes follow her down as Rachael bends to
        the floor and starts picking the food off the rug, put-
        ting it back on the plate.

                                DECKARD
                  That's okay, I'll get it...

        He bends down to help, but she's already done it.
        Their heads a few inches apart.  Something in her eyes
        diminishes the distance even more.

                                RACHAEL
                  Do I make you nervous?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'm sorry.

        And she is.  And suddenly he is too.  She hands him the
        plate and they stand.  She's looking at the floor,
        almost shy, then she looks up and he's watching her.
        She says it plain and simple.

                                RACHAEL
                  It's strange to suddenly realize
                  that what you thought was your
                  life is actually someone else's
                  fabrication.

        Deckard nods.  He feels it, but doesn't know what to
        do about it.

                                DECKARD
                  I can imagine.

                                RACHAEL
                  Can you?  I couldn't.

        These are not some of Deckard's finer moments.  But she
        doesn't seem to notice.

                                RACHAEL
                  A part of me is glad.  I think I
                  feel more.  I don't like who I was
                  before.

        Deckard nods, waits the respectable interval and is
        glad to have a plate to take into the kitchen.

        In the scrambled sanctuary of his kitchen Deckard looks
        around for a place to put the plate, but things have
        piled up on him in here.  He contemplates the refrig-
        erator.

                                DECKARD
                  So why do you think they were
                  after their records.

        He's a lot more comfortable talking shop.

                                RACHAEL
                  They probably want to find out
                  when they were made.

                                DECKARD
                  Right.

        He dumps his dinner in the garbage and comes back out.
        She's writing something on a card.

                                RACHAEL
                  I guess the date of your birth is
                  important if you know you're not
                  made to last.

        No way he can keep his foot out of it.  She looks up and
        hands him the card.

                                RACHAEL
                  That's my number.  If you need me.

        She goes to the door, opens it but hesitates before
        going through.

                                RACHAEL
                  You better get better locks --
                  if you want to keep me out.

        She looks back at him and smiles -- the smile says
        she's talking about all kinds of locks.  Deckard looks
        like he might ask her to stay, but...

                                RACHAEL
                  Good night.

        And she's gone.

                                DECKARD
                  Night.

        He looks down at the number.  It's the back side of a
        snapshot.   He turns it over.  The picture of a man
        and a woman.  The little girl between them looks like
        a six-year old Rachael.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        54

        He's sitting in front of his console studying pictures
        of Nexus Sixes at they appear, blank-faced, hairless
        and unadorned on his monitor.

        The over-lay machine is transforming each image with
        instant attributes; hair, moustaches, teeth, eye colors,
        age, youth, hats, glasses, etc.  All in rapid succession,
        running the gambit from ominous to beautiful.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  The possibilities were infinite.
                  They could change their appearances
                  but not their future.
                  Like she said, it was short.
                  Longevity is what they were after.
                  The garbage man even wanted a past.
                  Poor fuck.  I'd check it out but
                  I knew she was right.  The market
                  worked on turn-over.  Built-in
                  obsolescence was the name of the
                  game.  That meant her too.  It
                  was something I didn't want to
                  think about.

        On top of the monitor there's an open can of beans with
        a spoon stuck in it.  Deckard puts out his cigarette
        and reaches for them as the PHONE RINGS.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                BRYANT
                  Bryant here.  Regarding the
                  rundown you requested on job
                  applicants, Esper's concluded that
                  the only irregular category that
                  Tyrell's got is the entertainment
                  section.  You better get on it.

                                DECKARD
                  I was just about to have my dinner.

                                BRYANT
                  If you hurry you'll get back
                  before it gets cold.  I got a
                  spinner on your roof in five
                  minutes.  Good luck.

        Deckard hangs up and looks at the beans.  He didn't
        want them anyway.  He gets up and walks to the bedroom.
        Looks through the pile of clothes on the floor, finds
        his ankle laser and straps it on.

        EXT. CITY - BIRD'S EYE VIEW - NIGHT                     55

        The spinner skirts through the canyons of the city.
        Deckard, sitting in the contoured seat, watches the
        maze of suspension bridges, platforms and catwalks
        swing by below.  The tops of larger buildings shimmer
        with advertisements and weather announcements.

        INT. SPINNER - OVER CITY - NIGHT                        56

        Deckard is cruising low and slow over the city listen-
        ing to Esper.

        EXT./INT. SPINNER - LANDING AREA - NIGHT                57

        Deckard taking it down.  About to pull it in an already
        crowded lot, but the sign flashes "FULL."  Deckard
        doesn't believe in signs; is about to set it down any-
        way when a Chicano in a fluorescent coat runs out and
        waves him off.

                                DECKARD
                  Fuck.

        Pissed, Deckard veers away and buzzes low over and
        around the roof tops, all dark and cramped -- not a
        lot of room around here.

        EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                      58

        Finally brings it down between two buildings hardly
        enough clearance, but he jockeys the machine into an
        alley, touches down and runs it slowly along the surface
        -- parking it by a sign that says "NO PARKING."

        EXT. STREET - TAFFEY'S BAR - NIGHT                      59

        Not many people.  Wind blowing.  A nest of garish
        small-time clubs.

        Deckard emerges from one, goes into the next.  The
        pulsing neon over the entry says "TAFFEY'S BAR."

        INT. TAFFEY'S BAR - NIGHT                               60

        Crowded in here.  BONGO MUSIC.  Deckard is at the bar
        sitting next to a big-bellied man in a black beard who's
        looking through a viewer.  On the small stage in the
        background AMAZING RAMA is eating razor blades, a part
        of her juggling routine.

        Deckard leaves the bar and walks down a hall towards a
        door at the rear.

        INT. TAFFEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT                            61

        Taffey's what's referred to in the trade as a "Chicken
        Hawk" collector of young girls.

        It must be so, there's one in the bed.  Thin, pale,
        about thirteen years old, eyes rolled up under her
        fluttering eyelids, wires attached to her forehead,
        lying flat on her back in Taffey's crowded little
        room.

        Taffey's a little fella with wide hips and narrow
        shoulders, wears a jet black toupe and has a face like
        a seal.  But at the moment he's not present.

        There's a KNOCK at the DOOR, then the SOUND of a TOILET
        FLUSHING.  Taffey comes out of the bathroom, heart
        pounding under his polyester bathrobe, and approaches
        the door like the guilty fucker he is.  He looks through
        the peeper.

        Deckard is out there holding up his I.D.

                                DECKARD
                  Taffey Lewis?

                                TAFFEY
                  Yes?

                                DECKARD
                  Can I come in?

        There is a pause lasting the time it takes Taffey not
        to think of a way to say no.  The door opens and Deckard
        enters.  Except for the drool coming out of the corner of
        her mouth, and the fluttering eye-lids, Venus doesn't
        move a muscle.

                                TAFFEY
                  Excuse my niece there... She's
                  studying for an exam.

        Deckard takes the  Identikit hard copies our of his
        pocket and pushing some junk out of the way, fans them
        out on the table.

                                DECKARD
                  I'd like  you to take a look at
                  these pictures.

                                TAFFEY
                  Of course.

        Taffey bends down really close, peering at the pictures
        from about two inches away.

                                TAFFEY
                  You see I lost my contacts a
                  couple of days ago around here
                  somewhere and my sight is a
                  little... What am I supposed
                  to be looking for?

                                DECKARD
                  Do you recognize any of
                  them?

        He stops at Zhora.

                                TAFFEY
                  This one looks familiar, but
                  I don't know.  Naw.  There's
                  one came in today looks a
                  little like this one but...

                                DECKARD
                  What did she want?

                                TAFFEY
                  Who?

                                DECKARD
                  The girl that doesn't look
                  like that girl.

                                TAFFEY
                  Nothing.  She wanted to know
                  about suck night.

                                DECKARD
                  What night?

                                TAFFEY
                  I didn't know if I wanted to
                  handle her -- I already got
                  a snake act.  But my partner
                  goes down there to the Opera
                  House on suck night to book
                  the good ones.

                                DECKARD
                  What's suck night?

                                TAFFEY
                  That's what we call in the
                  trade, audition free-for-
                  alls and most of it sucks.
                  Bit I don't think that's
                  her.

                                DECKARD
                  You talking about the Opera
                  House on the Main?

        Taffey nods.  Deckard goes to the door and turns.

                                DECKARD
                  Book the good ones for where?

                                TAFFEY
                  Lots of places.  The tours,
                  the clubs, the Silicone shows,
                  private parties.

                                DECKARD
                  What shows?

                                TAFFEY
                  Silicone Valley.  Lots of
                  these science guys never
                  leave that place.  We book
                  two shows a month in there.
                  Those big time techs and bio-
                  guys might be real high zoners
                  up here, but when it comes
                  to the arts, they like it loud
                  and lewd.

        It's starting to get a little gooey.  Deckard tips his
        head good night and backs out of the door.

        INT. THE OLD OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT                        62

        Onstage four Mexican acrobats, in matching metallic
        jumpsuits roll head over heels in their rendition of
        a human wheel.  From the P.A. system the Announcer's
        voice blares through the cavernous theatre.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  Let's hear it for the Hermano
                  Brothers.

        Scattered APPLAUSE.  Hand in hand, the Hermano Brothers
        bow deeply, spring up and trot offstage.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  Next we're gonna see a little
                  charmer who keeps her dancing
                  partner in a basket!  She
                  comes to us all the way from
                  exotic Casablanca.  'Salome.'

        The old boys in the pit strike up a tinny version
        of "In a Persian Market" as SALOME dances onstage.
        She's a black-haired beauty in a scant belly dancer
        costume, a couple of pounds overweight but all in
        the right places.  She kneels ceremoniously center
        stage and sets the basket down before her.  Carefully
        removing the lid, she reaches in and lifts out a four-
        foot harlequin-patterned python.  Grinding her hips
        to the music, she rises, holding the coiling snake out
        like an offering.  Sounds of approval from the audience.
        The gold coins covering her breasts jingle and shimmer,
        as she weaves sensuously around the floor.

        INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                                  63

        To scattered APPLAUSE, HOOTS and WHISTLES, Salome
        flounces offstage, the snake hung around her shoul-
        ders, looking limp, and makes her way through the
        narrow corridor to her dressing room.  She's about
        to enter when:

                                DECKARD
                  Excuse me, Miss Salome.

        She turns.  Deckard's posture and attitude suggest hum-
        ble, sleazy persistence.  He comes closer with his
        shit-eating grin.

                                DECKARD
                  I'd like to have a word with you
                  if I could.

        Salome stands almost six feet high in her high heels
        -- she looks down on him with the haughty suspicion
        of a chick who knows how to handle cheap hits.

                                SALOME
                  Yeah?

                                DECKARD
                  I'm with the American Federation
                  of Variety Artists...

        He holds up a hand as if to stop her from protesting.

                                DECKARD
                  Don't worry, I'm not here to make
                  you join -- that's not my department.

        He glances around like a guy who's not supposed to be
        there.

                                DECKARD
                  I'm an investigator for the
                  Confidential Committee on Moral
                  Abuses.

        She nods, taking it a little more seriously.

                                DECKARD
                  There's been reports of management
                  sexually abusing the artists in
                  this place.

                                SALOME
                  I don't know nothing about it.

                                DECKARD
                  You haven't felt yourself to be
                  exploited by the management in any
                  way?

        She's definitely puzzled.

                                SALOME
                  How do you mean 'exploited'?

                                DECKARD
                  Like to get this position.  Did
                  you or were you asked to do anything
                  lewd or unsavory or otherwise
                  repulsive to your person?

                                SALOME
                  Are you for real?

                                DECKARD
                  Oh, yeah.
                  You'd be surprised what goes on
                  around here.  I'd like to check
                  the dressing room if I could.

                                SALOME
                  What the fuck for?

                                DECKARD
                  For holes.

        This guy might be an asshole but he's funny.

                                SALOME
                  I don't believe this.

        She shrugs and they go in.

        INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT                              64

        Musty and cramped.  A portable shower, a dressing table
        and not much else.  Salome takes the snake from around
        her shoulders and lays it on the dressing table.  Deck-
        ard watches it undulate into the warmth of the lights.

                                DECKARD
                  It that mother real?

                                SALOME
                  Of course he's not real.  You think
                  I'd be working here if I could
                  afford a real snake?

                                DECKARD
                  It's a good job.

                                SALOME
                  You mean the snake.

        Deckard nods.  There's not much costume to take off but
        she's doing it.

                                SALOME
                  The best.

                                DECKARD
                  Does it eat?

                                SALOME
                  Come on.

        His hand reaches out to touch it.  As his fingers make
        contact there's an electric "snap."  He jerks his hand
        back from the shock.

                                SALOME
                  Jeezus!

                                DECKARD
                  Sorry.

                                SALOME
                  Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck
                  mine, huh?

        She slides behind the screen and turns on the shower.
        Deckard starts creeping around pacing around the room
        like he's inspecting the walls.

                                DECKARD
                  They have their ways of doing
                  their dirty work without the
                  victim knowing what's going on.

        His eyes are moving over everything she's got.

                                DECKARD
                  You'd be surprised what a guy'll
                  go through to get a glimpse of a
                  beautiful body.

                                SALOME
                  I bet I would.

                                DECKARD
                  Little dirty holes the bastards
                  drill in the wall so they can
                  watch a lady undress.

        And to his amazement he actually spots one.  It's down
        low on the wall.  Not a good idea to turn his back on
        work but he can't resist.

                                SALOME
                  And what if somebody did try to
                  'exploit' me?  Who do I go to?

        Through the hole Deckard is looking at a pair of fat
        legs.

                                DECKARD
                  Me.

                                SALOME
                  And who do I go to about you?

        He looks back.  She's some out of the shower dripping
        nude.  She's taken off her black wig.  Her hair is
        short and blonde.

        Deckard recognizes her immediately from the identikit.
        He stares at her a moment too long.

                                DECKARD
                  Hmmmmm?

        Deckard grins and she returns it.

        She takes a towel off the table and starts to dry her
        body.  The snake noses through the cosmetics, tongue
        flicking trying to get back to its mistress.  Absently,
        she reaches out to stroke the snake and suddenly laughs.

                                ZHORA
                  You ever get the feeling things
                  aren't the way they seem?

        Her hand closes around the snake's head.  Deckard sees
        it coming but can't move fast enough.  She strikes him
        so hard it knocks him off his feet.  Before he hits the
        floor, she kicks him in the stomach.  The snake whistles
        through the air again as Deckard rolls out of the way.
        It slams down so hard it ruptures against the floor.
        He goes for his laser, but she's already out the door.

        INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                                 65

        Deckard bounds out of the room and sees her go through
        a door at the other end of the hall.  He sprints after
        her, arrives at the door and flings it open.  Black-
        ness.  The SOUND of her high heels CLATTER down the
        metal steps.

        EXT. STREET - OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT                       66

        It's raining heavily.

        The front of the Opera House is open only to foot traf-
        fic these days.  A bizarre place on a Friday night,
        hawkers and whores, the rabble, the poor and the cur-
        ious mill around the randy-built platforms and brightly
        lit stands.   Zhora, in just a raincoat, is not out of
        place in this flea market atmosphere.  Trying not to
        run, she slices through the mob as quickly as she can.
        Deckard is not far behind, dodging and side-stepping,
        trying to move against the tide of people scurrying for
        shelter.

        She comes to an intersection and turns out of the mall
        onto a less crowded street.  She glances over her
        shoulder as she breaks into a run and runs right into
        a couple of pedestrians.  All three go down.

        Deckard comes out of the crowd in time to spot her get-
        ting to her feet.  She sees him and runs.  The two ped-
        estrians are in his line of fire.  He runs past them
        and drops to one knee, leveling his laser.

                                DECKARD
                  Stop or you're dead!

        She doesn't.  The beam flashes through the air, but
        she's already around the corner.

        With his bottom lip between his teeth, it hurts to move
        so fast, Deckard jack-legs it into the street and jumps
        in front of the first car coming.  It screeches to a
        stop.  Deckard scrambles for the door, but the guy be-
        hind the wheel has other ideas.  He peels out fast.

        The next car slows down and swerves trying not to hit
        him.  Deckard goes for the door and before the old ma-
        tron inside can lock it, Deckard's yanked it open and
        jumps in.  She screams as he pushes her into the pas-
        senger seat and jams the car into a wrenching about
        face.  The lady squeals like a pig as the momentum
        plasters her against the door.

        Deckard slams it around the corner and guns it down the
        street.  It's long and it's empty and it's going by fast.
        Nothing the old lady cares to see -- she's got her hands
        over her eyes, whimpering, hoping she'll faint before
        she dies.

        Deckard takes the next left so hard he almost lays it
        over.  As the car bounces off the curb he floors it.

        Zhora's a hundred yards ahead, halfway down the street,
        trying to make it back into the crowded mall.  She's
        running fast, but the car is faster.

        As he passes her, Deckard hits the brakes and skids
        broadside seventy feet.  The door flies open and he
        rolls out FIRING.

        Zhora's ducking it with no where to go, except...

        The showcase window on her left EXPLODES as she crashes
        through.

        It's a corner shop joined to a series of stores, front-
        ing the mall.  Deckard runs to the opening she's made
        and pours FIRE through the tunnel of her jagged wake as
        Zhora breaks through one window after another, getting
        sliced, getting shot, trying to get away from Deckard's
        laser.  But she doesn't.

        His last shot burns a hole through the base of her
        skull.  It kills her but doesn't stop her.  Her speed
        takes what's left of her through the last two windows
        and into the street where she runs into a parked car
        with such force that she embeds herself in the side of
        it.

        Hunched over, breathing hard, Deckard comes slowly for-
        ward.  The crowd starting to gather.  There's something
        for everybody and they're coming from all directions.

        Deckard moves through them, edging to have a look.

        It's not a good thing to see.  It looks like Salome
        and the car tries to eat each other.  A bloody feast
        of metal and flesh.

        Deckard bows his head, sick, exhausted.  So much commo-
        tion he doesn't notice THREE COPS closing in from
        behind.

                                COP
                  Drop it!

        Deckard has his back to them.  They're fanned out and
        crouched, ready to fire.  Deckard drops his laser.  Two
        of them rush up, spin him around while the third does a
        frisk.

        TWO MORE COPS arrive, wary and wild-eyed, pushing the
        people back -- his is not a good place for cops.

        Deckard's ankle laser is discovered by the Cop frisking
        him.  With a snarl he pulls it out and hands it back to
        the SERGEANT covering the action.

                                SERGEANT
                  On your belly!

        Deckard's not in the mood for it.

                                DECKARD
                  Listen, Sergeant...

        He's reaching for his ID.  The Cop with the rubber
        billy hits him in the head.

        One thrill after another.  Somebody in the crowd YEOWLS.
        The last thing Deckard hears as he falls.  The Cop
        reaches inside Deckard's coat for the concealed weapon
        they missed, but it's an ID card.  He looks at it for a
        moment, then looks up.

                                COP
                  Hey, Sarge, this guy's a cop.

        An embarrassing situation.

                                SERGEANT
                  Clear this fuckin' crowd.

        The Cops start pushing.  And for one split second one
        of the crowd looks a lot like Leon.

        INT. OLD OPERA HOUSE - MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT               67

        Your standard low class crapper.  Bryant is planted
        firmly on the cracked tile floor next to the urinals
        rubbing his face, trying not to pop the clutch in his
        anger.  This is a public place, he doesn't want to
        yell.

                                BRYANT
                  Just because it's a Nexus 6 doesn't
                  change procedure.  A little known
                  fact can become a well-known fact
                  and part of our job, Deckard, is
                  to make sure that doesn't happen.
                  Now how can be do that if you blow
                  one away in front of a fuckin'
                  audience.

        It's not the sort of question that expects an answer.
        Deckard's washing his face in the basin hoping it'll
        all go away.

                                BRYANT
                  Well?

        Deckard looks up dripping, reaches for a paper towel.
        Bryant slaps one in his hand.

                                DECKARD
                  She was gonna get away.

                                BRYANT
                  Then let her get away.  I thought
                  you were a pro -- you're supposed
                  to be a fuckin' tracker!

        Bryant takes a couple of deep breaths.

                                BRYANT
                  I'd say you got a little carried
                  away.

        Deckard's voice is barely audible.

                                DECKARD
                  I didn't like her.

                                BRYANT
                  You didn't like her!?

        He slams the handle on one of the urinals.

                                BRYANT
                  You start liking or disliking
                  andies it's time to hang it up.

        The PLUMPING ROARS and SUCKS and DIES.  There's nothing
        to do but nod.  Deckard nods.  Poor bastard has had a
        rough night.  Bryant pulls a flask out of his coat and
        hands it to him.  Deckard puts it to his mouth and
        Bryant watches Deckard's Adam's apple like he's count-
        ing the swallows.  Deckard hands it back empty.  Bryant
        caps it, puts it back in his pocket.

                                BRYANT
                  Look, go home.  Get some rest.
                  Take an aspirin.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

        Bryant shuffles out like an old bear.

        INT. OLD OPERA HOUSE - BAR - NIGHT                      68

        Cheap whiskey and bad wine.  That's the kind of place
        this is.  It's near closing.  But still a few at the
        bar.  Alcoholic silhouettes.

        In the b.g. Deckard comes down the passage from the
        men's room and stops at the phone.  He gets a number
        out of his pocket and calls it.  As he talks he leans
        against the wall, his body language intimate and chummy.

        Not much action at the bar other than somebody snoring
        and a dipso down at the end having a conversation with
        himself.

        Deckard hangs up, walks to the bar and straggles a
        stool.  The BARTENDER's a big lady with tits like sand
        bags and a voice that plays no favorites.

                                BARTENDER
                  I can't protect your drinks,
                  mister; while you was in the
                  potty, this hummer snatched it.

        Deckard glances at his stool-mate.  A huge MAN, slumped
        over the bar like a beached whale.

                                DECKARD
                  No problem.  Gimme another.

        The whale doesn't move, but it speaks, with a gravelly
        Russian accent.

                                RUSSIAN
                  Forgive me.  I thought was free
                  drink.  I will pay.

                                DECKARD
                  Forget it.

        But the big man's digging through his pockets.  Deck-
        ard's drink arrives and the Russian raises his head.
        It's a big melancholy face with a glint of warmth in
        his red-rimmed eyes and a smile that could melt your
        heart.  But it's Leon.

                                LEON
                  I think I have no money.

                                DECKARD
                  It's okay.  Forget it.

                                LEON
                  But I would like to buy you drink.

                                DECKARD
                  I'll but you one.  What'll you
                  have?

                                LEON
                  Vodka!

                                DECKARD
                  Shot of vodka, please.

                                LEON
                  Thank you very much.

                                DECKARD
                  My pleasure.

        Deckard brings out his smokes.  Offers one.  Leon takes
        it and they light up.  The drinks come.

                                LEON
                  Prosit.

                                DECKARD
                  Prosit.

        Down the hatch.  Leon slaps his glass on the bar, reach-
        es into his pocket, brings out a little match box and
        slaps that down too.  It's done with such pride that
        Deckard has to look.

                                LEON
                  You want to see my friends?

                                DECKARD
                  Sorry, don't have the time.

                                LEON
                  No problem.

        Leon smiles broadly and with ceremonious care opens the
        box and dumps three live cockroaches on the bar.

                                DECKARD
                  Those cockroaches?

                                LEON
                  Ya.

        Deckard looks interested.  One of them starts to scamp-
        er away, but Leon walls off the next with his huge hand.

                                DECKARD
                  How long you had these guys?

                                LEON
                  Two months.  But this one is not
                  guy.  It is girl.  His girl.

        Leon leans closer like he doesn't want the cockroaches
        to hear.

                                LEON
                  Usually Blackie waits until Igor
                  is eating; then, when his back is
                  turned, he tries to take advantage
                  of Anna.

        Deckard nods, definitely interested.  He signals the
        bartender for another round.  The drinks arrive.

                                LEON
                  Prosit.

                                DECKARD
                  Prosit.

        Down the hatch.  Their eyes meet at the bottom.

                                LEON
                  You never saw a cockroach make
                  love?

        Deckard shakes his head, but he'd like to.

        Leon smiles slyly.

                                LEON
                  We will try.

        Leon brings a cube of sugar out of his pocket and puts
        it on the bar.  They both lean down and watch intently.
        The drinks come and are put away, but the cockroaches
        are not cooperating.

                                LEON
                  It must be that he is not hungry
                  or maybe she is not hot.

        Leon is catching the roaches and one by one puts them
        back in their box.  He holds up the last and kisses it.

                                LEON
                  You like to kiss her goodbye.

                                DECKARD
                  No thanks.

                                BARTENDER
                  Make sure you take your girlfriends
                  with you when you leave.

        What neither of them notices is that between Leon's
        fingers, his stub of his cigarette is burning his flesh.

        Deckard lifts his glass, it is empty.

                                LEON
                  I like you.

                                DECKARD
                  I like you too.

                                LEON
                  One more, eh?

                                DECKARD
                  I gotta piss.

        Deckard gets on his feet, leans forward like a man in
        a stiff wind and stops.

                                DECKARD
                  I think I'll piss outside.

        Leon watches his walk a perfect straight line through
        the bar down the passage and out of the rear exit.

        EXT. ALLEY - OLD OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT                    69

        Deckard reels out.  The door swings shut and he's sober
        as hell and moving fast.  Around the big trash dumpster
        alongside the building, he plasters himself against the
        wall and his gun is out, aimed at the door.  He's in a
        good spot with a perfect line of fire.  Moments go by
        and he's glad for the time to steady himself.  The
        SOUND of his BREATHING, the HUM of the city and the
        quiet.

        Suddenly from behind, Deckard is swept off his feet and
        twirled around in Leon's bear-trap embrace.

        Leon lets go and Deckard hits the pavement, skidding
        hard enough to tear clothes and burn skin, but he rolls
        out of it and comes up with gun in hand; but Leon is so
        fast he's already there and kicks it out of his hand.

        Leon moves towards him, backing Deckard against the wall.

                                LEON
                  How come you know where Zhora was
                  so quick?

        His hand is lightning.  It shoots out, grabs Deckard's
        hair.

                                DECKARD
                  I showed pictures.  Somebody
                  recognized her.  I went to see.

        Deckard is pale.  The sweat is starting to run.

                                LEON
                  How old am I?

                                DECKARD
                  I don't know.

        The grip tightens and twists.

                                LEON
                  My birthday is April 10, 2015.
                  How long do I live?

                                DECKARD
                  Four years.

        He lets go.

                                LEON
                  More than you.

        Deckard's knees come up fast.  Leon's fist comes down
        faster, like a hammer.

                                LEON
                  Painful to live in fear, isn't it.

        Deckard is doubled over, hugging his thigh.

                                LEON
                  But that's how it is to be a
                  slave.  The future is sealed off,
                  he grovels, he waits.

        Even hurt, Deckard is fast.  He goes for his ankle gun,
        but Leon's got it out of his hand before he can even
        raise it and throws it down the alley.

        Deckard hurls forward, knocking him off balance, and
        scrambles to get away.  Leon grabs him by the foot,
        drags him back and jerks him off the ground.

                                LEON
                  Sex, reproduction, security, the
                  simple things.  But no way to
                  satisfy them.  To be homesick
                  with no place to go.  Potential
                  with no way to use it.  Lots of
                  little oversights in the Nexus 6.

        He slams Deckard into the wall.

                                LEON
                  I tell you, nothing is worse
                  than having an itch you can never
                  scratch.

        Deckard slides down the wall to his knees and huddles,
        protecting his head with his arms, waiting for the next
        one.

        Leon folds his big hands together and raises them over
        his head, pausing just a second to savor the satisfac-
        tion of smashing Deckard's skull.

        The spasm that runs through Leon's face is not from
        satisfaction.  It's the bullet that went through his
        neck.  He hits the ground hard, his big teeth biting
        the air like a rabid dog.  Dead.

        Rachael is standing in the alley.  Deckard lies there
        looking at her.  She comes slowly and quietly forward
        and drops Deckard's gun by his side.

        Deckard gets to his hands and knees and tries to get
        up, but can't quite manage it.  He looks up at her,
        panting, spits blood and almost smiles.

                                DECKARD
                  Like I said, I don't need your
                  help.

        After a long moment, she bends down to touch him.

                                RACHAEL
                  You look terrible, you know that?

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT             70

        He's lying in the tub with a drink, eyes half mast,
        water up to his chin, bruised and beat, but looking
        just a little wicked in his balmy luxury.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  I knew a cop once who was involved
                  in a high-speed chase.  They shot
                  out one of his tires and he went
                  over a cliff at hundred and fifty
                  miles an hour.  They found him in
                  the morning with a broken skull,
                  six fractured ribs and second-
                  degree burns.  On the way to the
                  hospital he made a play for the
                  nurse.

        He takes a drink and clears his throat.

                                DECKARD
                  Hey!  I thought you were supposed
                  to be taking care of me.

                                RACHAEL'S VOICE
                  What do you need?

        He doesn't answer.  Lies there sipping his drink.
        Rachael comes in a little uncertain, a little droll,
        and stands there looking down at him.

                                DECKARD
                  Don't just stand there looking at
                  me.  It's not polite.

                                RACHAEL
                  What do you want me to do?

                                DECKARD
                  Sit.

        She sits on the edge of the tub.

                                DECKARD
                  Gimme your arm.

        She's wearing a short-sleeved dress.  It's a long, del-
        icate arm and Deckard holds it, inspecting it like a
        maestro with a Stradivarius.  He looks up at her.

                                DECKARD
                  You ever take a bath with a man
                  before?

                                RACHAEL
                  There's a lot I haven't done with
                  a man before.

        He's got her hand in the water and had begun to soap
        her arm.  Starting with her wrist and running the bar
        to her elbow, up and down, slow and slippery.  She
        watches, not quite sure of the ritual.

        He pulls her closer, and runs his hand up higher, mould-
        ing and pressing, working around her flesh, up and under
        her arm into the privacy of her dress.

                                RACHAEL
                  You're getting me wet.

        Oh, yes.  For a moment Deckard stares at her like some
        furry-legged satyr in rut, the fingers of his other
        hand rake through her hair and into the water she comes.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING            71

        The bed looks like it was hit by a storm and Deckard
        looks like something that was washed up in it.  He's
        spread out flat, face creased and puffed.

        His eyes squint open, but only for a moment.  His
        hands are more reliable.  They search over the bed,
        but find it bare.  He edges his head over the side,
        looking around for signs, but she's all gone.  He
        gets up in two stages, sits and then stands.  Then
        sits again, resting his head in his hands.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MORNING           72

        Deckard's got his face in the mirror shaving it.  It's
        been a long night.  Nothing a new tongue and a trans-
        fusion wouldn't put right.  He moves a couple of inches
        to the left so his eyes have a view of the tub.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING        73

        Deckard is on the edge of the couch with the phone on
        his knees, the card with Rachael's number in his lap
        and having no luck.

                                RACHAEL'S VOICE
                  Sorry, I am not in at the moment,
                  but if you'll leave your name and
                  number I'll return your call as
                  soon as I can.

        That's not soon enough.  Deckard hangs up, puts the
        phone on the floor and leans back on the couch.

                                DECKARD
                  Fuck you, then.

        INT. MR. DEETCHUM'S APARTMENT - MORNING                 74

        The rooster perched on the chair spreading its scrawny
        wings, strains from the tips of its toes, crowing at
        the ceiling.  Between crows there's a TAPPING at the
        door.

        You might call this a "barnyard" apartment.  There's
        straw on the floor and several hens roosting against
        the back wall.  The front door opens a few inches and
        Sebastian pokes his head in.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Mr. Deetchum?  Hello?

        Nobody seems to be home except his chickens.  As Sebas-
        tian enters, closing the door behind him, a goose
        charges out of the bedroom hissing and honking.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Now, now, Waddles.

        Seeming to recognize Sebastian as no intruder, Waddles
        veers off from the attack.  As Sebastian crosses the
        room a pig peeks out from behind the couch.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Hello, Wrigley.

        He goes to the chickens and collects some eggs, putting
        them into a bowl he's brought.  He puts down the bowl
        and reaching into his pocket carefully counts out the
        payment and puts the money on a plate.  He's about to
        leave but notices there's no water in the dispenser.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Mr. Deetchum isn't taking very
                  good care of you people.

        Pouring from a jug on the table, he fills the dispenser
        with water, scatters a little grain on the floor, gets
        his bowel of eggs and leaves.

        Wrigley grunts and comes out from behind the couch for
        a long drink.

        INT. CORRIDOR - SEBASTIAN'S FLOOR - MORNING             75

        Sebastian arrives on his floor, walks down the hall to
        his apartment, opens the door, walks in.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY                        76

        He turns to close door, comes face to face with Roy
        Batty.  Sebastian drops his bowl of eggs.  Batty's
        hand flashes out and catches it.

                                BATTY
                  Whoops.

        Smiling, Batty hands them back to Sebastian, who is
        too startled to speak.

        Pris runs up and gives Batty and Mary a big hug, steps
        back effusing and smiling, everybody's favorite teen-
        ager.

                                PRIS
                  This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.

                                BATTY
                  Hello, glad to meet you.

        He pumps Sebastian's free hand.

                                PRIS
                  And my Aunt Mary.

        Sebastian turns and there's Aunt Mary, modest and warm.

                                PRIS
                  And this is my savior, J.F. Sebastian,
                  everybody.

        Sebastian stands there with his eggs, bashful and ex-
        cited, the hero of this little family's warm attention.

                                BATTY
                  Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian.
                  If you hadn't come along...

                                MARY
                  We were worried to death.  It's
                  awfully kind of you.

        Sebastian is nodding and smiling.

                                BATTY
                  We're not used to the big city.
                  Where we come from it's not so
                  easy to get lost.

                                MARY
                  You certainly have a nice place
                  here.

                                BATTY
                  Well stocked.

        Batty looks around admiringly.  Sebastian mumbles some-
        thing that sounds like "Thank you."

                                PRIS
                  Sebastian doesn't like to go out
                  too much.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I keep a lot of provisions right
                  here.

                                BATTY
                  I like a man who stays put.  An
                  admirable thing to be able to
                  sustain yourself in these times.
                  You live here all by yourself, do
                  you?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Well, no, not really.  There's
                  Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman,
                  he lives on the first floor.

        Everybody nods.  A long pause.

                                MARY
                  We haven't found it easy, Mr.
                  Sebastian.

        They glance around the room, waiting for Sebastian to
        pick up the ball.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  How about breakfast, I was just
                  going to make some.

                                BATTY
                  If it wouldn't be too much of a
                  bother... a little bite to eat
                  would be...

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.

                                BATTY
                  Well, actually

                                MARY
                  We're famished.

        Sebastian is truly happy.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Okay, then.  You make yourselves
                  comfortable and I'll bring the
                  food right out.

        He disappears into the kitchen.  Batty looks happy with
        the way things are going.

                                BATTY
                  Charming.

        Pris comes up close.  Her tone muted but demanding.

                                PRIS
                  Well?

        Batty finds her attitude amusing, which makes her even
        more pugnacious.

                                PRIS
                  I want to know what's going on.

        There's a punitive edge to Batty's response.

                                BATTY
                  There's only three of us left.

        Pris is shocked.  Her whisper comes out a hiss.

                                PRIS
                  Then we're stupid and we'll die.

                                BATTY
                  Not if everybody is doing their
                  job here at home.  How are things
                  at home?

        A little spotted pig on the table sits up.

                                PIG
                  Home again, jiggidy jig.

        They all turn and stare at the pig.  Batty is delighted.

                                PRIS
                  I don't trust him.  I don't think
                  he knows what he's doing.

        The BELL-TONE from the microwave goes off in the kitchen.

                                BATTY
                  He knows what he's doing.

                                MARY
                  If he won't cooperate?

                                BATTY
                  Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants
                  to be appreciated.  We'll
                  appreciate him and he'll cooperate.

        INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR AND ROOM - DAY                   77

        Holden is laid out in an apparatus that resembles an
        iron lung.  A little above his head, facing him, is a
        bank of bio-feedback lights registering body functions.

        Deckard is in a chair sitting next to his friend.

        Holden has lost weight, his face is grey, he can't
        move his head, but he's smiling like the cat who ate
        the canary.

                                DECKARD
                  How are you doing, old man?

        Holden's voice is just a whisper -- the kind of whisper
        that comes out of the joker at the back of the class.

                                HOLDEN
                  I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm
                  not really great, but I feel just
                  great.  How you like my new suit?

                                DECKARD
                  Well, you don't have to worry
                  about getting it wrinkled.

        Holden's eyes close, his smile gets bigger and little
        spasms of laughter pump out of his mouth.

                                HOLDEN
                  Don't make me laugh.  It makes me
                  pee.

                                DECKARD
                  Sorry.

                                HOLDEN
                  Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee.
                  So how are you doing?

                                DECKARD
                  I'm doing okay.

                                HOLDEN
                  From what I hear you're doing
                  great.  Bryant tells me you're
                  going like a god damn one-man
                  army.  Making a lot of money, huh?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.
                         (pause)
                  But that's what I wanted to talk
                  to you about.

                                HOLDEN
                  Money?

                                DECKARD
                  No.  I got a problem.

                                HOLDEN
                  Let's hear it.

                                DECKARD
                  I think I'm starting to empathize
                  with these Nexus-sixes.

        Holden giggles.  Starts to laugh again.  A blue light
        on the panel begins to turn very bright.  They both
        notice it.

                                DECKARD
                  What's that?

                                HOLDEN
                  I'm taking a piss.

        They wait for the light to abate.

                                HOLDEN
                  Let me ask you something, Deck.
                  You been having intimate relations
                  with one of these units?

        Deckard doesn't deny it.  Holden smiles like a cherub.

                                HOLDEN
                  That's what I thought... one of
                  the liabilities of the trade --
                  you has sex with your prey, old
                  buddy.  That's bound to create
                  problems, unless you're a black
                  widow.

        Deckard has to wait for him to stop giggling.

                                DECKARD
                  What about -- not sex -- but love?

        Holden bites his bottom lip to keep the laugher out of
        his voice, but he can't.

                                HOLDEN
                  Love is just another name for sex.
                  Love is sexy and sex is lovely --
                  I don't care what you call it, an
                  android can't have it.

                                DECKARD
                  These aren't just...

                                HOLDEN
                  I know what they are, Deck --
                  Look, maybe they can pretend to
                  feel, but far as the raw, hot
                  emotions of the old heart -- no
                  way.

        Holden stops talking for a moment to get some air.

                                HOLDEN
                  Believe me, take it from an old
                  pro, no matter how good we get,
                  we're never gonna make an
                  artificial anything that can
                  feel.  It's a contradiction.
                  You might as well go fuck your
                  washing machine.

        Holden laughs, Deckard doesn't.

                                HOLDEN
                  Just go out there and keep up
                  the good work.

        Holden's whispers have become harder to hear.

                                HOLDEN
                  Got to save it, Deck, I'm getting
                  sleepy.  It's been good talking
                  to you.

        Deckard stands.

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

        But he's already asleep.  Deckard stands there a moment
        looking at him, then walks out.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - DAY                          78

        He's sitting on the couch, glum, contemplative.
        There's a SOUND.  His eyes move to the door.  Those
        locks are opening again.  Rachael comes in.  Looks
        surprised to see him.  Him too.

                                RACHAEL
                  I told you I'd come back.

                                DECKARD
                  You did?

                                RACHAEL
                  You didn't hear me.  You were
                  sleeping.

        He likes that.

                                RACHAEL
                  Are you glad I'm here?

        He is.  She's spunky.  Hasn't seen this place in the
        daytime.  Pleased, he watched her move around the mess.
        She spots a little framed photograph.  Picks it up.
        It's a man with a shotgun and a boy holding up a quail.

                                RACHAEL
                  Who is this?

                                DECKARD
                  Me and my dad.

                                RACHAEL
                  Where is he?

                                DECKARD
                  Dead.

                                RACHAEL
                  Oh.

        She puts it down and comes to him.

                                RACHAEL
                  How come you're not on the job?

                                DECKARD
                  I am.  Part of my job is to sit
                  on a couch and try and figure
                  things out.

                                RACHAEL
                  How are you doing?

                                DECKARD
                  Not too good.

        She sits next to him.

        Pleased as hell, they both sit there staring straight
        ahead.  He looks at her.  She looks at him.

                                RACHAEL
                  What do people do in the afternoon?

                                DECKARD
                  If they are smart, they take
                  naps.

        INT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - DAY                            79

        They're under the sheet.  Rachael is on her back, look-
        ing at the ceiling, hair sprawled like sea grass over
        the pillow.  Deckard lies next to her, a man studying
        a treasure.

                                RACHAEL
                  Do you dream?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.  Sometimes.

                                RACHAEL
                  I wish I could.

        His hand moves over her shoulder.

                                DECKARD
                  Wishing is a kind of dreaming.

        His hand goes under the sheet.

                                RACHAEL
                  I mean asleep.

        She feels good.  He moves closer.

                                RACHAEL
                  Did you cry when your father
                  died?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                RACHAEL
                  That's another thing I can't
                  do.

        He kisses her lightly on the cheek.

                                RACHAEL
                  Nobody is freer than when he
                  dreams.  I read that.

                                DECKARD
                  It wasn't very good last night,
                  was it?

                                RACHAEL
                  I don't know, I have nothing
                  to compare it to.  I guess I
                  thought there was something
                  more to it.

                                DECKARD
                  What?

                                RACHAEL
                  I don't know... I think I missed
                  something.

                                DECKARD
                  Like?

                                RACHAEL
                  I'm not sure.  Is there a
                  secret?

        Her face is close.  She's looking right at him.  Her
        lips are right there.

                                DECKARD
                  I don't know.  If there is I'd
                  like to find it.

        Slowly their lips touch and his arms slide under her
        body.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY                        80

        Batty, Pris and Mary sit at the table staring at their
        host.  Sebastian is staring back, his fork halfway to
        his mouth, looking from face to face.  Although nothing
        is being said, he's totally comfortable, as much at
        home with them as he is with his animoids.

                                BATTY
                  Why are you staring at us?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You're just all so... so different.

        Batty nods his head, smiling, sending home the fact and
        Sebastian is certainly getting it.

                                BATTY
                  What, Sebastian?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You're androids.

        A long pause.

                                PRIS
                  What makes you think so?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You're all so perfect.

        Sebastian is smiling from ear to ear.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What generation are you?

                                BATTY
                  Nexus - 6.
        
        Sebastian whistles.  Mary's head is shaking slightly.
        Pris gets up and moves to the couch.  Batty couldn't
        be more pleased.

                                BATTY
                  We can trust Sebastian, ladies.
                  He's been working with mechanisms
                  all his life.  He's a wizard and
                  a very perceptive man.

        Sebastian looks like a kid on Christmas Eve.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Could you...

        His voice is trembling.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Show me something?

                                BATTY
                  Like what?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Like...

        Like a million things, but he's too excited to think of
        one.

                                BATTY
                  We're not computers, Sebastian,
                  we're physical.

        Pris perks up proudly.

                                PRIS
                  I think, therefore I am.

                                BATTY
                  Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.

        It's a command Pris is pleased to obey.  She sits quiet-
        ly a moment, hands folded in her lap, prim and proper.
        Mary doesn't like these displays, but Batty is beaming.

        Those hands in Pris' lap suddenly move, almost faster
        than the eye can see and slam down on either side of
        her, digging into the material with such ferocity that
        Sebastian jumps.  She plunges into the guts of the couch
        up to her elbows and comes up holding springs and stuff-
        ing.  Except for the clenched teeth, she is smiling like
        an angel.

        Sebastian is riveted, his eyes wide and astounded, like
        he's just seen the devil.  He laughs nervously, glad
        that the devil is a friend.

                                BATTY
                  We have a lot in common.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You mean that you can't come here
                  and I can't go there?

                                BATTY
                  Not only that, but we have smiliar
                  problems.  Accelerated decrepitude.
                  But we don't want to die quite yet.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Of course not.

                                BATTY
                  You could help us.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I don't know much about biomechanics,
                  Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out
                  of my league.

                                BATTY
                  If we don't find help soon, Pris
                  hasn't got long to live.

        Sebastian sneaks a glance.  Pris is staring at him with
        big childlike eyes, Sebastian looks back at Batty, moved
        but helpless.

                                BATTY
                  What about your friend, the man
                  who owns this building?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Dr. Tyrell?

        Batty nods.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  He's not really my friend.  I just
                  do a job for him now and then.

                                BATTY
                  Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  He could?

                                BATTY
                  His company made us.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I'd be happy to mention it to him.

                                BATTY
                  Be better if I could talk to him
                  in person.  But he's not an easy
                  man to get to.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  No.

                                BATTY
                  When do you deliver your project?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  This afternoon.

        Batty leans forward and looks right into Sebastian's
        eyes.

                                BATTY
                  Will you help us?

        There's no way Sebastian could say no, even if he
        wanted to.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yes.

        Pris sits up smiling.  Mary sighs a breath of relief
        and Batty leans back nodding in gratitude.

                                BATTY
                  I'm sure glad you found us,
                  Sebastian.  What do you think,
                  Mary?

                                MARY
                  I don't think there is another
                  human being in this whole world
                  who would have helped us.

                                BATTY
                  Pris?

        Pris gets up and comes to Sebastian and kisses him.

        That has a lot of impact.  Sebastian looks around try-
        ing to keep the tears from coming.

                                BATTY
                  You're our best and only friend.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Thank you.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - DAY                  81

        Rachael is lying across the bed in one of Deckard's
        shirts, her chin over the edge, her eyes moving around
        the room.  Deckard lies next to her.  Looking like a
        man who died a voluptuous death.

                                RACHAEL
                  When was the last time you cleaned
                  this place?

                                DECKARD
                  Hmmm?

                                RACHAEL
                  Have you ever cleaned your
                  apartment?

                                DECKARD
                  Don't be fooled by appearances.

                                RACHAEL
                  It appears to be dirty -- why don't
                  you get somebody?

        He rolls over to admire her legs.

                                DECKARD
                  Because they would ruin the
                  arrangement.

        He kisses the back of her thigh.

                                RACHAEL
                  They could clean around the
                  arrangement.

                                DECKARD
                  I don't like people snooping around
                  my stuff.

        He kisses her other thigh, gets up and goes into the
        bathroom.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  There's a vacuum in the front room
                  closet is you wanna give it a try.

        Rachael lies there a moment, then gets up and goes into
        the front room and opens the closet door.  The vacuum is
        not easy to get to, but finally she wrestles it out.  As
        she starts to plug it in --

                                DECKARD
                  Oh no, don't do that.

        He's wrapped in a sheet, watching her from the doorway.

                                RACHAEL
                  But if I don't plug it in how can
                  I...

                                DECKARD
                  Never mind the plug, just go
                  through the motions.

                                RACHAEL
                  But then how can you...

                                DECKARD
                  I don't like the noise.  Just
                  practice.  Practice makes perfect.

        She stares at him like he's nuts.

                                DECKARD
                  I'm serious.  Go ahead.  Show me
                  how you would do it.

        Reluctantly she makes some half-hearted passes with the
        thing.

                                DECKARD
                  How about under the couch there.
                  Come on.

        She bends over to get it.  Deckard pulls up a chair and
        sits down with his chin in his hands.  She looks back
        at him.

                                RACHAEL
                  This feels stupid.

                                DECKARD
                  Good for a smart girl to feel
                  stupid.  Part of your education.

        She drops the vacuum and sits on the floor.  Deckard
        gets up and comes towards her.  Her eyes travel halfway
        down his sheet and she leaves.

                                RACHAEL
                  You're sick, Deckard.

                                DECKARD
                  I never felt better.

        EXT. TYRELL PRESERVE - DUSK                             82

        Mansion and opulent grounds.  Sebastian's humble truck
        parked among richer relations, including a spinner and
        a 1928 Dusenberg.

        EXT. TYRELL MANSION - DUSK                              83

        The den.  It contains a collection of big game trophies,
        and among all this sits Sebastian very straight and
        proper with an "egg" the size of a basketball in his
        lap.

        Old Hannibal Chew was right, the rich make you wait.
        Sebastian stands and carefully makes his way between
        the trophies to a window with a view of the grounds.

        EXT. TYRELL MANSION POOL - DUSK                         84

        Tyrell's young WIFE sits on the diving board watching
        her husband in the pool with their youngest TOT.  And
        two older LADS swim around trying to outdo each other
        for their dad's attention.

        From the sidelines an old servant pauses to watch the
        fun, then continues with a tray of mugs towards the
        house.

        EXT. PLATEAU - DUSK                                     85

        And beyond on a plateau overlooking the grounds, a
        figure stands watching, waiting like a bird of prey.

        EXT. TYRELL PRESERVE - DUSK                             86

        On a gravel path between shrubs of winter roses, Tyrell
        turns to observe the last quiet light over his kingdom.
        The moment is sweetened by the LOW PLAINTIVE BELLOW of
        one of the animals.

        He strolls by an old gardener who tips his cap, pro-
        ceeds up the steps and into his mansion.

        INT. TYRELL DEN - NIGHT                                 87

        Next to a tray of cookies and milk, Sebastian sits pa-
        tiently with the "egg" in his lap.  As the door opens
        he gets to his feet expectantly.  It's STYLES, Tyrell's
        bodyguard.  He could play the Giant in Jack and The
        Beanstalk.

                                STYLES
                  Okay, I'll take that now.

        Sebastian would rather put it in the boss's hands, but
        Styles takes it and is almost through the door when
        Sebastian stops him.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Wait!

        He almost forgot.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Can't fly without the pilot.

        Sebastian hands him a little box.  Styles stuffs it in
        his pocket and shuts the door behind him.

        EXT. TYRELL PRESERVE - NIGHT                            88

        Motionless and monumental, six buffalo stand like stat-
        ues in the grass.  Suddenly they swing their shaggy
        heads to watch something pass.

        In the dark silence Batty stops to look at the curious
        beasts and then moves soundlessly towards the mansion.

        INT. TYRELL DINING ROOM - NIGHT                         89

        It's a medieval-sized hall.  The piece de resistance is
        an 18th Century, English painting of an Arab stallion,
        gleaming like coal over the CRACKLING fireplace.

        The entire family is seated at the table which glitters
        for the festive occasion.  Presents gathered around the
        oldest child.

        Styles hands the "egg" to Tyrell.  A hush falls over
        the table.  This is Dad's big present.  Tyrell sets is
        down before the boy.

        IAN is a fresh, slim lad who is ten today.  He looks up
        at his father, then, beaming, pries open the "egg's"
        hinged lid.  Tyrell's hand goes to his pocket and the
        griffon steps out of the shell.

                                IAN
                  Oh!

        Basically an avian invention, it has wings and plumage,
        the head of an eagle, the body of a lion and weighs no
        more than eight pounds.  It cranes its neck and testing
        its balance, stands on one leg and then hops to the
        edge of the table and into the air.

        The littlest tot claps her hands as the griffon beats
        its wings rapidly and rises towards the ceiling.  Turn-
        ing in a forty-five degree, it suddenly drops into a
        dive.

        Delighted, the children shriek and scream as the griffon
        swoops over their crouching heads and sails the length
        of the hall -- its silhouette flickering briefly over
        the ancestral portraits of the Tyrell clan.

        Reaching the end of the room, it banks sharply and
        flies back towards the table, cups its wings, spreads
        its tail and comes in for an awkward landing.  They're
        laughing and clapping as it waddles down the table and
        knocks over a glass and stops in front of Ian.

                                IAN
                  Papa!  Did you make this?

                                TYRELL
                  No.  We can make man, but not a
                  griffon.

        He bends down and kisses his wife.

                                TYRELL
                  Have to give the cottage industry
                  a chance too.

        Pleased he excuses himself and heads for the den.

        INT. TYRELL DEN - NIGHT                                 90

        Tyrell comes in and sits behind his desk.  Sebastian
        hands down the invoices.  Tyrell glances over them and
        writes out a check.

        He looks up to hand it over when he sees Batty against
        the wall, by the door.  For a fraction of a second he's
        shocked, but recovers fast.

                                TYRELL
                  A friend of yours, Sebastian?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yes, this is someone who wants to
                  talk to you, Dr. Tyrell.

        Batty smiles.

                                BATTY
                  The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.

                                TYRELL
                  Oh?

        Very slowly Tyrell's hand moves towards the back side
        of the desk.

                                BATTY
                  To act without understanding could
                  lead to the very thing the act
                  seeks to avoid.

        What's in Batty's eyes completes the warning.  Tyrell
        decides to heed it.

                                BATTY
                  A little talk it all I need.

        Tyrell looks at Sebastian.  Considers consequences.
        Back to Batty.

                                TYRELL
                  Would you like to talk in private
                  then.

        Batty thinks it over.

                                BATTY
                  Yeah.  It might be better if we
                  talk in private, Sebastian.  Why
                  don't you go home.

                                TYRELL
                  Here's your check, my boy.  Thank
                  you.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Thank you, Dr. Tyrell.  I'll see
                  you later.

        He slips out closing the door behind him.  Opens it
        again and sticks his head it.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Was everything okay?

                                TYRELL
                  Just beautiful.

        He's gone.

        If Tyrell is scared he's doing a good job of concealing
        it.

                                TYRELL
                  I'm surprised you didn't come to
                  me sooner.

                                BATTY
                  It's not an easy thing to meet
                  your maker.

                                TYRELL
                  And what can he do for you?

                                BATTY
                  Can the maker repair what he makes?

                                TYRELL
                  Would you like to be modified?

                                BATTY
                  Had in mind something a little more
                  radical.

                                TYRELL
                  What's the problem?

                                BATTY
                  Death.

                                TYRELL
                  I'm afraid that's a little out of
                  my...

        Batty cuts in with a whisper.

                                BATTY
                  I want more life, fucker.

                                TYRELL
                  Come here.

        Batty walks forward.

                                TYRELL
                  Sit down.

        Batty does.

                                TYRELL
                  The facts of life.  I'll be blunt.
                  To make an alteration in the
                  evolvement of an organic life
                  system, at least by men, makers
                  or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence
                  can't be revised once it's
                  established.

                                BATTY
                  Why?

                                TYRELL
                  Because by the second day of
                  incubation any cells that have
                  undergone reversion mutation give
                  rise to revertant colonies -- like
                  rats leaving a sinking ship.  The
                  ship sinks.

                                BATTY
                  What about E.M.S. recombination?

                                TYRELL
                  We've already tried it -- ethyl
                  methane sulfonate is an alkylating
                  agent and a potent mutagen -- it
                  creates a virus so lethal the
                  subject was destroyed before we
                  left the table.

        Batty nods grimly.

                                BATTY
                  Then a repressor protein that blocks
                  the operating cells.

                                TYRELL
                  Wouldn't obstruct replication, but
                  it does give rise to an error in
                  replication, so that the newly
                  formed DNA strand carries a
                  mutation and you're got a virus
                  again... but all this is academic
                  -- you are made as good as we could
                  make you.

                                BATTY
                  But not to last.

                                TYRELL
                  Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are
                  made to last -- as least they were.
                  But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari.
                  A high strung racing car -- built
                  to win, not to last.

        Batty smiles bitterly.

                                TYRELL
                  Also you're too valuable to
                  experiment with.

                                BATTY
                  I am?

        Tyrell can't help a flash of pride.

                                TYRELL
                  The bast of all possible androids.
                  We're proud of our prodigal son --
                  glad you're returned.  You're quite
                  a prize.

        Shoulders hunched, Batty looks down, an uncharacteristic
        note of guilt in his voice.

                                BATTY
                  I've done some questionable things.

                                TYRELL
                  Also extraordinary things.

                                BATTY
                  Nothing the God of biomechanics
                  wouldn't let you in heaven for.

        They share a laugh.  In spite of himself, there's a look
        of relief in Tyrell's face as Batty extends his hand.
        Tyrell takes it and they shake.  The reverence in Bat-
        ty's eyes caused Tyrell a fatherly smile.  The smile
        turns into a growl as he feels the bones in his hands
        crack.  Before the scream comes out of his mouth, Batty
        stifles it.

        Tyrell claws at the iron fingers, but they're sinking
        into his face.  Placing his other hand behind Tyrell's
        head, Batty squeezes them together and squashes the
        man's head like a melon.  The mess is not small.

        Palms up, like a surgeon, Batty walks to the drapes and
        wipes off the gore and without looking back, strolls out
        of the room.

        INT. TYRELL - HALL TO KITCHEN - NIGHT                   90A

        Styles is coming down the hall.  He sees Batty coming
        towards him.  Styles looks at him curiously, this is not
        one of the guests.  As they close, Batty smiles.

                                BATTY
                  Could you tell me where the
                  bathroom is?

        Styles doesn't get a chance to answer.  Batty's hand has
        torn into his crotch.  The man is lifted off the floor,
        up the wall and held a moment.  Whatever is encased in
        his pelvis is pulverized.  Batty lets go.  Styles hits
        the floor.  He died of shock.  Grinding his teeth, Batty
        continues towards the SOUNDS OF THE FESTIVITIES.

        INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                91

        The birthday cake has arrived, the candles lit.  They're
        waiting for Dad.  Mrs. Tyrell looks around to find Batty
        observing from the doorway.

        A little startled, a little curious, but ever the cor-
        porate wife, she smiles.

                                MRS. TYRELL
                  May I help you?

        Batty smiles back and shakes his head in mock regrets.

        INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                    92

        In the sink the faucet is on.  The water pink with
        blood.  Batty is washing his hands.

        A portly maid emerges from the pantry.  Batty looks up.
        She stops, embarrassed at being caught.  Her eyes no-
        tice drops of blood on the floor and follow them to the
        door.  When she looks back, Batty is right in front of
        her.

        INT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                          93

        Books scattered on the bed.  Rachael sitting cross-
        legged with one in her lap, looking through exquisite
        shots of nature.  Deckard is next to her, watching her
        like a lover, like a father.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  She'd never seen the great outdoors.
                  Never even seen books on the
                  subject.  She went through
                  everything I had, and we talked.
                  And there were subjects we didn't
                  discuss and they were words we
                  didn't say, I couldn't say, like
                  death, like future, like real.  But
                  it was hard because she was curious
                  and full of questions.  She was
                  more alive than anyone I'd ever
                  known.

        She looks up stunned by the beauty of a photo, but with
        no need to comment.  It's in her eyes.  She stares at
        him, a revelation taking shape.

                                RACHAEL
                  You and I are good friends, huh?

        He considers it and she stares at him, smiling at the
        wonder of it.

                                RACHAEL
                  It's so easy.

        Convinced and not convinced, he nods his head.  She
        laughs at his solemnity.  She's irresistible.  Deckard's
        pretty irresistible himself.

                                RACHAEL
                  Have you ever known anybody a long
                  time?

                                DECKARD
                  You mean a woman?

                                RACHAEL
                  Uh-huh.

                                DECKARD
                  What's a long time?

                                RACHAEL
                  Ten years.

                                DECKARD
                  Nope.  Nobody could stand me that
                  long.

        The CHIME on the PHONE next to the bed GOES OFF.  He
        reaches out and brings it to his ear.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                BRYANT
                  This is Bryant.  Are you alone?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                BRYANT
                  She's not with you?

                                DECKARD
                  Who.

        A pause.

                                BRYANT
                  Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth
                  floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia
                  South.

                                DECKARD
                  Got it.

                                BRYANT
                  Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his
                  family and half his staff were just
                  massacred.  The cat is about to get
                  out of the bag.  Pressure is
                  definitely on.  The Nexus program
                  is terminated.  When you finish
                  there, locate Nexus designated Rachael
                  and retire.

        Deckard says nothing.

                                BRYANT
                  If you don't, we will.  It has to
                  be total, Deckard.  That's an order
                  from as high as it comes.  Got it?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.  I got it.

                                BRYANT
                  Go.

        He hangs up the receiver and gets up.  She watches him
        from the bed.  The gun goes into his belt.  He loads
        the ankle job and straps it on.  She watches every move.

                                RACHAEL
                  Why do you call it retire, why
                  don't you call it murder?

                                DECKARD
                  Because it's not.

                                RACHAEL
                  Don't you think anything that can
                  suffer deserves to be considered?

                                DECKARD
                  Andies only simulate suffering --
                  if they're programmed for it.

                                RACHAEL
                  Do you think I simulated what
                  happened between us?

                                DECKARD
                  No, I don't.

        Without looking at her, he puts on his jacket.

        He's standing in the middle of the floor with his back
        to her.  He turns and they're facing one another.
        Neither of them moves.

                                DECKARD
                  Don't leave here.  Don't open the
                  door, don't answer the phone.

                                RACHAEL
                  What difference will it make?

                                DECKARD
                  Just wait here.

        He goes to the door.

                                RACHAEL
                  You know what I think?

                                DECKARD
                  What?

                                RACHAEL
                  That some of the folks around here
                  are more programmed then me.

        He has to laugh.

                                RACHAEL
                  You know what else I think?

                                DECAKRD
                  What?

                                RACHAEL
                  This was the best day of my life.

        He turns and goes through the door.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                      94

        Sebastian is putting his work table in order, but his
        mind is not with it and his hands are trembling.

        Batty, Pris and Mary are on the other side of the room
        talking:  their voices low.

                                MARY
                  Let's go while there is still
                  time.

                                BATTY
                  Where?

                                MARY
                  Anywhere.

        Batty smiles.

                                BATTY
                  What's the point?

                                MARY
                  Not to be trapped.

                                BATTY
                  You underestimate the trap, Mary.

        Sebastian has almost reached the door.

                                BATTY
                  Where are you going, Sebastian?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Just thought I'd...

                                BATTY
                  No, you stay here with us.  Out
                  last night together.

        They all watch.

        Sebastian walks away from the door.

                                BATTY
                  Think of yourself as a light, Mary.
                  Shine before you're turned off.

        She's too fragile for that logic, but it appeals to
        Pris.  She and Batty hold a look that burns.

        Sebastian is by the window.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Someone is coming here.

        Batty goes to the window and looks down.

                                BATTY
                  One man.
                         (he smiles)
                  He must be good.

                                MARY
                  Then go get him.

                                BATTY
                  That wouldn't be very sporting.

        Sebastian looks ready to bolt.  Batty puts an arm
        around him.

                                PRIS
                  I want to do it.

                                BATTY
                  Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a
                  little for everybody.  A
                  masterpiece.

        A pause.

                                BATTY
                  Turn out the lights, Pris.

        EXT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                      95

        In the dim, nocturnal light, Deckard crosses into the
        courtyard fronting the building and stops.  He looks
        around.  Nobody there, just silence.

        He comes closer to the building and stands in the sha-
        dows off to one side of the entry.

        His head jerks up to the SOUND OF CRASHING GLASS.

        Sebastian comes hurtling down and explodes into the
        pavement thirty feet below.

        Deckard's eyes move up the line of descent, the shat-
        tered window on the next-to-top floor.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT LOBBY - NIGHT                96

        Not much to see, But Deckard misses none of it as he
        crosses the floor and positions himself in the spot of
        least exposure.  He looks around.  Elevator and stair-
        well.

        Close to the wall, he moves towards the elevator, keep-
        ing an eye on the stairwell door.

        Stepping to one side, he hits the button.  The elevator
        door slides open.  He reaches in, presses a button and
        as the doors slide shut, Deckard slips a pen between
        the doors, jamming the operation.

        Deckard's shoes and soundless as he quickly crosses the
        lobby floor.  He pauses a moment in front of the stair-
        well door, then pushes it open and:

        INT. STAIRWELL, SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT           97

        Steps into the dark on the other side.  Suddenly he
        spins, dropping to the floor, and FIRES three times in-
        to the figure hovering to his left.

        The man is hanging off the floor, his arms locked into
        the railing, neck broken -- with three holes in his
        chest... but he was already dead.

        Deckard stares at the corpse.  It's Mr. Deetchum, the
        old watchman.  That RUSTLING SOUND are rats who were
        feeding on him, scampering for safer places, Deckard
        gets to his feet.

        The stairway rectangles ten stories up.  As his foot
        touches the first step, a raw, terrified SCREAM shatters
        the air.  It came from below.  It's the cry of a young
        girl -- it GROWS TO A PIERCING SHRIEK AND ABRUPTLY
        STOPS.  Deckard ejects the half-used cartridge from his
        laser, inserts a fresh one and quiet as the silence,
        descends the basement stairs.

        INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT                                   98

        At the bottom he faces a corridor.  The FAINT HUM OF
        MACHINERY comes from the double doors at the far end.
        The HUM BECOMES A RATTLE by the time he gets there.
        Each door is fitted with a small window.  Deckard
        steps to the side and peers through.

        INT. GYM - NIGHT                                        99

        It's a gym.  The mirror-lined walls are cracked and
        tarnished, the equipment atrophied from lack of use.
        The heavier barbells have sunk into the floor.  Two
        weight-reducing machines are flapping and grinding away
        like idiots.  Deckard's eyes stop on the woman.

        She dangles a few feet off the floor, hung by the
        shoulders through rings suspended from the ceiling.
        Her head is slung forward, her body limp and slightly
        swaying.

        Deckard pushes open one of the doors until it touches
        the wall.  Slowly, he advances toward the hanging figure,
        keeping an eye on the mirror to cover surprises from the
        door.  He's not breathing hard.  His heart isn't pound-
        ing.  Deckard's in his element.

        Close enough to look up into her face, he stops.  It
        isn't grisly death that causes the reaction in his
        eyes.  It's the innocence of her angel face.

        It's not something he has time to consider.  In the
        mirror behind him, he sees the door starting to open.
        Deckard spins.  He shouldn't have.  Pris' legs snap up,
        crack the laser out of his hand and clamp around his
        neck.

        Slowly, the door swings closed, but Deckard doesn't
        notice.  His carotid artery is no longer sending blood
        to the brain.  He jerks up his foot and reaches down.
        As his fingers close around the ankle laser, Pris'
        fingers close around his wrist.  Deckard's hand opens
        like a flower.  The laser drops to the floor as his
        eyes roll back into his head.

                                PRIS
                  Naughty, naughty.

        She lets go, but before he can fall, she rams a foot
        into his back.  He's propelled fifteen feet across the
        room, slams into a machine and falls to the floor.
        Pris flies off the rings and comes at him.

        Deckard reaches out to pull himself up, but she's al-
        ready there.  Not too hard and just in the right place,
        she kicks him in the stomach.  He goes back to the
        floor, gagging for air.  Oh-so-precisely she reaches
        out with a long index finger and flips the switch on
        the machine.

        It's a flab eliminator with a vibrator belt.  Normally
        an innocuous piece of equipment, but the motor housing
        on this one is missing.  Lots of GRINDING METAL.  A
        bad place for flesh and bone.

        But that's where Deckard's hand is going.  An eight-
        year-old against a full-down man.  In two more seconds
        his hand will be ground round.  Deckard tries to pull
        his hand loose.  It won't come.  He yanks hard, but
        it's welded in hers.

        His face is twisted and strained as he raises a leg,
        wedges his foot against her chest and pushes with all
        his might.  The hold breaks.  They topple back.  Deckard
        hits the floor gulping to catch his breath.  Pris is up
        and coming for him again.  She hovers over him.  Deckard
        rolls out of the way as she comes down like a pile
        driver.

        Reflexively Deckard raises his arm to protect himself.
        Pris just smiles, takes hold of his foot and drags him
        across the floor.  She doesn't like to leave a piece of
        work unfinished.  They're going back to the machine.

        He goes by a weight-stand of dumbbells and grabs hold.
        It doesn't stop him.  He's sliding over the floor like
        it was ice, weight stand in tow.

        Pris gets to the machine, yanks his foot up and forces
        it toward the opening.  Deckard sits up, a five-pound
        dumbbell in his hand, and clobbers her in the back.  It
        knocks her off balance, but she doesn't let go of his
        foot.  She hooks out with a fist but misses.  He gets
        her with a roundhouse in the face.

        She goes to the floor and Deckard's up, the dumbbell
        over his head, coming down with it.  Fighting for her
        life now, Pris drives a foot into his chest.  It lifts
        him off the floor.  He flies back across the gym and
        lands in a heap.

        No more games.  Pris is furious and moving fast.  She
        rips a steel bar out of the wall and, holding it over-
        head, charges him like a samurai.  As she comes down
        for the kill, she freezes.

        Deckard landed near the laser.  He crawls towards it.
        As in a nightmare, it takes forever.  But he gets there.

        He reaches out and grabs the laser, rolls over and
        takes careful aim.  She charges towards him, screaming
        her rage.  He FIRES as she comes.

        The shot amputates her left arm at the shoulder, but
        her hand doesn't let go of the bar.  It dangles crazily
        in front of her as she charges forward.

        He PUTS THE NEXT ONE through her neck.  Pris hiccups a
        rope of blood as she flies through the air and crashes
        next to Deckard.  Dead.

        He lies next to her, chest heaving.  Slowly he rolls
        over and gets to his hands and knees.  Panting, he stag-
        gers to his feet and stands over her, swaying slightly.
        The sound that escapes his throat is raspy and dry.  It
        might not sound like a war cry, but it is.

        INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                   100

        Laser in hand, Deckard kicks open the swinging doors
        and walks into the corridor, a dangerous man.

        INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT                                  101

        Deckard arrives at the main floor landing, checks his
        loads and continues up the stairs.  He's going to shoot
        the next thing that moves and find out later if he was
        right or wrong.

        INT. STAIRWELL - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT                   101A

        On the next landing he throws the door open.  His eyes
        move down the hall, looking for prints in the dust.
        None.  He continues up the stairs.

        INT. NINTH FLOOR - NIGHT                                102

        On the ninth floor he finds what he's looking for.
        Footprints coming and going from a door halfway down the
        hall.  He stops to the side of it and listens.  Silence.
        Deckard FIRES three quick shots through the door.  If
        somebody were on the other side of it, they aren't now.

        He kicks the door open and dives through head first
        and hits the floor in a roll, POURING FIRE into the
        far corners of the room but the room is empty.  There's
        a kitchen bar, a closet and a bedroom door, both
        closed.  Deckard's breathing is the only sound.  No
        response from either door.

        Maybe it was a sound, maybe intuition, but suddenly
        Deckard twists around and FIRES several shots into the
        closet.  The smouldering door slowly creaks open.

        Mary is huddled in the rear of the closet.  Her hand
        out like somebody about to catch a ball but afraid of
        it.  In her other hand she clutches a button-eyed
        monkey.  Her face is bewildered, frozen in fear, her
        body riddled with holes.  No recognition gap here.
        Deckard SHOOTS her through the neck to make sure.  Mary
        falls to the floor, like a puppet with her strings cut.

        Deckard backs away from the pathetic figure in the
        closet and sits on the sofa, unable to take his eyes
        off her.

        Deckard lays the laser down next to him, holds out his
        hand and looks at it.  It's steady.  He drops it in
        his lap, closes his eyes and leans back.

        A TAPPING from the ceiling.  Deckard looks up.

        A KNOCK -- with the proverbial DOUBLE RAP at the end.
        A pause.  Deckard jumps out of the way as the ceiling
        gives in.  Chucks on concrete and plaster hit the
        couch where he was sitting.  The hole is a couple feet
        in diameter -- beams cracked through, exposing the
        apartment above.  Silence.  Deckard wipes the plaster
        dust from his eyes and mouth, then whispers:

                                DECKARD
                  Hello, Roy.

        INT. STAIRWELL - NINTH AND TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT          103

        Deckard comes out onto the landing.  Taking his time,
        he climbs the steps to the next floor, the last floor.
        He SHOOTS the hinges out of the big stairwell door,
        pushes it with his foot and it comes down with a BANG.
        The REVERBERATIONS turn into silence.  The corridor is
        empty.

        INT. CORRIDOR - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                     104

        Moving fast but cautious, he passes each door until he
        gest to the apartment above Sebastian's.  Slowly he
        turns the know and pushed open the door.

        INT. APARTMENT - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                    105

        Except for the hole in the middle of the floor, there's
        nothing to see.  Back against the wall, he moves to-
        wards the bedroom, but stops at the NOISE.  It sounds
        like the HOOTING OF AN OWL and it's coming from the
        hallway.

        INT. CORRIDOR - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                     106

        Deckard looks around the corner of the door down the
        hall.  Batty's at the other end.  Except for jockstrap
        and gym shoes, he's nude.

                                BATTY
                  You wanna play?

        Deckard FIRES.  Batty's fast.  He ducks into a doorway.
        Pops out again.

                                BATTY
                  Not very sporting to fire on an
                  unarmed opponent.  I thought you
                  were supposed to be good.  Aren't
                  you the man?!

        The makeup on Batty's face is somewhere between a Coman-
        che warrior and a transvestite.  The immensity of his
        insolence awesome -- the muscles of his body are swol-
        len, trembling from the thrill of it.

                                BATTY
                  This is how we do it up there, lad!
                  Come on!

        In a blue of lightning-like action, Batty whips down the
        hall, zigzagging off the walls towards Deckard so fast
        that Deckard gets only three SHOTS off before the blur
        crashes through the wall on his left with a laugh.

        Deckard stands there a moment -- digesting the impact
        of it, then edges up to the gaping wall.  Batty is be-
        hind him.

        He knees Deckard in the back and slaps him in the head.
        Deckard goes to his knees, then over on his face.
        Batty kneels next to him.

                                BATTY
                  Not hurt, are you?  You better get
                  it up or I'm going to have to kill
                  you.  Unless you're alive you can't
                  play.  And if you don't play, you
                  don't get to be alive.

        Deckard's eyes are closed, mouth bleeding.  He exhales
        and makes and effort.  He slides his hands up even with
        his chest and starts to push.

                                BATTY
                  That's the spirit.

        Like a matador, Batty walks away.  By the time Deckard's
        on his feet, Batty's disappeared through one of the
        doors.

        Deckard wipes the blood from his mouth, bends down and
        picks up his laser, reloads and looks down the hall,
        towards the jeering voice.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  Come on, Deckard, show me what you
                  got!  I'm right here on the other
                  side of the door.  But you gotta
                  shoot straight 'cause I'm fast!

        Deckard gets to the door, BLASTS it, kicks it open and
        FIRES at Batty.  But it's only the reflection of Batty.

        INT. ROOM - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                         107

        The full length mirror on the other side of the room
        SHATTERS.  Batty's next to him, grabs Deckard's hand
        and steps in closer.

                                BATTY
                  Straight doesn't seem to be good
                  enough.

        They're face to face.

                                BATTY
                  You don't have a chance, do you?

        In an exaggeration of weary disappointment, Batty drops
        his head to the side.

                                BATTY
                  Looks like I'm gonna have to scale
                  it down for you.  Give you a
                  handicap.  I won't run through any
                  more walls.  Okay?  I promise to
                  use the doors.  Okay?

        Deckard stares back at him, but doesn't respond.  Sud-
        denly fury storms through Batty.  He throws Deckard out
        the door, knocking him down, grabs him by the collar
        and rams his head into the wall.

                                BATTY
                  Come on, let's use that brain!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT                       108

        He drags him down the hall, on his knees and bangs his
        head into the wall again.

                                BATTY
                  Think!  We need a little
                  resilience around here!

        He yanks him further and bashes his head again.

                                BATTY
                  Where are those balls of yours?!
                  Let's see a little bravery!

        The storm passes.

        Deckard hangs in Batty's hand like a bag of laundry.

                                BATTY
                  That was irrational of me -- not
                  to mention unsportsmanlike.  Won't
                  happen again.

        He drops him.

                                BATTY
                  I'll be down the hall when you're
                  ready.

        Betty walks off and disappears through one of the doors.

        Deckard gets to his knees, leans against the wall a mo-
        ment, then punches it with his fist.

        On his feet he's a little wobbly.  Holding his breath
        so he can hear above his own breathing, he listens.  No
        sound.  No sign of Batty.  The laser is laying nearby.
        He doesn't bother.

        Deckard is backing down the hall, quiet as he can.  He
        had a job to do.  He would like to have done it, but
        he's not insane.  He gets to the landing and turns.

        On the first step down, he stops.  Batty's on the land-
        ing below, looking up at him.

                                BATTY
                  Where you going?

        He wait a moment for Deckard's answer.

                                BATTY
                  No cheating.  A promise is a
                  promise.  I'll honor the
                  handicapped, but we gotta play on
                  the top floor.  You go get your
                  laser gun now.  And I'll give you
                  a few seconds before I come.

        Deckard turns back into the hall.  Batty smiles.

        Deckard's running down the corridor.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  One!

        Halfway down the hall he finds his laser.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  Two!

        Deckard darts into the nearest door.  The apartment
        above Sebastian's, with the hole in the floor.  Deckard
        considers it.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  No fair jumping through holes.  You
                  might get hurt doing that!  THREE!

        Deckard dashes back into the hall, chooses another door
        and goes in.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      109

        His eyes skim over everything, looking for an advantage.
        He throws open a door.  The bathroom.  The plumbing is
        dismantled, walls stripped, revealing brick, nails
        protruding.  Too small.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR STAIRWELL - NIGHT                      110

        Batty's coming up the steps.

                                BATTY
                  Five!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      111

        Deckard's looking for a corner -- a place that covers
        the angles.  He chooses the far side of the room with
        a line to the door.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           112

        Batty's coming down the center, listening at the doors.

                                BATTY
                  Six!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      113

        Deckard's crouched in the corner and aimed.  He looks at
        his hand.  It's trembling.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  Seven!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           114

        Batty's standing in front of a door, listening.

                                BATTY
                  Oh, I wonder where he is.  Not in
                  here, I don't think.  Eight!

        He goes to the next door.

                                BATTY
                  Maybe here.  Doesn't sound like
                  it.  Nine!

        Batty moves to the next.  The door to Deckard.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      115

        Deckard's crouched lower, holding his breath -- talk
        about a hair trigger... Silence.  Batty's FEET are heard
        CREAKING AWAY.  Deckard looks around.  Runs a hand over
        the wall behind him.  Batty's FEET COME BACK.  A pause.

                                BATTY
                  Ten!

        The door explodes!

        A shape hurtles across the room.  Deckard pivots, fol-
        lowing it with RAPID FIRE.  It's a TV.  He spins back.
        but Batty's already on him.  He gets one SHOT off be-
        fore Batty's got his hand.  There's a hole over Batty's
        right eye.  Blood running down his face, dripping on
        Deckard.  The right side of his face isn't working too
        good.  The corner of his mouth doesn't quite shut --
        his voice comes out slurred, a little hollow.

                                BATTY
                  One point for you.

        The would doesn't minimize his omnipotence, just makes
        it more malignant.  He throws Deckard against the far
        wall.  Deckard FIRES.  Hits Batty in the shoulder.

                                BATTY
                  Ho ho!  Try it again!

        He comes at Deckard, jerking back and forth, a cobra in
        fast motion, faking, weaving, yelping with excitement
        as Deckard tries to get a shot, FIRING AWAY until his
        laser's empty.  Bloody and crazed, Batty pushes up
        against him.

                                BATTY
                  What's wrong?  Don't you like me?
                  I'm what we've made!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           116

        He's backing Deckard out the door.  Deckard trips and
        falls.  There's fear on his face.  The strength is gone.
        Something is starting to crack.

                                BATTY
                  What's wrong?  Aren't you a lover
                  of Faster, Bigger and Better?!

        Deckard's pedaling backwards over the floor.

                                BATTY
                  It's time to die.

        Deckard throws the laser at him.  It misses.  Batty
        throws his head back and laughs.  A one-eyed colossus
        about to eat the world.  Suddenly he stops.  His eye
        moves over the wall.

                                BATTY
                  Ah!

        He reaches out and pinches something.  His lips compress
        as he yanks it out of the wall.  It's a ten-penny nail.

        He holds it out to Deckard and drops it.  Deckard
        catches it.

                                BATTY
                  That's for you.

        One side of Batty's face smiles savagely.

                                BATTY
                  Stick it in your ear and push.
                  If that doesn't work, try the
                  eye.

        Deckard stares at the nail in his hand, then up at
        his executioner.

                                BATTY
                  Believe me, it'll be better
                  for you than what I'm about
                  to do.

        Batty watches him, hoping the stimulus might inspire
        his victim to more action.  It doesn't look like it.

                                BATTY
                  Well?

        Deckard springs to his feet and bolts.  But instead of
        going for the stairwell he turns in the first available
        door.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT #2 - NIGHT                   117

        Provocation accomplished. Batty smiles and walks lei-
        surely towards the door.  Deckard's terrified scream
        and the SOUND of GLASS CRASHING stop him.  Batty speeds
        up and moves into the room.

        The window pane is splattered, curtains sucked out,
        bellowing in the wind.

                                BATTY
                  Crap.

        He walks up to the window.  Deckard comes away from the
        wall, inching up behind him, laser in both hands, aimed
        at the base of Batty's skull.  Batty starts to lean
        over, but even before his eyes see the pavement, he
        knows.  He spins...

        Deckard FIRES again.  This one goes home.  Batty falls
        like he was poleaxed, hits the floor dead weight.

        Deckard starts to tremble.  His arms go limp as his
        head tilts back and he closes his eyes.  He can breathe
        again.
        
        On the floor, Batty's hand is crawling toward Deckard's
        ankle.

        With the unsuspected abruptness of a man slipping on a
        banana peel, Deckard comes down.  Face knotted in hor-
        ror, he EMPTIES THE LASER in Batty's body -- but the
        hand holds on.  With a screech of frustration he drops
        the laser and like an animal claws at Batty's dead
        fingers -- but the fingers are welded shut.

        Deckard starts to crawl, pulling Batty behind him.  He
        struggled through the door and stumbles to his feet.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           118

        Deckard plunges down the corridor dragging Batty along.
        He falls, gets to one foot, falls again and crawls the
        last couple feet to the stairwell.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR STAIRWELL - NIGHT                      119

        Groaning, he tugs and pulls, hauls and heaves Batty's
        body to the edge of the landing.  He pauses for breath,
        then lays back, wedging his feet against Batty's shoul-
        ders and pushes.  Inch by inch the body goes over the
        edge.  Then all at once it drops.  But the hand holds
        and the weight of the body takes Deckard with it.  As
        Deckard slides over the edge, he grabs hold of the
        railing.

        Deckard's hanging three hundred feet over the basement
        floor, supporting himself and Batty's corpse -- almost
        four hundred pounds of stress on his fingers.
        
        With his free foot he chops away at Batty's hand, try-
        ing to break it loose.  But it's not working.  Deckard's
        fingers are starting to slip.

        His face is a mask of agony as he wedges his heel over
        Batty's thumb.  With the help of gravity and everything
        he's got in his right leg to push with, he pushes.  The
        thumb breaks loose.  Batty falls.

        The SOUND OF HIS BODY HITTING BELOW sounds good, but
        Deckard doesn't notice.  He's in an awkward position.
        He must reverse the way he's facing to pull himself up.
        He lets go with his right hand and crosses it over the
        left.  Then turns the left around so he's got an over-
        hand grip.

        Like a man doing his last pull-up... the one that can't
        be done, Deckard pulls himself up, throws a foot over
        the edge and grapples and heaves and wiggled himself
        onto the cold solid steel of the stairwell landing.

        And lies there, body jerking spasmodically, slowly
        clenching and unclenching his cramped hand, but it's
        his burning cheek against the cool metal he's most aware
        of.

        Dizzy, hot, lungs on fire, he stands -- and putting one
        foot in front of the other, Deckard descends the stairs.

        EXT. SEBASTIAN'S BUILDING - DAWN                        120

        Slowly the door pushes open and Deckard comes out into
        the morning.  The sun isn't yet risen, but the sky has
        begun to pale.  It's a brooding gray stew of a dawn not
        very pretty, but even though he can't show it, Deckard
        is glad to see it.

        For a moment he tilts his head back and takes some
        breath, then walks across the courtyard towards the
        street, so dead on his feet he hasn't the energy to
        fall.

        Deckard slumps into the shelter of his car.  The col-
        lapses on the front seat.

        INT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - DAWN                           121

        In a corner of the dimness Deckard sits slumped on a
        chair, facing the pearly gray light of the window.  The
        only SOUND in the room is the soft steady BREATHING
        that comes from the bed.

        Quietly he gets up and walks over to her.  Rachael lies
        sleeping, one delicate arm exposed from under the sheet.

        Deckard stands there, bettered and grim, staring down
        at her.

        Moments go by and finally he sits gently on the edge of
        the bed.

        Rachael opens her eyes, and looks up at him, she smiles.

        EXT. COUNTRYSIDE (MONTAGE) - DAY                        122

        Deckard's car is skimming over the narrow highway.  He
        and Rachael in the front seat.  Except for the occasion-
        al glance, their faces are still and quiet in the cold
        shine of an icy dream.

        The clouds overhead are soft and swift.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  She wanted to go to a place I knew.
                  Out of the city.  Like one of those
                  pictures she saw.  Where there were
                  trees but no buildings.

        Rachael's face in the window watching the woods stream
        by.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  We had a good time.  She told me a
                  funny story and I taught her a
                  song.  A song about monkeys and
                  elephants.  And it made us laugh so
                  hard we couldn't sing.

        EXT. WOODS (MONTAGE) - DAY                              123

        Deckard and Rachael walking.  The land lays white and
        hushed before them.

        Down an aisle of maples and beeches.  The frosty light
        slanting through the clean, hard limbs.

        The crisp, blue-white snow underfoot melted through in
        spots exposing soggy patches of rich brown earth.

        Rachael stops and faces him.  Her lips are parted, her
        warm breath turning the cold air to vapor.  Looking
        lithe and fragile by these barren-rooted trees, she
        stands in the crisp white snow looking at Deckard.
        Nothing in her retreats, even now her eyes insist on
        knowing.

        EXT. WOODS - DAY                                        124

        Deckard walking over the snow.  Alone.  He walks slowly,
        mechanically through the cold, unaffected by it.  His
        gaunt face, empty of expression except for the tears
        running down his pale cheeks.

        But for the SQUEAK of his wet shoes over the crusted
        snow, there is no sound.  And Deckard recedes into the
        silence of the freezing white landscape.

        EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                    125

        Deckard's car, solid, THROBBING, GUNNING along like
        some metal animal.  Headlights piercing the dark of the
        long, flat road.  WHISTLING speed of air and tires spin-
        ning THRUM.  And then silence.  And the silence
        astounded by the CRACK OF A GUN.

        INT. CAR - NIGHT                                        126

        Deckard is behind the wheel, face in shadow, eyes star-
        ing straight ahead.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  I told myself over and over again,
                  if I hadn't done it, they would
                  have.

                  I didn't go back to the city, not
                  that city, I didn't want the job.

                  She said the great advantage of
                  being alive was to have a choice.
                  And she chose.  And a part of me
                  was almost glad.  Not because she
                  was gone but because this way they
                  could never touch her.

                  As for Tyrell -- he was murdered,
                  but he wasn't dead.  For a long
                  time I wanted to kill him.  But
                  what was the point?  There were too
                  many Tyrells.  But only one Rachael.
                  Maybe real and unreal could never
                  be separated.  The secret never
                  found.  But I got as close with
                  her as I'd ever come to it.  She'd
                  stay with me a long time.  I guess
                  we made each other real.

        And the ruby lights of Deckard's car disappear into
        the darkness.
        
        
        
        					THE END

                                ****************

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION LOCKER ROOM - DAY               1

        THE EYE                                                 2

        It's magnified and deeply revealed.  Flecks of green
        and yellow in a field of milky blue.  Icy filaments
        surround the undulating center.

        The eye is brown in a tiny screen.  On the metallic
        surface below, the words VOIGHT-KAMPFF are finely
        etched.  There's a touch-light panel across the top
        and on the side of the screen, a dial that registers
        fluctuations of the iris.

        The instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits
        on a table between two men.  The man talking is big,
        looks like an over-stuffed kid.  "LEON" it says on
        his breast pocket.  He's dressed in a warehouseman's
        uniform and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in
        his lap.  Despite the obvious heat, he looks very cool.

        The man facing him is lean, hollow cheeked and dressed
        in gray.  Detached and efficient, he looks like a cop
        or an accountant.  His name is HOLDEN and he's all
        business, except for the sweat on his face.

        The room is large and humid.  Rows of salvaged junk
        are stacked neatly against the walls.  Two large fans
        whir above their heads.

                                LEON
                  Okay if I talk?

        Holden doesn't answer.  He's centering Leon's eye on
        the machine.

                                LEON
                  I kinda get nervous when I
                  take tests.

                                HOLDEN
                  Don't move.

                                LEON
                  Sorry.

        He tries not to move but finally his lips can't help
        a sheepish smile.

                                LEON
                  Already had I.Q. test this year --
                  but I don't think I never had a...

                                HOLDEN
                         (cutting in)
                  Reaction time is a factor in this,
                  so please pay attention.  Answer
                  quickly as you can.

        Leon compresses his lips and nods his big head eagerly.
        Holden's voice is cold, geared to intimidate and evoke
        response.

                                HOLDEN
                  You're in a desert, walking along
                  in the sand when all of a sudden
                  you look down and see a...

                                LEON
                  What one?

        It was a timid interruption, hardly audible.

                                HOLDEN
                  What?

                                LEON
                  What desert?

                                HOLDEN
                  Doesn't make any difference what
                  desert -- it's completely
                  hypothetical.

                                LEON
                  But how come I'd be there?

                                HOLDEN
                  Maybe you're fed up, maybe you
                  want to be by yourself -- who
                  knows.  So you look down and
                  see a tortoise.  It's crawling
                  towards you...

                                LEON
                  A tortoise.  What's that?

                                HOLDEN
                  Know what a turtle is?

                                LEON
                  Of course.

                                HOLDEN
                  Same thing.

                                LEON
                  I never seen a turtle.

        He sees Holden's patience is wearing thin.

                                LEON
                  But I understand what you mean.

                                HOLDEN
                  You reach down and flip the
                  tortoise over on its back, Leon.

        Keeping an eye on his subject, Holden notes the dials
        in the Voight-Kampff.  One of the needles quivers
        slightly.

                                LEON
                  You make these questions, Mr.
                  Holden, or they write 'em down
                  for you?

        Disregarding the question, Holden continues, picking
        up the pace.

                                HOLDEN
                  The tortoise lays on its back,
                  its belly baking in the hot sun,
                  beating its legs trying to turn
                  itself over.  But it can't.  Not
                  without your help.  But you're
                  not helping.

        Leon's upper lip is quivering.

                                LEON
                  Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?

                                HOLDEN
                  I mean you're not helping!
                  Why is that, Leon?

        Leon looks shocked, surprised.  But the needles in
        the computer barely move.  Holden goes for the inside
        of his coat.  But big Leon is faster.  His LASER BURNS
        a hole the size of a nickel through Holden's stomach.
        Unlike a bullet, a laser causes no impact.  It goes
        through Holden's spine and comes out his back, clean
        as a whistle.  Like a rag doll he falls back off the
        bench from the waist up.  By the time he hits the
        floor, big slow Leon is already walking away.  But he
        stops, turns and with a little smile of satisfaction,
        FIRES at the machine on the table.

        There's a flash and a puff of smoke.  The Voight-Kampff
        is hit dead center, crippled but not destroyed; as
        Leon walks out of the room, one of its lights begins
        to blink, faint but steady.

        EXT. DESERT - NIGHT                                     3

        The horizon marked by a thin copper line that maybe
        the end, of the beginning of a day.

        The train that follows, cuts through the night at 400
        miles an hour.

        INT. TRAIN - NIGHT                                      4

        No clickitty-clack of track-bound noise, it's a long,
        insulated Pullman of contoured seats and low-keyed
        lighting, coloured to soothe,and empty, except for
        the passenger half way down.

        His eyes closed, head rested against the glass.  Ten
        years ago, DECKARD might have been an athlete, a
        track man or a welter-weight.  The body looks it, but
        the face has seen some time -- not all of it good.

        INT. TRAIN - REFRESHMENT DISPENSER - NIGHT              5

        Deckard comes down the aisle, slips a coin into the
        mechanism, receives a beer and returns to his seat.

        INT. TRAIN - NIGHT                                      6

        Tired of the program, he takes off the headset and
        drops it next to three empty beer bottles and a
        sandwich wrapper, adjusts his position and winds up
        staring at his reflection in the window.  Runs a
        hand over his face, it could use a shave.  He leans
        closer and peers through the glass.

        Out there in the black a sign flashes past:  SAN
        ANGELES, THREE MINUTES.

        EXT. PLATFORM - NIGHT                                   7

        The train slides in, smooth as an eel, and stops with-
        out a sound.  Carrying a bag and umbrella, Deckard
        disembarks ahead of the other passengers and into the
        sweltering night.

        INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                   8

        Deckard has got his coat swung over his shoulder, his
        shirt already damp, as he walks down the long, hollow
        passage under orbs of yellow light.

        EXT. TERMINAL - NIGHT                                   9

        Deckard unlocks his car and gets in.  Turns the ig-
        nition and hits a sensor.  The dash console glows
        and Deckard sits back waiting for the air unit to cool
        things off.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  It was 97 degrees in the city and
                  no hope of improvement.  Not bad
                  if you're a lizard.  But two hours
                  earlier I was drinking Acquavit
                  with an Eskimo lady in North East
                  Alaska.  That's a tough change to
                  make.  It was so good, I didn't
                  want to leave, so I left a day
                  early.

        A little detached, Deckard taps another sensor on the
        panel, lights up a cigarette and watches as his mes-
        sages flash across the viewer stating date, time and
        caller.  The last one is repeated five times.  Deckard
        sighs, switches off the viewer and gets on the radio.

                                DECKARD
                  Contact.  This is Blade Runner One
                  calling Com-fast 27.

        The SOUND OF A CHIME precedes the mechanical female
        voice that answers.

                                VOICE
                  Blade Runner One, stand by please.

        A pause.  Followed by a husky male voice.

                                VOICE
                  Deckard.

                                DECKARD
                  Yah, Gaff.

                                GAFF (VOICE)
                  Where the hell you been?

                                DECKARD
                  You know where I been.  I been on
                  vacation.

                                GAFF
                  Next time you go on vacation,
                  do me a favor, let us know where
                  it is.

                                DECKARD
                  What's up?

                                GAFF
                  Holden got hit.

        There is a pause.  That was bad news.

                                DECKARD
                  Bad?

                                GAFF
                  Severed spine.  You'd better get
                  in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.

                                DECKARD
                  I'll see you in a minute.

        The ENGINE REVS, the wipers rake two weeks of dust off
        the windshield and Deckard jams out of the lot.

        INT. THE HALL OF JUSTICE - NIGHT                        10

        An enormous grey vault of a building.  A businesslike
        Deckard strides down a long corridor with his brief-
        case and police ID pinned to his coat.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  I-X-4-P-D referred to as a Nexus-6,
                  The Tyrell Corporation's new pride
                  and joy.  Holden was administering
                  the Voight-Kampff test when one
                  nailed him.

        The door in front of Deckard slides open and he walks
        through.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  The Nexus-6 must be fast because
                  Holden was as quick as they come.
                  The report said there were six of
                  them.  Three males and three female.
                  Led by a combat model called Roy
                  Batty.

        INT. INSPECTOR BRYANT'S OFFICE - NIGHT                  11

        The INSPECTOR is in his fifties.  The deep creases in
        his face, the broken capillaries in his nose say
        brawler, spoiler, drinker, but the diplomas on the
        wall say something else.  Bryant's kneeled at his safe
        trying to open it.  Deckard it sitting on the edge of
        the desk reading the print-out.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  They escaped from the colonies
                  two weeks ago.  Killed twenty-
                  three people and jumped a shuttle.
                  An aerial patrol found the ship
                  in the desert.  No crew.

        Bryant gets the safe open and brings out a bottle of
        whiskey.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  Bryant's got a liver problem.  A
                  couple years back he handed me a
                  bottle and said have a drink for
                  another man.  I been drinking
                  for him ever since.

        Deckard sets down the report and takes the shot Bryant
        just poured for him.

                                DECKARD
                  Six, huh?

                                BRYANT
                  Five.  Three nights ago one of
                  them managed to break into the
                  Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two
                  guards and got as far as the
                  Genetic Sector before he got
                  fried going through an electro-
                  field.

                                DECKARD
                  What was he after?

                                BRYANT
                  There wasn't much left of him,
                  so we can't be sure.  But bio-
                  chemical data and morphology records
                  of the Nexus-6 were reported
                  missing.  Going on the possibility
                  they might try to infiltrate we
                  send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff
                  tests on the new employees.  Guess
                  he found himself one.

        A grim pause.

                                DECKARD
                  You got a machine on it yet?

                                BRYANT
                  We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that
                  picked up Holden's alarm.  Its
                  guess is that all five are in
                  the city.

                                DECKARD
                  Where do we start?

        Bryant's back at the safe locking up his bottle.

                                BRYANT
                  The Tyrell Corporation has a
                  demo model.  Check it out on the
                  Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance
                  the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability
                  to detect.  If that's the case,
                  everybody's up shit creek.

                                DECKARD
                  What was the cover on the one that
                  got Holden?

                                BRYANT
                  Industrial refuse.

                                DECKARD
                  Garbage man?

        Bryant nods.

                                DECKARD
                  Did personnel have an address on
                  him?

        Bryant fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket,
        copies down a number and hands it over.

                                DECKARD
                  I'll go take a look.

        Deckard stands and holds up his drink.

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

        Like a sick boy looking out of the window, Bryant
        watches Deckard down the whiskey.  Deckard puts down
        the glass and turns to leave.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  The big incentive to emigrate was
                  still free labor.  If the public
                  found out that their door-prizes
                  might kill them, they might not be
                  so hot to go up there.  This was
                  one of the worst one's we had and
                  Bryant was worried.  He wanted to
                  tell me to be discrete or something.
                  But I didn't give him a chance.

        EXT. LEON'S HOTEL ENTRANCE - NIGHT                      12

        An electrical storm is brewing.  Deckard stands out-
        side the entrance to an old hotel holding an umbrella,
        as people scuttle into doorways to avoid the sudden
        downpour.

        INT. LEON'S HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT                         13

        A heavy metal maze of cubicles and perilous iron
        balconies, peopled with rejects from the surface world;
        Mato Grosso Indians in white man's clothes and other
        lower echelon welfare recipients.  Drop city is crowded,
        cramped and darkly alive.

        Deckard steps out of an elevator and moves through the
        crowd.  A cloud of steam drifts up through  a grating
        as two old men, clad in towels descend a flight of
        stairs under a neon sign that says bath house.

        A musty subterranean wind ripples Deckard's clothes as
        he turns into an alcove.  He stops in front of a door
        that says, MANAGER and pushes the buzzer.  It's opened
        by an emphysema victim with an oxygen tank lashed to
        his hip.  Deckard flashes his ID and speaks some words
        which are inaudible due to the TUBA MUSIC down the hall.
        The man grabs a key from his wall, hands it over and
        shuts the door.

        INT. LEON'S HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT                      14

        The companion ways below deck of a big ship are no
        more bewildering than the ups and downs and ins and
        outs of this establishment.  But Deckard finds the door
        he's looking for.  He pauses a moment, listens, then
        knocks.  He inserts the key and with a hand on his gun
        opens it.

        INT. LEON'S ROOM - NIGHT                                15

        An empty room.  A cot and not much else.  He steps in
        and stands quiet as a hunter sensing the signs.  For a
        place surrounded by greasy hovels it is surprisingly
        clean.  Spartan in fact.  The towel by the spotless
        basin is perfectly folded.

        Deckard runs two fingers over a shelf.  No dust.  He
        looks in the waste basket.  Wadded up candy wrappers.
        The bed by the window is neatly made.  Deckard looks
        under it, then runs his hands along both sides of the
        mattress.

        The closet.  There's one suit in it.  He pats it down.
        Nothing. A show box on the floor.  He stoops, takes
        out what looks like a pen from his pocket and care-
        fully traces it over the box.  Assured of its harm-
        lessness, he lifts off the lid.

        It contains a little stack of photos bound with a
        rubber band.  Deckard removes them, goes to the lamp
        by the balcony window and turns it on.

        A touching collection of family snapshots.  The kind of
        anonymous stuff sold by the bunch in dusty junk shops.
        The family dog.  Junior on the pony squinting in the
        sun.  Uncle Ben clowning with the kids.  The faded
        polaroid of Christmas morning.  Simple pictures of
        simple folks celebrating the family bond.  A curious
        collection for the likes of Leon and Deckard studies
        them with interest.

        EXT. STREET BELOW - NIGHT                               16

        Oblivious to the cloudburst, a blue-eyed albino stands
        in the doorway, peddling candy and artificial flowers
        looking like he'd never been touched by the light of
        day.

        Leon is standing behind him, staring up at his room,
        watching Deckard at the window.  He's still wearing
        his coveralls, but he looks different.  His face is
        more intent, smarter and angry.

        EXT. STREET BELOW - NIGHT                               17

        For one seething moment it looks like Leon might mash
        something, but suddenly he swings away and disappears
        into the crowd.

        INT. LEON'S ROOM - NIGHT                                18

        Deckard pockets the pictures and moves away from the
        window.

        EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                      19

        Leon's got a neck like a fire hydrant and legs to
        match, but he's a graceful runner.  Looks like he could
        do it for days.  And he could.  He's put a lot of alley
        behind him and he's not out of breath.

        EXT. CHINATOWN - NIGHT                                  20

        Slowing down he cuts into an opening and comes out onto
        a narrow street.  The Asian Quarter.

        INT. CHOP SUEY HOUSE - NIGHT                            21

        A seamy as well as steamy little place.  Counter and
        small tables.  Old slant-eyed enders humped over their
        fuming bowls jabbering and slurping.

        The only voice coming out clear is from the big three-
        D TV on the back wall.  As the mellow-mouthed TV
        announcer delivers the message, a Latin-looking beauty
        in a well-fitted maids uniform does a twirl, flashes
        a beguiling smile and glides OUT OF FRAME.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  Choose from a variety of seventy
                  nine different personality types.
                  Each and every one a loyal trouble-
                  free companion given to you upon
                  your arrival absolutely free...

        The Latin beauty is replaced by an impeccable Ray
        Bolger type gentleman's gentleman who clicks his heels,
        snaps to attention and struts off to make room for the
        next.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  To use as personal body servant
                  to tireless field hand -- the
                  custom tailored humanoid robot,
                  designed especially for your
                  needs.

        The Chinese are paying no attention, but the man and
        the woman seated at the table by the window are.

        The woman is pretty, a touch of gray in her hair, kind
        and blue-eyed.  MARY looks like an American dream mom,
        right out of "Father Knows Best."

        The man also resembles a tradition: the gym instructor,
        short cropped hair with the body of a drill sergeant,
        but the eyes are grey and chilling.  ROY BATTY is a
        presence of force with a lazy, but acute sense of what
        goes on around him.

        Leon has just come through the door behind them.  Try-
        ing not to be the bull in a china shop, he approaches
        their table and kneels .  Batty doesn't bother to look
        at him, which amplifies the note of sarcasm in his
        quiet voice.

                                BATTY
                  Did you get your precious 'things'?

                                LEON
                  Somebody was already there.

                                BATTY
                  Police.

                                LEON
                  Just a man.

                                BATTY
                  Police man.

        Leon looks sullen.

                                BATTY
                  Why don't you have a seat.

        There's one next to him.  Leon pulls it over and sits.

                                BATTY
                  Enjoy the view.

        From the pot on the table, Mary pours tea and they sit
        so quiet and still in this noisy place that they seem
        almost invisible.  The view they're "enjoying" is
        through the window.  Outside the neon side in the win-
        dow directly across the street says:  HANNIBAL CHEW,
        MEMBERS.

        INT. HANNIBAL CHEW'S SHOP - NIGHT                       22

        Chew is a spindly old man of precision, his veiled
        eyes are shrewd and Chinese, but the rest of him
        looks like a Charles Dickens invention.

        He's got a jewelers' glass stuck in his eye, lurched
        over a lamp, squinting at something in his hand.  After
        a moment his lips peal back into a sour, belligerent
        smile.

                                CHEW
                  Well, you're right.  This little
                  honey has a couple of defective cones.

        He snaps off the lamp and swings round to face his
        client.

        SEBASTIAN'S face is almost young, but something has
        gone too far, too fast.  Premature old age has made
        his bones brittle and his co-ordination slow.  The
        house may be dark but there's a light on in it.  Se-
        bastian is a closet genius.

                                CHEW
                  You're a regular perfectionist,
                  Sebastian.

        Sebastian's apologetic, especially around the acerbic
        Mr. Chew.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  It's gotta be right for my
                  customer.

                                CHEW
                  Your customer, eh?

        Chew snickers and beckons.  Sebastian follows his down
        a high narrow hall to a heavy insulated door.  There's
        a moth-eaten full length fur coat hanging by it.  Chew
        tugs it on and they go through.  The big door slams
        shut behind them.

        INT. COLD STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT                          23

        Except for the work table with its sharp gleaming in-
        struments, the room is as barren and sterile as a
        morgue.  The glass-doored compartments in the walls
        look like crypts.  Some of them small as post office
        boxes.  From one of the Chew removes a vacuum, packed
        box.  Carefully separating the seal, he reaches into
        the purple jell and with a pair of tweezers extracts
        an eye.

        Through the jeweler's glass, which he has not bothered
        to remove, Chew holds the eye up to the light and
        studies it a moment.  His other hand searches through
        his pockets.

                                CHEW
                  You got a pocket-charger, boy?

        Quick to accommodate, Sebastian removes a pencil-like
        device from a row of such things in his breast pocket
        and steps closer.  The back of the eye is touched with
        the pencil and the pupil moves.  Suddenly its staring
        back at them.

                                CHEW
                  Is that good enough for your
                  customer?

        Anxious to leave, Sebastian nods.  Chew reseals the
        eye taking his time.  He can afford to, he's wearing
        his coat.

                                CHEW
                  How much is he paying you?

        In place of an answer, Sebastian clears his throat,
        stares at the bag like he didn't hear.

                                CHEW
                  Well, when do you get paid?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Soon as I finish the job.

                                CHEW
                  When might that be?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Day after tomorrow.

                                CHEW
                  Oh!  Day after tomorrow.

        Sebastian nods.  Chew stares at the poor bastard, con-
        cerned in spite of himself.

                                CHEW
                  The rich hate to pay, Sebastian.
                  A guy like Tyrell keeps you waiting.
                  Pay the little guy last.  You should
                  charge twice as much.  It'll make
                  him feel better.

        Sebastian nods his head like that's exactly what he'll
        do.  Chew sees it's hopeless and hands him the bag.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Thanks, Mr. Chew.

        Chew pulls the door open for him and Sebastian goes
        through quick as a dog.

        EXT. HANNIBAL CHEW'S STORE - STREET - NIGHT             24

        Sebastian may lack co-ordination but he got what he
        came for and there's a hopeful spring to his walk as
        he heads for his truck.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S AMBULANCE - NIGHT                      25

        It's an old panel job with ambulance siren and lights.
        The lettering on the side reads "J.R. SEBASTIAN -
        ANIMOID EXPRESS."  Sebastian gets in, starts up the
        engine and suddenly realizes he's not alone.  It's a
        jolt that causes him to yelp.

        PRIS is sprawled on the seat next to him, and wakes up
        with a yelp of her own.  They stare at one another for
        a startled instant, and she jumps out and starts walk-
        ing.

        But she's forgotten her little beat-up overnight case.
        Sebastian puts the truck in gear, drives next to her
        and opens the door.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Hey!  You forgot your...

        He holds up the bag.  Hesitantly she reaches for it.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  How come you were in my truck?

                                PRIS
                  I was tired and didn't have any
                  place to go.

        She stares at him, hand on her case, looking lost.
        Sebastian isn't good at this, but he tries.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You can get back in if you want...

        She can't make up her mind.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

        She gets in.  Both of them are silent.  People are not
        Sebastian's medium -- usually he's too shy, but this
        girl is shyer still, plus they're about the same age --
        it gives him courage.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What's your name?

                                PRIS
                  Pris.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

                                PRIS
                  Hi.

        So pleased with the way that went, he forgets for a
        while what comes next.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh!  Where do you want to go?

        She shrugs.  That leaves him a lot of responsibility.
        He throws her side-long glances, but she's not helping.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You want to go home?

                                PRIS
                  I don't have one.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh.

        What do you do with a teenage beauty who looks like
        she's lost out of some "Welcome to Sunny Arizona"
        poster?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Where are your folks?

                                PRIS
                  They left.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What about friends?

                                PRIS
                  I have some, but I have to find
                  out where they are staying.

        She leans forward and rests her elbows on the dash.
        Her body would win prizes, from any angle.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Well, where should I take you?

        She looks at him,a shadow of enticement in her clear
        blue eyes.

                                PRIS
                  We scared each other pretty good
                  didn't we?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  We sure did.

        She giggles and laughs.

                                PRIS
                  I'm hungry, J.F.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I've got stuff.  If you wanna go
                  to my place?

                                PRIS
                  I was hoping you'd say that.

        Sebastian's face is normally on the grey side, but it
        just turned red.  He turns on the ignition and they
        pull away from the curb.

        INT. DECKARD'S CAR - FREEWAY - NIGHT                    26

        Speeding along the freeway.  The terminal in the com-
        munications console lit.  Deckard's right hand just
        finished a punch-up.  The screen flashes back.

        REQUEST

        Deckard punches up.  Letters flash across the screen:

        ESPER

        Screen flashes back:

        CLEARANCE

        Deckard punches up.

        BLADE RUNNER ONE CODE ML-33

        Pause.

        Screen flashes:

        STAND BY.

        Deckard's voice has been heard over the preceding.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  Machines can be helpful sometimes,
                  but they can also be a pain in the
                  ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger
                  and you might wind up at a steel-
                  mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once
                  in a while -- it's their personalities
                  that usually get me.  Somebody once
                  said that man makes machines in his own
                  image.  If that's true, whoever made
                  Esper should have been shot.

                                ESPER
                  This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go
                  ahead please.

        Esper's deep melodious voice is anxious to please, and
        oiled with a touch of self-pity.

                                DECKARD
                  You equipped for random questions?

                                ESPER
                  Why, yes, of course.

                                DECKARD
                  You start.

                                ESPER
                  The five in question are third
                  generation Nexus Sixes, constructed
                  of skin-flesh culture, selected
                  enogenic transfer conversion
                  capable of self-perpetuating
                  thought, para-physical abilities
                  and developed for emigration
                  program.  Are you with me?

                                DECKARD
                  How do I stop one?

                                ESPER
                  Unlike a five, they can sustain
                  massive traumas to several parts
                  of the body without debilitating
                  another.  Sever a leg and it will
                  perform quicker on the remaining leg
                  than the fastest man can run,

                                DECKARD
                  Okay, but...

                                ESPER
                  I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable
                  zone is the base of the skull,
                  the occipital bone.  A direct hit
                  is a positive retirement.

        The communication is interrupted by a BELL which is
        immediately followed by a stern, MECHANICAL VOICE.

                                VOICE
                  You are in violation of traffic

                  limit restricted by one-hundred
                  and eighty kilometers.

        In his rear view mirror Deckard sees two black-clad
        motorcycle cops coming up behind him like the hounds
        of hell.  They draw silently alongside.  Deckard
        presses his I.D. to the window.

        The cop tosses a salute to Deckard and he and his
        partner accelerate, vanish in the night.  And Deckard's
        car does too.

        EXT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT                              27

        A district of silence and ruin.  The street is strewn
        with refuse.  The building looks vacant.  A ten storey
        condo gone to shit.  The vandals have come and gone
        long ago.

        Sebastian's little white ambulance parked at the curb.
        MR. DEETCHUM, the old Watchman, sitting in the building
        entry in a straight backed chair, is reading a comic
        book.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                      28

        Well stocked with items of survival, all labeled and
        stacked.  And shelved along the walls and hung from the
        ceiling is a menagerie of animoids.  Like so many broken
        toys awaiting resurrection from Sebastian's wise hands.
        
        Sebastian is seated at a large work-table, bent over a
        stereo scope.  The tool in his right hand is a sensor
        probe and he's using it with the delicacy of an en-
        graver.

        The object of his concentration is a maze-like chip
        configuration no bigger than a thumbnail, but magnified
        under the scope, it looks like an aerial view of a
        large city.  The needle-like sensor probe moves care-
        fully over the contours of the configuration, testing
        the bonds.

        Suddenly a blue flash erupts from one of the junctures.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh!

        Pris is light on her feet.  She's standing behind him
        with a half-eaten sandwich in her hand.

                                PRIS
                  Whatcha doin'?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You scared me.

        But he's happy to see her.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I'm working.

        She's changed her dress and made up her face.  Looks a
        little older and sexier.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You look... better.

                                PRIS
                  Just better.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Beautiful.

                                PRIS
                  Thanks.

        He watches her as she prowls around the room, looking
        at this and that, eating her sandwich.

                                PRIS
                  And you live in this building all
                  by yourself?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yeah, I live here pretty much
                  alone right now...

        Trying to make light of it.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  No housing shortage around here...
                  plenty of room for everybody.

        She sprawls on the couch studying him.

                                PRIS
                  How old are you?

        He can't meet her eyes.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Twenty.

                                PRIS
                  What's your problem?

        It's not an easy subject.  His voice is barely audible.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Methuselah Syndrome.

                                PRIS
                  What's that?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  My glands.  They grow old too fast.

                                PRIS
                  Is that why you're still here?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.

        There is a silence.  He steals a glance at her.

                                PRIS
                  I like you just the way you are.

        Under the desk he bats his knees together.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Ah, you get hold of your friends?

                                PRIS
                  As a matter of fact I did.  They've
                  got some work to do tonight, but
                  they're gonna come tomorrow.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Good.

        The implications catch up.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I can sleep on the couch.

        A little gray mouse on the shelf above his head bobs
        up.

                                MOUSE
                  Don't let the bed bugs bite!

        Taking their cue from the mouse, some of the more
        talented animoids toot, flap and wheel about.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        29

        It's dark except for the glow of the terminal.  A tired
        Deckard sits in front of it.  Esper sounds like he's
        been talking for hours.

                                ESPER

        A long pause.

                                ESPER
                  Here's something you might find
                  interesting.  They have been built
                  to emulate the human in every way
                  except in its emotional spectrum.
                  However, after a period of time
                  it is only logical that such a
                  'mechanism' would create its own
                  emotional responses, hate, love,
                  fear, anger, envy.

                                DECKARD
                  I know all that.

                                ESPER
                  What about a summary then.

                                DECKARD
                  I think we're through for the night.

        Deckard starts to reach for the panel.

                                ESPER
                  Mr. Deckard.

        Hesitates.

                                DECKARD
                  Yes?

                                ESPER
                  Do you have something against
                  science?

                                DECKARD
                  Not if it works.

                                ESPER
                  And what in your estimation works?

                                DECKARD
                  The umbrella.

        Deckard picks up the umbrella and with it stabs the
        terminal off button before Esper can respond and the
        machine goes dead.  He sits there for a moment then
        flips on the lamp.  Leon's snap-shots are spread out
        before him.

        INT. SPINNER - DAY                                      30

        A police marked spinner makes a sharp bank, drops into
        a steep curve and slides towards the Tyrell Corporation.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  Every government that could was
                  racing to populate their colonial
                  territory.  But emigrants needed
                  incentive.  Over-population and
                  the greenhouse factor didn't seem
                  to be enough; but owning a human
                  look-a-like had lots of appeal.
                  It was big industry, the competition
                  was stiff and Tyrell was top of the
                  line.

        EXT. TYRELL CORPORATION - DAY                           31

        The spinner gently touches down.  The hatch drops open
        and Deckard steps out.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  His claim to fame was making a
                  product more human than human and
                  sometimes the 'more' turned out to
                  be a problem.  This wasn't just an
                  escaped andy who broke his owner's
                  arm -- there were twenty-eight
                  people dead and the pressure was
                  on.

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION - DAY                           32

        Deckard walks up to a desk, hands his I.D. to a guard
        who checks it against a list on a screen.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  But so far they'd always managed
                  to keep it quiet.  Not to say
                  that once in a while there wasn't
                  bad publicity.  Some fanatic
                  bitching about equal rights for
                  andies or an occasional trade union
                  proclaiming it was aun-American for
                  automatons to take jobs away from
                  humans on the colony.

        The guard hands Deckard back his I.D., pushed a button
        and Deckard walks away.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  But what's more American than good
                  old supply and demand?  The
                  Government needed them, industry
                  made them and the church backed
                  them.  The big religious boys
                  said that Androids, no matter how
                  human, were objects; only God
                  could make people. I'm not religious,
                  but I was inclined to agree.
                  Otherwise I'd be out of a job.

        The elevator door slides open.  The young lady inside
        would look right standing on a cliff, hair blowing in
        the wind, looking out to sea in a 19th Century painting.

                                RACHAEL
                  Hello, Mr. Deckard.  My name is
                  Rachael.

        Deckard tips his head to her and steps in.

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION ELEVATOR - DAY                  33

        No woman can be all things to all men, the Rachael comes
        closer than most.  The only trouble is she's all busi-
        ness.  Formidable without really trying.  Some beauty
        is better avoided and Deckard looks straight ahead.

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION CORRIDOR - DAY                  33A

        The door slides open and they continue down the corri-
        dor.

                                 RACHAEL
                  It seems your department doesn't
                  believe out new unit is to the
                  public benefit.

                                 DECKARD
                  A humanoid robot is like any other
                  machine, it can be a benefit or a
                  hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's
                  not our problem.

                                 RACHAEL
                  But because your department can't
                  do an adequate job in detecting
                  the miniscule number at large,
                  it's a problem.  Correct, Mr.
                  Deckard?

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION - AIR-FILTERED CORRIDOR - DAY   33B

        They pass into a canopied, air-filtered corridor.
        Deckard doesn't answer the question because he's looking
        at the animals.  Small northern animals in neat "en-
        vironmental" cages.  He looks at the rabbit, the raccoon
        and the squirrel, but the owl asleep on its perch stops
        him.  The armed guard at the exit never takes his eyes
        off them.

                                RACHAEL
                  You like our owl?

        Deckard nods.  Rachael claps her hands.  The owl opens
        its yellow eyes and blinks at them.

                                DECKARD
                  It's artificial?

                                RACHAEL
                  Of course not.

        Hands thrust in her pockets, she strides off towards
        the exit without looking back.

        The exit is another tube.  Just big enough for two.  No
        room for excess.  He tries to ignore her cool appraising
        stare.

                                RACHAEL
                  You're in a very unique position,
                  Mr. Deckard.  You could affect the
                  future of this entire organization
                  according to how you work your
                  little test.

        Deckard has nothing to say.

                                RACHAEL
                  Are you apprehensive?

                                DECKARD
                  Why should I be?

                                RACHAEL
                  For the responsibility of your
                  power.  Being a police bureaucrat,
                  you've got more than your share.

        The door slides open.  Deckard looks down at her.

                                DECKARD
                  You got it wrong, girl.  I work
                  with the bureau not for them.

        He lets it sink in.

                                DECKARD
                  My job isn't to detect
                  malfunctioning andies, it's to
                  eliminate them.  The more the
                  better.

        He walks out of the elevator first.

        INT. INNER SANCTUM OF DR. TYRELL - DAY                  34

        The office is dimly lit, but highlights of resilience
        reside in the luster of the antique furnishings, like
        glimmers of gold in a darkened mine.  Dr. Tyrell is a
        fragile man of power, with that look of "youth" obtained
        from steroids and surgery.  Dapper and trim, he leans
        against the desk looking at an old fashioned pocket
        watch.  The only sound is the insidious PERKING of COFFEE
        BREWING in the background.

        Tyrell taps a sensor on his desk.  The door in front of
        Deckard and Rachael slides open.  They enter a vestibule
        and face another door, this one befitting the decor of
        the office, Tyrell slips the watch into his pocket as
        they enter.

                                RACHAEL
                  Mr. Deckard.  Dr. Eldon Tyrell.

                                TYRELL
                  How do you do, Mr. Deckard.  Please
                  sit down.  Would you care for a cup
                  of coffee?

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

                                TYRELL
                  Black?

                                DECKARD
                  Please.

        Tyrell pours from an old time sylex into small china
        cups and hands one to Deckard.  The congenial light in
        his eyes could almost pass for warmth -- dragon warmth.

                                TYRELL
                  Somehow, I didn't expect that the
                  man who did the dirty work would
                  be the man to do the technical
                  work.  Here you are, Mr. Deckard.

        He hands Deckard a cup of coffee.

                                TYRELL
                  Is this to be an empathy test?

                                DECKARD
                  Yes.

                                TYRELL
                  Capillary dilation of the so-called
                  blush response?  Plus fluctuation
                  of the pupil, plus involuntary
                  dilation of the iris?

        Deckard nods.

                                TYRELL
                  May I ask a personal question?

                                DECKARD
                  Go ahead.

                                TYRELL
                  Have you ever retired a human by
                  mistake?

                                DECKARD
                  No.

                                TYRELL
                  But in your profession that is a
                  risk.

                                DECKARD
                  Nothing is infallible, but so far
                  the Voight-Kampff scale bas been
                  foolproof.

                                TYRELL
                  Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a
                  machine can be a hazard.  The
                  Voight-Kampff scale is a machine,
                  isn't it?

                                DECKARD
                  One that relies on human
                  interpretation.  Where's the
                  subject?

                                TYRELL
                  Sitting next to you.

        Deckard stares at Rachael, then back at Tyrell.  Delighted,
        Tyrell takes a cup of coffee.

        Accepting the challenge, Deckard opens his briefcase and
        starts fishing out the apparatus.

        THE VOIGHT-KAMPFF                                       35

        Rachael's eye fills the screen, the iris brilliant, shot
        with light, the pupil contracting.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  Ready.

                                RACHAEL
                  Go ahead.

        In the soft green glow of the dials, the needles in both
        gauges are at rest.  Dr. Tyrell stands silhouetted behind
        Deckard, who sits in front of Rachael, a pencil beam
        trained on her eye.  Wire mesh discs are attached to her
        cheeks.

                                DECKARD
                  You're given a calfskin wallet
                  for your birthday.

        The needles in both gauges swing violently past green to
        red, then subside.

                                RACHAEL
                  I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd
                  report the person who gave it to
                  me to the police.

                                DECKARD
                  You have a little boy.  He shows
                  you his butterfly collection, plus
                  the killing jar.

        Again the gauges register, but not so far.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'd take him to the doctor.

                                DECKARD
                  You're watching T.V. and suddenly
                  you notice a wasp crawling on your
                  wrist.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'd kill it.

        Both needles go to red.  Deckard makes a note, takes a
        sip of coffee and continues.

                                DECKARD
                  In a magazine you come across a
                  full-page photo of a nude girl.

                                RACHAEL
                  Is this testing whether I'm an
                  android or a lesbian?

                                DECKARD
                  You show the picture to your husband.
                  He likes it and hangs it on the wall.
                  The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.

                                RACHEL
                  I wouldn't let him.

                                DECKARD
                  Why not?

                                RACHAEL
                  I should be enough for him.

        Deckard frowns, then smiles.  His smile looks a little
        like a grimace or the other way around.

                                DECKARD
                  You become pregnant by a man who
                  runs off with your best friend,
                  and you decide to get an abortion.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'd never get an abortion.

                                DECKARD
                  Why not?

                                RACHAEL
                  That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.

                                DECKARD
                  In your opinion.

                                RACHAEL
                  It would be my child.

                                DECKARD
                  Sounds like you speaks from
                  experience.

        He notes the needles.  One goes green and the other
        remains inert.

                                DECKARD
                  Last question.  You're watching
                  an old movie.  It shows a banquet in
                  progress, the guests are enjoying
                  raw oysters.

                                RACHAEL
                  Ugh.

        Both needles swing swiftly.

                                DECKARD
                  The entree consists of boiled
                  dog stuffed with rice.

        Needles move less.

                                DECKARD
                  The raw oysters are less acceptable
                  to you than a dish of boiled dog.

        Deckard moves the adhesive discs from her cheeks and
        switches off his beam.

                                DECKARD
                  Lights please.

        The lights come on.

                                TYRELL
                  Well?

                                DECKARD
                  If she is, the machine works.

                                TYRELL
                  The machine works.  She is.

        Rachael sits very still.  Except her eyes -- they go to
        Tyrell and hang on.  He stares back at her as he speaks.

                                TYRELL
                  How many questions did it take?

                                DECKARD
                  Thirteen.

        Rachael sits rigidly in her chair, as the ground crumbles
        around her, her big mermaid eyes locked with Tyrell.
        His voice is quiet and strong, mesmerizing.  She's hang-
        ing by a thread.

        Deckard watches with a bas taste in his mouth.

                                DECKARD
                  She didn't know?

                                TYRELL
                  Memory implant.  She was programmed.
                  But I think she has transcended
                  her conditioning.  I think she was
                  beginning to suspect.

        Rachael nods fixedly.  Careful not to let go her grasp.

                                TYRELL
                  How many questions does it usually
                  take, Mr. Deckard?

                                DECKARD
                  Five, maybe six.

        Slowly, carefully, Tyrell unlocks his gaze from Rachael
        and turns towards Deckard, who is starting to put away
        his equipment.

                                TYRELL
                  You're going to have to be on your
                  toes, my friend.

        Deckard glances back at him.

                                TYRELL
                  It's a complex problem and we
                  wouldn't want anything to happen
                  to you.

        Less of a man might shrink at the end of Deckard's look,
        but not Tyrell.

                                TYRELL
                  For the good of all, I recommend
                  you take Rachael with you.
                  Considering her uniqueness, I'm
                  sure she could prove quite helpful.

        Deckard almost smiles at the nasty power of Tyrell's
        style.  He turns away and starts packing up the Voight-
        Kampff.

                                DECKARD
                  No thanks.

        Deckard is ready to go.

                                TYRELL
                  And how is it one man will be able
                  to cover so much ground?

                                DECKARD
                  Discreetly.

                                TYRELL
                  All pertinent information is
                  being fed into your departmental
                  computer, an Esper 231 -- I
                  believe -- and a photo over-lay
                  packet is being produced.

        Deckard opens the door.

                                TYRELL
                  Mr. Deckard, I think it would be
                  wise to reconsider my offer.

        Rachael sits there very pale and expressionless, her
        feet flat on the floor, alone is the word.

        Trying to keep the fury out of it, Deckard's voice
        comes out in a whisper.

                                DECKARD
                  I work alone.

        On the last word, Rachael glances up at him and Deckard
        turns away. The outer door slides open and he goes
        through it.

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     36

        As seen through the windshield from the passenger side
        of a vintage Dusenberg.  The headlights cut through the
        dark, illuminating a narrow strip of mountain road.  A
        downgrade.

        A sign slides by stating:  "Caution Curves Ahead."
        Good advice considering the sheer nightmare of a drop
        to the right and the wall of solid rock to the left.

        The steady HUM of the ENGINE and the HISS of the TIRES
        will remain, but the location suddenly changes to:

        INT. ROOM - NIGHT                                       37

        A pleasant place of soft light and domestic charm.  The
        young lady in the short dress is vacuuming the rug.
        Her back to the viewer.  As she bends over to vacuum
        beneath the couch, exposing her beautiful ass, an
        admonishment from a resonant and slightly tired MALE
        VOICE intercedes.

                                VOICE
                  Let's keep our eyes on the road,
                  Deckard.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  Sorry.

        Abruptly the VIEW FLASHES BACK TO:

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     38

        The moon is up there slicing through the trees, strobing
        over the hood of the car.  The road is getting steeper
        and the corners sharper.  Rags of mist skim by as the
        Dusenberg picks up speed.  It is becoming a riveting
        ride, but the passenger's mind moves elsewhere.

        EXT. WOODS - DAY                                        39

        Swift, soft clouds overhead.  In the cold shine of
        the icy light,the viewer walks down an aisle of maples
        and beeches, their clean hard limbs deflecting the
        frosty light, and underfoot the crisp, blue-white snow,
        melted through in spots, exposing soggy patches of rich
        brown earth.

                                VOICE
                  Come on, stay with the machine.

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     40

        The Dusenberg is going faster now, headlights eating
        up the road.  Rushing the corners in gut wrenching four-
        wheel drifts.  Not a pleasant sensation if you don't
        like roller-coasters.

        The Dusenberg slides out of a corner and faces a couple
        hundred yards of straightway leading to the next bend.

        Good place for a breather, but the driver shifts into
        high and screws on.

        EXT. LAKE - DAY                                         41

        Cold and gray.  The current running strong.  The nose
        of a kayak points through the swells, the viewer paddling
        for the shore.

        This is cold remote country, wild and untouched.  A sky
        bluer than the Madonna's cloak.  The kayak banks and
        the viewer steps out, moving over the sandy beach
        towards a little camp.

                                VOICE
                  We're going to have to start the
                  sequence again if you don't stay
                  with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  How do you know I'm not?

                                VOICE
                  You're not responding to the
                  stimulus.  I can see right here,
                  I'm not getting a reading.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  I'm tired of this.

                                VOICE
                  Almost through.

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     42

        In the Dusenberg the driver turns to look at the passen-
        ger, his specter-like face obscured by shadow, but by
        the glint of teeth, he must have just smiled.  And the
        passenger's view snaps back to the road.

        Suddenly another pair of headlights round the approach-
        ing bend.  Large ones, of a bus or a truck.  Blinding.

        The Dusenberg is going too fast to stop.  No room to
        pass.  HORNS BLAST.  The Dusenberg brakes, goes into a
        broadside skid.  The hands of the passenger reach out
        and grip the mahogany dash.  Brakes locked, TIRES
        SCREAMING, skidding.  The Dusenberg tears through the
        railing and plunges into space.  The last view of the
        passenger is pure vertigo.  Silence.

        INT. DOCTOR WHEELER'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON                43

        The good doctor is bending over his glass-top desk which
        resembles a pin-ball machine.  Displayed under its
        surface is a network of crisp electronic symbols and
        read-outs indicating the results of the test.

        Deckard detached the patches from his forehead, which
        it a little damp, but other than that, he looks no
        worse for wear, stands up to stretch and walks over to
        the doctor's desk.

                                DECKARD
                  So how did I do?

        Dr. Wheeler is a thin boney man, aloof but a promise
        of compassion in his sunken eyes.

                                WHEELER
                  Nerves of steel.

                                DECKARD
                  No rust?

                                WHEELER
                  I didn't say that.  Your motivity
                  rate checked out a little slower
                  than last time.

                                DECKARD
                  Meaning?

                                WHEELER
                  Meaning you don't run as fast as
                  you used to.

        Deckard starts to dress.

                                WHEELER
                  During the road test...

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah?

                                WHEELER
                  Your mind kept wandering.  That
                  bothered me.

                                DECKARD
                  Huh huh.

                                WHEELER
                  Considering the nature of your
                  work, that could be unhealthy.

                                DECKARD
                  True.

        Wheeler studies his "desk" for a moment and his finger
        comes down on the section illuminating Deckard's simple
        statistics.

                                WHEELER
                  You got a birthday coming up.

        Deckard bends over slipping on his shoes.  Wheeler looks
        up, concerned.

                                WHEELER
                  But you haven't put in for
                  emigration.

                                DECKARD
                  Nope.

                                WHEELER
                  You're going to be over the limit.

                                DECKARD
                  Listen, I could make you a long
                  list of complaints about this
                  fucken city but I still rather be
                  here than up there.

                                WHEELER
                  What if you change your mind?

                                DECKARD
                  They'll change the limit before
                  I change my mind.

                                WHEELER
                  You sure?

                                DECKARD
                  Never been more sure of anything
                  in my life.

        Deckard is ready to go.  Looking at Wheeler, a little
        touched with his concern.

                                DECKARD
                  Why didn't you go?

                                WHEELER
                  Too old.

                                DECKARD
                  But if you could?

        Wheeler considers it a moment, smiles and shakes his head.

                                WHEELER
                  My job is here.

                                DECKARD
                  Me too.

        They shake hands and Deckard walks.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON             44

        The referee is bouncing around the ring, trying to keep
        up with the two Mexican light-weights pounding the shit
        out of each other.  If not for the fuzz and the silence,
        the audio on the holoscope is off, you might think
        you were ringside at the Garden.  It's a good fight but
        Pris isn't watching.

        She's got her feet up on the couch painting her toe
        nails.  The room is so quiet you can almost hear the
        polish.  She starts on her fourth toe when a NOISE
        form above STOPS HER

        It sounded like a CREAKING of a FLOOR, but so quiet,
        sudden and over so fast it's hard to be sure.  She
        stares at the ceiling a moment, then glances at
        Sebastian.

        On the other side of the room, in his own world,
        Sebastian is peering into his magnifier, soldering
        gossamer strands with a laser.

        Pris has crossed the floor and is closing the door
        quietly behind her.  If the animoids nestled around
        the ledges of the room are capable of noticing, they'd
        be the only ones in the room who did.

        INT. CORRIDOR - SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTER-     45
        NOON

        Pris moving smoothly past the doors, some of them open
        and warped offering sights and shadow and decay.

        INT. FIRE STAIRS - SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTER-  46
        NOON

        The gloom in here is like the light of the empty well.
        Her feet against the metal steps reverberate in the
        hollow silence.

        INT. THE FLOOR ABOVE SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE       47
        AFTERNOON

        She's running now, down the hall, stops at the apart-
        ment directly above Sebastian's and opens the door.

        INT. APARTMENT ABOVE SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE       48
        AFTERNOON

        Mary turns her head as Pris comes in.  She's sitting in
        a chair.  The only piece of furniture in the room.
        It's broken and tilts at a funny angle.  She nods and
        Pris nods back.

        Batty is lying on his back, rolling his head slightly
        from side to side like he's soothing a stiff neck.

                                BATTY
                  What's going on down there?

                                PRIS
                  He's not ready yet.

                                BATTY
                  When?

                                PRIS
                  Tomorrow, he says.

        Batty nods he can't wait.  Pris glances at Mary and
        gives a frigid little smile.  Pris backs out and closes
        the door behind her.  Batty blows air through his
        nostrils.  Like an animal.

        EXT. DECKARD'S CAR - FREEWAY - NIGHT                    49

        The sky is streaked with remnants of a lingering dusk.
        Prisms of light flash over the sheen of Deckard's car
        as he cuts off the freeway and sweeps down the off-
        ramp curve.

        EXT./INT. CAR - STREETS - NIGHT                         50

        Moving through the dark city streets.  Deckard turns a
        corner and guns it up a long, steep hill.

        EXT. STREET - DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT               51

        At the top of the hill the car pulls into a drive and
        disappears into the subterranean garage of a high-rise.

        INT. CORRIDOR DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT               52

        He's coming down the hall carrying a foil wrapped
        plastic plate and stops in front of his door.  It's
        riddled with locks.  He slips a small device out of
        his pocket, aims it at the door and the locks unlock,
        the bolts slide open.  He walks in and kicks the door
        shut behind him.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        53

        He slips on the light and crosses the front room.
        Deckard is a pack rat -- hard to tell if he just moved
        in or is just moving out.

        As he enters the kitchen, the SOUND of SOMEBODY BEHIND
        him causes him to whirl around fast, hand snapped out
        in front of him, gun already in it.  Rachael almost got
        shot.  But she's unruffled, a little pale maybe, but
        direct as ever.  There's a long, chilly moment, then
        she almost smiles as her eyes move to the plate on the
        floor.

                                RACHAEL
                  Was that your dinner?

        Deckard looks down at the over-turned plate and nods.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'm sorry.  I called and found out
                  you were on your way home.  These
                  were already delivered to your
                  department but I thought you
                  should have copies as soon as
                  possible.

        She's holding out a cassette the size of a cigarette
        pack.  But it's taking Deckard's adrenalin time to
        recede.

                                RACHAEL
                  It's the Nexus information you
                  wanted.

        He takes the cassette, but a man with so many locks
        must be wondering how they were gotten through so easily.
        He doesn't even want to ask.

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

        He realizes he's still got the gun aimed at her and
        sticks it back in his belt and they're left staring
        at each other.  The situation makes awkward silence.
        At least for him.  She's looking at him like she's
        got something to say but isn't saying it.

                                DECKARD
                  Is there anything else?

                                RACHAEL
                  I know you think it complicates
                  your work, but I'm here to help.

                                DECKARD
                  I've already got more help than
                  I need.

                                RACHAEL
                  I think you need more help than
                  you've got.

        He doesn't, but she's not backing off.

                                RACHAEL
                  There's two reasons a man rejects
                  help.  Either because he's so good
                  at what he does he doesn't think
                  he needs it, or he's so insecure
                  he can't admit it.

                                DECKARD
                  Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either
                  way, but the answer is still no.

                                RACHAEL
                  Two of us might be more effective
                  than one.

                                DECKARD
                  I work alone.

        She smiles.

                                RACHAEL
                  No you don't.

        She lets it sink in.

                                RACHAEL
                  You use your equipment, don't you?

                                DECKARD
                  So?

                                RACHAEL
                  So, I'm a piece of equipment.
                  Use me.

        It's a strong look that passes between them -- a long
        one.  Maybe if he were on firmer ground he might do
        something about such an offer but...

        Deckard's eyes follow her down as Rachael bends to
        the floor and starts picking the food off the rug, put-
        ting it back on the plate.

                                DECKARD
                  That's okay, I'll get it...

        He bends down to help, but she's already done it.
        Their heads a few inches apart.  Something in her eyes
        diminishes the distance even more.

                                RACHAEL
                  Do I make you nervous?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'm sorry.

        And she is.  And suddenly he is too.  She hands him the
        plate and they stand.  She's looking at the floor,
        almost shy, then she looks up and he's watching her.
        She says it plain and simple.

                                RACHAEL
                  It's strange to suddenly realize
                  that what you thought was your
                  life is actually someone else's
                  fabrication.

        Deckard nods.  He feels it, but doesn't know what to
        do about it.

                                DECKARD
                  I can imagine.

                                RACHAEL
                  Can you?  I couldn't.

        These are not some of Deckard's finer moments.  But she
        doesn't seem to notice.

                                RACHAEL
                  A part of me is glad.  I think I
                  feel more.  I don't like who I was
                  before.

        Deckard nods, waits the respectable interval and is
        glad to have a plate to take into the kitchen.

        In the scrambled sanctuary of his kitchen Deckard looks
        around for a place to put the plate, but things have
        piled up on him in here.  He contemplates the refrig-
        erator.

                                DECKARD
                  So why do you think they were
                  after their records.

        He's a lot more comfortable talking shop.

                                RACHAEL
                  They probably want to find out
                  when they were made.

                                DECKARD
                  Right.

        He dumps his dinner in the garbage and comes back out.
        She's writing something on a card.

                                RACHAEL
                  I guess the date of your birth is
                  important if you know you're not
                  made to last.

        No way he can keep his foot out of it.  She looks up and
        hands him the card.

                                RACHAEL
                  That's my number.  If you need me.

        She goes to the door, opens it but hesitates before
        going through.

                                RACHAEL
                  You better get better locks --
                  if you want to keep me out.

        She looks back at him and smiles -- the smile says
        she's talking about all kinds of locks.  Deckard looks
        like he might ask her to stay, but...

                                RACHAEL
                  Good night.

        And she's gone.

                                DECKARD
                  Night.

        He looks down at the number.  It's the back side of a
        snapshot.   He turns it over.  The picture of a man
        and a woman.  The little girl between them looks like
        a six-year old Rachael.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        54

        He's sitting in front of his console studying pictures
        of Nexus Sixes at they appear, blank-faced, hairless
        and unadorned on his monitor.

        The over-lay machine is transforming each image with
        instant attributes; hair, moustaches, teeth, eye colors,
        age, youth, hats, glasses, etc.  All in rapid succession,
        running the gambit from ominous to beautiful.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  The possibilities were infinite.
                  They could change their appearances
                  but not their future.
                  Like she said, it was short.
                  Longevity is what they were after.
                  The garbage man even wanted a past.
                  Poor fuck.  I'd check it out but
                  I knew she was right.  The market
                  worked on turn-over.  Built-in
                  obsolescence was the name of the
                  game.  That meant her too.  It
                  was something I didn't want to
                  think about.

        On top of the monitor there's an open can of beans with
        a spoon stuck in it.  Deckard puts out his cigarette
        and reaches for them as the PHONE RINGS.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                BRYANT
                  Bryant here.  Regarding the
                  rundown you requested on job
                  applicants, Esper's concluded that
                  the only irregular category that
                  Tyrell's got is the entertainment
                  section.  You better get on it.

                                DECKARD
                  I was just about to have my dinner.

                                BRYANT
                  If you hurry you'll get back
                  before it gets cold.  I got a
                  spinner on your roof in five
                  minutes.  Good luck.

        Deckard hangs up and looks at the beans.  He didn't
        want them anyway.  He gets up and walks to the bedroom.
        Looks through the pile of clothes on the floor, finds
        his ankle laser and straps it on.

        EXT. CITY - BIRD'S EYE VIEW - NIGHT                     55

        The spinner skirts through the canyons of the city.
        Deckard, sitting in the contoured seat, watches the
        maze of suspension bridges, platforms and catwalks
        swing by below.  The tops of larger buildings shimmer
        with advertisements and weather announcements.

        INT. SPINNER - OVER CITY - NIGHT                        56

        Deckard is cruising low and slow over the city listen-
        ing to Esper.

                                DECKARD
                  Never mind.  Do they have that
                  knowledge?

                                ESPER

        EXT./INT. SPINNER - LANDING AREA - NIGHT                57

        Deckard taking it down.  About to pull it in an already
        crowded lot, but the sign flashes "FULL."  Deckard
        doesn't believe in signs; is about to set it down any-
        way when a Chicano in a fluorescent coat runs out and
        waves him off.

                                DECKARD
                  Fuck.

        Pissed, Deckard veers away and buzzes low over and
        around the roof tops, all dark and cramped -- not a
        lot of room around here.

        EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                      58

        Finally brings it down between two buildings hardly
        enough clearance, but he jockeys the machine into an
        alley, touches down and runs it slowly along the surface
        -- parking it by a sign that says "NO PARKING."

        EXT. STREET - TAFFEY'S BAR - NIGHT                      59

        Not many people.  Wind blowing.  A nest of garish
        small-time clubs.

        Deckard emerges from one, goes into the next.  The
        pulsing neon over the entry says "TAFFEY'S BAR."

        INT. TAFFEY'S BAR - NIGHT                               60

        Crowded in here.  BONGO MUSIC.  Deckard is at the bar
        sitting next to a big-bellied man in a black beard who's
        looking through a viewer.  On the small stage in the
        background AMAZING RAMA is eating razor blades, a part
        of her juggling routine.

        Deckard leaves the bar and walks down a hall towards a
        door at the rear.

        INT. TAFFEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT                            61

        Taffey's what's referred to in the trade as a "Chicken
        Hawk" collector of young girls.

        It must be so, there's one in the bed.  Thin, pale,
        about thirteen years old, eyes rolled up under her
        fluttering eyelids, wires attached to her forehead,
        lying flat on her back in Taffey's crowded little
        room.

        Taffey's a little fella with wide hips and narrow
        shoulders, wears a jet black toupe and has a face like
        a seal.  But at the moment he's not present.

        There's a KNOCK at the DOOR, then the SOUND of a TOILET
        FLUSHING.  Taffey comes out of the bathroom, heart
        pounding under his polyester bathrobe, and approaches
        the door like the guilty fucker he is.  He looks through
        the peeper.

        Deckard is out there holding up his I.D.

                                DECKARD
                  Taffey Lewis?

                                TAFFEY
                  Yes?

                                DECKARD
                  Can I come in?

        There is a pause lasting the time it takes Taffey not
        to think of a way to say no.  The door opens and Deckard
        enters.  Except for the drool coming out of the corner of
        her mouth, and the fluttering eye-lids, Venus doesn't
        move a muscle.

                                TAFFEY
                  Excuse my niece there... She's
                  studying for an exam.

        Deckard takes the  Identikit hard copies our of his
        pocket and pushing some junk out of the way, fans them
        out on the table.

                                DECKARD
                  I'd like  you to take a look at
                  these pictures.

                                TAFFEY
                  Of course.

        Taffey bends down really close, peering at the pictures
        from about two inches away.

                                TAFFEY
                  You see I lost my contacts a
                  couple of days ago around here
                  somewhere and my sight is a
                  little... What am I supposed
                  to be looking for?

                                DECKARD
                  Do you recognize any of
                  them?

        He stops at Zhora.

                                TAFFEY
                  This one looks familiar, but
                  I don't know.  Naw.  There's
                  one came in today looks a
                  little like this one but...

                                DECKARD
                  What did she want?

                                TAFFEY
                  Who?

                                DECKARD
                  The girl that doesn't look
                  like that girl.

                                TAFFEY
                  Nothing.  She wanted to know
                  about suck night.

                                DECKARD
                  What night?

                                TAFFEY
                  I didn't know if I wanted to
                  handle her -- I already got
                  a snake act.  But my partner
                  goes down there to the Opera
                  House on suck night to book
                  the good ones.

                                DECKARD
                  What's suck night?

                                TAFFEY
                  That's what we call in the
                  trade, audition free-for-
                  alls and most of it sucks.
                  Bit I don't think that's
                  her.

                                DECKARD
                  You talking about the Opera
                  House on the Main?

        Taffey nods.  Deckard goes to the door and turns.

                                DECKARD
                  Book the good ones for where?

                                TAFFEY
                  Lots of places.  The tours,
                  the clubs, the Silicone shows,
                  private parties.

                                DECKARD
                  What shows?

                                TAFFEY
                  Silicone Valley.  Lots of
                  these science guys never
                  leave that place.  We book
                  two shows a month in there.
                  Those big time techs and bio-
                  guys might be real high zoners
                  up here, but when it comes
                  to the arts, they like it loud
                  and lewd.

        It's starting to get a little gooey.  Deckard tips his
        head good night and backs out of the door.

        INT. THE OLD OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT                        62

        Onstage four Mexican acrobats, in matching metallic
        jumpsuits roll head over heels in their rendition of
        a human wheel.  From the P.A. system the Announcer's
        voice blares through the cavernous theatre.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  Let's hear it for the Hermano
                  Brothers.

        Scattered APPLAUSE.  Hand in hand, the Hermano Brothers
        bow deeply, spring up and trot offstage.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  Next we're gonna see a little
                  charmer who keeps her dancing
                  partner in a basket!  She
                  comes to us all the way from
                  exotic Casablanca.  'Salome.'

        The old boys in the pit strike up a tinny version
        of "In a Persian Market" as SALOME dances onstage.
        She's a black-haired beauty in a scant belly dancer
        costume, a couple of pounds overweight but all in
        the right places.  She kneels ceremoniously center
        stage and sets the basket down before her.  Carefully
        removing the lid, she reaches in and lifts out a four-
        foot harlequin-patterned python.  Grinding her hips
        to the music, she rises, holding the coiling snake out
        like an offering.  Sounds of approval from the audience.
        The gold coins covering her breasts jingle and shimmer,
        as she weaves sensuously around the floor.

        INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                                  63

        To scattered APPLAUSE, HOOTS and WHISTLES, Salome
        flounces offstage, the snake hung around her shoul-
        ders, looking limp, and makes her way through the
        narrow corridor to her dressing room.  She's about
        to enter when:

                                DECKARD
                  Excuse me, Miss Salome.

        She turns.  Deckard's posture and attitude suggest hum-
        ble, sleazy persistence.  He comes closer with his
        shit-eating grin.

                                DECKARD
                  I'd like to have a word with you
                  if I could.

        Salome stands almost six feet high in her high heels
        -- she looks down on him with the haughty suspicion
        of a chick who knows how to handle cheap hits.

                                SALOME
                  Yeah?

                                DECKARD
                  I'm with the American Federation
                  of Variety Artists...

        He holds up a hand as if to stop her from protesting.

                                DECKARD
                  Don't worry, I'm not here to make
                  you join -- that's not my department.

        He glances around like a guy who's not supposed to be
        there.

                                DECKARD
                  I'm an investigator for the
                  Confidential Committee on Moral
                  Abuses.

        She nods, taking it a little more seriously.

                                DECKARD
                  There's been reports of management
                  sexually abusing the artists in
                  this place.

                                SALOME
                  I don't know nothing about it.

                                DECKARD
                  You haven't felt yourself to be
                  exploited by the management in any
                  way?

        She's definitely puzzled.

                                SALOME
                  How do you mean 'exploited'?

                                DECKARD
                  Like to get this position.  Did
                  you or were you asked to do anything
                  lewd or unsavory or otherwise
                  repulsive to your person?

                                SALOME
                  Are you for real?

                                DECKARD
                  Oh, yeah.
                  You'd be surprised what goes on
                  around here.  I'd like to check
                  the dressing room if I could.

                                SALOME
                  What the fuck for?

                                DECKARD
                  For holes.

        This guy might be an asshole but he's funny.

                                SALOME
                  I don't believe this.

        She shrugs and they go in.

        INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT                              64

        Musty and cramped.  A portable shower, a dressing table
        and not much else.  Salome takes the snake from around
        her shoulders and lays it on the dressing table.  Deck-
        ard watches it undulate into the warmth of the lights.

                                DECKARD
                  It that mother real?

                                SALOME
                  Of course he's not real.  You think
                  I'd be working here if I could
                  afford a real snake?

                                DECKARD
                  It's a good job.

                                SALOME
                  You mean the snake.

        Deckard nods.  There's not much costume to take off but
        she's doing it.

                                SALOME
                  The best.

                                DECKARD
                  Does it eat?

                                SALOME
                  Come on.

        His hand reaches out to touch it.  As his fingers make
        contact there's an electric "snap."  He jerks his hand
        back from the shock.

                                SALOME
                  Jeezus!

                                DECKARD
                  Sorry.

                                SALOME
                  Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck
                  mine, huh?

        She slides behind the screen and turns on the shower.
        Deckard starts creeping around pacing around the room
        like he's inspecting the walls.

                                DECKARD
                  They have their ways of doing
                  their dirty work without the
                  victim knowing what's going on.

        His eyes are moving over everything she's got.

                                DECKARD
                  You'd be surprised what a guy'll
                  go through to get a glimpse of a
                  beautiful body.

                                SALOME
                  I bet I would.

                                DECKARD
                  Little dirty holes the bastards
                  drill in the wall so they can
                  watch a lady undress.

        And to his amazement he actually spots one.  It's down
        low on the wall.  Not a good idea to turn his back on
        work but he can't resist.

                                SALOME
                  And what if somebody did try to
                  'exploit' me?  Who do I go to?

        Through the hole Deckard is looking at a pair of fat
        legs.

                                DECKARD
                  Me.

                                SALOME
                  And who do I go to about you?

        He looks back.  She's some out of the shower dripping
        nude.  She's taken off her black wig.  Her hair is
        short and blonde.

        Deckard recognizes her immediately from the identikit.
        He stares at her a moment too long.

                                DECKARD
                  Hmmmmm?

        Deckard grins and she returns it.

        She takes a towel off the table and starts to dry her
        body.  The snake noses through the cosmetics, tongue
        flicking trying to get back to its mistress.  Absently,
        she reaches out to stroke the snake and suddenly laughs.

                                ZHORA
                  You ever get the feeling things
                  aren't the way they seem?

        Her hand closes around the snake's head.  Deckard sees
        it coming but can't move fast enough.  She strikes him
        so hard it knocks him off his feet.  Before he hits the
        floor, she kicks him in the stomach.  The snake whistles
        through the air again as Deckard rolls out of the way.
        It slams down so hard it ruptures against the floor.
        He goes for his laser, but she's already out the door.

        INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                                 65

        Deckard bounds out of the room and sees her go through
        a door at the other end of the hall.  He sprints after
        her, arrives at the door and flings it open.  Black-
        ness.  The SOUND of her high heels CLATTER down the
        metal steps.

        EXT. STREET - OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT                       66

        It's raining heavily.

        The front of the Opera House is open only to foot traf-
        fic these days.  A bizarre place on a Friday night,
        hawkers and whores, the rabble, the poor and the cur-
        ious mill around the randy-built platforms and brightly
        lit stands.   Zhora, in just a raincoat, is not out of
        place in this flea market atmosphere.  Trying not to
        run, she slices through the mob as quickly as she can.
        Deckard is not far behind, dodging and side-stepping,
        trying to move against the tide of people scurrying for
        shelter.

        She comes to an intersection and turns out of the mall
        onto a less crowded street.  She glances over her
        shoulder as she breaks into a run and runs right into
        a couple of pedestrians.  All three go down.

        Deckard comes out of the crowd in time to spot her get-
        ting to her feet.  She sees him and runs.  The two ped-
        estrians are in his line of fire.  He runs past them
        and drops to one knee, leveling his laser.

                                DECKARD
                  Stop or you're dead!

        She doesn't.  The beam flashes through the air, but
        she's already around the corner.

        With his bottom lip between his teeth, it hurts to move
        so fast, Deckard jack-legs it into the street and jumps
        in front of the first car coming.  It screeches to a
        stop.  Deckard scrambles for the door, but the guy be-
        hind the wheel has other ideas.  He peels out fast.

        The next car slows down and swerves trying not to hit
        him.  Deckard goes for the door and before the old ma-
        tron inside can lock it, Deckard's yanked it open and
        jumps in.  She screams as he pushes her into the pas-
        senger seat and jams the car into a wrenching about
        face.  The lady squeals like a pig as the momentum
        plasters her against the door.

        Deckard slams it around the corner and guns it down the
        street.  It's long and it's empty and it's going by fast.
        Nothing the old lady cares to see -- she's got her hands
        over her eyes, whimpering, hoping she'll faint before
        she dies.

        Deckard takes the next left so hard he almost lays it
        over.  As the car bounces off the curb he floors it.

        Zhora's a hundred yards ahead, halfway down the street,
        trying to make it back into the crowded mall.  She's
        running fast, but the car is faster.

        As he passes her, Deckard hits the brakes and skids
        broadside seventy feet.  The door flies open and he
        rolls out FIRING.

        Zhora's ducking it with no where to go, except...

        The showcase window on her left EXPLODES as she crashes
        through.

        It's a corner shop joined to a series of stores, front-
        ing the mall.  Deckard runs to the opening she's made
        and pours FIRE through the tunnel of her jagged wake as
        Zhora breaks through one window after another, getting
        sliced, getting shot, trying to get away from Deckard's
        laser.  But she doesn't.

        His last shot burns a hole through the base of her
        skull.  It kills her but doesn't stop her.  Her speed
        takes what's left of her through the last two windows
        and into the street where she runs into a parked car
        with such force that she embeds herself in the side of
        it.

        Hunched over, breathing hard, Deckard comes slowly for-
        ward.  The crowd starting to gather.  There's something
        for everybody and they're coming from all directions.

        Deckard moves through them, edging to have a look.

        It's not a good thing to see.  It looks like Salome
        and the car tries to eat each other.  A bloody feast
        of metal and flesh.

        Deckard bows his head, sick, exhausted.  So much commo-
        tion he doesn't notice THREE COPS closing in from
        behind.

                                COP
                  Drop it!

        Deckard has his back to them.  They're fanned out and
        crouched, ready to fire.  Deckard drops his laser.  Two
        of them rush up, spin him around while the third does a
        frisk.

        TWO MORE COPS arrive, wary and wild-eyed, pushing the
        people back -- his is not a good place for cops.

        Deckard's ankle laser is discovered by the Cop frisking
        him.  With a snarl he pulls it out and hands it back to
        the SERGEANT covering the action.

                                SERGEANT
                  On your belly!

        Deckard's not in the mood for it.

                                DECKARD
                  Listen, Sergeant...

        He's reaching for his ID.  The Cop with the rubber
        billy hits him in the head.

        One thrill after another.  Somebody in the crowd YEOWLS.
        The last thing Deckard hears as he falls.  The Cop
        reaches inside Deckard's coat for the concealed weapon
        they missed, but it's an ID card.  He looks at it for a
        moment, then looks up.

                                COP
                  Hey, Sarge, this guy's a cop.

        An embarrassing situation.

                                SERGEANT
                  Clear this fuckin' crowd.

        The Cops start pushing.  And for one split second one
        of the crowd looks a lot like Leon.

        INT. OLD OPERA HOUSE - MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT               67

        Your standard low class crapper.  Bryant is planted
        firmly on the cracked tile floor next to the urinals
        rubbing his face, trying not to pop the clutch in his
        anger.  This is a public place, he doesn't want to
        yell.

                                BRYANT
                  Just because it's a Nexus 6 doesn't
                  change procedure.  A little known
                  fact can become a well-known fact
                  and part of our job, Deckard, is
                  to make sure that doesn't happen.
                  Now how can be do that if you blow
                  one away in front of a fuckin'
                  audience.

        It's not the sort of question that expects an answer.
        Deckard's washing his face in the basin hoping it'll
        all go away.

                                BRYANT
                  Well?

        Deckard looks up dripping, reaches for a paper towel.
        Bryant slaps one in his hand.

                                DECKARD
                  She was gonna get away.

                                BRYANT
                  Then let her get away.  I thought
                  you were a pro -- you're supposed
                  to be a fuckin' tracker!

        Bryant takes a couple of deep breaths.

                                BRYANT
                  I'd say you got a little carried
                  away.

        Deckard's voice is barely audible.

                                DECKARD
                  I didn't like her.

                                BRYANT
                  You didn't like her!?

        He slams the handle on one of the urinals.

                                BRYANT
                  You start liking or disliking
                  andies it's time to hang it up.

        The PLUMPING ROARS and SUCKS and DIES.  There's nothing
        to do but nod.  Deckard nods.  Poor bastard has had a
        rough night.  Bryant pulls a flask out of his coat and
        hands it to him.  Deckard puts it to his mouth and
        Bryant watches Deckard's Adam's apple like he's count-
        ing the swallows.  Deckard hands it back empty.  Bryant
        caps it, puts it back in his pocket.

                                BRYANT
                  Look, go home.  Get some rest.
                  Take an aspirin.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

        Bryant shuffles out like an old bear.

        INT. OLD OPERA HOUSE - BAR - NIGHT                      68

        Cheap whiskey and bad wine.  That's the kind of place
        this is.  It's near closing.  But still a few at the
        bar.  Alcoholic silhouettes.

        In the b.g. Deckard comes down the passage from the
        men's room and stops at the phone.  He gets a number
        out of his pocket and calls it.  As he talks he leans
        against the wall, his body language intimate and chummy.

        Not much action at the bar other than somebody snoring
        and a dipso down at the end having a conversation with
        himself.

        Deckard hangs up, walks to the bar and straggles a
        stool.  The BARTENDER's a big lady with tits like sand
        bags and a voice that plays no favorites.

                                BARTENDER
                  I can't protect your drinks,
                  mister; while you was in the
                  potty, this hummer snatched it.

        Deckard glances at his stool-mate.  A huge MAN, slumped
        over the bar like a beached whale.

                                DECKARD
                  No problem.  Gimme another.

        The whale doesn't move, but it speaks, with a gravelly
        Russian accent.

                                RUSSIAN
                  Forgive me.  I thought was free
                  drink.  I will pay.

                                DECKARD
                  Forget it.

        But the big man's digging through his pockets.  Deck-
        ard's drink arrives and the Russian raises his head.
        It's a big melancholy face with a glint of warmth in
        his red-rimmed eyes and a smile that could melt your
        heart.  But it's Leon.

                                LEON
                  I think I have no money.

                                DECKARD
                  It's okay.  Forget it.

                                LEON
                  But I would like to buy you drink.

                                DECKARD
                  I'll but you one.  What'll you
                  have?

                                LEON
                  Vodka!

                                DECKARD
                  Shot of vodka, please.

                                LEON
                  Thank you very much.

                                DECKARD
                  My pleasure.

        Deckard brings out his smokes.  Offers one.  Leon takes
        it and they light up.  The drinks come.

                                LEON
                  Prosit.

                                DECKARD
                  Prosit.

        Down the hatch.  Leon slaps his glass on the bar, reach-
        es into his pocket, brings out a little match box and
        slaps that down too.  It's done with such pride that
        Deckard has to look.

                                LEON
                  You want to see my friends?

                                DECKARD
                  Sorry, don't have the time.

                                LEON
                  No problem.

        Leon smiles broadly and with ceremonious care opens the
        box and dumps three live cockroaches on the bar.

                                DECKARD
                  Those cockroaches?

                                LEON
                  Ya.

        Deckard looks interested.  One of them starts to scamp-
        er away, but Leon walls off the next with his huge hand.

                                DECKARD
                  How long you had these guys?

                                LEON
                  Two months.  But this one is not
                  guy.  It is girl.  His girl.

        Leon leans closer like he doesn't want the cockroaches
        to hear.

                                LEON
                  Usually Blackie waits until Igor
                  is eating; then, when his back is
                  turned, he tries to take advantage
                  of Anna.

        Deckard nods, definitely interested.  He signals the
        bartender for another round.  The drinks arrive.

                                LEON
                  Prosit.

                                DECKARD
                  Prosit.

        Down the hatch.  Their eyes meet at the bottom.

                                LEON
                  You never saw a cockroach make
                  love?

        Deckard shakes his head, but he'd like to.

        Leon smiles slyly.

                                LEON
                  We will try.

        Leon brings a cube of sugar out of his pocket and puts
        it on the bar.  They both lean down and watch intently.
        The drinks come and are put away, but the cockroaches
        are not cooperating.

                                LEON
                  It must be that he is not hungry
                  or maybe she is not hot.

        Leon is catching the roaches and one by one puts them
        back in their box.  He holds up the last and kisses it.

                                LEON
                  You like to kiss her goodbye.

                                DECKARD
                  No thanks.

                                BARTENDER
                  Make sure you take your girlfriends
                  with you when you leave.

        What neither of them notices is that between Leon's
        fingers, his stub of his cigarette is burning his flesh.

        Deckard lifts his glass, it is empty.

                                LEON
                  I like you.

                                DECKARD
                  I like you too.

                                LEON
                  One more, eh?

                                DECKARD
                  I gotta piss.

        Deckard gets on his feet, leans forward like a man in
        a stiff wind and stops.

                                DECKARD
                  I think I'll piss outside.

        Leon watches his walk a perfect straight line through
        the bar down the passage and out of the rear exit.

        EXT. ALLEY - OLD OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT                    69

        Deckard reels out.  The door swings shut and he's sober
        as hell and moving fast.  Around the big trash dumpster
        alongside the building, he plasters himself against the
        wall and his gun is out, aimed at the door.  He's in a
        good spot with a perfect line of fire.  Moments go by
        and he's glad for the time to steady himself.  The
        SOUND of his BREATHING, the HUM of the city and the
        quiet.

        Suddenly from behind, Deckard is swept off his feet and
        twirled around in Leon's bear-trap embrace.

        Leon lets go and Deckard hits the pavement, skidding
        hard enough to tear clothes and burn skin, but he rolls
        out of it and comes up with gun in hand; but Leon is so
        fast he's already there and kicks it out of his hand.

        Leon moves towards him, backing Deckard against the wall.

                                LEON
                  How come you know where Zhora was
                  so quick?

        His hand is lightning.  It shoots out, grabs Deckard's
        hair.

                                DECKARD
                  I showed pictures.  Somebody
                  recognized her.  I went to see.

        Deckard is pale.  The sweat is starting to run.

                                LEON
                  How old am I?

                                DECKARD
                  I don't know.

        The grip tightens and twists.

                                LEON
                  My birthday is April 10, 2015.
                  How long do I live?

                                DECKARD
                  Four years.

        He lets go.

                                LEON
                  More than you.

        Deckard's knees come up fast.  Leon's fist comes down
        faster, like a hammer.

                                LEON
                  Painful to live in fear, isn't it.

        Deckard is doubled over, hugging his thigh.

                                LEON
                  But that's how it is to be a
                  slave.  The future is sealed off,
                  he grovels, he waits.

        Even hurt, Deckard is fast.  He goes for his ankle gun,
        but Leon's got it out of his hand before he can even
        raise it and throws it down the alley.

        Deckard hurls forward, knocking him off balance, and
        scrambles to get away.  Leon grabs him by the foot,
        drags him back and jerks him off the ground.

                                LEON
                  Sex, reproduction, security, the
                  simple things.  But no way to
                  satisfy them.  To be homesick
                  with no place to go.  Potential
                  with no way to use it.  Lots of
                  little oversights in the Nexus 6.

        He slams Deckard into the wall.

                                LEON
                  I tell you, nothing is worse
                  than having an itch you can never
                  scratch.

        Deckard slides down the wall to his knees and huddles,
        protecting his head with his arms, waiting for the next
        one.

        Leon folds his big hands together and raises them over
        his head, pausing just a second to savor the satisfac-
        tion of smashing Deckard's skull.

        The spasm that runs through Leon's face is not from
        satisfaction.  It's the bullet that went through his
        neck.  He hits the ground hard, his big teeth biting
        the air like a rabid dog.  Dead.

        Rachael is standing in the alley.  Deckard lies there
        looking at her.  She comes slowly and quietly forward
        and drops Deckard's gun by his side.

        Deckard gets to his hands and knees and tries to get
        up, but can't quite manage it.  He looks up at her,
        panting, spits blood and almost smiles.

                                DECKARD
                  Like I said, I don't need your
                  help.

        After a long moment, she bends down to touch him.

                                RACHAEL
                  You look terrible, you know that?

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT             70

        He's lying in the tub with a drink, eyes half mast,
        water up to his chin, bruised and beat, but looking
        just a little wicked in his balmy luxury.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  I knew a cop once who was involved
                  in a high-speed chase.  They shot
                  out one of his tires and he went
                  over a cliff at hundred and fifty
                  miles an hour.  They found him in
                  the morning with a broken skull,
                  six fractured ribs and second-
                  degree burns.  On the way to the
                  hospital he made a play for the
                  nurse.

        He takes a drink and clears his throat.

                                DECKARD
                  Hey!  I thought you were supposed
                  to be taking care of me.

                                RACHAEL'S VOICE
                  What do you need?

        He doesn't answer.  Lies there sipping his drink.
        Rachael comes in a little uncertain, a little droll,
        and stands there looking down at him.

                                DECKARD
                  Don't just stand there looking at
                  me.  It's not polite.

                                RACHAEL
                  What do you want me to do?

                                DECKARD
                  Sit.

        She sits on the edge of the tub.

                                DECKARD
                  Gimme your arm.

        She's wearing a short-sleeved dress.  It's a long, del-
        icate arm and Deckard holds it, inspecting it like a
        maestro with a Stradivarius.  He looks up at her.

                                DECKARD
                  You ever take a bath with a man
                  before?

                                RACHAEL
                  There's a lot I haven't done with
                  a man before.

        He's got her hand in the water and had begun to soap
        her arm.  Starting with her wrist and running the bar
        to her elbow, up and down, slow and slippery.  She
        watches, not quite sure of the ritual.

        He pulls her closer, and runs his hand up higher, mould-
        ing and pressing, working around her flesh, up and under
        her arm into the privacy of her dress.

                                RACHAEL
                  You're getting me wet.

        Oh, yes.  For a moment Deckard stares at her like some
        furry-legged satyr in rut, the fingers of his other
        hand rake through her hair and into the water she comes.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING            71

        The bed looks like it was hit by a storm and Deckard
        looks like something that was washed up in it.  He's
        spread out flat, face creased and puffed.

        His eyes squint open, but only for a moment.  His
        hands are more reliable.  They search over the bed,
        but find it bare.  He edges his head over the side,
        looking around for signs, but she's all gone.  He
        gets up in two stages, sits and then stands.  Then
        sits again, resting his head in his hands.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MORNING           72

        Deckard's got his face in the mirror shaving it.  It's
        been a long night.  Nothing a new tongue and a trans-
        fusion wouldn't put right.  He moves a couple of inches
        to the left so his eyes have a view of the tub.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING        73

        Deckard is on the edge of the couch with the phone on
        his knees, the card with Rachael's number in his lap
        and having no luck.

                                RACHAEL'S VOICE
                  Sorry, I am not in at the moment,
                  but if you'll leave your name and
                  number I'll return your call as
                  soon as I can.

        That's not soon enough.  Deckard hangs up, puts the
        phone on the floor and leans back on the couch.

                                DECKARD
                  Fuck you, then.

        INT. MR. DEETCHUM'S APARTMENT - MORNING                 74

        The rooster perched on the chair spreading its scrawny
        wings, strains from the tips of its toes, crowing at
        the ceiling.  Between crows there's a TAPPING at the
        door.

        You might call this a "barnyard" apartment.  There's
        straw on the floor and several hens roosting against
        the back wall.  The front door opens a few inches and
        Sebastian pokes his head in.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Mr. Deetchum?  Hello?

        Nobody seems to be home except his chickens.  As Sebas-
        tian enters, closing the door behind him, a goose
        charges out of the bedroom hissing and honking.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Now, now, Waddles.

        Seeming to recognize Sebastian as no intruder, Waddles
        veers off from the attack.  As Sebastian crosses the
        room a pig peeks out from behind the couch.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Hello, Wrigley.

        He goes to the chickens and collects some eggs, putting
        them into a bowl he's brought.  He puts down the bowl
        and reaching into his pocket carefully counts out the
        payment and puts the money on a plate.  He's about to
        leave but notices there's no water in the dispenser.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Mr. Deetchum isn't taking very
                  good care of you people.

        Pouring from a jug on the table, he fills the dispenser
        with water, scatters a little grain on the floor, gets
        his bowel of eggs and leaves.

        Wrigley grunts and comes out from behind the couch for
        a long drink.

        INT. CORRIDOR - SEBASTIAN'S FLOOR - MORNING             75

        Sebastian arrives on his floor, walks down the hall to
        his apartment, opens the door, walks in.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY                        76

        He turns to close door, comes face to face with Roy
        Batty.  Sebastian drops his bowl of eggs.  Batty's
        hand flashes out and catches it.

                                BATTY
                  Whoops.

        Smiling, Batty hands them back to Sebastian, who is
        too startled to speak.

        Pris runs up and gives Batty and Mary a big hug, steps
        back effusing and smiling, everybody's favorite teen-
        ager.

                                PRIS
                  This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.

                                BATTY
                  Hello, glad to meet you.

        He pumps Sebastian's free hand.

                                PRIS
                  And my Aunt Mary.

        Sebastian turns and there's Aunt Mary, modest and warm.

                                PRIS
                  And this is my savior, J.F. Sebastian,
                  everybody.

        Sebastian stands there with his eggs, bashful and ex-
        cited, the hero of this little family's warm attention.

                                BATTY
                  Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian.
                  If you hadn't come along...

                                MARY
                  We were worried to death.  It's
                  awfully kind of you.

        Sebastian is nodding and smiling.

                                BATTY
                  We're not used to the big city.
                  Where we come from it's not so
                  easy to get lost.

                                MARY
                  You certainly have a nice place
                  here.

                                BATTY
                  Well stocked.

        Batty looks around admiringly.  Sebastian mumbles some-
        thing that sounds like "Thank you."

                                PRIS
                  Sebastian doesn't like to go out
                  too much.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I keep a lot of provisions right
                  here.

                                BATTY
                  I like a man who stays put.  An
                  admirable thing to be able to
                  sustain yourself in these times.
                  You live here all by yourself, do
                  you?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Well, no, not really.  There's
                  Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman,
                  he lives on the first floor.

        Everybody nods.  A long pause.

                                MARY
                  We haven't found it easy, Mr.
                  Sebastian.

        They glance around the room, waiting for Sebastian to
        pick up the ball.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  How about breakfast, I was just
                  going to make some.

                                BATTY
                  If it wouldn't be too much of a
                  bother... a little bite to eat
                  would be...

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.

                                BATTY
                  Well, actually

                                MARY
                  We're famished.

        Sebastian is truly happy.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Okay, then.  You make yourselves
                  comfortable and I'll bring the
                  food right out.

        He disappears into the kitchen.  Batty looks happy with
        the way things are going.

                                BATTY
                  Charming.

        Pris comes up close.  Her tone muted but demanding.

                                PRIS
                  Well?

        Batty finds her attitude amusing, which makes her even
        more pugnacious.

                                PRIS
                  I want to know what's going on.

        There's a punitive edge to Batty's response.

                                BATTY
                  There's only three of us left.

        Pris is shocked.  Her whisper comes out a hiss.

                                PRIS
                  Then we're stupid and we'll die.

                                BATTY
                  Not if everybody is doing their
                  job here at home.  How are things
                  at home?

        A little spotted pig on the table sits up.

                                PIG
                  Home again, jiggidy jig.

        They all turn and stare at the pig.  Batty is delighted.

                                PRIS
                  I don't trust him.  I don't think
                  he knows what he's doing.

        The BELL-TONE from the microwave goes off in the kitchen.

                                BATTY
                  He knows what he's doing.

                                MARY
                  If he won't cooperate?

                                BATTY
                  Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants
                  to be appreciated.  We'll
                  appreciate him and he'll cooperate.

        INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR AND ROOM - DAY                   77

        Holden is laid out in an apparatus that resembles an
        iron lung.  A little above his head, facing him, is a
        bank of bio-feedback lights registering body functions.

        Deckard is in a chair sitting next to his friend.

        Holden has lost weight, his face is grey, he can't
        move his head, but he's smiling like the cat who ate
        the canary.

                                DECKARD
                  How are you doing, old man?

        Holden's voice is just a whisper -- the kind of whisper
        that comes out of the joker at the back of the class.

                                HOLDEN
                  I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm
                  not really great, but I feel just
                  great.  How you like my new suit?

                                DECKARD
                  Well, you don't have to worry
                  about getting it wrinkled.

        Holden's eyes close, his smile gets bigger and little
        spasms of laughter pump out of his mouth.

                                HOLDEN
                  Don't make me laugh.  It makes me
                  pee.

                                DECKARD
                  Sorry.

                                HOLDEN
                  Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee.
                  So how are you doing?

                                DECKARD
                  I'm doing okay.

                                HOLDEN
                  From what I hear you're doing
                  great.  Bryant tells me you're
                  going like a god damn one-man
                  army.  Making a lot of money, huh?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.
                         (pause)
                  But that's what I wanted to talk
                  to you about.

                                HOLDEN
                  Money?

                                DECKARD
                  No.  I got a problem.

                                HOLDEN
                  Let's hear it.

                                DECKARD
                  I think I'm starting to empathize
                  with these Nexus-sixes.

        Holden giggles.  Starts to laugh again.  A blue light
        on the panel begins to turn very bright.  They both
        notice it.

                                DECKARD
                  What's that?

                                HOLDEN
                  I'm taking a piss.

        They wait for the light to abate.

                                HOLDEN
                  Let me ask you something, Deck.
                  You been having intimate relations
                  with one of these units?

        Deckard doesn't deny it.  Holden smiles like a cherub.

                                HOLDEN
                  That's what I thought... one of
                  the liabilities of the trade --
                  you has sex with your prey, old
                  buddy.  That's bound to create
                  problems, unless you're a black
                  widow.

        Deckard has to wait for him to stop giggling.

                                DECKARD
                  What about -- not sex -- but love?

        Holden bites his bottom lip to keep the laugher out of
        his voice, but he can't.

                                HOLDEN
                  Love is just another name for sex.
                  Love is sexy and sex is lovely --
                  I don't care what you call it, an
                  android can't have it.

                                DECKARD
                  These aren't just...

                                HOLDEN
                  I know what they are, Deck --
                  Look, maybe they can pretend to
                  feel, but far as the raw, hot
                  emotions of the old heart -- no
                  way.

        Holden stops talking for a moment to get some air.

                                HOLDEN
                  Believe me, take it from an old
                  pro, no matter how good we get,
                  we're never gonna make an
                  artificial anything that can
                  feel.  It's a contradiction.
                  You might as well go fuck your
                  washing machine.

        Holden laughs, Deckard doesn't.

                                HOLDEN
                  Just go out there and keep up
                  the good work.

        Holden's whispers have become harder to hear.

                                HOLDEN
                  Got to save it, Deck, I'm getting
                  sleepy.  It's been good talking
                  to you.

        Deckard stands.

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

        But he's already asleep.  Deckard stands there a moment
        looking at him, then walks out.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - DAY                          78

        He's sitting on the couch, glum, contemplative.
        There's a SOUND.  His eyes move to the door.  Those
        locks are opening again.  Rachael comes in.  Looks
        surprised to see him.  Him too.

                                RACHAEL
                  I told you I'd come back.

                                DECKARD
                  You did?

                                RACHAEL
                  You didn't hear me.  You were
                  sleeping.

        He likes that.

                                RACHAEL
                  Are you glad I'm here?

        He is.  She's spunky.  Hasn't seen this place in the
        daytime.  Pleased, he watched her move around the mess.
        She spots a little framed photograph.  Picks it up.
        It's a man with a shotgun and a boy holding up a quail.

                                RACHAEL
                  Who is this?

                                DECKARD
                  Me and my dad.

                                RACHAEL
                  Where is he?

                                DECKARD
                  Dead.

                                RACHAEL
                  Oh.

        She puts it down and comes to him.

                                RACHAEL
                  How come you're not on the job?

                                DECKARD
                  I am.  Part of my job is to sit
                  on a couch and try and figure
                  things out.

                                RACHAEL
                  How are you doing?

                                DECKARD
                  Not too good.

        She sits next to him.

        Pleased as hell, they both sit there staring straight
        ahead.  He looks at her.  She looks at him.

                                RACHAEL
                  What do people do in the afternoon?

                                DECKARD
                  If they are smart, they take
                  naps.

        INT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - DAY                            79

        They're under the sheet.  Rachael is on her back, look-
        ing at the ceiling, hair sprawled like sea grass over
        the pillow.  Deckard lies next to her, a man studying
        a treasure.

                                RACHAEL
                  Do you dream?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.  Sometimes.

                                RACHAEL
                  I wish I could.

        His hand moves over her shoulder.

                                DECKARD
                  Wishing is a kind of dreaming.

        His hand goes under the sheet.

                                RACHAEL
                  I mean asleep.

        She feels good.  He moves closer.

                                RACHAEL
                  Did you cry when your father
                  died?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                RACHAEL
                  That's another thing I can't
                  do.

        He kisses her lightly on the cheek.

                                RACHAEL
                  Nobody is freer than when he
                  dreams.  I read that.

                                DECKARD
                  It wasn't very good last night,
                  was it?

                                RACHAEL
                  I don't know, I have nothing
                  to compare it to.  I guess I
                  thought there was something
                  more to it.

                                DECKARD
                  What?

                                RACHAEL
                  I don't know... I think I missed
                  something.

                                DECKARD
                  Like?

                                RACHAEL
                  I'm not sure.  Is there a
                  secret?

        Her face is close.  She's looking right at him.  Her
        lips are right there.

                                DECKARD
                  I don't know.  If there is I'd
                  like to find it.

        Slowly their lips touch and his arms slide under her
        body.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY                        80

        Batty, Pris and Mary sit at the table staring at their
        host.  Sebastian is staring back, his fork halfway to
        his mouth, looking from face to face.  Although nothing
        is being said, he's totally comfortable, as much at
        home with them as he is with his animoids.

                                BATTY
                  Why are you staring at us?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You're just all so... so different.

        Batty nods his head, smiling, sending home the fact and
        Sebastian is certainly getting it.

                                BATTY
                  What, Sebastian?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You're androids.

        A long pause.

                                PRIS
                  What makes you think so?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You're all so perfect.

        Sebastian is smiling from ear to ear.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What generation are you?

                                BATTY
                  Nexus - 6.
        
        Sebastian whistles.  Mary's head is shaking slightly.
        Pris gets up and moves to the couch.  Batty couldn't
        be more pleased.

                                BATTY
                  We can trust Sebastian, ladies.
                  He's been working with mechanisms
                  all his life.  He's a wizard and
                  a very perceptive man.

        Sebastian looks like a kid on Christmas Eve.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Could you...

        His voice is trembling.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Show me something?

                                BATTY
                  Like what?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Like...

        Like a million things, but he's too excited to think of
        one.

                                BATTY
                  We're not computers, Sebastian,
                  we're physical.

        Pris perks up proudly.

                                PRIS
                  I think, therefore I am.

                                BATTY
                  Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.

        It's a command Pris is pleased to obey.  She sits quiet-
        ly a moment, hands folded in her lap, prim and proper.
        Mary doesn't like these displays, but Batty is beaming.

        Those hands in Pris' lap suddenly move, almost faster
        than the eye can see and slam down on either side of
        her, digging into the material with such ferocity that
        Sebastian jumps.  She plunges into the guts of the couch
        up to her elbows and comes up holding springs and stuff-
        ing.  Except for the clenched teeth, she is smiling like
        an angel.

        Sebastian is riveted, his eyes wide and astounded, like
        he's just seen the devil.  He laughs nervously, glad
        that the devil is a friend.

                                BATTY
                  We have a lot in common.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You mean that you can't come here
                  and I can't go there?

                                BATTY
                  Not only that, but we have smiliar
                  problems.  Accelerated decrepitude.
                  But we don't want to die quite yet.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Of course not.

                                BATTY
                  You could help us.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I don't know much about biomechanics,
                  Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out
                  of my league.

                                BATTY
                  If we don't find help soon, Pris
                  hasn't got long to live.

        Sebastian sneaks a glance.  Pris is staring at him with
        big childlike eyes, Sebastian looks back at Batty, moved
        but helpless.

                                BATTY
                  What about your friend, the man
                  who owns this building?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Dr. Tyrell?

        Batty nods.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  He's not really my friend.  I just
                  do a job for him now and then.

                                BATTY
                  Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  He could?

                                BATTY
                  His company made us.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I'd be happy to mention it to him.

                                BATTY
                  Be better if I could talk to him
                  in person.  But he's not an easy
                  man to get to.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  No.

                                BATTY
                  When do you deliver your project?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  This afternoon.

        Batty leans forward and looks right into Sebastian's
        eyes.

                                BATTY
                  Will you help us?

        There's no way Sebastian could say no, even if he
        wanted to.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yes.

        Pris sits up smiling.  Mary sighs a breath of relief
        and Batty leans back nodding in gratitude.

                                BATTY
                  I'm sure glad you found us,
                  Sebastian.  What do you think,
                  Mary?

                                MARY
                  I don't think there is another
                  human being in this whole world
                  who would have helped us.

                                BATTY
                  Pris?

        Pris gets up and comes to Sebastian and kisses him.

        That has a lot of impact.  Sebastian looks around try-
        ing to keep the tears from coming.

                                BATTY
                  You're our best and only friend.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Thank you.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - DAY                  81

        Rachael is lying across the bed in one of Deckard's
        shirts, her chin over the edge, her eyes moving around
        the room.  Deckard lies next to her.  Looking like a
        man who died a voluptuous death.

                                RACHAEL
                  When was the last time you cleaned
                  this place?

                                DECKARD
                  Hmmm?

                                RACHAEL
                  Have you ever cleaned your
                  apartment?

                                DECKARD
                  Don't be fooled by appearances.

                                RACHAEL
                  It appears to be dirty -- why don't
                  you get somebody?

        He rolls over to admire her legs.

                                DECKARD
                  Because they would ruin the
                  arrangement.

        He kisses the back of her thigh.

                                RACHAEL
                  They could clean around the
                  arrangement.

                                DECKARD
                  I don't like people snooping around
                  my stuff.

        He kisses her other thigh, gets up and goes into the
        bathroom.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  There's a vacuum in the front room
                  closet is you wanna give it a try.

        Rachael lies there a moment, then gets up and goes into
        the front room and opens the closet door.  The vacuum is
        not easy to get to, but finally she wrestles it out.  As
        she starts to plug it in --

                                DECKARD
                  Oh no, don't do that.

        He's wrapped in a sheet, watching her from the doorway.

                                RACHAEL
                  But if I don't plug it in how can
                  I...

                                DECKARD
                  Never mind the plug, just go
                  through the motions.

                                RACHAEL
                  But then how can you...

                                DECKARD
                  I don't like the noise.  Just
                  practice.  Practice makes perfect.

        She stares at him like he's nuts.

                                DECKARD
                  I'm serious.  Go ahead.  Show me
                  how you would do it.

        Reluctantly she makes some half-hearted passes with the
        thing.

                                DECKARD
                  How about under the couch there.
                  Come on.

        She bends over to get it.  Deckard pulls up a chair and
        sits down with his chin in his hands.  She looks back
        at him.

                                RACHAEL
                  This feels stupid.

                                DECKARD
                  Good for a smart girl to feel
                  stupid.  Part of your education.

        She drops the vacuum and sits on the floor.  Deckard
        gets up and comes towards her.  Her eyes travel halfway
        down his sheet and she leaves.

                                RACHAEL
                  You're sick, Deckard.

                                DECKARD
                  I never felt better.

        EXT. TYRELL PRESERVE - DUSK                             82

        Mansion and opulent grounds.  Sebastian's humble truck
        parked among richer relations, including a spinner and
        a 1928 Dusenberg.

        EXT. TYRELL MANSION - DUSK                              83

        The den.  It contains a collection of big game trophies,
        and among all this sits Sebastian very straight and
        proper with an "egg" the size of a basketball in his
        lap.

        Old Hannibal Chew was right, the rich make you wait.
        Sebastian stands and carefully makes his way between
        the trophies to a window with a view of the grounds.

        EXT. TYRELL MANSION POOL - DUSK                         84

        Tyrell's young WIFE sits on the diving board watching
        her husband in the pool with their youngest TOT.  And
        two older LADS swim around trying to outdo each other
        for their dad's attention.

        From the sidelines an old servant pauses to watch the
        fun, then continues with a tray of mugs towards the
        house.

        EXT. PLATEAU - DUSK                                     85

        And beyond on a plateau overlooking the grounds, a
        figure stands watching, waiting like a bird of prey.

        EXT. TYRELL PRESERVE - DUSK                             86

        On a gravel path between shrubs of winter roses, Tyrell
        turns to observe the last quiet light over his kingdom.
        The moment is sweetened by the LOW PLAINTIVE BELLOW of
        one of the animals.

        He strolls by an old gardener who tips his cap, pro-
        ceeds up the steps and into his mansion.

        INT. TYRELL DEN - NIGHT                                 87

        Next to a tray of cookies and milk, Sebastian sits pa-
        tiently with the "egg" in his lap.  As the door opens
        he gets to his feet expectantly.  It's STYLES, Tyrell's
        bodyguard.  He could play the Giant in Jack and The
        Beanstalk.

                                STYLES
                  Okay, I'll take that now.

        Sebastian would rather put it in the boss's hands, but
        Styles takes it and is almost through the door when
        Sebastian stops him.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Wait!

        He almost forgot.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Can't fly without the pilot.

        Sebastian hands him a little box.  Styles stuffs it in
        his pocket and shuts the door behind him.

        EXT. TYRELL PRESERVE - NIGHT                            88

        Motionless and monumental, six buffalo stand like stat-
        ues in the grass.  Suddenly they swing their shaggy
        heads to watch something pass.

        In the dark silence Batty stops to look at the curious
        beasts and then moves soundlessly towards the mansion.

        INT. TYRELL DINING ROOM - NIGHT                         89

        It's a medieval-sized hall.  The piece de resistance is
        an 18th Century, English painting of an Arab stallion,
        gleaming like coal over the CRACKLING fireplace.

        The entire family is seated at the table which glitters
        for the festive occasion.  Presents gathered around the
        oldest child.

        Styles hands the "egg" to Tyrell.  A hush falls over
        the table.  This is Dad's big present.  Tyrell sets is
        down before the boy.

        IAN is a fresh, slim lad who is ten today.  He looks up
        at his father, then, beaming, pries open the "egg's"
        hinged lid.  Tyrell's hand goes to his pocket and the
        griffon steps out of the shell.

                                IAN
                  Oh!

        Basically an avian invention, it has wings and plumage,
        the head of an eagle, the body of a lion and weighs no
        more than eight pounds.  It cranes its neck and testing
        its balance, stands on one leg and then hops to the
        edge of the table and into the air.

        The littlest tot claps her hands as the griffon beats
        its wings rapidly and rises towards the ceiling.  Turn-
        ing in a forty-five degree, it suddenly drops into a
        dive.

        Delighted, the children shriek and scream as the griffon
        swoops over their crouching heads and sails the length
        of the hall -- its silhouette flickering briefly over
        the ancestral portraits of the Tyrell clan.

        Reaching the end of the room, it banks sharply and
        flies back towards the table, cups its wings, spreads
        its tail and comes in for an awkward landing.  They're
        laughing and clapping as it waddles down the table and
        knocks over a glass and stops in front of Ian.

                                IAN
                  Papa!  Did you make this?

                                TYRELL
                  No.  We can make man, but not a
                  griffon.

        He bends down and kisses his wife.

                                TYRELL
                  Have to give the cottage industry
                  a chance too.

        Pleased he excuses himself and heads for the den.

        INT. TYRELL DEN - NIGHT                                 90

        Tyrell comes in and sits behind his desk.  Sebastian
        hands down the invoices.  Tyrell glances over them and
        writes out a check.

        He looks up to hand it over when he sees Batty against
        the wall, by the door.  For a fraction of a second he's
        shocked, but recovers fast.

                                TYRELL
                  A friend of yours, Sebastian?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yes, this is someone who wants to
                  talk to you, Dr. Tyrell.

        Batty smiles.

                                BATTY
                  The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.

                                TYRELL
                  Oh?

        Very slowly Tyrell's hand moves towards the back side
        of the desk.

                                BATTY
                  To act without understanding could
                  lead to the very thing the act
                  seeks to avoid.

        What's in Batty's eyes completes the warning.  Tyrell
        decides to heed it.

                                BATTY
                  A little talk it all I need.

        Tyrell looks at Sebastian.  Considers consequences.
        Back to Batty.

                                TYRELL
                  Would you like to talk in private
                  then.

        Batty thinks it over.

                                BATTY
                  Yeah.  It might be better if we
                  talk in private, Sebastian.  Why
                  don't you go home.

                                TYRELL
                  Here's your check, my boy.  Thank
                  you.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Thank you, Dr. Tyrell.  I'll see
                  you later.

        He slips out closing the door behind him.  Opens it
        again and sticks his head it.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Was everything okay?

                                TYRELL
                  Just beautiful.

        He's gone.

        If Tyrell is scared he's doing a good job of concealing
        it.

                                TYRELL
                  I'm surprised you didn't come to
                  me sooner.

                                BATTY
                  It's not an easy thing to meet
                  your maker.

                                TYRELL
                  And what can he do for you?

                                BATTY
                  Can the maker repair what he makes?

                                TYRELL
                  Would you like to be modified?

                                BATTY
                  Had in mind something a little more
                  radical.

                                TYRELL
                  What's the problem?

                                BATTY
                  Death.

                                TYRELL
                  I'm afraid that's a little out of
                  my...

        Batty cuts in with a whisper.

                                BATTY
                  I want more life, fucker.

                                TYRELL
                  Come here.

        Batty walks forward.

                                TYRELL
                  Sit down.

        Batty does.

                                TYRELL
                  The facts of life.  I'll be blunt.
                  To make an alteration in the
                  evolvement of an organic life
                  system, at least by men, makers
                  or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence
                  can't be revised once it's
                  established.

                                BATTY
                  Why?

                                TYRELL
                  Because by the second day of
                  incubation any cells that have
                  undergone reversion mutation give
                  rise to revertant colonies -- like
                  rats leaving a sinking ship.  The
                  ship sinks.

                                BATTY
                  What about E.M.S. recombination?

                                TYRELL
                  We've already tried it -- ethyl
                  methane sulfonate is an alkylating
                  agent and a potent mutagen -- it
                  creates a virus so lethal the
                  subject was destroyed before we
                  left the table.

        Batty nods grimly.

                                BATTY
                  Then a repressor protein that blocks
                  the operating cells.

                                TYRELL
                  Wouldn't obstruct replication, but
                  it does give rise to an error in
                  replication, so that the newly
                  formed DNA strand carries a
                  mutation and you're got a virus
                  again... but all this is academic
                  -- you are made as good as we could
                  make you.

                                BATTY
                  But not to last.

                                TYRELL
                  Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are
                  made to last -- as least they were.
                  But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari.
                  A high strung racing car -- built
                  to win, not to last.

        Batty smiles bitterly.

                                TYRELL
                  Also you're too valuable to
                  experiment with.

                                BATTY
                  I am?

        Tyrell can't help a flash of pride.

                                TYRELL
                  The bast of all possible androids.
                  We're proud of our prodigal son --
                  glad you're returned.  You're quite
                  a prize.

        Shoulders hunched, Batty looks down, an uncharacteristic
        note of guilt in his voice.

                                BATTY
                  I've done some questionable things.

                                TYRELL
                  Also extraordinary things.

                                BATTY
                  Nothing the God of biomechanics
                  wouldn't let you in heaven for.

        They share a laugh.  In spite of himself, there's a look
        of relief in Tyrell's face as Batty extends his hand.
        Tyrell takes it and they shake.  The reverence in Bat-
        ty's eyes caused Tyrell a fatherly smile.  The smile
        turns into a growl as he feels the bones in his hands
        crack.  Before the scream comes out of his mouth, Batty
        stifles it.

        Tyrell claws at the iron fingers, but they're sinking
        into his face.  Placing his other hand behind Tyrell's
        head, Batty squeezes them together and squashes the
        man's head like a melon.  The mess is not small.

        Palms up, like a surgeon, Batty walks to the drapes and
        wipes off the gore and without looking back, strolls out
        of the room.

        INT. TYRELL - HALL TO KITCHEN - NIGHT                   90A

        Styles is coming down the hall.  He sees Batty coming
        towards him.  Styles looks at him curiously, this is not
        one of the guests.  As they close, Batty smiles.

                                BATTY
                  Could you tell me where the
                  bathroom is?

        Styles doesn't get a chance to answer.  Batty's hand has
        torn into his crotch.  The man is lifted off the floor,
        up the wall and held a moment.  Whatever is encased in
        his pelvis is pulverized.  Batty lets go.  Styles hits
        the floor.  He died of shock.  Grinding his teeth, Batty
        continues towards the SOUNDS OF THE FESTIVITIES.

        INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                91

        The birthday cake has arrived, the candles lit.  They're
        waiting for Dad.  Mrs. Tyrell looks around to find Batty
        observing from the doorway.

        A little startled, a little curious, but ever the cor-
        porate wife, she smiles.

                                MRS. TYRELL
                  May I help you?

        Batty smiles back and shakes his head in mock regrets.

        INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                    92

        In the sink the faucet is on.  The water pink with
        blood.  Batty is washing his hands.

        A portly maid emerges from the pantry.  Batty looks up.
        She stops, embarrassed at being caught.  Her eyes no-
        tice drops of blood on the floor and follow them to the
        door.  When she looks back, Batty is right in front of
        her.

        INT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                          93

        Books scattered on the bed.  Rachael sitting cross-
        legged with one in her lap, looking through exquisite
        shots of nature.  Deckard is next to her, watching her
        like a lover, like a father.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  She'd never seen the great outdoors.
                  Never even seen books on the
                  subject.  She went through
                  everything I had, and we talked.
                  And there were subjects we didn't
                  discuss and they were words we
                  didn't say, I couldn't say, like
                  death, like future, like real.  But
                  it was hard because she was curious
                  and full of questions.  She was
                  more alive than anyone I'd ever
                  known.

        She looks up stunned by the beauty of a photo, but with
        no need to comment.  It's in her eyes.  She stares at
        him, a revelation taking shape.

                                RACHAEL
                  You and I are good friends, huh?

        He considers it and she stares at him, smiling at the
        wonder of it.

                                RACHAEL
                  It's so easy.

        Convinced and not convinced, he nods his head.  She
        laughs at his solemnity.  She's irresistible.  Deckard's
        pretty irresistible himself.

                                RACHAEL
                  Have you ever known anybody a long
                  time?

                                DECKARD
                  You mean a woman?

                                RACHAEL
                  Uh-huh.

                                DECKARD
                  What's a long time?

                                RACHAEL
                  Ten years.

                                DECKARD
                  Nope.  Nobody could stand me that
                  long.

        The CHIME on the PHONE next to the bed GOES OFF.  He
        reaches out and brings it to his ear.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                BRYANT
                  This is Bryant.  Are you alone?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                BRYANT
                  She's not with you?

                                DECKARD
                  Who.

        A pause.

                                BRYANT
                  Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth
                  floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia
                  South.

                                DECKARD
                  Got it.

                                BRYANT
                  Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his
                  family and half his staff were just
                  massacred.  The cat is about to get
                  out of the bag.  Pressure is
                  definitely on.  The Nexus program
                  is terminated.  When you finish
                  there, locate Nexus designated Rachael
                  and retire.

        Deckard says nothing.

                                BRYANT
                  If you don't, we will.  It has to
                  be total, Deckard.  That's an order
                  from as high as it comes.  Got it?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.  I got it.

                                BRYANT
                  Go.

        He hangs up the receiver and gets up.  She watches him
        from the bed.  The gun goes into his belt.  He loads
        the ankle job and straps it on.  She watches every move.

                                RACHAEL
                  Why do you call it retire, why
                  don't you call it murder?

                                DECKARD
                  Because it's not.

                                RACHAEL
                  Don't you think anything that can
                  suffer deserves to be considered?

                                DECKARD
                  Andies only simulate suffering --
                  if they're programmed for it.

                                RACHAEL
                  Do you think I simulated what
                  happened between us?

                                DECKARD
                  No, I don't.

        Without looking at her, he puts on his jacket.

        He's standing in the middle of the floor with his back
        to her.  He turns and they're facing one another.
        Neither of them moves.

                                DECKARD
                  Don't leave here.  Don't open the
                  door, don't answer the phone.

                                RACHAEL
                  What difference will it make?

                                DECKARD
                  Just wait here.

        He goes to the door.

                                RACHAEL
                  You know what I think?

                                DECKARD
                  What?

                                RACHAEL
                  That some of the folks around here
                  are more programmed then me.

        He has to laugh.

                                RACHAEL
                  You know what else I think?

                                DECAKRD
                  What?

                                RACHAEL
                  This was the best day of my life.

        He turns and goes through the door.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                      94

        Sebastian is putting his work table in order, but his
        mind is not with it and his hands are trembling.

        Batty, Pris and Mary are on the other side of the room
        talking:  their voices low.

                                MARY
                  Let's go while there is still
                  time.

                                BATTY
                  Where?

                                MARY
                  Anywhere.

        Batty smiles.

                                BATTY
                  What's the point?

                                MARY
                  Not to be trapped.

                                BATTY
                  You underestimate the trap, Mary.

        Sebastian has almost reached the door.

                                BATTY
                  Where are you going, Sebastian?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Just thought I'd...

                                BATTY
                  No, you stay here with us.  Out
                  last night together.

        They all watch.

        Sebastian walks away from the door.

                                BATTY
                  Think of yourself as a light, Mary.
                  Shine before you're turned off.

        She's too fragile for that logic, but it appeals to
        Pris.  She and Batty hold a look that burns.

        Sebastian is by the window.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Someone is coming here.

        Batty goes to the window and looks down.

                                BATTY
                  One man.
                         (he smiles)
                  He must be good.

                                MARY
                  Then go get him.

                                BATTY
                  That wouldn't be very sporting.

        Sebastian looks ready to bolt.  Batty puts an arm
        around him.

                                PRIS
                  I want to do it.

                                BATTY
                  Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a
                  little for everybody.  A
                  masterpiece.

        A pause.

                                BATTY
                  Turn out the lights, Pris.

        EXT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                      95

        In the dim, nocturnal light, Deckard crosses into the
        courtyard fronting the building and stops.  He looks
        around.  Nobody there, just silence.

        He comes closer to the building and stands in the sha-
        dows off to one side of the entry.

        His head jerks up to the SOUND OF CRASHING GLASS.

        Sebastian comes hurtling down and explodes into the
        pavement thirty feet below.

        Deckard's eyes move up the line of descent, the shat-
        tered window on the next-to-top floor.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT LOBBY - NIGHT                96

        Not much to see, But Deckard misses none of it as he
        crosses the floor and positions himself in the spot of
        least exposure.  He looks around.  Elevator and stair-
        well.

        Close to the wall, he moves towards the elevator, keep-
        ing an eye on the stairwell door.

        Stepping to one side, he hits the button.  The elevator
        door slides open.  He reaches in, presses a button and
        as the doors slide shut, Deckard slips a pen between
        the doors, jamming the operation.

        Deckard's shoes and soundless as he quickly crosses the
        lobby floor.  He pauses a moment in front of the stair-
        well door, then pushes it open and:

        INT. STAIRWELL, SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT           97

        Steps into the dark on the other side.  Suddenly he
        spins, dropping to the floor, and FIRES three times in-
        to the figure hovering to his left.

        The man is hanging off the floor, his arms locked into
        the railing, neck broken -- with three holes in his
        chest... but he was already dead.

        Deckard stares at the corpse.  It's Mr. Deetchum, the
        old watchman.  That RUSTLING SOUND are rats who were
        feeding on him, scampering for safer places, Deckard
        gets to his feet.

        The stairway rectangles ten stories up.  As his foot
        touches the first step, a raw, terrified SCREAM shatters
        the air.  It came from below.  It's the cry of a young
        girl -- it GROWS TO A PIERCING SHRIEK AND ABRUPTLY
        STOPS.  Deckard ejects the half-used cartridge from his
        laser, inserts a fresh one and quiet as the silence,
        descends the basement stairs.

        INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT                                   98

        At the bottom he faces a corridor.  The FAINT HUM OF
        MACHINERY comes from the double doors at the far end.
        The HUM BECOMES A RATTLE by the time he gets there.
        Each door is fitted with a small window.  Deckard
        steps to the side and peers through.

        INT. GYM - NIGHT                                        99

        It's a gym.  The mirror-lined walls are cracked and
        tarnished, the equipment atrophied from lack of use.
        The heavier barbells have sunk into the floor.  Two
        weight-reducing machines are flapping and grinding away
        like idiots.  Deckard's eyes stop on the woman.

        She dangles a few feet off the floor, hung by the
        shoulders through rings suspended from the ceiling.
        Her head is slung forward, her body limp and slightly
        swaying.

        Deckard pushes open one of the doors until it touches
        the wall.  Slowly, he advances toward the hanging figure,
        keeping an eye on the mirror to cover surprises from the
        door.  He's not breathing hard.  His heart isn't pound-
        ing.  Deckard's in his element.

        Close enough to look up into her face, he stops.  It
        isn't grisly death that causes the reaction in his
        eyes.  It's the innocence of her angel face.

        It's not something he has time to consider.  In the
        mirror behind him, he sees the door starting to open.
        Deckard spins.  He shouldn't have.  Pris' legs snap up,
        crack the laser out of his hand and clamp around his
        neck.

        Slowly, the door swings closed, but Deckard doesn't
        notice.  His carotid artery is no longer sending blood
        to the brain.  He jerks up his foot and reaches down.
        As his fingers close around the ankle laser, Pris'
        fingers close around his wrist.  Deckard's hand opens
        like a flower.  The laser drops to the floor as his
        eyes roll back into his head.

                                PRIS
                  Naughty, naughty.

        She lets go, but before he can fall, she rams a foot
        into his back.  He's propelled fifteen feet across the
        room, slams into a machine and falls to the floor.
        Pris flies off the rings and comes at him.

        Deckard reaches out to pull himself up, but she's al-
        ready there.  Not too hard and just in the right place,
        she kicks him in the stomach.  He goes back to the
        floor, gagging for air.  Oh-so-precisely she reaches
        out with a long index finger and flips the switch on
        the machine.

        It's a flab eliminator with a vibrator belt.  Normally
        an innocuous piece of equipment, but the motor housing
        on this one is missing.  Lots of GRINDING METAL.  A
        bad place for flesh and bone.

        But that's where Deckard's hand is going.  An eight-
        year-old against a full-down man.  In two more seconds
        his hand will be ground round.  Deckard tries to pull
        his hand loose.  It won't come.  He yanks hard, but
        it's welded in hers.

        His face is twisted and strained as he raises a leg,
        wedges his foot against her chest and pushes with all
        his might.  The hold breaks.  They topple back.  Deckard
        hits the floor gulping to catch his breath.  Pris is up
        and coming for him again.  She hovers over him.  Deckard
        rolls out of the way as she comes down like a pile
        driver.

        Reflexively Deckard raises his arm to protect himself.
        Pris just smiles, takes hold of his foot and drags him
        across the floor.  She doesn't like to leave a piece of
        work unfinished.  They're going back to the machine.

        He goes by a weight-stand of dumbbells and grabs hold.
        It doesn't stop him.  He's sliding over the floor like
        it was ice, weight stand in tow.

        Pris gets to the machine, yanks his foot up and forces
        it toward the opening.  Deckard sits up, a five-pound
        dumbbell in his hand, and clobbers her in the back.  It
        knocks her off balance, but she doesn't let go of his
        foot.  She hooks out with a fist but misses.  He gets
        her with a roundhouse in the face.

        She goes to the floor and Deckard's up, the dumbbell
        over his head, coming down with it.  Fighting for her
        life now, Pris drives a foot into his chest.  It lifts
        him off the floor.  He flies back across the gym and
        lands in a heap.

        No more games.  Pris is furious and moving fast.  She
        rips a steel bar out of the wall and, holding it over-
        head, charges him like a samurai.  As she comes down
        for the kill, she freezes.

        Deckard landed near the laser.  He crawls towards it.
        As in a nightmare, it takes forever.  But he gets there.

        He reaches out and grabs the laser, rolls over and
        takes careful aim.  She charges towards him, screaming
        her rage.  He FIRES as she comes.

        The shot amputates her left arm at the shoulder, but
        her hand doesn't let go of the bar.  It dangles crazily
        in front of her as she charges forward.

        He PUTS THE NEXT ONE through her neck.  Pris hiccups a
        rope of blood as she flies through the air and crashes
        next to Deckard.  Dead.

        He lies next to her, chest heaving.  Slowly he rolls
        over and gets to his hands and knees.  Panting, he stag-
        gers to his feet and stands over her, swaying slightly.
        The sound that escapes his throat is raspy and dry.  It
        might not sound like a war cry, but it is.

        INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                   100

        Laser in hand, Deckard kicks open the swinging doors
        and walks into the corridor, a dangerous man.

        INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT                                  101

        Deckard arrives at the main floor landing, checks his
        loads and continues up the stairs.  He's going to shoot
        the next thing that moves and find out later if he was
        right or wrong.

        INT. STAIRWELL - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT                   101A

        On the next landing he throws the door open.  His eyes
        move down the hall, looking for prints in the dust.
        None.  He continues up the stairs.

        INT. NINTH FLOOR - NIGHT                                102

        On the ninth floor he finds what he's looking for.
        Footprints coming and going from a door halfway down the
        hall.  He stops to the side of it and listens.  Silence.
        Deckard FIRES three quick shots through the door.  If
        somebody were on the other side of it, they aren't now.

        He kicks the door open and dives through head first
        and hits the floor in a roll, POURING FIRE into the
        far corners of the room but the room is empty.  There's
        a kitchen bar, a closet and a bedroom door, both
        closed.  Deckard's breathing is the only sound.  No
        response from either door.

        Maybe it was a sound, maybe intuition, but suddenly
        Deckard twists around and FIRES several shots into the
        closet.  The smouldering door slowly creaks open.

        Mary is huddled in the rear of the closet.  Her hand
        out like somebody about to catch a ball but afraid of
        it.  In her other hand she clutches a button-eyed
        monkey.  Her face is bewildered, frozen in fear, her
        body riddled with holes.  No recognition gap here.
        Deckard SHOOTS her through the neck to make sure.  Mary
        falls to the floor, like a puppet with her strings cut.

        Deckard backs away from the pathetic figure in the
        closet and sits on the sofa, unable to take his eyes
        off her.

        Deckard lays the laser down next to him, holds out his
        hand and looks at it.  It's steady.  He drops it in
        his lap, closes his eyes and leans back.

        A TAPPING from the ceiling.  Deckard looks up.

        A KNOCK -- with the proverbial DOUBLE RAP at the end.
        A pause.  Deckard jumps out of the way as the ceiling
        gives in.  Chucks on concrete and plaster hit the
        couch where he was sitting.  The hole is a couple feet
        in diameter -- beams cracked through, exposing the
        apartment above.  Silence.  Deckard wipes the plaster
        dust from his eyes and mouth, then whispers:

                                DECKARD
                  Hello, Roy.

        INT. STAIRWELL - NINTH AND TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT          103

        Deckard comes out onto the landing.  Taking his time,
        he climbs the steps to the next floor, the last floor.
        He SHOOTS the hinges out of the big stairwell door,
        pushes it with his foot and it comes down with a BANG.
        The REVERBERATIONS turn into silence.  The corridor is
        empty.

        INT. CORRIDOR - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                     104

        Moving fast but cautious, he passes each door until he
        gest to the apartment above Sebastian's.  Slowly he
        turns the know and pushed open the door.

        INT. APARTMENT - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                    105

        Except for the hole in the middle of the floor, there's
        nothing to see.  Back against the wall, he moves to-
        wards the bedroom, but stops at the NOISE.  It sounds
        like the HOOTING OF AN OWL and it's coming from the
        hallway.

        INT. CORRIDOR - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                     106

        Deckard looks around the corner of the door down the
        hall.  Batty's at the other end.  Except for jockstrap
        and gym shoes, he's nude.

                                BATTY
                  You wanna play?

        Deckard FIRES.  Batty's fast.  He ducks into a doorway.
        Pops out again.

                                BATTY
                  Not very sporting to fire on an
                  unarmed opponent.  I thought you
                  were supposed to be good.  Aren't
                  you the man?!

        The makeup on Batty's face is somewhere between a Coman-
        che warrior and a transvestite.  The immensity of his
        insolence awesome -- the muscles of his body are swol-
        len, trembling from the thrill of it.

                                BATTY
                  This is how we do it up there, lad!
                  Come on!

        In a blue of lightning-like action, Batty whips down the
        hall, zigzagging off the walls towards Deckard so fast
        that Deckard gets only three SHOTS off before the blur
        crashes through the wall on his left with a laugh.

        Deckard stands there a moment -- digesting the impact
        of it, then edges up to the gaping wall.  Batty is be-
        hind him.

        He knees Deckard in the back and slaps him in the head.
        Deckard goes to his knees, then over on his face.
        Batty kneels next to him.

                                BATTY
                  Not hurt, are you?  You better get
                  it up or I'm going to have to kill
                  you.  Unless you're alive you can't
                  play.  And if you don't play, you
                  don't get to be alive.

        Deckard's eyes are closed, mouth bleeding.  He exhales
        and makes and effort.  He slides his hands up even with
        his chest and starts to push.

                                BATTY
                  That's the spirit.

        Like a matador, Batty walks away.  By the time Deckard's
        on his feet, Batty's disappeared through one of the
        doors.

        Deckard wipes the blood from his mouth, bends down and
        picks up his laser, reloads and looks down the hall,
        towards the jeering voice.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  Come on, Deckard, show me what you
                  got!  I'm right here on the other
                  side of the door.  But you gotta
                  shoot straight 'cause I'm fast!

        Deckard gets to the door, BLASTS it, kicks it open and
        FIRES at Batty.  But it's only the reflection of Batty.

        INT. ROOM - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                         107

        The full length mirror on the other side of the room
        SHATTERS.  Batty's next to him, grabs Deckard's hand
        and steps in closer.

                                BATTY
                  Straight doesn't seem to be good
                  enough.

        They're face to face.

                                BATTY
                  You don't have a chance, do you?

        In an exaggeration of weary disappointment, Batty drops
        his head to the side.

                                BATTY
                  Looks like I'm gonna have to scale
                  it down for you.  Give you a
                  handicap.  I won't run through any
                  more walls.  Okay?  I promise to
                  use the doors.  Okay?

        Deckard stares back at him, but doesn't respond.  Sud-
        denly fury storms through Batty.  He throws Deckard out
        the door, knocking him down, grabs him by the collar
        and rams his head into the wall.

                                BATTY
                  Come on, let's use that brain!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT                       108

        He drags him down the hall, on his knees and bangs his
        head into the wall again.

                                BATTY
                  Think!  We need a little
                  resilience around here!

        He yanks him further and bashes his head again.

                                BATTY
                  Where are those balls of yours?!
                  Let's see a little bravery!

        The storm passes.

        Deckard hangs in Batty's hand like a bag of laundry.

                                BATTY
                  That was irrational of me -- not
                  to mention unsportsmanlike.  Won't
                  happen again.

        He drops him.

                                BATTY
                  I'll be down the hall when you're
                  ready.

        Betty walks off and disappears through one of the doors.

        Deckard gets to his knees, leans against the wall a mo-
        ment, then punches it with his fist.

        On his feet he's a little wobbly.  Holding his breath
        so he can hear above his own breathing, he listens.  No
        sound.  No sign of Batty.  The laser is laying nearby.
        He doesn't bother.

        Deckard is backing down the hall, quiet as he can.  He
        had a job to do.  He would like to have done it, but
        he's not insane.  He gets to the landing and turns.

        On the first step down, he stops.  Batty's on the land-
        ing below, looking up at him.

                                BATTY
                  Where you going?

        He wait a moment for Deckard's answer.

                                BATTY
                  No cheating.  A promise is a
                  promise.  I'll honor the
                  handicapped, but we gotta play on
                  the top floor.  You go get your
                  laser gun now.  And I'll give you
                  a few seconds before I come.

        Deckard turns back into the hall.  Batty smiles.

        Deckard's running down the corridor.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  One!

        Halfway down the hall he finds his laser.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  Two!

        Deckard darts into the nearest door.  The apartment
        above Sebastian's, with the hole in the floor.  Deckard
        considers it.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  No fair jumping through holes.  You
                  might get hurt doing that!  THREE!

        Deckard dashes back into the hall, chooses another door
        and goes in.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      109

        His eyes skim over everything, looking for an advantage.
        He throws open a door.  The bathroom.  The plumbing is
        dismantled, walls stripped, revealing brick, nails
        protruding.  Too small.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR STAIRWELL - NIGHT                      110

        Batty's coming up the steps.

                                BATTY
                  Five!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      111

        Deckard's looking for a corner -- a place that covers
        the angles.  He chooses the far side of the room with
        a line to the door.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           112

        Batty's coming down the center, listening at the doors.

                                BATTY
                  Six!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      113

        Deckard's crouched in the corner and aimed.  He looks at
        his hand.  It's trembling.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  Seven!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           114

        Batty's standing in front of a door, listening.

                                BATTY
                  Oh, I wonder where he is.  Not in
                  here, I don't think.  Eight!

        He goes to the next door.

                                BATTY
                  Maybe here.  Doesn't sound like
                  it.  Nine!

        Batty moves to the next.  The door to Deckard.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      115

        Deckard's crouched lower, holding his breath -- talk
        about a hair trigger... Silence.  Batty's FEET are heard
        CREAKING AWAY.  Deckard looks around.  Runs a hand over
        the wall behind him.  Batty's FEET COME BACK.  A pause.

                                BATTY
                  Ten!

        The door explodes!

        A shape hurtles across the room.  Deckard pivots, fol-
        lowing it with RAPID FIRE.  It's a TV.  He spins back.
        but Batty's already on him.  He gets one SHOT off be-
        fore Batty's got his hand.  There's a hole over Batty's
        right eye.  Blood running down his face, dripping on
        Deckard.  The right side of his face isn't working too
        good.  The corner of his mouth doesn't quite shut --
        his voice comes out slurred, a little hollow.

                                BATTY
                  One point for you.

        The would doesn't minimize his omnipotence, just makes
        it more malignant.  He throws Deckard against the far
        wall.  Deckard FIRES.  Hits Batty in the shoulder.

                                BATTY
                  Ho ho!  Try it again!

        He comes at Deckard, jerking back and forth, a cobra in
        fast motion, faking, weaving, yelping with excitement
        as Deckard tries to get a shot, FIRING AWAY until his
        laser's empty.  Bloody and crazed, Batty pushes up
        against him.

                                BATTY
                  What's wrong?  Don't you like me?
                  I'm what we've made!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           116

        He's backing Deckard out the door.  Deckard trips and
        falls.  There's fear on his face.  The strength is gone.
        Something is starting to crack.

                                BATTY
                  What's wrong?  Aren't you a lover
                  of Faster, Bigger and Better?!

        Deckard's pedaling backwards over the floor.

                                BATTY
                  It's time to die.

        Deckard throws the laser at him.  It misses.  Batty
        throws his head back and laughs.  A one-eyed colossus
        about to eat the world.  Suddenly he stops.  His eye
        moves over the wall.

                                BATTY
                  Ah!

        He reaches out and pinches something.  His lips compress
        as he yanks it out of the wall.  It's a ten-penny nail.

        He holds it out to Deckard and drops it.  Deckard
        catches it.

                                BATTY
                  That's for you.

        One side of Batty's face smiles savagely.

                                BATTY
                  Stick it in your ear and push.
                  If that doesn't work, try the
                  eye.

        Deckard stares at the nail in his hand, then up at
        his executioner.

                                BATTY
                  Believe me, it'll be better
                  for you than what I'm about
                  to do.

        Batty watches him, hoping the stimulus might inspire
        his victim to more action.  It doesn't look like it.

                                BATTY
                  Well?

        Deckard springs to his feet and bolts.  But instead of
        going for the stairwell he turns in the first available
        door.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT #2 - NIGHT                   117

        Provocation accomplished. Batty smiles and walks lei-
        surely towards the door.  Deckard's terrified scream
        and the SOUND of GLASS CRASHING stop him.  Batty speeds
        up and moves into the room.

        The window pane is splattered, curtains sucked out,
        bellowing in the wind.

                                BATTY
                  Crap.

        He walks up to the window.  Deckard comes away from the
        wall, inching up behind him, laser in both hands, aimed
        at the base of Batty's skull.  Batty starts to lean
        over, but even before his eyes see the pavement, he
        knows.  He spins...

        Deckard FIRES again.  This one goes home.  Batty falls
        like he was poleaxed, hits the floor dead weight.

        Deckard starts to tremble.  His arms go limp as his
        head tilts back and he closes his eyes.  He can breathe
        again.
        
        On the floor, Batty's hand is crawling toward Deckard's
        ankle.

        With the unsuspected abruptness of a man slipping on a
        banana peel, Deckard comes down.  Face knotted in hor-
        ror, he EMPTIES THE LASER in Batty's body -- but the
        hand holds on.  With a screech of frustration he drops
        the laser and like an animal claws at Batty's dead
        fingers -- but the fingers are welded shut.

        Deckard starts to crawl, pulling Batty behind him.  He
        struggled through the door and stumbles to his feet.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           118

        Deckard plunges down the corridor dragging Batty along.
        He falls, gets to one foot, falls again and crawls the
        last couple feet to the stairwell.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR STAIRWELL - NIGHT                      119

        Groaning, he tugs and pulls, hauls and heaves Batty's
        body to the edge of the landing.  He pauses for breath,
        then lays back, wedging his feet against Batty's shoul-
        ders and pushes.  Inch by inch the body goes over the
        edge.  Then all at once it drops.  But the hand holds
        and the weight of the body takes Deckard with it.  As
        Deckard slides over the edge, he grabs hold of the
        railing.

        Deckard's hanging three hundred feet over the basement
        floor, supporting himself and Batty's corpse -- almost
        four hundred pounds of stress on his fingers.
        
        With his free foot he chops away at Batty's hand, try-
        ing to break it loose.  But it's not working.  Deckard's
        fingers are starting to slip.

        His face is a mask of agony as he wedges his heel over
        Batty's thumb.  With the help of gravity and everything
        he's got in his right leg to push with, he pushes.  The
        thumb breaks loose.  Batty falls.

        The SOUND OF HIS BODY HITTING BELOW sounds good, but
        Deckard doesn't notice.  He's in an awkward position.
        He must reverse the way he's facing to pull himself up.
        He lets go with his right hand and crosses it over the
        left.  Then turns the left around so he's got an over-
        hand grip.

        Like a man doing his last pull-up... the one that can't
        be done, Deckard pulls himself up, throws a foot over
        the edge and grapples and heaves and wiggled himself
        onto the cold solid steel of the stairwell landing.

        And lies there, body jerking spasmodically, slowly
        clenching and unclenching his cramped hand, but it's
        his burning cheek against the cool metal he's most aware
        of.

        Dizzy, hot, lungs on fire, he stands -- and putting one
        foot in front of the other, Deckard descends the stairs.

        EXT. SEBASTIAN'S BUILDING - DAWN                        120

        Slowly the door pushes open and Deckard comes out into
        the morning.  The sun isn't yet risen, but the sky has
        begun to pale.  It's a brooding gray stew of a dawn not
        very pretty, but even though he can't show it, Deckard
        is glad to see it.

        For a moment he tilts his head back and takes some
        breath, then walks across the courtyard towards the
        street, so dead on his feet he hasn't the energy to
        fall.

        Deckard slumps into the shelter of his car.  The col-
        lapses on the front seat.

        INT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - DAWN                           121

        In a corner of the dimness Deckard sits slumped on a
        chair, facing the pearly gray light of the window.  The
        only SOUND in the room is the soft steady BREATHING
        that comes from the bed.

        Quietly he gets up and walks over to her.  Rachael lies
        sleeping, one delicate arm exposed from under the sheet.

        Deckard stands there, bettered and grim, staring down
        at her.

        Moments go by and finally he sits gently on the edge of
        the bed.

        Rachael opens her eyes, and looks up at him, she smiles.

        EXT. COUNTRYSIDE (MONTAGE) - DAY                        122

        Deckard's car is skimming over the narrow highway.  He
        and Rachael in the front seat.  Except for the occasion-
        al glance, their faces are still and quiet in the cold
        shine of an icy dream.

        The clouds overhead are soft and swift.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  She wanted to go to a place I knew.
                  Out of the city.  Like one of those
                  pictures she saw.  Where there were
                  trees but no buildings.

        Rachael's face in the window watching the woods stream
        by.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  We had a good time.  She told me a
                  funny story and I taught her a
                  song.  A song about monkeys and
                  elephants.  And it made us laugh so
                  hard we couldn't sing.

        EXT. WOODS (MONTAGE) - DAY                              123

        Deckard and Rachael walking.  The land lays white and
        hushed before them.

        Down an aisle of maples and beeches.  The frosty light
        slanting through the clean, hard limbs.

        The crisp, blue-white snow underfoot melted through in
        spots exposing soggy patches of rich brown earth.

        Rachael stops and faces him.  Her lips are parted, her
        warm breath turning the cold air to vapor.  Looking
        lithe and fragile by these barren-rooted trees, she
        stands in the crisp white snow looking at Deckard.
        Nothing in her retreats, even now her eyes insist on
        knowing.

        EXT. WOODS - DAY                                        124

        Deckard walking over the snow.  Alone.  He walks slowly,
        mechanically through the cold, unaffected by it.  His
        gaunt face, empty of expression except for the tears
        running down his pale cheeks.

        But for the SQUEAK of his wet shoes over the crusted
        snow, there is no sound.  And Deckard recedes into the
        silence of the freezing white landscape.

        EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                    125

        Deckard's car, solid, THROBBING, GUNNING along like
        some metal animal.  Headlights piercing the dark of the
        long, flat road.  WHISTLING speed of air and tires spin-
        ning THRUM.  And then silence.  And the silence
        astounded by the CRACK OF A GUN.

        INT. CAR - NIGHT                                        126

        Deckard is behind the wheel, face in shadow, eyes star-
        ing straight ahead.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  I told myself over and over again,
                  if I hadn't done it, they would
                  have.

                  I didn't go back to the city, not
                  that city, I didn't want the job.

                  She said the great advantage of
                  being alive was to have a choice.
                  And she chose.  And a part of me
                  was almost glad.  Not because she
                  was gone but because this way they
                  could never touch her.

                  As for Tyrell -- he was murdered,
                  but he wasn't dead.  For a long
                  time I wanted to kill him.  But
                  what was the point?  There were too
                  many Tyrells.  But only one Rachael.
                  Maybe real and unreal could never
                  be separated.  The secret never
                  found.  But I got as close with
                  her as I'd ever come to it.  She'd
                  stay with me a long time.  I guess
                  we made each other real.

        And the ruby lights of Deckard's car disappear into
        the darkness.
        
        
        
        					THE END
BLADE : TRINITY


        Over darkness a WOMAN'S VOICE speaks to us.


                                ABIGAIL (V.0.)
                     Italo Calvino once said that myth is the
                     hidden part of every story, the buried
                     part, the region that is still unexplored
                     because there are as yet no words to
                     enable us to get there.
                          (beat)
                     But I was there for the end.  I took part
                     in it.  And I think my words can help shed
                     light on what happened.  My name is
                     Abigail.  This is our story.


            FADE IN:


            EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAWN


            Harsh sunlight beats down over a bleak, unforgiving stretch of
            rocky desert.  Amidst this desolation rise the ruins of an
            ancient Sumerian ziggurat, a massive stepped pyramid of mud
            brick that was once the center of the city known as Ur.


            SUPER TITLE:	SOUTHEASTERN IRAQ, DHI QAR PROVINCE


                                    SIX MONTHS AGO


            AN EMACIATED SHEEP HERDER


            kneels by the ziggurat, tending to a ragged band of sheep.  He
            is conducting the first of his daily prayers, listening to a
            religious broadcast from Baghdad on a tinny RADIO.


            Presently, we hear HELICOPTERS.  The sheepherder looks up --


            TWO ANERICAN RAH-66 COMANCHE HELICOPTERS


            approach from the East.  They touch down near the base of the
            ziggurat, rotors stirring up clouds of dust.


            FOUR FIGURES


            disembark, their bodies covered in desert camo-gear.  They
            wear helmets with polarized face-plates and are armed to the
            teeth.  To the sheepherder they might as well be aliens.


            One of the figures turns to the East.  We can see the rising
            sun reflected in the face-plate of his helmet -- and a hint of
            a skull-like under-mask/respirator beneath the face-plate. He
            raises a gloved hand, gives the "finger" to the new day.


            Another figure (a woman) waves a hand, urging them onward.
            They mount the central steps of the ziggurat.


            INT. ZIGGURAT - SHRINE - DAY


            The shrine is empty.  The woman activates a wearable computing
            device, calling up a schematic of the ziggurat.


            She kneels, studying the floor.  In the corner of the room she
            identifies a particular brick and presses it.  We hear hidden
            COUNTER-WEIGHTS shifting and the floor opens up --


            -- revealing a stone stairway leading down.


            INT. ZIGGURAT - STAIRWAY - DAY


            Dark.  Sepulchral.  Spooky.  The figures descend into --


            INT. ZIGGURAT - BURIAL VAULT - DAY


            -- an empty room with an earthen floor.  The sunlight from
            above barely penetrates down here.  One of the figures takes
            out a battery--powered lantern, turning it on, illuminating --


            -- walls covered with CUNEIFORM WRITING.  The male figure who
            flipped off the sun speaks via radio headset.


                                MALE FIGURE
                     That's great. We've got dick.
                          (turning to the others)
                     Is there any reason we had to embark on
                     this cluster-fuck during the day?


            The woman removes her helmet.  This is DANICA TALOS.  A
            vampire.  Intense, appearing to be in her 30s.  Possessing a
            regal air.  She wears a silver crucifix around her neck.


                                DANICA
                     Night-time's too tricky, Grimwood. You
                     know that.


            One by one, the others remove their helmets.  All vampires:


            GRIMWOOD (30s), a hulking vampire with an imposing physique
            and an even more imposing set of surgical steel teeth/fangs.


            ASHER (4Os), a natural-born leader with easygoing charisma.


            WOLFE (30s), quiet and deliberative.  Right now he's readying
            a portable ground-penetrating radar unit.


            Grimwood studies the writing on the walls.


                                GRIMWOOD
                     What is this chicken-scratch?


                                DANICA
                     Cuneiform. Dates back about four
                     thousand years.


                                GRIMWOOD
                     So why here?


                                DANICA
                     Because this was the cradle of
                     civilization.  He would've been
                     comfortable here.


                                ASHER
                     I don't know, Dan.  Seems like another
                     dead-end.


                                WOLFE
                     I'm not so sure --


            Wolfe looks at his unit, excited.  The others gather round.


                                WOLFE
                     There's something beneath us.


            ON WOLFE'S RADAR UNIT


            We see a cross-section image of the soil and subsurface
            features beneath them.  SOMETHING has been buried down there.


                                ASHER
                     Is that a body --?


            Wolfe makes a few adjustments on the unit.  The image resolves
            further.  It's definitely a BODY.  Then, we hear the low
            RUMBLING of more hidden counter-weights and --


            A SLAB OF STONE


            slides down from above the stairs, sealing off the vault.


                                GRIMWOOD
                     What the fuck --?!


            Grimwood pounds his fist against the stone.  It's solid.  He
            tries to find a hand-hold, tries to shoulder it open in some
            way, but the barrier is unmovable.  They're trapped.


                                ASHER
                     Radio back-up.  See if they can open it
                     from the other --


                                WOLFE (0.S.)
                     Guys?


            Wolfe points at the ground.  A tiny depression has formed,
            with sand funneling into it.


            Wolfe sets his radar unit down and kneels before the hole. 
            The grains of sand are falling faster now, the depression
            gradually widening.  Curious, Wolfe leans closer --


            A CLAWED, ARMORED HAND


            suddenly EXPLODES upward from the ground.  It latches onto
            Wolfe's neck.  dragging him down head-first!


            Wolfe THRASHES, his head still buried beneath the sand.  He
            knocks over the lantern, which FLICKERS, shorting out.


            Asher rushes to Wolfe's side.  Then Grimwood.  They grab Wolfe
            by the shoulders, SCREAMING, trying to pull him back.


            Asher is KICKED by Wolfe's thrashing legs.  He flies upward,
            hits the ceiling, falls back onto the ground, stunned --


            Danica joins Grimwood.  Abruptly, they wrest Wolfe free --
            headless.  BLOOD erupts from the sand.  Then --


            A HELLISH CREATURE


            unearths itself, ROARING.  It's difficult to make out in the
            flickering light.  But what we do see is terrifying.  Spiked,
            demonic armor, clutching a sword.  An elongated, helmeted face
            with a blood-splattered set of hinged fangs -- hinting at an
            inhuman physiognomy within.  The hinged jaws open, coming at
            us.  And just as the lantern goes out for good we --

                                                                  CUT TO:


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - CORRIDOR - NIGHT


            Danica moves down a modern architectural corridor lined in
            glass and steel.  VAMPIRE SOLDIERS stand ready nearby,
            outfitted in body armor, clutching automatic rifles.


            AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR


            Asher, Grirnwood, and another vampire, HENDRIX are gathered by
            a titanium door outfitted with a biometric security system.


            Danica joins them, studying a VIDEO MONITOR which offers a
            darkened view of the interior of the vault.  We can just make
            out a FIGURE sitting there in the shadows.


                                DANICA
                     What's he been doing?


                                ASHER
                     Nothing.  Just sitting there since we
                     brought him here.


                                HENDRIX
                          (nervously)
                     Do you think we've got enough security?


                                DANICA
                     Hendrix, if he wanted to out of there -
                     there isn't an army in the world that
                     could keep us safe.  We didn't capture
                     him.  He allowed us to take him in.  You
                     understand?
                          (nodding to the door)
                     Now open up.


            The others look at her like she's insane.  Nevertheless,
            Danica places her hand on the biometric scanner.  Hendrix keys
            in a series of commands on a nearby computer console.  The
            vault doors open with a HUM, allowing Danica into --


            AN AIRLOCK-STYLE VESTIBULE


            She steps inside.  The vault closes behind her.  We hear
            BLOWERS as the air is cycled.  A SECOND SET OF DOORS open --


            INT. VAMPIRE SAFE HOUSE - CELL - NIGHT


            Danica steps into a nearly pitch-black "clean room".  We hear
            BREATHING.  Despite her calm demeanor, she's frightened.


            From the darkness, SOMEONE SPEAKS -- a voice low and rumbling,
            laced with an ominous gravity.


                                VOICE (O.S.)
                     Why have you woken me?


                                DANICA
                     Your people need you, Sire.


            She kneels, bowing her head.


                                VOICE (0.S.)
                          (mocking)
                     "My people".  You think I'm your messiah?
                     Your Savior?


            We hear MOVEMENT.  A pair of RED EYES pierce the gloom -- and
            God help us, even though he remains partially shadowed, this
            guy has to be the scariest mother-fucker we've ever seen.


                                VOICE
                     What makes you think I wanted to be
                     brought back?


            A hand emerges from the darkness, armored.  Danica wants to
            bolt.  Instead, she fights to keep herself from flinching as a
            taloned finger brushes her throat.


                                DANICA
                     Times have changed.  Science has made
                     great strides.  Your blood, the sacrament
                     you provide -- it can set us free now.


                                VOICE
                     I see.  And the one I killed earlier?  He
                     was vampire?
                          (off her nod)
                     You must forgive me.  It had been
                     centuries since I last fed.


                                DANICA
                     I understand.


                                VOICE
                     Then offer yourself to me, child --
                          (lifting her chin)
                     -- and let me quench my thirst again.


            INT. VAMPIRE SAFE HOUSE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT


            WHOOSH!  The vault doors open and Danica stumbles out, all but
            falling into Asher's arms.  She's bone-white and there are
            fresh BITE MARKS on her throat, BLOOD staining her shirt.


                                ASKER
                     Danica!  Are you alright --?!


            She nods, shaking, struggling to recompose herself.


                                DANICA
                     Let him out -- he wants to see what's
                     become of his world.


                                                                  CUT TO:


            A VIDEO MONITOR


            LARRY KING launching into the intro of his show.


                                LARRY
                     Tonight, Dr. Edgar Vance, forensic
                     psychiatrist and author of the New York
                     Times best seller "Human Health: The Whole
                     Being Breakthrough".  Also with us is
                     Martin Vreede, Chief of Police.  They're
                     here for an hour and they'll take your
                     calls.  Next on Larry King Live.


            INT. LARRY KING LIVE - STUDIO - NIGHT


            Taping is underway.  Larry King sits at his desk opposite
            EDGAR VANCE (40s), a smooth-talking pundit with a magnetic
            demeanor and movie star good looks.  CHIEF MARTIN VREEDE (50s,
            square-jawed), joins via remote feed.


                                LARRY
                     Dr. Vance -- you're a psychiatrist and a
                     biochemist, isn't that right?


                                VANCE
                     Yes.  I've long believed that in order to
                     achieve true health, we have to reconcile
                     the body and the mind.  Of course that
                     also requires letting go of a lot of our
                     old notions and superstitions, which is
                     what my work is all about.


                                LARRY
                     Let's talk about that.  How do you account
                     for the fascination with things that go
                     bump in the night?  Movies, books,
                     videogames -- seems like we can't get
                     enough of our boogeymen?


            Vance leans forward, skillfully playing to the cameras.


                                VANCE
                     Monsters provide a means for us to
                     transfer our more primal and darker urges
                     into something external.  In the case of
                     vampires, you're dealing with taboo issues
                     like predatory rage and sexual sadism. 
                     These are scary subjects for people to own

                     So we pass the buck to someone else?


                                VANCE
                     Exactly.  Historically, people suffering
                     from medical conditions have always been
                     our psychological scapegoats.  In the
                     Middle Ages schizophrenia was often
                     attributed to demonic possession.


                                LARRY
                     And vampires?


                                VANCE
                     Well, there's a hereditary blood disease
                     known as porphyria that has symptoms
                     remarkably similar to the classic vampiric
                     traits.  People suffering from this
                     disease are anemic, they become sensitive
                     to sunlight, they can't tolerate garlic --


                                LARRY
                     Which is too bad, since my doctor tells me
                     that's good for the heart.
                          (turning to Chief Vreede)
                     Chief Vreede?  What's your take on all the
                     recent rumors we've been hearing about
                     vampires?


                                VREEDE
                     The only vampires I'm worried about are
                     the ones passing the bar exam.
                          (laughing)
                     Seriously, if vampires existed, don't you
                     think we'd be on to them by now?  The
                     truth is, our streets have never been
                     safer.  Homicides, assaults -- violent
                     crime is down across the board.  If people
                     want to be concerned, they should focus on
                     criminals like Blade.


                                LARRY
                     Now who's this?  Tell me about him.


                                VREEDE
                     He's a sociopath we've been pursuing.


                                VANCE
                     Blade is a very disturbed individual. 
                     Even the name he's chosen for himself is
                     troubling.  According to witnesses, he
                     operates under the belief that a vast
                     conspiracy of vampires live amongst us. 
                     You have to look at the psychiatric
                     underpinnings here.  What does a person
                     like Blade really want? 
                     Odds are, he's really trying to work out
                     some kind of inner trauma.  He thinks he's
                     slaying monsters, but he's really trying
                     to murder aspects of himself.


            The sound of GUNFIRE pre-laps over from the next scene as we --


                                                                  CUT TO:


            EXT. MACHINE SHOP/PARKING LOT - NIGHT


            -- a MASSIVE EXPLOSION ripping through an industrial building. 
            Banks of windows BLOW OUTWARDS, FIRE ROlLS, brick walls
            CRUMBLE, raining debris everywhere.


            A SCREAMING, BURNING MAN


            goes tumbling into the night air.  Buoyed by the explosion,
            his body flies upward, trailing fire like a human comet.


            MORE MEN (VAMPIRES) race out, some of them on fire.


            CLOSER


            as a FORMIDABLE FIGURE resolves out of the swirling flames. 
            It's Blade, striding towards us in slow-motion, body bristling
            with weapons, the exaggerated sounds of his FOOTFALLS ringing
            out like drums of doom.


            He looks like the God of War.  WHOOSH!  We ramp back up to
            real-time.  Then faster as --


            -- a TRIO OF VAMPIRE LOW-LIFES (STONE, GEDGE, and CAMPBELL)
            run for their lives towards their vehicles.  TWO MODIFIED
            STREET RACING CARS are pulling out; a Mustang and an Eagle
            Talon.  Gedge is climbing into the Talon even as it starts to
            move, pulling the door shut.  At the same time --


            -- Stone and Campbell climb atop two stretched and lowered
            hardtail chopper cycles.  Blade starts forward, drawing two of
            his custom MACH pistols, but --


            --	the Mustang comes SCREAMING IN REVERSE TOWARDS him!


            Blade makes a SUPER-HUMAN LEAP over the speeding car. 
            Momentarily upside down, he FIRES through the windshield and
            engine block as he flips.  Within the car, the vampires ASH.
            The Mustang EXPLODES.  flipping over and --


            --	Blade, now facing frontward again, continues to FIRE as he
            lands, aiming at --


            THE TALON AND THE CHOPPERS,


            which haul ass out of the parking lot, swerving into the
            traffic on the street beyond.


            Blade KEEPS FIRING until he's out of bullets.  Then --


                                ELLINGSON (O.S.)
                     No more bullets, Blade?  Guess it's time
                     for you to fall down and go boom.


            FOUR STRANDED VAMPIRES,


            from the conflagration, their clothes still smoking, surround
            Blade.  Call them EMOND, DOH, DENLINGER, and ELLINGSON.


            Blade holsters his MACH pistols.  Then reaches for a wicked
            looking CHAIN-KNIFE strapped to his thigh.  The knife has a
            button on either side of the hilt.  As Ellingson RUSHES him --


            -- Blade triggers the first button.  ZZZING!  The knife-blade
            ejects from the hilt, trailing outward six feet on a razored
            chain.  The blade penetrates Ellingson's chest.  He GASPS as
            he starts to ASH.  But before his disintegration is complete --


            -- Blade hits the second button.  The knife-blade retracts,
            the razored chain WHIRRING back into the knife-hilt.  Blade
            SPINS, triggers the first button again --


            The knife-blade FLIES OUT, the razored chain whipping around
            Denlinger's throat.  Blade tugs.  The razor chain cuts through
            Denlinoer's neck, decapitates him. As he ASHES --


            -- Blade triggers the knife again.  As it ejects, he whirls it
            over his head, making a sound like a BULL-ROARER.


            Blade drops low, swinging the razored chain.  The chain slices
            through Emond's legs.  Emond's amputated legs ASH, the rest of
            him tumbling onto the asphalt.  He SCREAMS.


            Blade retracts the knife-blade, whirls, THRUSTS it through
            Doh's abdomen. who was coming up from behind.  As Doh ASHES,
            Blade returns to Emond, finishing him off --


            -- and Blade is on the move again, RUSHING after the vampires
            who escaped.


            EXT. STREET - OVERPASS - NIGHT


            The bike-riding vamps cut across traffic, then SCREAM down an
            on-ramp to a busy street below.


            BACK TO BLADE,


            sprinting from the parking lot to the sidewalk.  He touches a
            hand to his ear.  We SEE a tiny receiver tucked within.


                                BLADE
                     Whistler!  I'm on the Stonebridge
                     overpass at Clemons --


                                WHISTLER'S VOICE
                     Got it!  Heading eastbound, I'm just
                     beneath you --


            Blade dodges past a HONKING car, stepping onto and over the
            trunk, then leaps atop the safety rail of the overpass as --


            A BIG-RIG CAB


            hauling a semi-trailer THUNDERS beneath the overpass, sounding
            its AIR HORN.  It has safety cables running along the
            perimeter of the trailer roof, like an aircraft carrier.


                                WHISTLER'S VOICE
                     -- GO!!!


            EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT


            Blade LAUNCHES HIMSELF into the air.  He lands atop the semi,
            then tumbles, nearly slipping off the edge as he --


            -- snags one of the safety cables atop the trailer!  He
            dangles above the asphalt then SWINGS himself into the open
            back of the trailer.  We HOLD for a beat, then hear the
            THUNDERCLAP of a high-performance ENGINE turning over as --


            BLADE'S MATTE-BLACK DODGE CHARGER


            ROCKETS out of the back of the trailer, sailing right over a
            car that was tail-gating the semi, heading into three lanes of
            on-coming traffic at fifty miles an hour!


            Blade hits the brakes, sending the battle-scarred muscle car
            into a spin, clipping other vehicles in the process.


            INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT


            As cars continue to brake and COLLIDE around him, Blade puts
            the pedal to the metal once again.  The Charger accelerates,
            tachometer red-lining as Blade pulls alongside the cab of the
            big-rig, catching a glimpse of --


            WHISTLER BEHIND THE WHEEL


            Whistler grins, gives Blade a little salute and --


            --	Blade reaches between the seats, ACTIVATING the newly
            installed nitrous oxide fuel-injection system.


            EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT


            Hyper-speed.  The Charger jets forward as the NOS nitrous
            system boosts the car's speed by another 300 HP, leaving any
            and everything in its dust.  In seconds, it has caught up to --


            STONE AND CAMPBELL


            They draw TEC-9s, FIRING back at Blade.  The bullet-proof
            windshield holds as do the kevlar body panels protecting the
            engine -- but the rounds chew the shit out of the bodywork.


            INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT


            Blade gives his car another jolt of nitrous.  The Charger
            SURGES FORWARD as Stone and Campbell fall back, veering to
            either side.  Now Blade is ahead of them.  He checks their
            position in his rear-view mirror, then stands on the brakes --


            EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT


            The Charger drops from a hundred to fifty in a heart beat,
            causing Stone and Campbell to rear-end Blade.


            The vamps are ejected over the handle bars of their bikes like
            crash-test dummies.  Stone SMASHES through Blade's back
            windshield, continuing into the front seat--


            -- while Campbell tumbles over Blade's roof and across his
            hood, somehow managing to cling to one of the windshield
            wipers at the last minute.


            INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT


            Blade clutches the wheel.  He's got a HOWLING vampire in the
            front seat, upside down, covered in windshield fragments and
            another perched on his hood, obscuring his vision.


            Stone tries to right himself, clawing at Blade.  Blade
            struggles, keeping one hand on the wheel while he --


            --	reaches for a shotgun secured between the seats.  He
            FIRES.  As the vampire ASHES, Blade hits a button on the dash. 
            The passenger door opens, spills Stone onto the road --


            EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT


            -- right into the path of an oncoming bus!  WHAM!  Stone is
            ground to paste and --


            INT. TOUR BUS - NIGHT


            TOURISTS, mostly elderly.  The passengers are jolted in their
            seats as the wheels of the bus KA-THUMP over Stone's remains --


                                OLD WOMAN
                     I hope that wasn't a dog.


            INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT


            -- and we're back in Blade's Charger as Campbell continues to
            HAMMER away at the windshield.  The windshield spiderwebs. 
            Campbell manages to get a clawed hand through --


            Blade swings his shotgun over, shoving it in Campbell's
            snarling mouth.  He pulls the trigger --


            BOOM!  Campbell's CINDER-REMAINS blow over the cracked
            windshield.  Blade hits the wipers, spritzes window cleaner -
            but the mess turns to ashen sludge.  making the view worse!


            EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT


            The Talor is up ahead, weaving in and out of traffic. 
            Fighting to see, Blade accelerates, gaining ground --


            The VAMPIRE DRIVER leans out of his own wihdow, looking back
            at Blade, FIRING an AUTOMATIC PISTOL --


            INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT


            Blade's windshield, already weakened by Campbell, SHATTERS,
            blowing glass fragments all over him.  Undaunted, Blade calmly
            reaches for his dash, hitting a button labeled "UV".


            EXT. BUSY STREET/BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT


            Roof-mounted UV DAYLIGHTS come on, bathing the car ahead and


            (more importantly) the vampire driver with UV LIGHT!


            The vampire at the wheel SHRIEKS, ASHES, leaving the car


            driverless.  Gedge tries to lean over and take the wheel --


            INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT


            BURNING REMAINS blow back at us.  Then the view clears and --


            EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT


            --	Blade SLAMS his charger into the Talon.  The cars briefly
            lock, grinding SPARKS.  Then they disengage.  Blade jerks his
            steering wheel, gives the Talon ANOTHER SLAM.


            The Talon hits the curb, riding halfway up onto a sidewalk,
            PLOWING DOWN newspaper vending machines and table-top displays
            piled with cheap wares, then a phone booth, a food cart. 
            PEDESTRIANS duck for cover and --


            -- the Talon gets some serious air, ROLLING onto its side as
            it comes back to earth.


            EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT


            --WK-KRUNCH-- the wreck skids to a stop against a streetlight.
            The streetlight CREAKS, CRASHES DOWN on the wreck.  BYSTANDERS
            gather, murmuring amongst themselves --


            Gedge drags his bleeding body from the wrecked Talon.  He
            staggers to his feet, clutching a pistol, limps away --


            BLADE'S CHARGER


            pulls up.  Blade climbs out, shotgun in hand.  The shotgun has
            an under-mounted stake launcher.  Blade FIRES at --


            -- Gedge.  The stake hits him in the back.  KNOCKING him onto
            the street.  Bystanders SCREAM, falling back, taking cover --


            Blade approaches, puzzled.  Gedge is still alive, LAUGHING. 
            He looks at Blade, eyes crazed, flashing his fangs.


                                BLADE
                     Staked you with silver.  Why aren't you
                     ash?


            Gedge coughs blood, struggles to speak:


                                GEDGE
                     Why aren't you smarter?  Not a vampire,
                     dumbshit -- set your sorry ass up --


            Gedge tugs at his fangs.  They're fake, PROSTHETIC.  Gedge is
            looking past Blade.  Blade turns, looking up --


            A ROOFTOP ABOVE


            Danica is perched there.  She backs into the shadows.  But
            Blade doesn't have time to investigate because --


            --	POLICE SIRENS are drawing near.  Blade retreats to his
            charger.  He GUNS it, speeding away as we --


            CUT TO:


            EXT. BLADE AND WHISTLER'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT


            Blade's Charger pulls up to a boat house at the water's edge. 
            Blade climbs out, disappears inside.


                                WHISTLER (O.S.)
                     What the fuck happened tonight?


            INT. BLADE AND WHISTLER'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT


            New digs.  Built into the decaying boat house, retrofitted for
            Blade's combat needs.  Blade is taking off his body armor,
            tossing weapons onto a work table.  He's frustrated.


                                BLADE
                     How should I know?  He was human.


            Whistler reaches for a bottle of whiskey, takes a sip.


                                WHISTLER
                     You've been getting careless, Blade.  You
                     kill a vampire, they ash, don't leave any
                     proof of their existence.  But something
                     like this, a human corpse, it's messy --
                          (shaking his head)

                                REPORTER
                          (on-screen)
                     That was just a taste of the mayhem that
                     occurred during tonight's brazen shoot-out
                     that left at least four people dead.  Now
                     apparently an anonymous citizen captured
                     the whole event on video --


            The IMAGE FREEZES.  We hear the clatter of KEYBOARD KEYS as we
            pan over to an adjacent computer monitor where a series of
            VIDEO CAPTURES of the event flash by us in slide-show mode.


            AGENT RAY CUMBLERLAND studies the screen.  Ray is a career
            agent.  Dedicated and dogged to the point of annoyance,
            utterly humorless.  His office is cramped and institutional,
            devoid of any personal touches.  It's also overflowing with
            files, photographs, and charts concerning Blade and Whistler.


            A BULLETIN BOARD


            features numerous surveillance photos of Blade and Whistler in
            action, along with various news clippings and two WANTED
            POSTERS ("UNLAWFUL FLIGHT TO AVOID PROSECUTION - MURDER,
            AGGRAVATED KIDNAPPING, ARMED VIOLENCE").  Most of the photos
            are blurry and indistinct -- akin to snaps taken of Bigfoot.


                                HALE (O.S.)
                     Ray!  Heard we've got a lead!


            WILSON HALE (20s), Ray's subordinate, rushes in, excited.  Ray
            stands, ripping down a photo of Blade and Whistler.


                                CUMBERLAND
                     Book us a flight, Hale.  Time to take
                     these cowboys down.

            CUT TO:


            INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY


            Whistler is buying a pack of cigarettes when he notices	--


            A BLACK AND WHITE TABLOID


            on display nearby.  The cover story features a BLURRY PHOTO of
            Blade's recent melee with the vampires.


            Whistler picks up the tabloid, studying it.  Next to the photo
            is an ARTIST'S SKETCH OF BLADE.  The headline reads: "GUN
            TOTING PSYCHOPATH CAPTURED ON FILM!"


            Whistler nods to the CASHIER, hands over some more cash.


                                WHISTLER
                     I'll take this too.


            EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY


            Whistler exits the store, perusing the tabloid as he walks. 
            We hear the WHIR of a camera's HIGH-SPEED MOTOR DRIVE and --


            A SERIES OF DIGITAL SHOTS


            capture Whistler as he moves down the sidewalk.


            ANGLE ON AN FBI AGENT


            perched on a nearby roof, taking surveillance photos.


                                FBI AGENT
                     Subject is heading West.


            WHIP-PAN to a parked CAR, Cumberland and Hale seated within.


                                CUMBERLAND
                     Got him.


            Cumberland starts the car, starts following Whistler.


                                WHISTLER (0.S.)
                     Congratulations.  You're famous.  Just
                     what we needed.


            INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - DAY


            CLOSE ON the tabloid as Whistler slaps it down on a workbench. 
            WIDEN to include Whistler and Blade.


                                WHISTLER
                     Somebody screwed us.  Your face is all
                     over the papers, the television.  Media's
                     eating it up.


                                BLADE
                     Like I care?


                                WHISTLER
                     You should.  Something like this --
                          (gesturing to the tabloid)
                     -- taking out a human, even one working
                     for the vampires -- far as the rest of the
                     world's concerned, you're public enemy
                     number one.


                                BLADE
                     Didn't realize this was a popularity
                     contest.


            Whistler shakes his head, frustrated.


                                WHISTLER
                     Damnit, Blade, don't you see what's
                     happening?!  The fuckers are finally
                     getting smart.  They're waging a goddamn
                     PR campaign.  Now it's not just vampires
                     we have to worry about, we're gonna have
                     to take on the rest of the world too.
                          (beat, adamant)
                     They've got us on the run.  These last few
                     months we've barely been staying ahead of
                     the curve.


                                BLADE
                     You worry too much, old man.


                                WHISTLER
                     I've been doing this since before you were
                     born, Blade.  The moment you stop
                     worrying, you're dead.


            Then Whistler's face softens for a moment.


                                WHISTLER
                     Since the day I found you, you've been
                     like a son to me.  I taught you everything
                     I know.
                          (beat)
                     But I'm tired.  You understand?

             EXT. INNER CITY STREET - NIGHT


            It's rush hour and the streets are choked with traffic. 
            PEOPLE mill past on the crowded sidewalk.


            We move from face to face, capturing brief portraits of
            working-class desperation -- an OVERWEIGHT GUY, a PAIR OF
            HOMELESS TEENAGERS, an ASIAN VENDOR, a STREETWALKER.


                                VOICE (O.S)
                     How about that one?


                                SECOND VOICE (O.S.)
                     No fatties.  They taste like Cheetos.


                                THIRD VOICE (O.S.)
                     What about that shrunken apple-head
                     beeyatch-a-saurus over there?


                                VOICE (O.S.)
                     Fucking blow me, man!


            We hear LAUGHTER and we WHIP-PAN over to a grimy office
            building, ZIPPING UP the face of it to --


            A ROOFTOP PARKING STRUCTURE


            A SKATE-PUNK (SQUID) gets some air, flipping his board up into
            a nice Ollie backside grab, then scoots over to --


            -- THREE MORE PUNKS perched on a concrete ledge, watching the
            people below them.  They are: PROOF, FLICK and DINGO.  All in
            their teens, sporting copious piercings and tattoos.  Flick
            wears a ratty T-shirt from "The Lost Boys" movie.


                                DINGO
                     C'mon, just pick one.


                                PROOF
                     Once you buy a prize, it's yours and
                     yours to keep.


            They keep looking.  Then, Flick suddenly points, excited --


                                FLICK
                     Got it, got it!  Baby on board!


            ANGLE ON A MOUSY WOMAN (ABIGAIL)


            moving below, her figure camouflaged beneath layers of
            clothing.  She's in her 20s, lugging a NEWBORN in a BabyBjorn
            carrier that's strapped to her chest, clutching a bag of
            groceries in either hand.  She looks a little haggard.


            As we watch, she reaches an elevated rail station entrance.


            BACK TO THE SKATE-PUNKS


            Dingo nods and smiles approvingly.


                                DINGO
                     Looks like we got ourselves a combo meal.


            EXT. ELEVATED RAIL STATION - VARIOUS - NIGHT


            A series of shots as Abigail makes her way into the station,


            passing a few other PEOPLE here and there.


            INT. ELEVATED RAIL PLATFORM - NIGHT


            A depressing, dimly lit, partially open-air station.  Abigail
            moves out onto the platform, which is now deserted.  She
            glances around, a bit nervous, and finally sits on a bench.


            Beat.  Just the wind MOANING in the tunnels, across the
            platform.  Then we hear a RUSTLING SOUND --


            Abigail looks right, sees nothing.  We hear ANOTHER SOUND,
            this time from the left --


            Abigail looks up, briefly glimpsing a FIGURE ducking behind a
            concrete pillar.


            Unnerved, she stands, moving a protective hand over her baby. 
            She backs up a few steps, trying to look around the pillar --


            -- but no one is there.  Then a SHADOW MOVES behind her.  She
            SENSES it, spinning --


            -- but again, she seems to be alone.  Thoroughly frightened
            now, Abigail scoops up her grocery bags, turns to exit and --


            -- slams right into Dingo and Proof!  She GASPS.


                                DINGO
                     Hey, pretty lady.


                                PROOF
                     Sophisticated mama.


            Dingo and Proof reveal their fangs.  Abigail SCREAMS, runs --


            -- right into the arms of Flick and Squid!  They grab her,
            RIPPING the BabyBjorn carrier from her chest, SHOVING her back
            at Dingo and Proof.


            In seconds, Dingo and Proof have Abigail on the floor. 
            They're tearing away at her clothing, LAUGHING.


                                DINGO
                     Scream if this hurts, chica!


            ON FLICK,


            removing the BABY from its carrier.  He holds the baby up -
            only it's not a baby.  It's a DOLL with the words "FUCK YOU!"
            written on its chest.  Flick is briefly confused --


            -- and then the baby doll EXPLODES, covering Flick's face with
            a cloud of GARLIC GAS!


            Flick recoils, retching, wiping at his burning face --


                                FLICK
                     --aghhk -- it's fucking garlic!


            ON DINGO AND PROOF,


            looking back, alarmed.  Then Abigail pulls her knee to her
            chest.  A SILVER SPIKE springs out from the toe of her boot.


            She KICKS UP, imbedding the spike up through the underside of
            Proof's chin.  Proof ASHES.


            Before Dingo has a chance to act, Abigail gets him in a
            leglock, FLIPPING him back onto his ass.


            ABIGAIL


            jumps to her feet, shedding her coat and hat.  Long tresses of
            hair spill around her shoulders.  She's not mousy at all.  In
            fact, she's beautiful.  And cut like an Olympic athlete.  And
            equipped with a walking arsenal of weapons.


            Dingo SNARLS -- CRUNCH!  Abigail plants her heel in his face,
            SMASHING IN his nose.  She does a cartwheel, KICKS him again.
            Follows that with flurry of PUNCHES.  He goes down as --


            -- Flick and Squid come charging!  Squid gets her in a CHOKE
            HOLD.  She FLIPS him over her shoulder, KICKING him in the
            nuts as he lands.  He curls up, GROANING --


            Abigail turns back to Flick, ELBOWING him in the throat --


            -- then returns to Squid, ejecting a SILVER THROWING KNIFE
            from a spring-loaded, automated dispenser strapped to her
            wrist.  She POPs the knife through Squid's chest.  He ASHES --


            FOLLOWING ABIGAIL


            as she reaches behind her, removing a CRESCENT-SHAPED DEVICE
            secured to her back.  She holds the crescent in the center,
            the curve pointing away from her, gives it a twist and --


            CHINKT!  The device extends from either end, telescoping
            outward into a three-foot long metal arc.  Connecting the two
            ends of the arc is a powerful, BUZZING UV LASER.


            Abigail LASHES OUT, lopping off Flick's arm.  His arm falls,
            ASHING.  Abigail swings the arc around, pushing it forward
            through Flick's mid-section like a cheese cutter --


            Flick literally falls apart, his upper torso sliding from his
            trunk, ASHING in the foreground, his burning particles falling
            away to reveal Abigail in the background --


            Dingo scrambles to his feet, running for his life.


            Abigail gives her UV arc a twist.  It retracts.  She secures
            it behind her back once again, unholsters a strange-looking
            "bloop" GUN with a large barrel.  She FIRES --


            A rapidly-expanding spherule of ANTI-PERSONNEL FOAM splatters
            against Dingo's legs, hardening instantly, tripping him up --


            Dingo goes down again.  He panics, trying to scrape the gunk
            off his legs, manages to get one of his hands stuck to the
            hardening mess in the process -- like a mouse in a glue-trap.


            Abigail calmly approaches.  She stands over Dingo, staring
            down at him with a look of cruel indifference.  She holsters
            her bloop gun, withdraws another SILVER STAKE --


                                ABIGAIL
                     Scream if this hurts, chica.


            -- and SLAMS the stake into his chest.


            WIDEN OUT


            Abigail turns, surveying her work.  The ashen remains of the
            vampires are popping and crackling like campfire embers.  In
            thirty-seven seconds she's managed to eliminate them all.


            A train approaches, pulls into the station.  PASSENGERS
            disembark, flood the platform.  They tramp all over the ashes
            of the vampires, completely unaware of the recent slaughter.


            Abigail walks against the stream of traffic, boards the train. 
            She is the sole passenger as the train pulls away.


            INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - WHISTLER'S ROOM - NIGHT	


            Whistler sits on a cot, contemplating the tarnished wedding
            ring on his hand.  He slowly spins it around his finger.


            INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BLADE'S ROOM - NIGHT


            Blade sits before a small Buddhist shrine, meditating. 
            Incense burns.  His sword rests in a ceremonial holder.  Near
            silence punctuated by the intermittent ocean swell outside.


            CLOSE ON BLADE'S FACE


            We hear the SOUNDS OF VIOLENCE -- ECHOING SCREAMS, GUNSHOTS. 
            These are Blade's thoughts.  The inner demons he is constantly
            trying to tame.  The sounds CRESCENDO and --


            --	Blade opens his eyes.  He listens.  Something is wrong.


            INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT


            Blade creeps into the outer room, sword drawn.


            NOISE behind him, turns to see --


            WHISTLER


            standing in the shadows, clutching a handgun.


                                WHISTLER
                     What is it?


                                BLADE
                     What you've been worrying about.


            They listen.  Just the sound of the ocean swell.  Then --


            A WINDOW SHATTERS


            TWO ARMORED SWAT AGENTS lower in on rappelling lines. 


            TWO MORE AGENTS


            CRASH through a bank of windows on either side, swinging in. 
            They FIRE cannisters of TEAR GAS.  As Blade moves to engage
            them, Whistler RUSHES into the heart of the armory --


            A reinforced door EXPLODES inward.  MORE AGENTS storm inside. 


            FROM THE WATER,


            a military Zodiac (inflatable boat) roars up one of the wooden
            boat ramps, laden with gun-toting AGENTS.  They jump out,
            fanning all over the boat house.


            He hears a


                                AGENT
                     On the floor!  ON THE FLOOR!


            Whistler FIRES at them, then makes a run for it.  The agents
            RETURN FIRE, but Whistler ducks behind a concrete pillar --


            EXT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT


            Cop cruisers, unmarked cars, and SWAT trucks sweep in, SIRENS
            blaring, disgorging a small army of POLICE and FBI AGENTS.
            POLICE BOATS are pulling up to the dock.


            AGENTS CUMBERLAND AND HALE


            emerge from an unmarked, wearing bullet-proof vests,
            brandishing firearms.  Cumberland barks orders into a radio.


                                CUMBERLAND
                     Lock it down!  Keep them contained!


            On the rooftops above, various SWAT SNIPERS take position.


            INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT


            Blade BRAWLS with a half-dozen agents, sending them flying in
            all directions.  He grabs one agent, HEAD-BUTTS him, THROWS
            him into the path of two others --


            Then he reaches for another, THROWING him THROUGH a window at
            the rear, out into the river which runs below --


            ON WHISTLER


            as he moves with increased urgency.  The armory is filling up
            with tear gas.  Coughing and half-blind, he hurries to a bank
            of computers, types in a series of commands --


            THE VARIOUS COMPUTER MONITORS


            around him synch up, showing the same protocol message:


                            Data protection routine enabled


                          --	Server 1 protection enabled...


                          --	Server 2 protection enabled...


            In response, a rack of network storage equipment and removable
            hard drives EXPLODES.  Then a second rack of equipment
            EXPLODES as well.


            EXT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT


            From their vantage point below, Cumberland and the others can
            hear the explosions. Cumberland is on his radio, SHOUTING:


                                CUMBERLAN D
                     What's going on in there?


                                AGENT'S VOICE
                          (over radio)
                     Some kind of self-destruct program!
                     They're fragging their hard drives!


            INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT


            Whistler keeps moving.  An agent gets a clear shot at him,
            FIRES -- Whistler is hit in the chest.


            Blade SEES Whistler take the hit, but he's cut off from the
            old man, being swarmed by agents --


                                BLADE
                     WHISTLER!


            Whistler staggers, keeps moving.  He makes it to another bank
            of computers, launches the same protocol.


            ON MORE MONITORS


            Erasing information, purging themselves.  We see commands:


                         --	Workstation 1 protection enabled


                         --	Workstation 2 protection enabled


            With each successive command, the workstations themselves
            begin self-destructing, EXPLODING one after another.


            Another agent gets a bead on Whistler, FIRING a round into
            Whistler's thigh.  Whistler SCREAMS --


            ON BLADE,


            in anguish as he sees his mentor being slaughtered.  Then two
            agents are RUSHING HIM, tackling Blade.  As one they fall
            backwards, into another bank of windows --


            EXT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT


            CRASH!  The three of them come FLYING DOWN in a spray of
            glass, landing atop one of the police cruisers below.  The
            roof buckles under their weight, windows SHATTERING --


                                CUMBERLAND
                     Take him down!


            An FBI AGENT raises a CODA net gun atop his shoulder, taking
            aim.  BA-BANG!  Four projectiles expand out from the barrel,
            carrying a STEEL NET which has been strung between them.


            The netting hits Blade, wrapping around him, restricting his
            movements.  Immediately, a small army of agents DIVE on top of
            him, PUMMELING AWAY, trying to beat him into submission --


            INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT


            On the verge of losing consciousness, Whistler props himself
            against a piece of machinery.  He's bleeding, been shot to
            hell.  One of his hands is closed, clutching something.


            Agents warily close in around him, guns raised.


                                AGENT
                     Move a finger and you're dead.


                                WHISTLER
                          (flipping them off)
                     How 'bout this one?


            Whistler lets his other hand uncurl. He's got a REMOTE in his
            palm, with a tiny digital timer counting-down.


                                AGENT #2
                     He's got something in his--


            00:03.  00:02.  00:01.  The timer reaches zero.


            A SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS


            rock the workshop, knocking the agents back.


            EXT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT


            CLOUDS OF FIRE and FLAMING DEBRIS MUSHROOM OUTWARD, catching
            all unawares, sweeping them up off their feet with a hurricane
            force.  In the midst of the conflagration --


            -- Blade briefly manages to tear free of his captors --


                                BLADE
                     WHISTLER!!!


            -- but the wall of FIRE and LIGHT is rushing onward, sweeping
            up everything in its path, turning the world to white.


            INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT


            FADE IN.  We are CLOSE ON Blade's perspiration-beaded face.
            His eyelids flutter as he slowly regains consciousness.


                                CUMBERLAND (O.S.)
                     Rise and shine, sleepyhead.


            PULL BACK.  We are in a room with a one-way mirrored window. 
            Blade sits, hands cuffed behind him, BRIGHT LIGHTS shining
            down on him.  He looks disoriented, battered.  Very weak.


            Cumberland and Hale are sitting across from Blade.


                                BLADE
                     Who --?


                                CUMBERLAND
                     Special Agents Ray Cumberland and Wilson
                     Hale, FBI.  We've been tracking you for a
                     long time.


                                BLADE
                     Whistler --


                                HALE
                     Dead.  Just like all of your victims.


            Blade shuts his eyes -- as if he could just wish them away.


                                CUMBERLAND
                     How many people have you killed?  Thirty?
                     Forty?  A hundred?


                                BLADE
                     Those were familiars -- people who worked
                     for them --


                                CUMBERLAND
                     And by "them" you mean vampires, right?
                     I suppose next you'll be telling us that
                     Bigfoot's in on the conspiracy too? So
                     what kills these bloodsu~kers, tough guy? 
                     Maybe you can give us some pointers.
                          (counting on his ringers)
                     You can stake 'em, right?  Then there's
                     sunlight -- what about crosses, Wilson? 
                     Do those still work?


                                HALE
                     I don't know, Ray.  What if a vampire's
                     Jewish?


                                CUMBERLAND
                     That's a good point.  And does garlic work
                     on a Hindu vampire?  Or do you need
                     saffron or something?


            Hale laughs.  Cumberland shakes his head, his smile fading.


                                CUMBERLAND
                     You can keep doing your song and dance as
                     long as you want, Blade, but it's not
                     going to play.  You're a stone-cold
                     killer.  And you're sick as fuck.


                                VANCE (O.S.)
                     Let's leave the diagnosis to the
                     professionals.


            ANGLE ON DR. EDGAR VANCE,


            standing in the doorway.  He's the man we saw on Larry King.
            He takes a seat by Blade, sets a leather case on a table.


                                VANCE
                     Hello, Blade.  My name is Doctor Vance.
                     I'm with the Department of Mental Health.
                     I've been charged with conducting a
                     psychiatric evaluation of you.
                          (to Cumberland and Hale)
                     Gentleman, would you mind giving us a few
                     moments alone?


            Cumberland nods.  They rise, exiting the room.  Vance smiles,
            trying to project a sympathetic air.


                                VANCE
                     I imagine this must be very frightening
                     for you.  But I want you to know that I'm
                     here to help.  In order to do that,
                     however, I need to ask you some questions.
                          (beat)
                     Now.  Can you tell me what day it is?


            Blade just stares daggers at Vance.


                                VANCE
                     What about the President?  Do you know
                     who's in the White House at the moment?


                                BLADE
                     An ass-hole.


                                VANCE
                          (sighing)
                     Alright then, let's talk about vampires --
                     what can you tell me about that?


            INT. POLICE STATION - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT


            On the other side of the mirror, Cumberland and Hale have
            joined Chief Vreede.  We hear Blade and Vance via speakers:


                                BLADE
                     There's nothing to tell.  They exist.


                                VANCE
                     And are you one of them?


            INT.	POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT


            Vance sits forward, drawing closer.


                                VANCE
                     What about blood?   When you drink it, do
                     you find yourself sexually aroused?


            Blade just glares at Vance.


                                VANCE
                     You see, it strikes me that this business
                     of vampirism has strong connotations of
                     sexual confusion.  Bodily fluids being
                     exchanged, that sort of thing.  You have
                     to ask where that comes from.  I'm
                     wondering, for instance, what your
                     relationship was like with your mother.
                     Were the two of you close?


            Blade glares.  If he escapes, he's going to kill this guy.


            INT. POLICE STATION - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT


            Dr. Vance steps into the observation room, joining Chief
            Vreede, Cumberland, and Hale.


                                VREEDE
                     What's your assessment, Doctor?


                                VANCE
                     He's psychotic, with paranoid features,
                     possessing dangerous levels of sociopathy. 
                     He's exhibiting disorganized behavior.  He
                     obviously doesn't have a properly formed
                     conscience --
                          (spreading his hands)
                     For his safety and the public's, I'm
                     recommending that he be transferred to
                     County Psychiatric for further treatment.


                                CUMBERLAND
                     That's unacceptable.  This man's wanted in
                     connection with a laundry list of federal
                     crimes.  I need him on a plane to the
                     Detention Center in Washington tonight.


                                VANCE
                     Agent Cumberland, that man is in no
                     condition to undergo prosecution.


            Cumberland and Hale look to Vreede with disbelief.


                                HALE
                     Chief, we've got a federal arrest warrant
                     here that clearly supersedes --


                                VREEDE
                     I don't care about your warrant.  We're in
                     my jurisdiction now.  You've got an issue
                     with that, you take it up with the local
                     magistrate.


            Dr. Vance shrugs as if to say he's sorry.


                                VANCE
                     I'm sorry, gentlemen, but the call has
                     already been made.  A team from the
                     hospital should be here momentarily to
                     oversee the transfer.


            INT. POLICE STATION - ENTRY WAY - NIGHT


            Asher, Danica, and Grimwood enter, followed by FOUR VAMPIRES
            dressed as orderlies.  The orderlies carry a straightjacket,
            various restraints, and a collapsible transport gurney.


            Danica approaches the DESK SERGEANT, flashing a hospital ID.


                                DANICA
                     Hi.  We're here to transfer a patient to
                     County General?


            INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT


            Vance enters once more.  He opens the leather case on the
            table, removing a syringe and an ampule of fluid.


                                VANCE
                          (speaking softly now)
                     Just a little something to keep you
                     compliant.  The normal dose is two, maybe
                     three hundred milligrams.  But for a
                     strapping young hybrid like yourself --


            Vance pokes the needle of the syringe into the ampule.


                                VANCE
                     -- I think we'll kick it up to a couple
                     thousand.


            Vance reaches for Blade's arm.  Blade struggles, tries to pull
            back, but Vance manages to inject him nonetheless.


                                VANCE
                     There.  That wasn't so bad, was it?
                          (smiling)
                     You're weak, aren't you?  In need of your
                     serum.  Who would've guessed a mere human
                     like myself could overpower you?


                                BLADE
                          (realizing)
                     You're with them -- a familiar --


                                VANCE
                     Going on five years now.


            Vance extends his arm, pulling back his shirt cuff a little to
            reveal a VAMPIRE GLYPH tattooed on the underside of his wrist. 
            Then he pulls his cuff back down, smiles at Blade.


                                VANCE
                     It's the end-game, Blade.  All their plans
                     are finally coming to fruition.  So just
                     sit back and enjoy the show.


            Blade looks to the one-way mirror, SCREAMS.


                                BLADE
                     He's one of them!  Damnit, he's working
                     for them!


            Vance looks to the one-way mirror as well and shrugs as if to
            say -- "The man's deranged.  What can I do?"


            INT. POLICE STATION - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT


            On the other side of the glass, Blade looks like a raging
            lunatic.  Vance enters.  He extends his hand to Vreede.


            They shake.  As they do so, we SEE a vampire GLYPH on the
            inside of Vreede's wrist as well.  Another familiar.


            INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT


            Blade stares at his own reflection in the mirror.  He blinks,
            trying to focus -- but the drug is starting to kick in.


            INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT


            An elevator door opens.  Asher, Danica, and Grimwood exit,
            followed by the orderlies who are now wheeling the gurney.  As
            they move down the corridor, they pass --


            -- Cumberland and Hale, who are chasing down Chief Vreede.


                                CUMBERLAND
                     Just hold it right there --


            Danica shoves Cumberland aside, hard, keeps moving past him.


            Cumberland looks to Hale.  Something isn't right about this.


            INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT


            Blade struggles, in the full throes of the drug now.


            BLADE'S POV


            His vision is blurring, various objects in the room leaving
            trails as he shifts his head from side to side and --


            ASHER, DANICA, AND GRIMWOOD


            enter, followed by two of the orderlies.  Despite his
            incapacitation, Blade attempts to rise.  Danica plants her
            heel in his chest, shoving him back down.


                                DANICA
                     Easy, lover. You're not going anywhere.


            She draws closer, enjoying herself.


                                DANICA
                     We moved the humans around like, pawns,
                     Blade.  Used them to flush you out.


            Blade tries to LUNGE from his chair at her and -- WHACK!
            Grimwood punches Blade across the jaw.  A brutal blow.


                                GRIMWOOD
                     Don't worry, Captain Sunshine.  Soon as we
                     get you out of here, you'll get a chance
                     to play.


            Danica motions to the two vampire orderlies.  They step
            forward with the straight-jacket, start to put it on Blade. 
            Blade THRASHES madly.  Asher LAUGHS, enjoying this.


                                DANICA
                     Don't make this any harder than it has to
                     be.  You're all alone, Blade.  No one can
                     help you now.


            BA-BOOM!  The one-way mirror SHATTERS, exploding outward in a
            shower of SLOW-MOTION GLASS FRAGMENTS, carrying with it --


            -- a BODY, one of the vampire mental health flunkies --


            ASHING in mid-air as he sails into the room!  Seconds later --


            A MAN


            VAULTS through the blown-out window, simultaneously drawing
            two high-tech electronic pistols.
            Meet HANNIBAL KING (30s), an audacious vampire hunter with an
            irrepressible grin.  Slapped to his chest is a "Hello, my name
            is" sticker with the words "FUCK YOU" written where the name
            should be.


                                KING
                     Why'd the Polish vampire starve to death?


            Danica spins, enraged, recognizing King instantly --


                                KING
                     He kept biting his own lip.


                                DANICA
                     King!


            The lights go out.  Immediately, backup lights come on,
            followed by FIRE ALARMS.  In the ensuing confusion ~ both
            pistols at Asher, who drops, allowing one of the vampire
            orderlies behind him to take the hit.


            THE VAMPIRE ORDERLY ASHES


            But unlike Blade's victims, he disintegrates from the inside
            out.  (The reason is King's signature bullets -- SUN DOGS,
            explosive rounds that give off concentrated UV light.)


            King whips around, FIRING at --


            -- Danica, who LEAPS behind the table.  She quickly upends it,
            using it as a shield, FLINGING it at King.


            ON BLADE


            He shifts his weight, throwing himself and the chair he's
            sitting on to the floor.  Then he KICKS OUT AND UP --


            -- connecting with Grimwood's mid-section, sending him FLYING
            BACKWARDS -- straight through the wall into the next room!


            King holsters one of his pistols and hauls Blade up.  At the
            same time, he FIRES on Asher again, missing him --


                                KING
                     Let's FLY, kemosabe!


            King drags Blade to the door --


            INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT


            -- into the neighboring corridor.  Cumberland and Hale SEE
            them.  They reach for their weapons --


                                CUMBERLAND
                     He's getting away!


            King FIRES into the room behind him, then pulls a GRENADE
            secured to a bandolier and tosses it through the doorway --


            An EXPLOSION rocks the interrogation room, filling the
            corridor with smoke, knocking Cumberland and Hale back.


            King turns his attention to Blade's handcuffs, FIRING between
            them, freeing Blade's hands.  Blade collapses against the
            wall.  He's shaking, close to passing out.


                                KING
                     Don't die on me, you undead motherfucker!


            King drags Blade up.  They continue down the corridor to --


            ABIGAIL, THE FEMALE VAMPIRE HUNTER


            we met earlier.  She's engaged in hand-to-hand combat with a
            half-dozen UNIFORMED OFFICERS.  Three of them are already
            down.  In seconds, she finishes off the other three.


                                KING
                     Whistler!  We need that serum NOW!


            Whistler?  Abigail spins, dispatching the last officer with a
            kick to the mid-section while tossing a PNEUMATIC INJECTOR at
            King.  He snatches it, places it in Blade's hands.


            Blade injects himself in the neck.  Moments later, he's
            reenergized.  He looks to King, clear-eyed.


                                KING
                     Hey Blacula, you ready to shake and bake?


            Blade responds by PUNCHING King across the jaw.


                                BLADE
                     Call me that again and I'll give you
                     fucking brain damage.


            King massages his jaw, tossing Blade a pistol even as --


            --	Grimwood rounds the corner, hungry for blood, TWO MORE
            VAMPIRE ORDERLIES behind him.


            Blade FIRES round after round of EXPLOSIVE BULLETS, causing
            Grimwood and the others to fall back.  Blade and King move,
            joining Abigail.  MORE SMOKE, darkness, only the emergency
            lights to illuminate the station.


            UP AHEAD,


            a group of POLICEMEN spill from a stairwell, armed with bullet
            proof vests.  They OPEN FIRE --


            Blade, King, and Abigail retreat into an alcove.  They're
            pinned down between the vampires and a group of policemen.


                                KING
                     We're pinned down!
                          (to Blade)
                     Can't you do something?!


                                BLADE
                     I can't shoot around corners!


                                ABIGAIL
                     I can.


            As King and Blade lay down COVER FIRE, Abigail reaches behind
            her, withdrawing a device that's been secured there.  She
            gives it a SNAP and it springs open, taking the shape of a --


            FUTURISTIC COMPOUND BOW


            Crafted from aluminum, its limbs imbedded in key positions
            with vibration-dampening modules, this bow is capable of
            firing an arrow upwards of 300 feet-per-second.


            Abigail withdraws a SILVER ARROW with a time-delay explosive
            tip from her quiver, nocks it in her bow and takes aim at --


            A FIRE EXTINGUISHER


            mounted at the end of the corridor.  She lets her arrow fly --


            MOVING WITH THE ARROW


            as it banks off the side of the fire extinguisher, continuing
            down the side corridor where it embeds itself in --


            -- the shoulder of one of the vampires!  The vampire SCREAMS,
            grabbing the shaft, ripping it out.  Then we --


            MACRO-ZOOM ON THE ARROW HEAD


            A tiny "egg-timer" dial on the arrowhead spins.  It CLICKS in
            place, a RED LED comes on, and --


            --	the arrowhead EXPLODES, catching all three vampires with
            the full force of a UV BLAST.  Grimwood ducks away from the
            blast as the other two vampires ASH --


            BLADE, KING, AND ABIGAIL


            come racing out of the alcove.  They reach a stairwell.  Blade
            RIPS a steel door clear off its hinges, tossing it down the
            stairwell at a phalanx of COP REINFORCEMENTS who are charging
            up the stairs.  The cops go down like ten-pins.


            Blade and company have an opening.  But as they charge
            downward --


                                BLADE
                          (as King and Abigail
                          freeze)
                     My sword.  They still have it.


                                KING
                          (apoplectic)
                     Are you insane?!  We're practically home
                     free!  We can't go hunting for your
                     fucking butter-knife now!


            But Blade is already heading back the way they came and --


                                KING
                     Hey!  HEY!!!  COME BACK HERE!!!  This is
                     supposed to be a rescue!


            -- Abigail grabs King's shoulder, pulling him to the stairs.


                                ABIGAIL
                     Forget it, King.  Let's move.


            POLICE STATION - NIGHT


            King and Abigail rush outside.  The station is gated. FLASHING
            POLICE CARS are surging through the mouth of the gate. 
            They're trapped.  Then --


            CRASH!


            A window on the third floor of the station EXPLODES OUTWARD. 
            Blade drops three stories, landing before King and Abigail in
            a cat-like crouch.  With his sword in his hand.  He looks at
            King, grins, flips him off.


                                BLADE
                     Now we can go.


                                KING
                          (nudging Abigail)
                     Is he epic or what?


            The police close in around them, pinning the trio down with
            FIREPOWER.  Yet King and Abigail seem unconcerned because --


            HEADLIGHTS


            are washing over them.  A beefed-up, 70s Land Cruiser is
            SCREAMING up the street.  The Cruiser jumps onto the sidewalk,
            SMASHES right through the gated wall.  SCREECHES to a stop
            between our trio and the police cars.


            A DRIVER (DEX)


            leans out his window, gives a little wave as the rear doors
            pop open.  Gruff and compact, he looks like a prize-fighter.


                                DEX
                     My name is Dex.  And I'll be saving your
                     ass this evening.


            Blade, King, and Abigail scramble into the back of the Land
            Cruiser.  Dex reverses, backing out the way he came.


            The police from the squad cars are FIRING, but the Land
            Cruiser is armored and the bullets harmlessly SPARK off.


            INT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT


            In the backseat, Abigail looks through the rear windshield --


            ABIGAIL'S POV


            Grimwood is running after them, actually gaining on the Land
            Cruiser.  Chewing up the asphalt like a cheetah.


            EXT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT


            Abigail leans out the rear window, nocking a non-UV arrow in
            her bow.  She takes aim at Grimwood, lets the arrow fly --


            SHUNKT!  The arrow sinks into Grimwood's eye.  He goes down,
            his somersaulting figure quickly receding into the background
            as the Land Cruiser speeds away.


            INT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT


            Safe for the moment, King basks in the adrenaline rush of a
            battle well fought.  Meanwhile, Dex is on a cell phone.


                                DEX
                     We have him.  We'll be there soon.


                                KING
                          (to Blade)
                     So my entrance back there -- what do you
                     think?  Too flashy?  Right on the money?


            King unhuckles his combat harness, revealing a bullet-proof
            vest bereath it that's been riddled with imbedded slugs.


                                BLADE
                     Who are you people?


                                KING
                     My name's Hannibal King.  I'm a hunter,
                     like you.
                          (re: Abigail)
                     And this little hellion is Abigail
                     Whistler.


            Abigail just stares back at Blade, silently appraising him.


                                KING
                     That's right, Blade.  You're not hearing
                     things.  She's Whistler's daughter.  You
                     see, Abby, Dex, myself -- we're all part
                     of Whistler's "contingency plan".


            King reaches into an inner pocket, pulls out a pack of gum. 
            He selects a stick, offers one to Blade.


                                KING
                     Juicyfruit?


            EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT


            The Land Cruiser rockets away, disappearing into the night.


            EXT. LUNA PARK - NIGHT


            The Land Cruiser moves across an abandoned lot towards the
            weed-choked ruins of an old amusement park.  We pass by the
            skeletal remains of a roller-coaster, a tilt-a-whirl, the
            vandalized and wood-rotted remnants of a carousel.


            Finally, the Land Cruiser turns towards a motorized loading
            door in the side of a large warehouse and disappears inside.


            INT. WAREHOUSE/GARAGE - NIGHT


            As the door grinds closed, the Land Cruiser stops.  King and
            Abigail lead Blade through the darkness.  In the gloom we see
            a half-dozen vehicles in various stages of being retrofitted
            with armored panels and weaponry, etc.  SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS
            mounted above track their progress.


                                BLADE
                     I thought the vampires murdered
                     Whistler's family.


                                ABIGAIL
                     They did.  I'm the product of an earlier
                     fling of my Dad's, born out of wedlock. 
                     After the murders happened, he kept me
                     hidden.  He wanted me safe.  Away from all
                     of this --
                          (gesturing around them)
                     -- but I guess hunting just runs in our
                     blood.


            As King and Abigail lead Blade towards a stairway, Blade
            catches sight of --


            A LITTLE GIRL (5)


            peering down at him from atop one of the rafters.  As soon as
            he spots her, she ducks into the shadows.


            They reach the stairway.  AUTOMATED GUNS mounted on swivel
            arms lock on them with infra-red targeting beams.


                                ABIGAIL
                     When I came of age, I tracked my Dad
                     down, told him I wanted in.
                          (beat, shrugging)
                     Been doing it ever since.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT


            We enter a sprawling industrial facility that is equal parts
            mechanics shop, firing range, and laboratory.  We glimpse a
            virtual arsenal of new weaponry and medical equipment,
            including DNA sequencers, microfuges, and electroporaters.


            The new equipment fights for space alongside the old -
            mountains of mothballed parts from the park's broken thrill
            rides.  Here and there we see the oversized fiberglass head of
            a grinning fun-house creature or the mildewed torso of a
            fortune-telling mannequin, frozen in its upended booth.


                                KING
                     Welcome to the honeycomb hideout.


                                BLADE
                          (looking around)
                     How do you bankroll this place?


                                KING
                     Internet porn.  See, we're using cock
                     suckers to pay for the blood-suckers.  
                          (off Blade's look)
                     Joke.  Come on, man.  This isn't some
                     piddly little hoopty-ass operation, Blade. 
                     We take our jobs very seriously.


            UP AHEAD,


            TWO OTHERS pause in their work as King approaches.  Dex falls
            in behind them.


            HEDGES (20s) is an engineer, always lost in his own world.


            SOMMERFIELD (30s) is a frail-looking geneticist.  She's also
            blind, operating her computers via a voice-synthesis program
            and Braille keyboard.


                                KING
                     You met Dex.  This is Hedges, Sommerfield--


            King gestures to them in turn.  They're all refugees in one
            way or another, sharing a common guardedness, their lives
            having been shattered by the vampires.


                                KING
                          (nodding back)
                     The runt you saw earlier is Sommerfield's
                     daughter, Zoe.  We call ourselves the
                     Nightstalkers.


                                BLADE
                     You sound like rejects from a Saturday
                     morning cartoon.


                                KING
                     We were gonna call ourselves the Super
                     Friends, but that was taken.


            Abigail rids herself of her weapons -- bow, arrows, silver
            stakes and knives.  She hands her compound bow to Hedges.


                                ABIGAIL
                     Tiller needs adjustment.


                                HEDGES
                     I'll run it through the bow press.


            Blade examines some of the equipment being developed.


                                BLADE
                     How many of you are there total?


                                KING
                     Enough.  We operate in sleeper cells. 
                     When one goes down, a new cell activates
                     to pick up the slack.  Consider us your
                     reinforcements.


                                BLADE
                     Sorry.  Never been much of a team player.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     I don't think you understand, Blade.
                     Whistler meant for us to help you.  When
                     he died, he activated an emergency
                     protocol.  All his knowledge --


            She gestures to the computer equipment around her.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     --was transferred to our servers here.


                                BLADE
                     And what makes you think you know so much
                     about killing vampires?


            King reaches for his collar, pulling it down to reveal a
            telltale mass of scar tissue in the shape of a BITE MARK.


                                KING
                     Well for starters, I used to be one.  
                          (in a sinister tone)
                     Do I pass the audition?


                                                                  CUT TO:


            EXT. PHOENIX TOWERS - NIGHT


            We soar through the night sky, diving down towards a cluster
            of gleaming, high-tech spires.  As we isolate a penthouse
            apartment atop one of them we hear an ANGRY SCREAM.


                                DANICA (O.S.)
                     Fucking Hannibal King!


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT


            An impressively decorated loft bespeaking of money, power, and
            a certain perverse esthetic.  Danica slams her fist straight
            through the wall, then spins around, enraged.


            Asher and Grimwood are there too, their wounds being treated
            by Hendrix and a VAMPIRE TECHNICIAN.  At tie moment, they're
            trying to remove the arrow protruding from Grimwood's eye.


            An enormous ROTTWEILER sits nearby, attentively watching. A
            TRIO OF GUARDS flinch with every act of violence. Danica is
            strong.  Clearly, no one wants to get in her way.


                                DANICA
                     I should've ripped his ripped his
                     bleeding heart out when I had the chance!
                          (pointing at Asher)
                     And don't you dare tell me "I told you
                     so"!


            Asher raises his hands as if to say "no harm, no foul". 
            Danica continues her tantrum, SMASHING a statue apart,
            SHATTERING a heavy glass tabletop.  Finally, she gives it a
            rest, collapsing into a chair, shoulders sagging.


                                ASHER
                     You through remodeling?


                                DANICA
                     Blow me.


                                ASHER
                     Face it, Dan.  We got caught with our
                     pants down.  We underestimated the
                     Nightstalkers.


                                GRIMWOOD
                     Pants down?!  They practically fucking
                     ass-raped us!


            Grimwood GRUNTS in pain as the arrow is removed.  Asher
            broaches a more serious subject.


                                ASHER
                     Has he been told yet?


                                VOICE (O.S.)
                     About your failure?


            A MAN (30s) enters the room.  The same being we glimpsed in
            the vault.  He has a haunting gaze and a commanding presence.
            We will learn who he is momentarily.  But for now, it's enough
            to know that everyone in the room pays him deference.


                                MAN
                     Yes, I've been told.


            He places a hand on Danica's shoulder.  She tenses.


                                MAN
                     Perhaps it's time I entered the fray.


                                                                  CUT TO:


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT


            CLOSE ON King buttoning his collar back up.  Blade, Abigail,
            and Sommerfield are gathered around him.


                                KING
                     You know the kind of woman that just
                     screams trouble? You see her and every
                     warning bell in your brain starts going
                     off but you still ask for her number? 
                     Well that's all I ever hook up with.  But
                     this betty blew 'em all away in the
                     shitstorm sweepstakes.


            King reaches out to a keyboard, calling up a piece of
            surveillance footage on a nearby monitor.  The footage
            features Asher and Danica and Grimwood.  It's been slowed to a
            near standstill and now advances frame by frame.


                                KING
                     Her name's Danica Talos.  You met her
                     earlier.  The man on her left is Asher,
                     her brother.


            King types a command.  The image ZOOMS IN, tracking Grimwood.


                                KING
                     The neanderthal behind them is Jarko
                     Grimwood.


            King freezes the footage on Danica's grainy, pixelated face.


                                KING
                     I picked Danica up in a bar, had a one
                     night stand with her -- then spent the
                     next five years playing step-and-fetch-it
                     as her little vampire cabana boy.
                          (beat)
                     Eventually Abigail found me.  Sommerfield
                     here managed to treat me with a cure.  Now
                     I kill them.
                          (beat)
                     That's called turning a frown upside
                     down.


                                ABIGAIL
                     We need to pool our resources, Blade.


                                BLADE
                     Why?


                                ABIGAIL
                     Because He's come back.


            King tosses a TOMB OF DRACULA comic book over to Blade.  Blade
            glances at the cover, then looks at them, incredulous.


                                BLADE
                     You gotta be kidding me.


                                KING
                     He's real, Blade.  Dig beneath all the
                     movies and myths.  All the layers of
                     bullshit that've cluttered our culture for
                     the last five hundred years and eventually
                     you'll strike the truth.


                                BLADE
                          (incredulous)
                     So the movies are true?


                                KING
                          (shaking his head)
                     The movies are just a comforting
                     fairytale compared to the real deal. 
                     There's no happy ending with this guy. 
                     Peter Cushing isn't going to run in at the
                     last second and save the day with a cross
                     and some holy water.
                          (re: the comicbook)
                     See, good old Brain Stoker, he wrote a
                     nice yarn.  But the events he described in
                     1897 were only a tiny piece of the mosaic. 
                     The rea1 Dracula's origin goes back much
                     earlier than that.


                                BLADE
                     How early?


                                ABIGAIL
                     Try six or seven thousand years.


            Off Blade's astonished look we --


                                                                  CUT TO:


            EXT. MESOPOTAMIA - NIGHT


            FLASH!  We see the man we met earlier (DRACULA/DRAKE) on the
            banks of the river Euphrates, striding towards us, engaged in
            fierce battle with UBAIDIAN SOLDIERS.  He's clutching the same
            sword we saw in the ziggurat, clad in the same armor.


                                KING (V.0.)
                     Dracula's only one of the names he's gone
                     by.  Now they call him Drake.  If you
                     believe the legends, he was born in
                     ancient Sumeria.


            As Drake SLASHES his sword downward we CUT BACK TO --


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT


            -- King continuing his story. As the hunter's monologue
            progresses we will INTERCUT with Drake's own progression
            through history.  Brief, violent FLASHBACKS.


            (NOTE:  The backgrounds surrounding Drake will be
            expressionistic, digital composites, constantly shifting.  The
            focus of the flashes is Drake himself, fighting a shadowy
            horde, his attire continually evolving through time.)


                                KING
                     Nobody really knows the specifics of his
                     origin.  But we do know this:  he was the
                     first of his kind.  The patriarch of the
                     hominus nocturna.


            EXT. EGYPTIAN DESERT - NIGHT


            FLASH!  We are in Egypt now, circa 1650 BC.  Drake wages war
            against the HYKSOS.  He is closer to the camera.  And will
            continue to move closer with each successive flashback.


                                KING (V.0.)
                     Every single vampire -- every single
                     monster that's walked the earth since then
                     -- owes their existence to Him.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT


            Back to King, holding court before Blade and Abigail.


                                KING
                     He's like the Patient Zero of evil.  The
                     original Serpent in the Garden of Eden.
                     And just like the Great White shark, he's
                     never had to evolve.  This guy was born
                     perfect.  Scour the history books --


            EXT. THRACE - NIGHT


            FLASH!  The Peloponnesian War, Southern Thrace, circa 405 BC.
            We see Dracula battling ATHENIANS.  Even closer now, his face
            spattered with blood.  At the same time, the SOUNDTRACK is
            gradually swelling, expanding in complexity and volume.


                                KING (V.0.)
                     -- read between the lines --


            EXT. HUNGARIA - NIGHT


            FLASH!  5th century AD, battling the GOTHS.  With every swipe
            of his sword, we WIPE FORWARD into the future.


                                KING (V.0.)
                     -- you'll find countless references to
                     Him.  Always mentioned, never named.


            EXT. EUROPE - NIGHT


            FLASH!  8th century AD, the reign of Charlemagne.  Battling
            the VIKINGS.  The FLASHBACKS come faster now, assaulting us
            with ever-increasing rapidity.


            Drake continues striding forward while the rest of the world
            evolves around him, centuries whizzing by via computer
            generated time-lapse photography.


                                KING (V.0.)
                     He's been there --


            EXT. VARIOUS - NIGHT


            FLASH!  12th century AD, the time of the Crusades.  The
            violence intensifies.


                                KING (V.0.)
                     -- moving behind the scenes --


            FLASH!  17th century France, the time of Louis the XIV.  The
            pace becomes breathless.


                                KING (V.0.)
                     -- cutting a bloody path through the Ages
                     until suddenly --


            FLASH!  18th century Russia, the time of Peter the Great.  The
            soundtrack is THUNDEROUS.  Drake has become a bloody blur of
            bestial rage and unfettered horror and --


                                KING (V.0.)
                     -- just like that --


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT


            -- King SNAPS his fingers.  We are back in the present.


                                KING
                     -- he up and disappeared.  About a century
                     ago the trail went cold.  Then we heard a
                     rumor.  The vampires were searching for
                     him -- trying to find the place where he'd
                     retreated.  According to our information,
                     they found him in Iraq about six months
                     ago.
                          (beat)
                     And he was pissed.


            EXT. DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL DISTRICT - NIGHT


            Grime.  Neon.  Near-silence as the cacophonous soundtrack
            recedes into the background, replaced by the steady drone of
            inner-city TRAFFIC.


            ON DRAKE,


            viewed through a long-lens, clad in modern, casual attire,
            striding in SLOW-MOTION down a PEDESTRIAN-CHOKED sidewalk.


            Slower.  A HEARTBEAT.  The pulse of the people.  And over
            this, intruding, the Doppler effect WAILING of an approaching
            car as it rushes past us in a SCREEN WIPE until we are --


            OUTSIDE A GOTH STORE


            Drake studies a window display.  Halloween merchandise. 
            Costumes and monster masks and -- VAMPIRE NOVELTIES.  We see
            vampire lunchboxes, Dracula plush dolls, plastic fangs, key
            chains.  Even Dracula bobbleheads.


            Drake stands in stark contrast to the mass-marketed caricature
            on display before him.


            INT. GOTH STORE - NIGHT


            Drake enters. The store is crowded with low-end junky goods
            that might appeal to tourists visiting Hollywood Boulevard.


            A pallid, Goth-guy CASHIER sits behind a counter, eating from
            a takeout container.  He's wafer thin, with a detached
            attitude.  A snot.  Further back is a sultry GOTH VIXEN.


            Behind them, on a TV, a cartoon is playing. An animated
            vampire cavorts -- "LITTLE BIT" (like the Hot Stuff devil from
            Ritchie Rich comicbooks)


                                DRAKE
                     In the window -- you sell vampire
                     merchandise?


            Goth Guy looks up, wiping his mouth with a napkin.  Doesn't
            want to engage with Drake at all.


                                GOTH GUY
                     Uh, yeah -- look around, we might have a
                     few things.


            He and the Goth Vixen have a snicker at Drake's expense.  Then
            she tries to be a little more helpful.


                                GOTH VIXEN
                     We've got Dracula lunchboxes.  Did you
                     see those?  And there're bobbleheads, Pez
                     dispensers.  We've got just about
                     anything --
                          (selecting a vampire-
                          shaped vibrator, playful)
                     -- even vampire vibrators.


            As Drake looks around, what he sees matches his ascending
            rage.  Costumes, candles, vampire Christmas ornaments. 
            Posters from different films -- Nosferatu, Lugosi, Lee -- then
            Love at First Bite and The Little Vampire.


                                GOTH VIXEN
                     Here, check this out --


            She reaches into a case, pulling out a soft-drink.  The label
            reads: "DRA-COLA" and has a stylized vampire on it.


                                GOTH VIXEN
                     "Dracola".  Makes you want to cry,
                     doesn't it?


            Drake just stares at the can.  His mind seems to have
            retreated elsewhere.  Back through the ages.


                                GOTH VIXEN
                     Was there something special you needed?


            Drake doesn't respond.  A kind of melancholy has settled over
            him.  He's an outsider now.  The world has moved on.


                                GOTH-GUY
                     Hey, guy, she's talking to you.


            Drake looks up as Goth Guy pours a bowl of Count Chocula.


            EXT. GOTH STORE - NIGHT


            CRASH!  Goth Guy comes flying through the display window, his
            trajectory taking his body clear across the street and into
            the display window of the store opposite us.


            INT. GOTH STORE - NIGHT


            Goth Vixen SCREAMS.  Drake LASHES out.  hauling her over the
            counter.  He sinks his teeth into her throat, drinking her
            blood with wild abandon.  He consumes it so quickly that his
            skin flushes BRIGHT RED.


            Then Drake tears his head away, lifting his face upward as he
            flings the girl aside, unleashing an ear-splitting ROAR.  And
            for a brief moment, the bones of his face seem to shift, once
            again hinting at another shape Drake might take.


            EXT. THE CITY - VARIOUS


            DRAKE's ROAR echoes through the canyons of downtown.


                                                                  CUT TO:


            EXT. LUNA PARK - NIGHT/DAY


            Time-lapse.  The sun rises over the decrepit amusement park.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - ARMORY - DAWN
            Sunlight slices down through skylights, bathing Blade, King,
            Abigail, and Sommerfield in its warmth.  Zoe has joined them. 
            She's still cautious and shy, but she's also curious.


                                BLADE
                     Why wake up Drake now?


                                ABIGAIL
                     That's what we've been trying to figure
                     out.


                                KING
                     When I was under the fang there used to be
                     talk about some kind of vampire 'Final
                     Solution'.  But I could never figure out
                     why they'd want to destroy their food
                     source.  I mean, seems stupid, right? 
                     They've always had plans for the human
                     race.  Seems likely that whatever they're
                     cooking up, Drake's return is a part of
                     it.


            Blade nods, pensive.


                                KING (CONT'D)
                     Let's face it, Blade -- we're fighting a
                     losing battle. 
                     So we kill a few hundred of them a year. 
                     Big deal.  There are thousands of them out
                     there.  Maybe tens of th'usands.  We need
                     a new tactic.


                                BLADE
                     Like what?


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     A biological weapon.


            Sommerfield moves to her Braille keyboard, types.


            ON A NEARBY MONITOR


            we SEE a real-time magnified view of a virus replicating.


                                SOMMERFIELD (CONT' D)
                     For the last year I've been~working with
                     synthesized DNA in order to create an
                     artificial virus targeted specifically at
                     vampires.  We're calling it DayStar.


                                KING
                     Think about it, Blade.  We could wipe
                     them all out in a single move.


                                BLADE
                     So what's been holding you back?


                                SOMMERFIELD
                          (sighing)
                     We've tried it on a number of captive
                     subjects.  We've got the disease vector
                     worked out fine -- it's easily
                     transmittable.  But the lethality in
                     vampires is still spotty.


                                ABIGAIL
                     Bottom line is, we need a better DNA
                     sample to work with.
                          (beat)
                     We need Dracula's blood.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     Vampire DNA is a hodge-podge of different
                     genes, mixed in with all sorts of useless
                     junk DNA.  Because Dracula's the
                     progenitor of the vampire race, his DNA is
                     still pure.  It hasn't been diluted by a
                     hundred generations of selective mutation. 
                     It still has all the necessary cellular
                     compounds for the virus to code to.  We
                     get his blood, we can boost Daystar's
                     viral efficacy to a hundred percent.


                                KING
                     So.  You want to join our club?  Can we
                     sign you up for a Nightstalkers secret
                     decoder ring?


                                                                  CUT TO:


            EXT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DAY


            Establishing.  The Sun at it's zenith


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DRAKE'S QUARTERS - DAY


            A darkened room, relatively austere.  The only source of light
            are a series of small, slitted skylights in the ceiling above. 
            From these skylights, narrow, blinding white shafts of
            sunlight knife downward to penetrate the gloom.


            DRAKE


            sits in a chair, his body partially illuminated by one of the
            sunlight shafts, his face turned upward into its brilliance.


            FOOTSTEPS.  Drake opens his eyes, SEES Danica hovering in the
            darkness, just on the edge of a shaft of light.


                                DRAKE
                     This world sickens me.  The humans have
                     soiled it with their filth.


                                DANICA
                     We can raze their cities to the ground.
                     We can bring the old world back.


            Drake just stares at her, not convinced.


                                DRAKE
                     Come closer.


                                DANICA
                          (re: light)
                     I can't.


                                DRAKE
                     And do you know why?
                          (off Danica's silence)
                     Once, all of my kind could brave the day. 
                     We were true predators.  The world was
                     ours.  And then, somewhere along the way,
                     the purity of our bloodline became
                     diluted.  Polluted with human DNA.


                                DANICA
                     That's impossible --


                                DRAKE
                     Is it?


            Drake stands, drawing close to Danica.  He grips her wrist --


                                DRAKE
                     You are bastard children.  No longer as
                     pure as you pride yourselves on being.


            -- and pulls her hand towards one of the sunlight shafts.  To
            her credit, Danica keeps staring at Drake.  She'll be damned
            if she will give him the satisfaction of seeing her break.


            Drake pulls her hand closer to the light -- to the very edge. 
            And the tips of Danica's fingers begin to burn.  She winces,
            clearly in agony --


            -- and Drake releases her hand.  She cradles it against her
            chest, blinking away tears that have welled up in her eyes.


                                DRAKE
                     My people.  How far you have fallen.


            Drake reaches out, brushes a tear from Danica's cheek, then
            turns and walks away -- through the alternating shafts of
            sunlight and darkness.


                                                                  CUT TO:


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - ARMORY - DAY


            Blade, King, and Abigail stand before a table where an
            assortment of weaponry and ammunition has been laid out on
            display.  Hedges is there too, assisting them.  Zoe watches.


                                HEDGES
                     We've got a wide assortment of ass-
                     kickery for your viewing pleasure --
                          (hefting a pistol)
                     Electronic pistol.  Comes with a built-in
                     fingerprint security system.  Fires a
                     three-shot burst in 1/500th of a second.
                     Bullets can also be triggered remotely.


            King tosses Blade a bullet.  He studies it -- it's more
            complex than a standard round.


                                BLADE
                     Explosive rounds?


                                KING
                     But with a concentrated burst of UV light
                     instead of your standard hollow-points.  I
                     call 'em sun dogs.
                          (to Hedges)
                     Hedges -- super-size me, baby!


            Hedges tosses King one of the four-barreled firearms.  On the
            stock is an irreverent decal of the mud-flap girl silhouette.


                                KING
                     This little mamacita -- a modified
                     version of the Army's Objective
                     Individual Combat Weapon.  Pick your
                     poison -- stakes, sun dogs, heat-seeking
                     mini-rockets.  Whatever gets you hard,
                     this puppy will pump out.
                          (gesturing to Blade's
                          sword, sarcastic)
                     Of course it doesn't have the range of a
                     sword but --


            Next, Hedges shows Blade the CRESCENT-SHAPED DEVICE that
            Abigail used.  He gives the device a twist and --


                                HEDGES
                     We call this the UV arc --


            CHINKT!  The device extends from either end, telescoping
            outward.  Connecting the tips is a concentrated UV LASER.


                                HEDGES
                     You hold the arc in the center, curved
                     away from you.  Connecting the tips is a
                     powerful UV laser beam.  Because of its
                     high focus, the laser cuts through vampire
                     flesh like a knife through butter.


                                KING
                     We're still trying to sort out fact from
                     fiction when it comes to Dracula.  Turning
                     into mist?  Kinda doubt it.  But general
                     shape-shifting?  Maybe.


                                HEDGES
                          (off Blade's look)
                     Not into a bat or a wolf or anything like
                     that.  But another human, someone with the
                     same approximate body mass -- given enough
                     practice it might be possible.


                                BLADE
                     How?


                                HEDGES
                     He wouldn't have a traditional skeletal
                     structure.  Probably something more like a
                     snake, with thousands of tiny bones in the
                     place of a normal array.  Commensurate
                     with this would be an exquisite control of
                     electrical potential across his tissues,
                     resulting in an ability to effectively
                     change shape at will --


                                KING
                          (raising his hand)
                     Question.  Have you ever been laid,
                     Hedges?


            CUT TO:


            INT. WAREHOUSE/GARAGE - DAY


            Blade, King, and Abigail, newly suited up for war, moving
            towards the Land Cruiser.


                                BLADE
                     Time to apply some pressure.  The weak
                     link in the vampire chain of command has
                     always been their familiars.  Vampires
                     can't go out in the day, so they get
                     humans to do their dirty work for them
                     Blood-running, safe house maintenance,
                     whatever --
                          (climbing in the Cruiser)
                     We bleed the wanna-be vampires, they'll
                     lead us to the real thing.


            Blade starts the ENGINE.


            INT. LAND CRUISER - DAY


            Blade looks to Abigail, who sits in the back.  She has a
            laptop on her knees and is assembling an MP3 playlist.


                                KING
                     She's making playlists.  Likes to listen
                     to MP3s when she hunts.  Her own internal
                     soundtrack, you know?  Dark-core, trip
                     hop, whatever kids these days are
                     listening to.  Me?   I'm more of a Kenny G
                     fan.


            Finished, Abigail slips her earbuds into her ears, turns on
            her portable MP3 player.  MUSIC CUE.  The smoking bassline of
            Jurassic 5's 'A Day At The Races' kicks in as --


            EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS - DAY


            -- Blade, King, and Abigail cruise the streets in a jagged
            fast-forward montage.


            EXT. SEEDY BAR - DAY


            The Land Cruiser jumps the curb, SCREECHING to a stop in front
            of a scuzzy bar.  Amidst a wall covered with graffiti and
            flyers we see a vampire glyph.


            INT. SEEDY BAR - DAY


            BANG!  Blade KICKS open the door.  A couple of LOW-LIFES take
            notice.  Blade moves around the bar, opening a refrigerator -
            we see packs of REFRIGERATED BLOOD inside.


            One of the low-lifes takes off running, back past the
            bathroom, shouldering a door at the rear --


            EXT. SEEDY BAR - REAR ENTRANCE - DAY


            --	STUMBLING right into Abigail's arms.  She trips him up,
            swinging him around, pinning an arm behind him.  She pulls the
            back of his collar down, sees a VAMPIRE GLYPH --


            We can't hear what the familiar is saying, but he's squealing,
            raising his hands in a "please don't hit me anymore" manner.


            EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS - DAY


            The Land Cruiser rockets down the streets.


            EXT. VAMPIRE SAFE HOUSES - VARIOUS - DAY


            In quick succession we see a half-dozen underworld dives --


            -- a pool hall --


            -- an internet cafe --


            -- an electronics repair shop --


            All are fronts for vampire operations, featuring back rooms
            with refrigerated blood and high-tech coffin-like beds where
            the vampires can safely sleep through the day unmolested.


            In each new location, Blade, King, and Abigail resort to
            oldfashioned strong-arm tactics:


            -- Blade HEAD-BUTTS a familiar.


            -- King PUNCHES a familiar across the jaw.


            -- Abigail KICKS a familiar in the stomach.


            Cut to a flurry of EXTREME CLOSE-UPS of VAMPIRE GLYPHS being
            exposed on the backs of familiar's necks, one after another --


            THEN A MONTAGE OF FACES


            as familiars have their heads cainfully SMASHED against --


            -- walls --


            -- car hoods --


            -- pool tables --


            -- into windows and doors and garbage cans.


            The bullying moves come faster, the shots becoming more and


            more abstract until --


            EXT. CITY ROOFTOP - DAY


            -- WHAM!  Blade tosses HOOP, a skinny familiar, off a roof. 
            It's a four story drop.  Hoop falls, SCREAMING -- but then
            jerks to a stop about twenty feet down, dangling upside down.


            We see now that Hoop has rope tied around one of Hoop's
            ankles.  And Blade is clutching the other end of the rope.


            Blade hauls Hoop back up -- but still keeps him dangling
            upside down.  King and Abigail look on.


                                BLADE
                     Want another spin, ass-hole?  Eventually,
                     your head's gonna pop off.


                                HOOP
                     Shit!  Oh Jesus, please, please --


                                BLADE
                     Who's your handler?


                                HOOP
                     I don't know his name, I swear I --


            Blade prepares to drop Hoop again --


            -- but a CELL PHONE in Hoop's jacket RINGS.  Blade fishes it
            out.  The screen reads:  EDGAR VANCE, 555-5631.


            EXT. CITY STREET - DAY


            Dr. Vance, the psychiatrist who gave Blade the mental
            evaluation, is cruising in his Pacific Blue XKB convertible
            Jaguar.  He's wearing sunglasses, talking on his cell phone.


                                VANCE
                     This is Dr. Vance.  Did someone page me?


            EXT.  CITY ROOFTOP - DAY


            Blade ends the call, then looks to Hoop, smiling cruelly.


            Blade lets Hoop drop.  The familiar PLUNGES four stories,
            SCREAMING.  Lands dead-center in a Goodwill box below.


                                                                  CUT TO:


            EXT. VANCE INSTITUTE FOR WHOLE BEING - DAY


            A high-tech office complex surrounded by meticulously-groomed
            grounds.  A sign with a swanky "VANCE INSTITUTE" logo zooms.


            Blade, King, and Abigail approach, taking note of Vance's
            Jaguar (complete with vanity plate), parked in front.


                                KING
                     Hey, Blade -- why didn't the vampire bite
                     Mick Jagger?
                          (off Blade's look)
                     Cause you can't get blood from a Stone.


            As Blade walks off --


                                KING (CONT'D)
                     Hey, they can't all be gems!


            INT. VANCE INSTITUTE FOR WHOLE BEING - LOBBY - DAY


            The trio enter, drawing stares from a number of PATIENTS
            gathered in a reception area.  Nearby is a large display with
            Vance's grinning face.  Beneath it, text reads:


                                  EDGAR VANCE, M.D.


                      PRESIDENT, VANCE INSTITUTE FOR WHOLE BEING


            Nearby is a bank of monitors showing a snazzy video featuring
            a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG COUPLE marvelling at a sunrise.


                                NARRATOR
                          (on monitors)
                     Regain control of your life.   Wake to a
                     new dawn.  At the Vance Institute for
                     Whole Being we believe in an integrated
                     approach to human health.


            The image cuts to Vance himself, poised on the edge of his
            desk, smiling.  As Blade and company move through the
            institute, the video plays counterpoint to their progress.


                                VANCE
                     I'm Dr. Vance.  Welcome to our facility.
                     As a member of the medical profession I
                     want to assure you that I will do
                     everything in my power ro provide you with
                     the care and compassion that you deserve.


            Past the RECEPTION DESK are the elevators with more monitors
            showing the video greeting.  As Blade, King, and Abigail
            approach, TWO SECURITY GUARDS move to intercept them.


                                SECURITY GUARD
                     Excuse me, can I help y--


            CRACK!  Blade effortlessly tosses the guards aside, sending
            them CRASHING into the nearest monitors.


            INT. VANCE INSTITUTE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


            The trio continue.  A DOCTOR steps out of a doorway.  King
            PUNCHES him in the face.  We see another video monitor.


                                VANCE
                     What does it mean to be human?  Since the
                     dawn of creation our ancestors have asked
                     ourselves that question.


            They round the corner --


            INT. VANCE INSTITUTE - SECOND HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


            -- nearly colliding with TWO MORE SECURITY GUARDS.  Blade
            takes them both out.  There's another video monitor.


                                VANCE
                     The modern world today is filled with
                     countless challenges.  In every direction
                     we look, toxic stressors are impacting
                     upon our happiness.  We think we're
                     healthy, but the truth is, our immune
                     systems are engaged in a life or death
                     struggle to maintain our well being.


            INT. VANCE INSTITUTE - OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS


            Blade, King, and Abigail storm in.  An EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT is
            moving to stop them.


                                EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT
                     I'm sorry but you can't --


            Abigail KICKS out the man's knee, then slices her hand into
            his windpipe, silencing him.


                                VANCE
                     Now, I'd like to take a moment to exolain
                     how a series of remarkable new
                     breakthroughs can immeasurably improve the
                     quality of your life


            Blade aims his shotgun at the door leading to Vance's office.
            He FIRES at the keycard lock, KICKS down the door --


            INT. VANCE INSTITUTE - VANCE'S OFFICE - DAY


            --	startling Dr. Vance himself, who is rising up from behind
            his desk.  Vance is wiping his mouth, not dressed like a
            doctor would normally be.  But we hardly notice this as --


                                VANCE
                     What --?


                                BLADE
                     Payback, Vance.


            --	Blade aims his shotgun at Vance's head.  Vance just
            smiles, seemingly unconcerned as --


            --	Abigail circles around the other side, getting a view
            behind Vance's desk where --


            VANCE'S BODY


            lies on the floor.  His throat has been ripped out.  And this
            body is dressed like a doctor.


            King puts it together first, reaching for a silver stake even
            as we hear the sound of POPPING CARTILAGE coming from beneath
            the Vance double's flesh --


                                KING
                     Jesus, it's him!  It's Drake!


            The Vance double jumps atop the desk and swats the muzzle of
            Blade's shotgun aside, re-directing the BLAST, which SHATTERS
            a glass window.  Then he KICKS Blade in the chest, KNOCKING
            him clear across the office as --


            --	King advances.  The Vance double's face WARPS, the bones
            in his head shifting around.  He reaches for King, SLAMS him
            onto the desk, TWISTS the stake from King's hand and brutally
            SHOVING it into King's rib cage, pinning him to the desk top.


            Then the Vance double whirls around to engage Abigail -- only
            we see that it's Drake now, having taken Vance's shape.


            DRAKE


            BACK-HANDS Abigail across the face, a teeth-jarring blow.


            She spins, falling --


            -- and Drake is moving like a hurricane, LEAPING through the
            window that was shattered by Blade's shotgun blast.


            BLADE


            gives chase.  He looks out the window, SEES Drake landing on
            the ground, some three stories below.


            EXT. VANCE INSTITUTE - REAR ENTRANCE - ALLEY - DAY


            Drake runs with inhuman speed.  He effortlessly scales a chain
            link fence, then BARRELS straight through a wooden barricade,
            sailing over a trash dumpster.  Seconds later, Blade follows,
            catching sight of Drake rushing out into --


            EXT. STREET MARKET - VARIOUS - DAY


            -- a crowded urban market.  What unfolds is a foot-chase at
            super-human velocity.  Vampire and hunter are moving at least
            twenty miles an hour, BATTERING ASIDE various pedestrians,
            SMASHING through and over stalls of merchandise.


            EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY


            Drake emerges onto the sidewalk of a busy street, four lanes
            of rush-hour traffic WHIZZING PAST.


            Abruptly, Drake cuts into the traffic, LEAPING atop the hood
            of an oncoming car.  The car's HORN sounds, brakes SQUEAL.


                                BLADE FOLLOWS,
                     jumping onto the hood of another car. More
                     HORNS sound.


            In this manner. Drake and Blade race across the flowing
            traffic itself. using the hoods and roofs of the cars like
            moving stepping stones.


            ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET


            Drake mounts the steps of an older apartment building,
            THUNDERS his way through the main entrance --


            INT. OLDER BUILDING - STAIRWELL/CORRIDOR - DAY


            Blade is on Drake like a shadow.  We're internal now, the
            sound of Blade's LABORED BREATH moving to the foreground of
            the soundscape.


            Chaos.  A BARKING DOG darting from a doorway.  Up ahead, an
            OLD MAN has been knocked over.  An insane dash up two flights
            of stairs, then down a corridor, passing MORE TENANTS. 
            Somewhere, a WOMAN SCREAMS.  We hear GLASS BREAKING and --


                                WOMAN
                     My baby


            -- there's another open door --


            INT. OLDER BUILDING - APARTMENT - DAY


            -- Blade tears into an apartment, passing a HYSTERICAL WOMAN,
            an upended crib.  He SEES a broken window by a fire escape --


            EXT. OLDER BUILDING - FIRE ESCAPE - DAY


            Cut onto the fire escape.  A glimpse of Drake overhead.


            Blade clambers up the fire escape, moving in a near-blur.  One
            story of steps up the rickety metal ladder --


            SMASH!  A LARGE PLANTER comes down from above, nearly striking
            Blade.  He lets go with one hand, swings outward --


            -- then he's climbing again.  A CLOUD OF PIGEONS take wing,
            flapping frenetically about him, momentarily blinding him.


            Another story, a third, a fourth.  As he reaches the top,
            Blade jumps, catching the edge of the roof above him --


            EXT. OLDER BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAY


            -- FLIPPING himself over and onto the roof.  He lands in a cat
            stance, drawing his sword, quickly scanning the area.


                                DRAKE (O.S.)
                     So you're the hunter they all fear.


            Blade spins --


            DRAKE


            stands on the ledge of the roof, cradling an INFANT in his
            arms.  In the full glare of the afternoon sun.


                                DRAKE
                          (re: infant)
                     Just so we understand each other,
                     Daywalker.


            With his free hand, he massages his jaw.  We hear a few more
            Pieces of POPPING CARTKAGE as the very last of Drake's
            cermanent features seem to settee into clace.


                                BLADE
                     Why did you kill Vance?


                                DRAKE
                     He'd outlived his purpose.  He'd become a
                     liabi1ity.


            Drake nods at Blade's sword --


                                DRAKE
                     Your sword -- I've seen that hilt before. 
                     Eight or nine centuries ago.  The hunter
                     who carried it was an accomplished
                     fighter.


            EXT. SEASIDE CLIFF - DAY (THE PAST)


            Drake in his armor, head to head with a 14th century VAMPIRE
            HUNTER.  The hunter has BLADE'S SWORD.  Drake tears the sword
            from the hunter's grasp, turns it around, thrusts it back
            through the man's chest.  And as the man GASPS we are --


            EXT. OLDER BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAY (THE PRESENT)


            -- back to here and now.


                                DRAKE
                     He was honorable, in his own way.  He
                     died a good death.


                                BLADE
                     I wouldn't know about that.


                                DRAKE
                     You lie.  You're part of a grand
                     tradition, Blade.  You hunters have
                     plagued my people since the day we first
                     walked the earth.  And I have vanquished
                     them.  One by one.


            Blade pauses, looking for some kind of opening.


                                BLADE
                     How can you exist in the daylight?


                                DRAKE
                     I've always been able to.  Haven't you
                     read Mr. Stoker's fable?  I was the first
                     of the vampires.  I am unique.


                                BLADE
                          (realizing)
                     That's why they brought you back.


                                DRAKE
                     Yes.  My children seek to isolate the
                     properties in my blood that make me immune
                     to sunlight.  Through me, they believe
                     they can all become Daywalkers.


            Drake glances down at the street people.  Throngs of PEOPLE
            are massing there, pointing up at him.


                                DRAKE
                     The world's changed much since I went to
                     sleep.  How crowded it's become.  Look at
                     them down there.  Lives brief as
                     fireflies.  Do you think they can ever
                     grasp what it means to be immortal like
                     us?


                                BLADE
                     You're not immortal.  I must've heard a
                     hundred of you people make the same claim. 
                     And every one of them's seen the end of my
                     sword.


            Drake smiles, intrigued by an obviously worthy opponent.


                                DRAKE
                     Perhaps I will as well, then.  But I think
                     it's more likely that you will fall before
                     mine.
                          (beat)
                     Catch.


            Drake tosses the infant at Blade.  Blade twists around to
            catch it, scooping it safely up.  But when he looks back --


            -- Drake is gone.


                                KING (O.S.)
                     Shit!


            INT. VANCE INSTITUTE - VANCE'S OFFICE - DAY


            CLOSE ON King being propped up against the wall by Abigail.
            Blade has joined them.  King is in terrible pain.


                                KING
                     Jesus, it hurts.  I wanna be a vampire
                     again -- fuck!  Did you see that guy?!
                     We're gonna lose, man.  We're gonna
                     fucking lose.


            Abigail ignores King, cuts open his shirt.  She removes a
            small aerosol cannister from her belt.


                                BLADE
                     What's that?


                                ABIGAIL
                     Fibrin sealant foam, it's an elastic
                     protein.  Help me spread the wound open.
                     The foam should seal the hemorrhaging in
                     his body cavity from within --


            Together they spread the wound apart.  King is really hurting,
            breathing hard as he tries to fight back the pain.


                                KING
                     Hey, hey -- what'd the one lesbian
                     vampire say to the other?


                                ABIGAIL
                     Shut up, King.


                                KING
                     -- see you in twenty-eight days --


            King's voice trails off as he passes out.  Abigail triggers
            the dispenser, spraying a jet of compressed foam into it.  The
            foam condenses, sealing the wound up.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - DAY


            Blade and Abigail enter the HQ, hauling King between them. 
            Dex and Hedges rush to meet them, relieving them of King.


            Exhausted and covered in blood, Abigail retires to her
            quarters, stripping off her clothes.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS' HEADQUARTERS - SHOWERS - DAY


            Abigail stands beneath (he showerhead, turning her face up
            into the scalding spray, rinsing the blood from her body.


            CLOSE ON the drain by her feet, BLOOD swirling down it.  


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - INFIRMARY - DAY


            King drowses on a cot.  His shirt is off and his chest has
            been bandaged.  He opens his eyes, SEES Blade above him.


                                KING
                     Hey, Blade -- say we're successful.  Say
                     we wipe the vampires out.  What happens
                     then?  You ever ask yourself that?
                          (weakly)
                     Somehow I don't picture you parked on a
                     porch with a jigsaw puzzle.


            King drifts back into unconsciousness again, leaving Blade
            left to ponder his words.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - LABORATORY AREA - DAY


            Later, Sommerfield and Hedges consult with Blade and Abigail.


                                HEDGES
                     So basically we're in an arms race.
                     They're using Drake's DNA to build
                     themselves a better vampire --


                                BLADE
                          (noddin)
                     -- and we need his blood to kill them.
                          (to Sommerfield)
                     How's this weapon of yours coming along?


                                SODDERFIELD
                     We're almost there --


            She gestures to a series of ampule-like prototypes.  (We'll
            see the completed version of this device later on.)


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     The virus is harmless to humans.  So we
                     decided to go after the vampires' food
                     source.  The one thing we know for sure
                     about vampires is that they have to drink
                     blood. 
                     If we manage to pull this off, we'll be
                     able to contaminate every blood source on
                     the planet.  They won't have anyone left
                     to feed on.


                                ABIGAIL
                     Doesn't do us any good if we don't have
                     time to finish it.  We can't just sit
                     here.  We need to take the battle to them.


            Sommerfield lowers her head, thinking.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     If the vampires are trying to isolate the
                     hereditary factor in Drake that makes him
                     immune to sunlight, they'll require
                     certain kinds of laboratory equipment and
                     provisions.  For instance, there's an
                     enzyme called Taq Polymerase.  And there
                     are only a limited number of suppliers.
                          (beat)
                     Give me a few hours.  I'll see if I can't
                     hunt us up some leads.


                                                                  CUT TO:


            EXT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT


            Moving towards the mirrored windows we hear LABORED BREATHING.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DRAKE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT


            CLOSE ON hands clasped together -- a man and a woman's.


            CLOSE ON Danica' s face, covered in sweat, in the throes of
            passion.  She looks up, eyes glazed --


            PULL BACK to reveal Drake, propped above her, thrusting away.
            Danica has her limbs wrapped around Drake, holding on for dear
            life.  Both are awash in moonlight.


            The two of them climax.  Drake withdraws, studying Danica. 
            She's naked but for the tiny silver crucifix she wears around
            her neck.  Drake nudges the crucifix with his finger.


                                DRAKE
                     Why do you wear that -- symbol?


                                DANICA
                          (defensive)
                     Old habits --


            She sits up, draping a sheet over her.


                                DANICA
                     I was a good Catholic school girl	Once.


            Drake nods, his thoughts distant.


                                DRAKE
                     I was there when they crucified him.  He
                     died -- for their sins, not mine.


                                DANICA
                          (playful1y)
                     And what are your sins?  Would you care
                     to confess them?


                                DRAKE
                          (shaking his head)
                     Too numerous to remember.
                          (nodding at the crucifix)
                     Take it off.


                                DANICA
                     Why?


                                DRAKE
                     I'll make you a better one.


            Drake draws her in, biting her gently on the neck, sinking his
            fangs into her flesh.  He pulls his head back.  Two rivulets
            of BLOOD trickle from the fresh wounds.


                                DRAKE
                     There's an old saying --


            Drake reaches for the sheet, pulling it away from Danica's
            chest.  Then he dips his fingertips into her flowing blood -
            PAINTING a long streak of it down between her breasts.


                                DRAKE
                     Kill one man, you're a murderer. Kill a
                     million, a king.
                          (smiling)
                     Kill them all, a God.


                                                                  CUT TO:


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - STORAGE AREA - NIGHT


            CLOSE ON a pneumatic injector.  PULL BACK to reveal Blade
            injecting himself with his serum.  No pain.  No violent spasms
            like before.  Blade's body now accepts the serum.


            ANGLE ON ZOE,


            crouched on an old piece of carny equipment, watching him.


                                ZOE
                     Why do you do that?


                                BLADE
                     There's something bad inside of me.  This
                     keeps it from getting out.


            Zee considers this.


                                ZOE
                     Why can't you just be nice?



                                BLADE
                     Good question.


                                SOMMERFIELD (0.S.)
                     I think I've got a lead.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - LABORATORY AREA - NGHT


            Sommerfield stands at her computers, reading a tactile Braille
            display.  Blade and Abigail are nearby.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     Biomedica Enterprises.  They've been
                     buying up all sorts of supplies -- Taq
                     polymerase, bone marrow growth supplement,
                     genetic sequencing enzymes.


                                BLADE
                     We'll check it out.


                                                                  CUT TO:


            EXT. BIOMEDICA ENTERPRISES - NIGHT


            A high-tech research park.


            INT. BIOMEDICA ENTERPRISES - LAB - NIGHT


            Hendrix, the vampire doctor we saw earlier, sits at a computer
            workstation.  Chief Vreede confers with him.  We hear a KNOCK
            at the door.  Hendrix looks to Vreede.  They obviously weren't
            expecting anyone.


            Hendrix moves to the door, checking a surveillance monitor. 
            He can't see anyone outside.  He shrugs, turns to leave and --


            CRUNCH!  The door is SMASHED inward, taking much of the door
            frame with it, flattening Hendrix.


            Blade and Abigail step inside.  As Blade hauls Hendrix up from
            the ground, Abigail points her already drawn gun at --


            CHIEF VREEDE


            He was reaching into his jacket for his own piece, now thinks
            better of it.


                                BLADE
                     Doing a little moonlighting, Chief?


            Blade nods to Abigail.  She reaches onto Vreede's jacket to
            disarm him.  Blade grips Hendrix by the shirt collar.


                                BLADE
                     C'mere.  We need to talk.


            Blade PUNCHES Hendrix in the face.  Hendrix sags for a moment,
            stunned.


                                BLADE
                     Now spill it, bite-boy.


                                HENDRIX
                          (wiping a bloody nose)
                     You know what we're doing.  Drake has come
                     back to us.  Soon we'll all be Daywalkers.
                     And when that day comes, the world will
                     truly be ours.


            Blade nods towards the back of the lab where another door -- a
            very secure one -- is located.


                                BLADE
                     What's back there?


            Hendrix shoots a quick look to Vreede.  Then he turns on
            Blade, all fangs and claws, trying to tear Blade's eyes out --


            Abigail FIRES her UV gun with blinding speed and --


            -- Hendrix is dead before he knows it.  ASHING all over Blade.


            Blade brushes Hendrix' s remains from coat collar, shoots
            Abigail a look:  "Did you really have to do that?"


                                BLADE
                          (dryly)
                     Thanks.


            Abigail cringes.  Mea culpa.


            Blade looks to the floor.  Aside from some cinders, all that
            remains of Hendrix are his glasses and a singed keycard. 
            Blade picks up the keycard, looks to Vreede.


                                BLADE
                     What's behind Door Number One?


                                VREEDE
                     They'll kill me --


                                BLADE
                          (an evil grin)
                     So will I.  But I'll enjoy it more.


            Vreede nods.  They move towards the door.  Blade slides the
            security card.  An inset light changes from RED to GREEN. 
            Vreede punches in a numeric code.  The doors slide open --


            INT. BLOOD FARMING FACILITY - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT


            Blade, Abigail, and Vreede emerge into a cavernous room.


                                ABIGAIL
                     God in Heaven --


            HUNDREDS OF HUMAN CADAVERS


            hang from gantries, preserved in fluid-filled pods, suspended
            by wires like nightmarish marionettes.  The bodies are hooked
            up to an elaborate system of biosensor feeds and IVs which are
            designed to replenish vital nutrients.


                                BLADE
                     What was this place?


            Vreede pauses before answering, looking uncomfortable.


                                VREEDE
                     It's a blood farming facility.
                          (elaborating)
                     They decided that hunting humans on a
                     piece-meal basis was too inefficient. 
                     Why kill your prey when you can keep them
                     alive?  Productive.  Under optimal
                     conditions a donor can generate anywhere
                     from fifty to a hundred pints of blood a
                     year.


                                ABIGAIL
                          (sickened)
                     But where did you get all these people?


                                VREEDE
                     The streets.  In any given year you've got
                     two to three million homeless people
                     wandering around America --
                          (shrugging)
                     No one cares about them.  We're doing the
                     country a service, really.


            Blade shakes his head, admiring the horrible efficiency.


                                BLADE
                     The vampire Final Solution.


            Abigail moves towards one of the pods, touching her hand to
            the glass, studyihg the comatose person within.


                                ABIGAIL
                     Are they aware?  Do they feel anything?


                                VREEDE
                          (shaking his head)
                     They're in a chemical-induced coma.
                     They're brain-dead, vegetables.


            Blade angrily SLAMS Vreede's face against one of the pods.


                                BLADE
                     Look at this!  Is this the future you
                     want?  You think there's a place for you
                     in their world?


            Vreede starts crying, blubbering.


                                VREEDE
                     We don't have a choice!  They're going to
                     win, don't you see that?!  He's come back!
                     There's nothing stopping them now!


            Blade pulls Vreede back so they're nose to nose --


                                BLADE
                     There's me.


            -- and Blade releases Vreede.


                                BLADE
                     Go.  You've got thirty seconds.


            Vreede turns and runs, stumbling towards the door.  Despite
            his promise, Blade lifts his MACH.  Without even looking in
            Vreede's direction, Blade FIRES.  We hear Vreede drop.


            Blade turns to Abigail.  She can hardly contain herself.
            Nearby is a control console.  Blade UNLOADS his MACH pistol
            into it, damaging the interlinked life support systems.


            One by one, the vital signs and EKGs on the pods flat-line,
            their warning tones rising into a collective, PIERCING WAIL.

                          (feeling a heavy weight)
                     Let's go.


            Blade and Abigail leave, turning the lights out as they go.


                                                                  CUT TO:

            At the same time, Sommerfield is reading aloud to Zoe, who
            sits nearby.  The book is The Emerald City of Oz and it's in
            Braille.  Sommerfield scans with her fingers.

            We see Whistler approaching through the garage.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT


            The steel door slides open and Whistler enters.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - INFIRMARY AREA - NIGHT


            King drowses on a cot.  He hears a NOISE, opens his eyes.
            Whistler stands in the doorway.


                                KING
                     You get me those Fruit Roll-ups like I

                          (surprised)
                     Dude.  Aren't you dead?


            Whistler doesn't respond.  King tries to sit up -- but
            Whistler places his hand on King's mouth, shoving him down,
            starting to smother him.  King struggles, confused.


            INT. NGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - STORAGE AREA - NIGHT


            Dex manages to steal the ball from Hedges, makes a shot. 
            Behind them, Whistler enters the makeshift court.

            Abruptly, the sounds of the one-on-one game stop.  We hear a
            THUD from the back of the warehouse -- like someone falling.

            Sommerfield looks to the storage area.  The silence is
            unnerving.  She turns off her voice-synthesis program.  Then
            closes the book.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     Guys?  You okay --?


            ON THE DOORWAY


            The basketball comes bouncing out.  It rolls, coming to rest
            against a workbench.  There are BLOOD SPATTERS on the ball.


            Sommefrield reaches for her cane.  She TAP-TAPS her way to the
            baLl, feels the blood.  Knows what it is.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     Zoe, go find some place to hide, sweety.


            Zoe hesitates.  Sommerfield senses it and lashes out with her
            cane, BANGING a rack of equipment, startling the girl.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     Damnit, go!  Get out of here, Zoe!


            The girl scurries away.  Sommerfield TAP-TAPS with her cane,
            moving towards the storage area.  She finds a gun cabinet,
            feels around with her hands, locates an electronic pistol.


            INT. NGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - STORAGE AREA - NIGHT


            Sommerfield enters.  Dex and Hedges are sprawled on the floor
            before her, having been slaughtered.  Blood is everywnere. 
            She doesn't see them, of course.  But we do.


            THE CAMERA SHIFTS AROUND,


            revealing Whistler crouched right behind her!


            She's unaware of his presence.  And as we watch, his facial
            features shift.  We hear the sickening sounds of CARTILAGE
            POPPING and we realize that it's Drake, not Whistler.


            With mounting dread, Sommerfield turns towards the sound.  And
            then Drake is upon her, rushing forward with a GROWL.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - BATHROOM - NIGHT


            As Sommerfield's AGONIZED SCREAMS echo through the warehouse,
            Zoe rushes into the bathroom, looking for a place to hide. She
            considers the lockers, discounts them.  Then settles on --


            A HEATING GRATE


            near the floor.  It's about fourteen inches wide -- just
            barely big enough for her to squeeze into.


            Zoe kneels, prying the grate off.  Inside, a heating duct
            extends four feet before making a ninety-degree turn upward.
            Zoe climbs into the duct feet first, scooting her body
            backwards.  Then she reaches for the grate, securing it back
            on, sealing herself inside.


            INT. HEATING DUCT - NIGHT


            Zoe waits.  It's cramped and claustrophobic inside the duct. 
            She's managed to force herself all the way back to the ninety
            degree turn by curling up into a near fetal position.


            ZOE'S POV (THROUGH GRATE)


            Mostly tile floor and a small portion of the open doorway
            leading to the hallway outside.


            She listens, trying to hear past the sound of her own


            BREATHING which has been magnified because of the ducting.


            The screams from the outer rooms have stopped.  Then --


            ZOE'S POV (THROUGH GRATE)


            A pair of boots appear in the doorway -- Drake.


            Zoe holds her breath.  We HEAR Drake searching the bathroom,
            opening the lockers and bathroom stalls.


                                ZOE'S POV (THROUGH GRATE)
                     Drake's boot-clad feet pass by the grate
                     again, closer, tn~s time. They pause for
                     an interminable moment --


            Zoe shuts her eyes.  She can't stand it.  Finally, we hear
            Drake's FOOTSTEPS receding away.  Relieved, Zoe takes in a
            breath and opens her eyes --


            ZOE'S POV (THROUGH GRATE)


            Drake's face is right there.  pressed up against the other
            side of the grate, staring at her!


            Zoe SCREAMS.  With a ROAR, Drake rips the grate off.  He tries
            to climb inside, but the width of the duct is too narrow to
            accommodate the size of his upper body.


            Instead, he reaches his right arm in, extending his clawed
            hand as far as he possibly can.  Zoe WHIMPERS, trying to
            compress her mass into an even tighter ball --


            ON DRAKE'S HAND,


            having reached the limits of its extension -- his fingertips


            only a few scant inches from Zoe's face.


            Zoe's been allowed a moment's reprieve.  He can't reach her!


            But then we hear the sound of POPPING CARTILAGE.  Of TINY
            BONES shifting beneath Drake's flesh.  Drake's fingers are
            elongating, snake-like Reaching for Zoe's face, rapidly
            closing the space whici1 separates them --


            CUT TO:


            EXT. LUNA PARK/GARAGE - NIGHT


            The real Blade and Abigail are returning.  The sliding garage
            door opens and the Land Cruiser glides inside.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT


            Blade and Abigail enter.  The place is dark.  They know
            instinctively that somethong is wrong.


            Blade tries a nearby light.  The power is out.  They both draw
            their weapons.  Blade turns on a FLASHLIGHT.  They move onto
            the darkness --


            SHADOWS loom everywhere.  It's like a tornado touched down
            inside.  Equipment lies smashed, tables and chairs have been
            overturned.  Sommerfield's lab area has been destroyed.


                                ABIGAIL
                     King --


            Blade and Abigail rush to the infirmary area, but King is gone
            and the place has been trashed.  They move into --


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - STORAGE AREA - NIGHT


            -- the back area.  They find Dex and Hedges on the floor,
            their bodies bled, desecrated.


                                ABIGAIL
                          (realizing)
                     Zoe -- where's Zoe?


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - VARIOUS - NIGHT


            With increased urgency, Blade and Abigail search the
            headquarters -- the bathroom, the garage, every nook and
            cranny.  With each moment, Abigail becomes more panicked.


                                ABIGAIL
                     Where is she?!


            They can't find her anywhere.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - SHOWER AREA - NIGHT


            Blade and Abigail enter.  A thin stream of BLOOD snakes its
            way across the shower tiles.  Taey follow it, discovering --


            SOMMERFIELD,


            her body propped up mock-crucifixion style in the showers.  On
            the wall nearby, someone has written a message in blood:


                   "IMMORTALITY WILL COME TO SUCH AS ARE FIT FOR IT"


            ON BLADE


            He knows damn well who left him the message.


            As tears streak down Abigail's cheeks, she rushes to
            Sommmerfield's body.  Together, she and Blade get her down.


            Abigail clutches Sommerfield, slowly rocking the body in her
            arms.  Blade puts a hand on her shoulder.


                                BLADE
                     Use it.


            Abigail doesn't respond.  Her whole body is shaking.


                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                          (more firmly)
                     Use it.


            Abigail raises her head, her eyes filled with hatred.  Blade
            doesn't let up.  He's like a drill instructor, galvanizing her
            with his words.


                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                     USE IT!!!


            Abigail lifts her head toward the heavens, letting loose a
            TORTURED SCREAM that erupts from the very pit of her soul.


            CUT TO:


            EXT. PHOENIX TOWERS - NIGHT


            Abigail's SCREAM ECHOES over the moonlit cityscape.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT


            CLOSE ON King's bloody face.  A dog is licking it.  King
            stirs, his eyes fluttering open --


            KING'S POV


            The rottweiler we saw earlier is slobbering all over him.


            PULL BACK to reveal King on his knees, shirtless, both wrists
            secured behind him in a high-tech pillory.  King tries to
            twist his head away from the dog.  The rottweiler GROWLS.


                                KING
                     Back off, pooch --


            The rottweiler's jaws open, revealing more teeth than any dog
            should probably have.


            Its muzzle splits in two as both sides of the rottweiler
            mandible fold back on either side of its head, disgorging a
            hellish and barbed tongue stalk!  The mutant dog ROARS, ready
            to bite King's face off and --


                                KING
                     Jesus Christ!


            -- Grimwood appears from off-screen, LAUGHING, pulling the
            animal back.  We see Danica and Asher now as well.


                                KING
                     What the fuck?!  WHAT THE FUCK?!?


                                ASHER
                     His name's Beau.  We've been experimenting
                     with porting the vampire gene over into
                     other species.


            As Asher pets the rottweiler, its muzzle closes back up again. 
            It looks up at him, panting happily, tongue lolling.


                                KING
                     You made a goddamn vampire dog?!


                                GRIMWOOD
                     Yeah.  Cool, huh?


                                DANICA
                     Poor little King.  You look so
                     distraught.


            Danica wipes a little blood from the corner of King's mouth. 
            She touches her fingertips to her tongue, tasting his blood.


                                DANICA
                     You're tasting a little bland, lover.  Not
                     getting enough fatty acids in your diet? 
                     Have you tried mackerel?  Lake trout?


                                KING
                     How about you take a sugar-frosted fuck
                     off the end of my dick?


                                DANICA
                     Oh, there'll be time to play doctor later,
                     believe me.  But for now, we need to have
                     a little talk.
                          (beat)
                     Tell us about this bio-weapon you've been
                     building.


                                KING
                     I can tell you two things.  Diddly.  And
                     shit.  And diddly just left the building.


            Grimwood steps forward, throttling King for a moment.


                                GRINWOOD
                     Spit it out, you fucking fruitcake!


                                KING
                     Okay, here's the deal with the weapon -
                     (coughing)
                     It's a new flavor crystal formula.  Twice
                     the chocolaty-goodness, half the calories.
                     Plus, it helps prevent tooth decay --


            Grimwood moves in to choke him again, but Danica intervenes.


                                DANICA
                     You're brave, King, I'll give you that.
                     But underneath all your swagger --


            She leans closer, caressing his face.


                                DANICA
                     -- I know what you really fear.   What
                     would hurt you more than anything else.


            King's smile falters for a moment.  Maybe she does know.  She
            rubs her cheek against his.


                                DANICA
                     You don't want to go back to being one of
                     us --
                          (her lips grazing his)
                     -- do you?


            King tries to turn his head away, but Danica grips his chin,
            turning his head back.  He's sweating now.  Worried.


                                DANICA
                     I'm going to bite you again, King.  And
                     then I'm going to leave you here while you
                     turn.  I'm going to watch you, day after
                     day, while the Thirst keeps building and
                     building.  And then, when you can't stand
                     it anymore --


            She nods.  Drake appears, holding Zoe.  She's alive. 
            Terrified.  Held firm in Drake's arms.


                                DANICA
                     -- I'm going to bring the little girl
                     for you to feed on.  Would you like that,
                     King?  Would you enjoy taking her life?


            King shuts his eyes, sickened at the thought.  Danica smiles.


                                DANICA
                     Now we're getting somewhere, my pet.


                                                                  CUT TO:


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS' HEADQUARTERS - SHOOTING RANGE - NIGHT


            Abigail sits in her workshop area, restringing one of her
            bows.  Nearby is a table with an assortment of equipment -- a
            bow press, vise stand, string jig, bow scales and wrench sets.


            Across the way is a shooting range with a variety of targets
            set up, a wall of netting behind them to catch stray arrows. 
            There's also a chronograph outfitted with a ballistic computer
            to measure arrow speed.


            CLOSE ON Abigail's hands as she works with a quiet precsion,
            re-setting the arrow rest, making minor adjustments to the
            center-shot position and wheel timing, etc.


            BLADE


            appears in the doorway, watching her.


                                BLADE
                     You alright?


                                ABIGAIL
                          (brusque)
                     I'll be fine.


            Blade nods.  He's going to leave her alone -- but then he
            hesitates, wrestling to say something.


                                BLADE
                     Don't let it turn inward.


            Abigail takes a deep breath, pausing in her work.


                                ABIGAIL
                     It already has.  Since I can remember
                     I've had this knife of sadness in my
                     heart.  As long as it stays there, I'm
                     strong.  I'm untouchable.  But the moment
                     I pull it out --
                          (turning back to him)
                     -- I'll die.


            Blade nods.  He understands all too well.  He leaves.


            ON ABIGAIL


            She stands, moving to the shooting range.  She straps on a
            quiver, takes aim at


            A 3-D HUMAN-SHAPED TARGET


            about a hundred feet away.  Just in front of the target is the
            chronograph, which looks like a miniature set of goal posts.


            WHOOSH!  Abigail FIRES an arrow.  It flies through the arms of
            the chronograph, sinking into the targets s chest.  On the
            screen of the ballistic computer, the arrow's speed is clocked
            at 240 feet per second.  We move CLOSER to her now as--


            WHOOSH!  Abicail FIRES again. The speed is 242 fps. CLOSER --


            WHOOSH!  Now the speed is 269 fps. EVEN CLOSER --


            WHOOSH!WHOOSH!WHOOSH!  285 fps.  302 fps.  315 fps!  The arrow
            speed creeps up and up as we move CLOSER AND CLOSER to Abigail
            until we --


            -- PULL BACK.  Abigail has fired every arrow in her quiver. 


            ON THE TARGET


            The arrows have formed a cross in the target's chest.  One
            vertical grouping running up, another horizontal grouping
            bisecting it.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - GARAGE - NIGHT


            Blade stands at the open entrance.  Abigail steps out.  Looks
            like she's made peace with herself for the moment.


                                ARIGAIL
                     I'm ready to go.


            HEADLIGHTS appear in the distance.  Another Land Cruiser
            approaches, weaving through the amusement park.  It pulls to a
            stop in front of them.  The driver's side window rolls down.


            A MAN (CAULDER)


            sits behind the wheel.  He raises a hand in greeting.


                                CAULDER
                     My name is Caulder.  And I'll be your
                     driver this evening.


            INT. CAULDER'S LAND CRUISER - NIGHT


            Caulder's Land Cruiser glides through the streets.


                                BLADE
                     Where are you taking us?


                                CAULDER
                     Another safehouse.


                                ABIGAIL
                     We told you, Blade.  We operate in sleeper
                     cells.  When one goes down, a new cell
                     activates to pick up the slack.


            EXT. DEEP-SIX AQUARIUM STOCK - NIGHT


            Caulder pulls up in front of a fish supply store.


            INT. DEEP-SIX AQUARIUM STOCK - NIGHT


            Caulder unlocks an accordion security gate, opens the door. 
            He leads Blade and Abigail through the darkened aisles.  There
            are fish tanks on either side, aerators BUBBLING, aquatic
            animals of every kind swimming about.


            IN THE BACK


            is another arsenal/lab area.  This one is smaller than the
            Nightstalkers' main headquarters.  Caulder moves to a
            computer, calls up a file.  A dialogue box for a media player
            opens.  Caulder activates a video file.


                                CAULDER
                     Sommerfield left a video message for you.


            ON THE MONITOR


            The video plays.  We see Sommerfield's face on the screen. 
            She looks grave, as if she might have been crying.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                          (on video)
                     If you're watching this, I'm already dead.
                     If Zoe's still alive, I want you to
                     promise you'll take care of her.  I've
                     been reading her The Oz books every night. 
                     We just started The Emerald City of Oz,
                     the one with the Nome King --


            Her voice cracks and she pauses, wiping away a tear.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     I think I've managed to cultivate a
                     workable strain of the Daystar virus.  As
                     a precaution, I transmitted the genetic
                     sequence to Caulder, in case our main
                     stock was destroyed.  In order for it to
                     achieve maximum lethality, you'll need to
                     interfuse it with Drake's blood.  If it
                     works, any vampires in the immediate
                     vicinity should die almost instantly. 
                     After that, it should take only a few
                     weeks for the virus to spread throughout
                     the rest of the world.


            Zoe hesitates, deciding how to broach the next subject.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     There's one other thing, Blade.  You need
                     to know that there's a chance the virus
                     could destroy you too.  Because you're a
                     hybrid, I'm not sure whether your immune
                     system will be able tolerate it.
                          (beat)
                     I'm sorry.  We didn't have enough time to
                     properly test it.


            The video cuts to STATIC.  Abigail turns off the monitor,
            looking to Blade.  God only knows what he's thinking.


                                CAULDER
                     Take a look at the plague arrow.


            Caulder reaches for a refrigerated aluminum case, snapping it
            open.  Inside, resting on a bed of form-fitting foam, is a
            glass ampule that's been fitted into a stake-like contraption. 
            It looks like the head of a high-tech harpoon.


                                CAULDER
                     I only had time to fabricate a small batch
                     of Daystar.  I outfitted it with a
                     compressed gas projectile, so you should
                     be able to fire it from one of the
                     fourbarrel rifles or a bow.
                          (beat)
                     Just make sure the shot counts, cause we
                     don't have enough for a second try.


            A SERIES OF DISSOLVES


            Abigail sits before a laptop, creating another custom MP3
            playlist.  We watch as she hi-lights songs with her mouse,
            moves them over to her portable device with a few CLICKS.


            Abigail unhooks her MP3 device, slips her earbud headphones
            into her ears.  The SOUNDS of Fluke's track Atom Bomb fade up,
            gradually shifting from tinny source music to SOUNDTRACK.


            MORE DISSOLVES


            Blade and Abigail suit up, arming themselves.  We SEE:


            Blade loading rounds into his pistols.


            Abigail selecting arrows, checking the range-dials.


            Blade sliding silver stakes into his bandoliers.


            Abigail working with Caulder, affixing the plague capsule to
            one of her arrowheads.


            Blade polishes his sword.  Finished, he sights down the length
            of it, takes a practice swing, then secures it in his back
            scabbard with a flourish.


            EXT. DEEP-SIX AQUARIUM STOCK - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT


            We hear the RUMBLE of two motorcycles.  Blade emerges from the
            alley astride his signature Ducati ST2 crotch-rocket.  Abigail
            appears a moment later on her own customized bike.


            Blade revs his engine.  Then the two bikes take off.


                                                                  CUT TO:


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DRAKE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT


            Drake sits before Zoe, who has been shackled to the wall, his


            right arm encased in one of the armored gauntlets from his
            burial armor.  The rest of the armor has been propped up on a
            stand nearby.


                                DRAKE
                     Do you know who I am?


                                ZOE
                     You're the Nome King.


            Drake smiles at this.


                                DRAKE
                     The Nome King.  I like that.
                          (leaning closer)
                     Tell me, child.  Do you want to die?


            Zoe is terrified but tries to remain defiant.


                                ZOE
                     I'm not afraid -- I'll go to Heaven.


                                DRAKE
                     There is no Heaven.  No God.  No angels.
                     No happy ending for good little girls.
                     The only thing you have to look forward to
                     is nothingness.


            As Drake talks his pupils seem to widen -- until the darkness
            nearly occludes the whites of his eyes.  Zoe stares at him. 
            Can't tear her gaze away.  His eyes are hypnotic.


                                DRAKE
                     But what if you could change that?  What
                     if you could remain a child forever?


            He reaches out, running a sharp fingernail over her cheek.


                                DRAKE
                     What if you could keep this little doll-
                     like face of yours until the sun itself
                     cooled to a cold, hard rock?
                          (beat)
                     Wouldn't you like that?  Wouldn't you
                     accept that gift?


            Zoe reaches out, calmly touches Drake's cheek.


                                ZOE
                     My friends are coming to kill you.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT


            WHACK!  Grimwood PUNCHES King, whose body sags, weakened from
            the beatings he has undergone.  Asher and Danica look on.


                                KING
                     -- gonna be sorry you did that --


                                ASHER
                     Nobody's coming for you, King.


                                KING
                     Sure they are.  Left a trail of digital
                     bread crumbs --


                                DANICA
                     Excuse me?


                                KING
                     One thing you need to know about us
                     Nightstalkers.  When you join our club,
                     you get this nifty little tracking node
                     surgically implanted in your body --


                                GRIMWOOD
                     Bullshit.


                                KING
                     Scout's honor.  One of us gets lost, the
                     others just dial up the satellite and
                     presto, instant cavalry.


            Grimwood looks to Asher and Danica, unsure.


                                AS HER
                     He's bluffing.


                                DANICA
                          (smiling, playing along)
                     Okay, King, where did they put this
                     tracking node of yours?


            He motions for her to draw closer, whispering.


                                KING
                     It's in my left ass-cheek --


            WHACK!  Danica slaps King's face, making him see stars.


                                KING
                     Alright.  alright, it's in my right ass-
                     cheek --


            WHACK!  Danica slaps King again, this time knocking his head
            the other way.  He spits out blood --


                                KING
                     No, seriously --
                          (gasping)
                     -- it's in the meat of my butt, right
                     below my Bart Simpson tattoo --


            Danica PUNCHES King's mid-section.  He sucks air.  Despite his
            attempts at humor, he's hurting now.  His body sags --


                                KING
                     -- pull down my tighty-whities -- see for
                     yourself.


                                DANICA
                     ENOUGH!  It's not funny anymore!


            Behind Danica, Grimwood and Asher both COUGH.


            King lifts his bruised face, staring up at Danica through
            blood-shrouded eyes.  For the first time, we get a sense of
            his true hatred for her.


                                KING
                     No, it's not, you horse-humping bitch --
                          (wincing as he breathes)
                     -- but it will be a few seconds from now.


                                DANICA
                          (coughing)
                     And what happens then, lover?


                                KING
                     Hammer time.
                          (beat)
                     See, that tickle in your throat you're
                     feeling right now?


            Danica COUGHS again, blinks repeatedly, as if her eyes were
            irritated.  She rubs them, looks to the others.  They're
            feeling the effects too.  And Grimwood's face is smoking!


                                KING
                     That's atomized colloidal silver.


            Danica keys into the RUMBLE of the air-conditioning system and
            a HISSING SOUND beneath that.  She looks up --


                                KING
                     It's being pumped into the building's air
                     conditioning system.


            ANGLE ON THE HEATING REGISTER ABOVE


            We GO MACRO, shrinking down until we see a CLOUD OF TINY
            SILVER PARTICLES blowing into the room.  The particles are
            dusting the vampires, being unwittingly inhaled by them and --


            WE'RE BACK TO NORMAL


            as the vampires react en mass, suddenly gagging, their throats
            and faces on fire.


                                KING
                     Which means that the fat lady should be
                     singing right about --


            GRIMWOOD


            has caught the worst of it.  A whole lung-full.  He SHRIEKS as
            He coughs up blue-tinged FLAMES, the flesh on his face
            simultaneously burning away and --


                                KING
                     -- NOW


            THE SKYLIGHT ABOVE THEM


            SHATTERS as Blade crashes down.  He lands in a cat-like
            stance, then flips over into a cartwheel, KICKING Grimwood in
            the face.  As Grimwood goes down, Asher and Danica scatter --


            Blade tackles Grimwood, sending both of them over the railing
            into the lower level of the penthouse.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT


            ALARMS are ringing.  Asher and Danica rush down the hall,
            trying not to breathe the silver-contaminated air.  We SEE
            other vampires staggering from doorways, COUGHING, GAGGING.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DRAKE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT


            Drake hears the ALARMS.  He reaches for his sword, which rests
            in a nearby stand.  As he heads out, he strides past Zoe,
            still chained to the wall.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT


            On the lower level, Blade and Grimwood are going at it.


            REINFORCENENTS


            flood in from multiple entry ways.  It's an all-out melee. 
            Blade is seriously overwhelmed, but the sheer number of
            vampires and humans is actually slowing them down.


            Blade takes on a half-dozen of them at once, stunning one of
            the familiars, using him as a human shield, TOSSING him aside
            to trip up another on-rushing pair.


            Then he pauses, instantly calculating the geography of the
            room, the relative positions of the other combatants,
            assessing decorations and furniture as possible weapons.  His
            battle plan ready, Blade engages his enemies once again.


            MEANWHILE, ON THE UPPER LEVEL


            Abigail appears at the lip of the smashed-in skylight.  She
            lowers herself down on a rope, rushes to King's side --


                                ABIGAIL
                     You alright?


                                KING
                     Nothing a hot tub full of Bactine won't
                     fix.


            Abigail hits the release switch on the high-tech pillory and
            the cuffs around his wrists open.  As Abigail helps King out:


                                ABIGAIL
                     Zoe --


                                KING
                     Drake's got her.


            Abigail nods, handing King her pistol.  Then she's out the
            door.  Seconds later, King follows --


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAYS - VARIOUS - NIGHT


            Abigail pauses, slipping her earbuds in, turning on her MP3
            player.  The bumping-strains of Fluke's Absurd track kick in. 
            Abigail uncilps her UV arc, telescopes it outward and --


            -- suddenly it's like we're in a first-person shooter video
            game.  She moves through the corridors with mathematical
            precision, feeling the MUSIC in her bones, slicing through
            every vampire she encounters with deadly efficiency.


            VAMPIRES AND HUMAN FAMILIARS


            are coming out from every doorway.


            Abigail PUNCHES one in the solar plexus, DECAPITATES another,
            finishes off the first.  Then she's moving on, taking down a
            third, fourth, and fifth vampire with her rapid-fire stake
            dispenser.  Throwing stakes with blinding speed.


            After a half-dozen stakes, her dispenser is empty.  Without
            missing a beat, she presses a tab on the dispenser, ejects the
            clip, then reaches to her belt where a back-up is secured and
            slaps it in place.  The mayhem continues.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT


            Blade unsheathes his sword.  He parries two combatants with
            clubs, then whirls around, DEFLECTING a GUNSHOT from a third
            with the flat of his sword.


            Grimwood is furious.  His men are tripping all over
            themselves.  He grabs an antique battle axe that's secured to
            the wall.  He sees an opening, SWINGS at Blade's head --


            -- Blade drops and the axe slices through one of Grimwood's
            own men.


            In an eye-blink, Blade is up again, advancing.  He cuts down
            another familiar, pushes forward, cuts oown a second --


            Now Blade and Grimwood are face to face.  Grimwood swings his
            axe again.  Blade hooks his sword beneath it, FLIPPING it from
            Grimwood's hands.


            Blade sweeps his sword around in a wide arc, CUTTING straight
            through Grimwood's mid-section.  The upper half of Grimwood's
            body topples away --


            -- then he rights himself.  A half-vampire.  He's still alive,
            running forward on his hands, trailing viscera.  He SPRINGS UP
            at Blade, all claws and gnashing teeth.


            Blade catches Grimwood by the throat, whirls him around --


            --  and manages to IMPALE what's left of Grimwood with his
            sword-point.  Grimwood ASHES in Blade's arms.  The only thing
            left are his steel teeth, which CLATTER to the floor at
            Blade's feet.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DRAKE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT


            Abigail enters, SEES Zoe.  TWO VAMPIRES GUARDS stand nearby. 
            In a flash, Abigail flings TWO SILVER STAKES at them.  Both
            stakes hit their mark and the vamps crumple to ASH.


            Abigail hurries over, SHOOTS apart the lock on Zoe's shackle.
            Zoe wraps her arms around Abigail, hugging her tight.  Abigail
            takes Zoe by the hand, pulling her towards the door.


                                ABIGAIL
                     Come on, hon.  Let's get you out of here.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT


            King stumbles out into the hallway, pulling his shirt back on. 
            As he limps down the corridor, a GROWL makes him pause --


            KING'S POV


            Beau, the vampire rottweiler, lopes around the corner.  Then --


            TWO MORE ROTTWEILERS


            emerge behind Beau.  They're all GROWLING now.


                                KING
                          (under his breath)
                     Fuck.  Me.  Sideways.


            The three of them break, BARKING like crazy, snouts splitting
            open as their jaws flower apart.


            CUT T0:


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT


            Blade moves into the upper gallery of a vast atrium.


            DRAKE


            stands before him, waiting, sword in hand.  He extends it,
            touching the tip to the floor.  A challenge.


                                DRAKE
                     Are you ready to die, Blade?


                                BLADE
                     Been ready since the day I was born,
                     mother-fucker.


                                DRAKE
                          (with a smile)
                     Then allow me to accommodate you.


            Drake does a back-flip over the balcony.  Forty feet down.


            Blade follows, drawing his sword as he LEAPS --


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT


            -- and lands.  Now the two warriors face each other, swords
            raised, eyes locked, their stances frozen.  Like classic
            samurai.  Whoever moves first, loses.


            Beat.  MOVING IN on both men, CIRCLING around them.  Slow the
            heart.  Slow the breath.  Find the opening.


            DRAKE


            breaks first, bringing his sword over in less time than it
            takes to blink an eye.  No one could possibly deflect the
            blow.  And yet --


            BLADE


            manages a COUNTER-STROKE with super-human grace.  He advances,
            parries, his sword CLANGING and SINGING like a blacksmith's
            hammer on sheet metal.


            Cut, thrust, block, diagonal downward slashes.  The moves come
            faster.  Drake DUCKS, barely avoiding being decapitated. 
            Blade's sword cuts right through a column instead.


            Drake retaliates.  Blade locks swords with him.  For a moment,
            the two warriors are nose to nose.  Then Blade twists his
            sword free, cutting open Drake's cheek --


            Drake GROWLS, back-flipping up onto a ledge.  He touches his
            fingertips to the cut, tastes his own blood.  Then we hear the
            telltale sounds of CARTILAGE POPPING.  For a brief moment, his
            facial features shift, giving us yet another glimpse of his
            true form.  As his anger increases, Drake begins to devolve.


            He DIVES at Blade, HOWLING, raking his CLAWS at Blade's face. 
            He strikes out, KNOCKING Blade across the atrium.  He SPRINGS
            forward, dragging Blade up by his throat, sinking his fangs
            into Blade's shoulder.  Blide SCREAMS and we --


                                                                  CUT TO:


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT


            -- as King runs.  He hazards a look back.  The vampire dogs
            are quickly gaining on him.


            UP AHEAD


            It's a dead-end.  Just plate glass windows and a whole lot of
            nothing beyond.


            The dogs are almost on King when suddenly, King JUMPS,
            snagging an overhead pipe.  As he swings his body upward --


            THE DOGS


            skid on the floor, unable to stop their momentum, and CRASH
            straight through the plate glass window.


            EXT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT


            An EXPLOSION OF GLASS as two of the vampire rottweilers tumble
            into the night.  They fall like stones -- twenty stories down
            into the traffic-clogged intersection below.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT


            King drops back to the floor, cackling, pleased with himself. 
            It takes him a second to realize that --


            ONE OF THE ROTTWEILERS (BEAU)


            -- didn't take a swan dive out the window.  He's right behind
            King.  And now he's SPRINGING FORWARD --


            WHAM!  King is hit in the chest by the SNARLING beast.  He
            drops the pistol as he's knocked back onto the floor.  The dog
            LUNGES again --


            With one arm, King struggles to keep his face from being bit
            off, while searching blindly for the discarded pistol.  King
            locates it, FIRING into the beast's chest --


            THE ROTTWEILER


            ASHES, disintegrating all over King's face.  King gets a
            mouthful of the charcoal remains, tries to SPIT them out.


                                KING
                          (making a face)
                     Bad dog.


                                                                  CUT TO:


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT


            Abigail emerges onto the gallery with Zoe.  She spots an
            alcove, indicates that Zoe should hide.  Then she slips a
            silver stake into Zoe's hand.  Just in case.


            Abigail rushes to the handrail, looking down at Blade and
            Drake.  Her view is obscured.  She can't get a good shot.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT


            Drake digs his fangs into Blade's shoulder.  Blade struggles,
            manages to slip a stake from his bandolier --


            WHAM!  Blade SLAMS the stake into Drake's ear canal.  The
            beast SHRIEKS in pain, dropping Blade.  But all the gambit has
            done is drive Drake into a berserker rage.


            Drake swings his fist.  Blade ducks.  Drake's fist goes
            through the wall, PUNCTURING a steam pipe.  Steam vents --


            Drake reaches in, RIPS an eight-foot section of the pipe from
            the wall, bringing a SPARKING nest of electrical cables along
            with it.  He swings the pipe section around, WHACKING Blade.


            KRUNCH!  Drake swings the makeshift club again.  He's a one
            man demolition crew, decimating everything in his path.  He's
            SMASHING holes in the floor, the walls, plowing through
            partitions of glass and steel.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT


            Abigail moves down the gallery, looks up --


            A SERIES OF LIGHTING GANTRIES


            span the length of the atrium ceiling.


            Abigail balances on the handrail, then jumps out into space --


            -- catching hold of one of the crosspieces.  Like an acrobat,
            she monkey-swings her way beneath the gantry.  If she loses
            her grip, she'll fall more than fifty feet.


            BA-BANG!  A bullet strikes just in front of Abigail, showering
            her with SPARKS.  MORE BULLETS follow.


            ANGLE ON PAIR OF VAMPIRES


            FIRING from below, trying to pick her off.  Suddenly, UV
            BULLETS strike each of the vampires.  As they ASH we --


            WHIP-PAN BACK TO KING,


            having dragged his battered body out onto the upper gallery. 
            He's playing guardian angel to Abigail, laying down cover fire
            so she can continue.  But then --


                                DANICA
                     KING!!!


            DANICA


            appears behind King.  She TACKLES him, wrestling him to the
            floor, pummeling his face with her fist.


            King tries to ward of f the blows, but he's sorely outmatched.
            He swings his electronic pistol up --


            Danica twists it from his grip, ejecting the clip from the
            stock.  King's sun dog bullets spill out all over the floor. 
            She tosses the gun aside, reaches for King again --


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - LIGHTING GANTRY - NIGHT


            Back to Abigail.  She's breathing heavily, trying to call up
            new reserves of strength.  She glances down --


            Big mistake.


            She forces herself to look back up.  She swings herself
            pendulum-style, manages to snag yet another crosspiece.  A
            SHOT RINGS OUT --


            ANGLE ON ASHER,


            down below, armed with a rifle.  He FIRES again --


            -- grazing Abigail's shoulder with the bullet.  Abigail CRIES
            OUT, nearly losing her grip.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT


            King rolls on his side, spits out a bloody tooth.


                                KING
                     No offense, Danica --
                          (gasping in pain)
                     -- but I've wanted to kill you since the
                     moment we slept together.


                                DANICA
                     I was that bad, huh?


            King reaches a palsied hand for his discarded pistol, points
            it vaguely in Danica's direction.  She LAUGHS.


                                DANICA
                     No bullets in your gun, King.


                                KING
                     Yeah, but here's the beauty --
                          (wiping his bloody mouth)
                     -- these babies can be triggered remotely.


            King pulls the trigger.  The scattered sun dog bullets ERUPT
            with UV LIGHT.  Danica SHRIEKS, trying to shield her already
            burning face from the glare.  She runs, horribly wounded.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT


            Drake pummels Blade, flinging his body about like a ragdoll. 
            He grabs Blade by his ankle, swings him upwards some thirty
            feet --


            SMASH!  Blade collides with the underside of a massive hanging
            glass chandelier/lighting fixture.


            Blade FALLS back to the ground, stunned, dropping his sword. 
            Drake pounces on him.  Blade can barely fend off Drake's blows
            anymore.  In desperation he digs his fingers into Drake's
            eyes.


            Drake swings both fists downward, Hulk-style, SHATTERING an
            entire section of the limestone flooring.


            A SHOCK-WAVE ripples out from the point of impact, sending
            waves of two-foot stone tiles flipping up into the air,
            knocking Blade off his feet.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT


            King loads a sun dog into his pistol, steadies his aim on the
            railing, and FIRES at Asher --


            THE SUN DOG


            screams across the atrium, striking dead-center in Asher's
            open mouth.  The bullet EXPLODES.  UV LIGHT causes Asher's
            skull to burn up from the inside out.  His headless corpse
            falls forward over the gallery railing.  Then it too
            carbonizes and BURNS UP.


            Relieved, King sinks to his knees.


            BEHIND KING,


            we SEE Zoe slip from the alcove.  She makes for the stairs.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - LIGHTING GANTRY - NIGHT


            King has bought Abigail more time.  She swings her body
            forward, hooking her legs over the next crosspiece.  Then she
            lets go with her hands.  Now she is hanging upside down,
            secured only by the tension in her calves.


            Abigail reaches behind her, removes her bow.  BLOOD from her
            wounded shoulder drips down over her collar bone, reaching her
            cheek, briefly obscuring her vision.  She wipes it away.  Then
            she reaches back once more and --


            -- because her quiver is pointed downward, a number of arrows
            slide out. Abigail panics, twisting her body --


            -- managing to lust barely snag the ~la~ue arrow as it tumbles
            Past her!


            Beat.  Abigail shuts her eyes, trying to find her center. 
            With her eyes closed, she nocks the arrow and draws the bow
            back.  Then she opens her eyes.


            She's only going to get one shot -- and she's going to have to
            take it while hanging upside down.


168 a       ABIGAIL'S POV                                      168 a  


            On Drake and Blade below, locked in combat.  She tracks their
            progress, waits for Drake to move into a better position --


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT


            Drake shoulders a support column, SNAPPING it in two.  An
            entire section of the gallery walkway above comes CRASHING
            DOWN, burying Blade in debris --


            -- but it's not enough for Drake.  He LEAPS forward, fishing
            Blade out, hauling him up --


            Drake head-butts Blade -- once, twice.  Blade's eyes roll to
            whites.  Drake looks down, SEES Blade's discarded sword. 
            Drake scoops it up, STRIKES at Blade --


            Blade manages to roll to the side, avoiding the blow.


            Drake STRIKES again, dealing Blade a glancing blow --


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - LIGHTING GANTRY - NIGHT


            ON ABIGAIL.  Waiting.  More blood has trickled down her neck,
            into her eyes.  But she can't wipe them anymore.  She's
            already got her bow drawn.  She's committed to the shot.


            We can hear ABIGAIL'S HEARTBEAT as she settles.  She takes a
            final breath, holds it -- and lets the plague arrow fly.


            ON THE PLAGUE ARROW


            as it streaks downward, hurtling towards Drake at more than
            300 feet per second.  Then, at the last possible instant	--


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT


            CHINGG!  Drake deflects the arrow with his sword.  It
            harmlessly falls to the floor, rolling a few yards away.


            ON ABIGAIL,


            stunned, her expression melting into despair.


            BACK TO DRAKE


            swinging Blade's sword around.  PLUNGING it into Blade's side.
            As he pulls it back out again --


            BLADE


            GASPS, sinking downward.  He's on his knees now, in shock.


            Drake ROARS again shifting, conjuring up seventy centuries of
            violence and predation.  And the nightmare shape that was only
            hinted at before, finally takes center-stage.


            BLOOD suffuses Drake's flesh, turning his skin crimson.  His
            canines elongate, his lower jaw distends. 
            Jagged bone spurs erupt all over his body -- like he's growing
            a suit of razor-sharp thorns.  He doesn't need a sword
            anymore.  He's become a living weapon.  Drake is gone.  Now he
            is --


            THE BEAST


            Drake swings the sword overhead.  He's going to decapitate
            Blade.  And just as the sword reaches the top of its arc --


            ZOE


            emerges from the shadows behind Drake, clutching a silver
            stake.  She SHOVES it into Drake's back,  pushing with all the
            strength her little body can muster.


            Drake staggers.  The blow wasn't lethal, but it hurt all the
            same.  He turns on Zoe, enraged, his attention distracted for
            one crucial second --


            ON BLADE,


            summoning the last of his reserves.  He pitches his body
            forward, managing to snag the end of the plague arrow.  And
            before Drake even realizes what is happening --


            WHAM!  Blade sinks the plague arrow deep into Drake's chest. 
            Drake drops the sword, turning back to face Blade --


            Exhausted beyond measure, Blade sags.


            INSIDE DRAKE'S CHEST - MACRO SHOT


            as the arrowhead dispense the bio-weapon.  We SEE the virus
            flooding Drake's internal organs, causing them to blacken as
            his circulatory system carries it throughout his body.


            ON DRAKE'S FACE,


            letting loose an INHUMAN SCREAM, vomiting up a spray of blood
            mist.  His monstrous features begin to melt, reshaping into
            his more familiar face.  At the same time we --


            GO MACR0 ONCE MORE


            Shrinking until we are amidst the spray of blood Drake
            expelled.  We continue shrinking until we are moving with the
            individual molecules of Drake's breath as the plague virions
            latch onto them, causing them to blacken and become necrotic. 
            Moving with the twirling molecules until they are inhaled by --


            DANICA,


            having retreated from her defeat by King.  She clutches her
            throat.  We can see the virus infiltrating her system as tiny
            BLACK THREADS expand across her face.  She sways, falling onto
            the floor.  She reaches a beseeching hand towards King --


            -- then dies, a final still-born curse on her lips.


            MORE VAMPIRES


            are feeling the effects now too.  One by one they drop,
            choking, going into convulsions.  As they writhe on the floor,
            we watch the Daystar virus ravaging their bodies.


            BACK TO BLADE AND DRAKE


            Drake slumps against the wall.  Hero and villain are now
            separated by only a few feet.  Both at death's door.


                                DRAKE
                     Well done, hunter.  Well done.


            Blade stares back.  At this point, he's just trying to remain
            conscious.  He's lost a ton of blood.


                                DRAKE 
                     You fought with honor --


            Drake shudders, his breathing becoming increasingly shallow.


                                DRAKE
                     -- as I knew you would.  The humans are
                     coming for you, you know.  In their eyes,
                     you and I are the same.
                     Allow me one last indulgence, then --
                          (gasping)
                     -- a parting gift --


            Drake grows still, his eyes locked on Blade's.


            ABIGAIL AND KING


            rush to Blade's side.  Zoe joins them.  Blade is dying, fading
            fast.  Abigail shakes Blade --


                                ABIGAIL

                     Blade!


            Her voice sounds distant and muted, overridden by Blade's own
            HEARTBEAT which is fading up, dominating the soundtrack.


                                ABIGAIL
                     BLADE!!!


            Blade's eyes can't focus anymore.  They're clouding over.


                                BLADE'S POV
                     We drop away from Abigail and King -- like
                     we're falling down


            a dark tunnel.	 Then the world FADES TO WHITE.


            EXT. CITYSCAPE	- DAWN


            FADE IN FROM WHITE.  We see the sky, the burning orb of the
            rising sun.  A trio of FBI helicopters ride out from the dawn,
            swooping down over the stirring city.


                                ABIGAIL (V.0.)
                     It didn't take long for the authorities
                     to arrive.


            INT. LEAD HELICOPTER - DAWN


            Cumberland sits in the front passenger seat, Hale behind him.


            EXT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PLAZA - DAWN


            As the helicopters touch down in the plaza we see a small
            convoy of POLICE and FBI VEHICLES converging around them.


            Cumberland and Hale are among the first out.  They rush
            towards the Phoenix Towers entrance, guns drawn, DOZENS OF
            AGENTS and OFFICERS behind them.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - DAWN


            The first rays of sun penetrate through the atrium windows
            setting the scattered vampire corpses ablaze.  Danica, Asher,
            and the others all ignite.


                                ABIGAIL (V.0.)
                     When they got there, all of Drake's
                     people were dead.


            By the time Cumberland and his men have entered, fanning out
            through the atrium, all they find are a series of corpse
            shaped piles of ash and singe marks.


                                ABIGAIL (V.0.)
                     In the weeks that followed, the rest of
                     the world's vampires also perished.
                          (beat)
                     We'd finally won.


            ON CUMBERLAND,


            surveying the scene, frustrated by what he's found.  Then we
            hear SHOUTS coming from the back of the atrium.


            AT THE BACK OF THE ATRIUM


            they find Blade.  He's dead, slumped against a wall.  There's
            no sign of Drake.  The vampire king is gone.


            INT. FBI MORGUE - DAY


            CLOSE ON Blade's face, his body being wheeled on an autopsy
            gurney.  PULL BACK to reveal that we are in an FBI morgue.
            Cumberland and Hale stand nearby, overseeing everything as --


            A TRIO OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS


            lift Blade's body onto an autopsy table.  They turn on a bank
            of overhead UV lights.  The lead examiner reaches for a
            scalpel.  But as he touches the scalpel to Blade's chest --


                                ABIGAIL (V.0.)
                     And Blade?  Cumberland and Hale finally
                     got their body --


            BLADE'S FACE


            changes.  We hear a series of POPS and CRACKS as subdermal
            cartilage begins to loosen and shift.  At the same time, the
            skin begins to lighten as melanin is gradually leached away.

                     -- but it wasn't the one they were banking
                     on.


            ON CUMBERLAND AND THE OTHERS


            as they react with varying degrees of shock.


            BACK TO THE BODY


            We realize that it's not Blade lying before them.  It's Drake.
            Somehow, even in death, the vampire king managed to take
            Blade's shape and temporarily retain it.


                                ABIGAIL (V.O.)
                     The virus didn't kill Blade.  But the
                     authorities very well could have.  So in
                     the end, realizing that own his people
                     were doomed, Drake decided to give Blade a
                     gift.


            (beat)


                                ABIGAIL (CONT ÃâD)
                     By taking Blade's shape, he bought Blade
                     enough time to escape.  Offering Blade a
                     second chance at life - -


                                                              DISSOLVE TO:


            EXT. SEASIDE CLIFF - DAY


            A bright summer day.  Blade stands at the edge of a cliff,
            looking out over a sun-struck ocean.  For the first time since
            we've seen him, he's not wearing armor or sunglasses or
            handguns or rifles.  And were it not for the sword he holds,
            we might even mistake him for an ordinary man.


                                ABIGAIL (V.0.)
                     And so Blade took it.


            Blade flings his sword over the cliff, into the ocean below. 


                                ABIGAIL (V.0.)
                     We never saw him again.


            UNDERWATER


            We see the sword sinking, reflecting the refracted sunlight
            from above as it twirls end over end.


            BACK TO BLADE


            At peace with himself at last.  After a moment's reflection,
            he turns and walks away.


                                ABIGAIL (V.0.)
                     He disappeared completely.
                          (beat)
                     But that's what heroes do.  They simply
                     fade out.  And in this way --


            A SERIES OF DISSOLVES


            as Blade moves further and further away from us, dwindling
            into the horizon until he disappears entirely.


                                ABIGAIL (V.0.)
                     -- they become legends.


                                                            FADE TO BLACK.


            Over darkness we hear the sound of TRAFFIC.


            EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT


            FADE IN.  We are moving towards a local punk dive wedged into
            a crowded block in the meat packing district.


            A DOORMAN (LUCIUS) stands outside, checking CUSTOMERS' IDs.We
            hear HILLBILLY THRASH MUSIC coming from within.


            ANGLE ON KING AND ABIGAIL


            approaching.  King holds his four-barreled rifle.  Abigail
            peels away, disappearing into an alley as King nears the front
            door.  The doorman recognizes King, knows he's trouble.


                                KING
                     Evening Lucius.


                                LUCIUS
                     King, what the hell are you doing here?


                                KING
                     Just a little sport hunting.


            INT. CLUB CROWBAR - NIGHT


            A BAND belts out a cover of Sam and the Shams' Little Red
            Riding Hood.  The band members look a little lupine.  As King
            weaves his way through the crowd, Lucius hurries alongside.


                                LUCIUS
                     Ain't no vampires left, King.  So who do
                     you have to hunt?


                                KING
                     That's an interesting question, my friend. 
                     And I've got a question for you in return.


            INT. CLUB CROWBAR - BACK AREA - NIGHT


            As King pushes his way through to the bathrooms, we hear an
            UNEARTHLY ROAR coming from the men's room.


                                KING
                     What do you get when you cross a vampire
                     with a werewolf?


            The door to the men's room EXPLODES OPEN.  Abigail comes
            flying out.  She hits the far wall of the hallway, slides to
            th floor.  But she's up in an instant, pulling a knife on --


                                KING
                          (raising his four-barrel)
                     A fur coat that sticks to your neck.


            A HILL-BILLY HIPSTER WERE-CREATURE,


            wearing a blood-soaked Stray Cats-style suit.  The ephedrine
            nightmare creature looks at King, opening his elongated snout
            to flash a set of razor-sharp canid teeth.


                                KING
                     Don't you know fur is murder?


            As King FIRES point-blank into the were-creature we --

                                                           Emil Cioran
          
          EXT. FOREST - DAWN
          
          Bare as all hell. The trees stripped of their bark and white
          like ghosts. Some torn violently from their roots and felled.
          
          STARK GRAY SUNLIGHT shafts between the trees, clouded by a
          creeping fog that obscures the true color of everything. A
          LIGHT SNOW flutters. The world monochrome, lifeless and cold.
          
          A CAT prowls across the dead earth. Barely recognizable as
          the domestic breed it might once have been. Its fur mangy and
          rank, body rib-thin from starvation. Entirely feral.
          
          It moves slowly, cautiously. Sniffing the air, scanning the
          forest, alert. Trusting nothing of its surroundings. It paces
          across a leaf-strewn clearing, closing stealthily on:
          
          A DEAD MAN, splayed face-down in the earth. His feet bare.
          Face frozen in a grim death mask. A GAPING GUNSHOT WOUND in
          his head, the dried blood caked around it matting his hair.
          
          As the cat moves closer, approaching warily:
          
          P.O.V. FROM ACROSS THE CLEARING
          
          About thirty yards away. Someone is watching. Waiting. SLOW,
          DEEP BREATHS, heard through a GASMASK RESPIRATOR.
          
          CLOSE ON A PAIR OF INDUSTRIAL GOGGLES
          
          The MIRRORED LENSES reflecting the forest clearing, locked
          onto the cat. The slow, metered breathing continues.
          
          THE CAT slows, but continues pacing toward the corpse. More
          cautious than ever. It inches forward, sniffing at the body.
          
          ON THE WATCHER. Crouched behind the mangled stump of a felled
          tree. Concealed beneath a camouflaging mesh of leaves, twigs
          and bracken. A "ghillie suit" of the kind used by snipers.
          
          THE CAT sniffs at the dead man's hand, frozen by death in a
          grotesquely contorted claw. The animal still unsure. Looks
          around again, checking its surroundings for predators.
          
          THE WATCHER moves almost imperceptibly. The leaves covering
          him rustle ever so slightly as we hear - just barely - the
          familiar creaking sound of a BOW STRING BEING DRAWN TAUT.
          
          THE CAT hears it. Looks up, alert. Staring right at the
          watcher, but he is too well camouflaged to be seen. An
          interminable, tense BEAT - is the prey going to flee?
          
          Finally, the cat turns its attention back to the carcass,
          nibbling gingerly at the flesh of the man's fingers.
          
                                                                  2.
          
          
          THE WATCHER looses the arrow. It sails across the clearing
          and SKEWERS THE CAT clean through. It drops to the ground.
          
          THE WATCHER STANDS, shaking off the ghillie suit, revealing
          him to us for the first time.
          
          He wears a weather-beaten knee-length duster. Hooded sweater
          with more layers beneath that. Torn pants and scuffed work
          boots. Everything filthy and battered from years of wear.
          
          Along with the goggles, his face remains obscured by a
          DISPOSABLE PAPER DUST MASK and a CRUDELY-FASHIONED FUR HAT
          with dangling ear flaps that may once itself have been a cat.
          
          Around his neck he wears a silver SAINT CHRISTOPHER PENDANT
          hanging from a frayed twine cord.
          
          His name is ELI.
          
          He shoulders the bow and walks across the clearing. Crouches
          beside the dead cat and pulls out the arrow. Wipes the blood
          from the shaft, then reaches down to collect the body.
          
          Suddenly the cat SCREECHES AND FLAILS WILDLY! Eli recoils,
          falling backward, stunned, as the cat - MORTALLY WOUNDED BUT
          FIGHTING TO THE DEATH - bites and claws desperately at him.
          
          Eli struggles violently with the cat, wrestling it to the
          ground and grabbing up a HUNK OF FALLEN BRANCH. He holds the
          writhing animal down and CLUBS IT until it lays still.
          
          He sits back, breathing harder than the dustmask will allow.
          He yanks it down, revealing the dirty, unshaven face beneath.
          Impossible to tell his age, but certainly not a young man.
          
          For a moment he just sits there. Then bundles up the dead cat
          and returns to the mangled tree stump. Folds away his ghillie
          suit into a nearby RUCKSACK which he hauls up onto his back.
          
          A canteen dangles from the backpack, a SHOTGUN strapped to
          its side. Eli reaches down for his final possession - an old
          SAMURAI SWORD in a scabbard which he slings across his back.
          
          He gazes up at the sky. A snowflake drifts down and lands on
          his cheek. He reaches up and brushes it away, leaving a BLACK
          SMEAR on his face. Not snow after all, but some kind of ASH.
          
          EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY
          
          Eli emerges from the treeline onto the cracked and ruptured
          asphalt. Lined by more of those ghostly, stripped-bare trees.
          
                                                                    3.
          
          
          He sniffs the air, breathing it in. Checks the road in both
          directions. Deserted. A few yards away is the rusted, burned-
          out chassis of a CAR. He heads toward it.
          
          The car rests half on the road, half in the adjacent ditch.
          Stripped of its tires and engine. In the driver's seat is a
          MUMMIFIED BODY. A BULLET HOLE piercing its forehead.
          
          Eli regards the body dispassionately. Tries the door handle
          but it's jammed. He yanks on it harder and eventually
          wrenches it open. He leans in and checks the man's feet.
          
          They're bare. No shoes or socks. Eli curses under his breath.
          
          He leaves the car behind and heads on down the road. As he
          walks away, we see that the sole of one of his boots has worn
          loose, held in place now only by a rubber band.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          Eli continues down the road. He ambles along slowly, a man in
          no hurry. A man who has been walking a long time.
          
          The road has since emerged from the forest. Passing now
          through a wasteland of dead scrub brush and urban junk.
          
          The sun beats down from directly overhead. The sky has no
          color to it, paper-white. The unfiltered sun's stark light
          leaves everything seeming bleached-out, over-exposed.
          
          CRANE UP as Eli walks on. On the horizon is the silhouette of
          a CITY. Or what was once a city. Columns of BLACK SMOKE rise
          from within, casting a deathly pall over the skyline. BURNED
          AND BROKEN SKYSCRAPERS jut out like tombstones.
          
          Eli reaches a fork in the road and stops. The road he's on
          appears to wind off in the direction of the ruined city on
          the horizon. The other fork continues on into the wasteland.
          
          After a brief pause, Eli changes direction and heads off down
          the other fork, away from the city.
          
          EXT. ABANDONED TOWN - DAY
          
          Little more than a main street lined with storefronts. Eli
          walks steadily along, side-stepping rubble and debris.
          Ignoring the petrified corpses lying in the street.
          
          He passes by abandoned stores, every one picked clean. Empty
          shelves, smashed windows. Looted and burned. He doesn't even
          look inside, knowing already that he will find nothing.
          
          Until he comes to a store that does cause him to stop. An old-
          fashioned sign squeaks on rusted hinges in the breeze.
          
                                                                    4.
          
          
                    ED'S SHOES - GENTLEMEN'S AND LADIES' FOOTWEAR
          
          He steps into the doorway and pushes open the door. It swings
          open on its one remaining hinge before splintering away from
          the frame and crashing to the floor in a cloud of dust.
          
          INT. SHOE STORE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli steps inside. Like all the others, the store has been
          cleaned out. Shoe racks and empty boxes strewn over the
          floor. The whole place reeking of dead, musty air.
          
          Eli looks around, just to be sure. Drags his sheathed sword
          idly along the empty racks as he checks them. Nothing.
          
          As he turns back for the door, his foot nudges against a shoe
          box. It's not empty. He crouches down, flips the lid off
          hopefully... and pulls out a LADY'S HIGH-HEELED SHOE.
          
          He strokes the shoe leather with his hand. Shakes his head
          grimly, then tosses the shoe back into the box and leaves.
          
          EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY
          
          On the outskirts of town. In disrepair - peeling paint,
          broken windows, damp-stained walls - but habitable.
          
          Eli stands in the front yard, surrounded by brownish,
          overgrown weeds. Thinking it over. Turns to face the setting
          sun. It will be dark soon. He turns back toward the house.
          
          INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY
          
          The front door is sent CRASHING OPEN with a hard kick,
          revealing Eli silhouetted in the fading sunlight. The shotgun
          unhitched from his pack and held ready. He moves inside.
          
          Another dead place. Flies buzzing in the still, dank air.
          Everything covered in a thick layer of dust but otherwise
          largely preserved. An eerie snapshot of a world long gone.
          
          KITCHEN
          
          Every cupboard empty. Eli checks each one, poking around in
          the dark corners with his sword, but finds nothing but dust.
          
          He opens the freezer, checks inside. Empty save for a small
          ICEBOX. The lid stuck fast with mildew and gunk. Eli digs at
          it with his grimy fingernails and manages to pry it open.
          
          Inside are the wizened, petrified remains of a HUMAN HAND.
          Floating in slimy, discolored water. The smell vile and thick
          enough to make Eli retch. He quickly jams the lid back on.
          
                                                                  5.
          
          
          BEDROOM
          
          A wooden bedframe stripped clean. The dresser drawers have
          been emptied and lie strewn across the floor. Eli moves
          toward a large walk-in closet and opens the door.
          
          No clothes inside - just the near-fossilized corpse of a MAN
          HANGING BY A NOOSE. Twisting gently back and forth.
          
          Unfazed, Eli crouches down and checks the man's feet. An old
          pair of Converse All-Stars hang limp from the man's skeletal
          ankles. Eli calmly sets about unlacing them.
          
          He checks the size; they're a fit. He upturns each shoe and
          shakes the old flakes of mummified flesh from them. Discards
          his ruined boots and puts on the sneakers, laces them up.
          
          He walks around, pacing up and down, getting a feel for the
          new shoes. They feel good. For the first time, he smiles.
          
          LATER
          
          Eli sits in the corner, roasting the carcass of the dead cat
          over a small CAMPFIRE. He cleans the animal's pelts as he
          watches it cook. Pokes at the meat with a pen-knife, checking
          it for done-ness. It appears ready to eat.
          
          He clasps his hands together in prayer.
          
                              ELI
                    Dear Lord, thank you for your
                    generosity in providing us today
                    with this bountiful feast.
          
          He speaks QUIETLY, his voice barely above a whisper. Even so,
          we catch the accent - a RASPY, OLD-WORLD MIDWEST DRAWL, like
          John Wayne or some other long-forgotten western icon.
          
                              ELI
                    Thank you for the many gifts that
                    you have given me. Thank you for
                    your protection and your guidance.
                    Thank you for bringing me this far.
                    I know my long journey's end is
                    near. I ask now only for the
                    strength and the courage to
                    complete the task that you in your
                    infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow
                    upon me over all men. I won't let
                    you down. Amen.
          
          He signs a cross over himself, then uses the knife to saw off
          a chunk of meat. Takes a bite, savoring the taste with great
          relish. To him, it's grade-A filet mignon.
          
                                                                  6.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Hey. You hungry?
          
          It appears as though he is talking to himself... until a RAT
          emerges from his coat pocket, whiskers twitching keenly. Eli
          offers it some meat. The rat gnaws enthusiastically at it.
          
          SUNDOWN
          
          The last of the waning sunlight shafts through the bedroom's
          broken window. Eli rummages through his backpack, pulls out a
          SMALL PACKAGE wrapped in cloth and tied fast with string.
          
          He sits back in his corner and carefully unwraps it. It's an
          OLD LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The binding cracked and pages dog-
          eared, thumbed through a thousand times and more.
          
          Eli gazes lovingly at it. Lets his fingers play across the
          beat-up old leather cover. A cherished thing.
          
          He begins to read, half-hidden in the shadows of the fading
          sunlight. Silently mouthing the words as he reads them.
          
          MANY PAGES LATER
          
          Eli closes the book and parcels it back up as before.
          Replaces it in his pack, then reaches in for something else.
          
          A CAR BATTERY. Old and streaked with acid stains. Attached to
          a tangled bunch of ELECTRICAL WIRING and JUMPER CABLES. Eli
          reaches into his pocket and produces:
          
          AN IPOD. Badly beat-up, the case pretty much held together
          with duct tape. But functional. Eli attaches the battery
          cable to the iPod and places the headphones in his ears.
          
          The music plays. Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 in D Minor.
          Eli rests back against the wall and pushes the volume way up.
          
          THE MUSIC SWELLS. Eli's fingers dance and swoop in the air,
          as though conducting an orchestra, as he is transported by
          the music to another world, a world far from this one.
          
          MORNING
          
          Sunlight shafts through the window. Eli sits slumped in the
          exact same position, headphones still in his ears. Asleep.
          
          The rat scurries up Eli's chest and licks his face. Slowly,
          he wakes, realizing he fell asleep with his music still on.
          Checks the battery. It's dead, drained overnight. He frowns.
          
          He gets to his feet, moves to the window and checks outside.
          All seems quiet. He loads up his backpack and weapons.
          
                                                                  7.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Come on now.
          
          The rat scurries up his leg, onto his duster and disappears
          into the breast pocket. Eli turns and moves out.
          
          EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - MORNING
          
          The gate squeaks shut behind Eli as he exits the front yard.
          
          He breathes in the air, turns to feel the warm morning sun on
          his face. Then turns away from it and walks on down the road.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          The landscape barren and featureless, road lined with dead
          trees. Eli walks along the warped and broken asphalt.
          
          The road is strewn with burned-out cars and debris from a
          world long dead. A warped metal sign by the side of the road
          reads: LITTER REMOVAL NEXT TWO MILES BY: "CIRCUIT CITY".
          
          Up ahead is a HUNCHED FIGURE by the side of the road. Eli
          arrives to see that it's a YOUNG WOMAN. Bone-thin, dressed in
          filthy rags. Skin plagued by an unpleasant rash.
          
          The SHOPPING CART she was pushing has overturned into a
          roadside ditch, spilling its contents. Blankets, tins of
          food, old clothes. She's on her knees trying to gather it up.
          
          She looks up as she sees Eli approaching. Instantly cowers
          from him, raising her hands to protect herself. Terrified.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Oh. Please don't hurt me. Here,
                    take anything you want. You want
                    some food? Take it.
          
          She offers him a can of pet food with a trembling hand. Eli
          stands there looking at her. His expression impossible to
          read behind the mirrored goggles.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm not going to hurt you.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    That's what the last guys said.
          
          Eli bends down and picks up a couple of the cart's spilled
          contents. Steps forward and offers them to her.
          
                              ELI
                    Here.
          
                                                                    8.
          
          
          She blinks. Unsure. Cautiously she reaches out and takes it.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Could you help me? The wheel came
                    off. I can't fix it. Maybe if I
                    could get it out of the ditch. But
                    I can't.
          
          Eli looks at the cart. It has come to rest in the ditch just
          inches from a THICK BRACKEN HEDGEROW that lines the road.
          
          He looks again at the girl. Her faded blouse is unbuttoned,
          revealing a little cleavage. Her skirt torn along the leg,
          showing more than a little thigh. Almost deliberate.
          
          He sniffs the air. Watches the hedgerow warily. Just like the
          cat he hunted, his senses heightened and on alert.
          
          Behind the hedge, THREE ROADSIDE BANDITS are crouched,
          waiting to pounce. Each armed with a crude blunt weapon. They
          exchange anxious looks.
          
          ELI sniffs the air again - then backs away from the girl.
          
                              ELI
                    One good thing about no soap any
                    more. You can smell the road agents
                    a mile off.
          
          The girl's face falls as Eli backs up. The three bandits
          EMERGE FROM THE HEDGEROW, brandishing their weapons. A couple
          of them wear old sunglasses and goggles similar to Eli's.
          
          The BANDIT LEADER grabs the girl by a fistful of hair as he
          passes, yanking her painfully to her feet.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    Dumb bitch. What did we tell you?
          
          He pushes her away, she crumples to the road in a heap.
          
          Eli backs away, but TWO MORE ARMED BANDITS drop from hiding
          in the trees behind, cutting off his escape, surrounding him.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    What you got there in the pack?
          
                               ELI
                    Nothing.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    Yeah, that's what they all say. How
                    about you take it off real slow and
                    tip it out so's we can take a look?
          
                                                                  9.
          
          
          BANDIT #2 notices the shotgun strapped to the pack.
          
                              BANDIT #2
                    He's got a gun.
          
                               BANDIT LEADER
                    Shit, it ain't loaded. They never
                    are. Ain't that right, old man?
                        (BEAT)
                    Open the fucking pack or die.
          
                              ELI
                    I can't do that.
          
          The bandit leader steps forward aggressively. Now within
          striking distance of Eli. He grins, teeth filthy and rotten.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    Want us to do it for you? We can
                    get it off real easy after we've
                    hacked your fucking arms off.
          
          Eli remains perfectly calm. And though he speaks with a soft,
          even tone, there is something formidable about his voice.
          
                              ELI
                    It's real important you boys listen
                    to me and understand. The man I
                    work for, you do not want to cross
                    him. See, I'm under his protection.
                    You stand in my way, you stand in
                    his. And he will cut you down with
                    a righteous fury - through me. For
                    I am his faithful instrument.
          
          BEAT. The bandit leader looks at Eli incredulously... and
          then LAUGHS. The other bandits laugh along nervously.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    What the hell are you, some kinda
                    preacher?
          
                              ELI
                    Something like that.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    Well I got news for you, preacher
                    man. Whatever kinda God you reckon
                    yourself to be working for, he left
                    these parts a long time ago. He
                    ain't here to protect your ass. Now
                    take off the pack and set it on the
                    ground.
          
                                                                 10.
          
          
          Eli doesn't move, doesn't say a word. The bandit leader takes
          another step forward and shoves him in the shoulder.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    You fucking listening to me?
          
                              ELI
                    I hear you. You lay that hand on me
                    again and you will not get it back.
          
          The other bandits exchange nervous looks. This is not how
          it's supposed to go.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    All right, I had just about enough
                    of this shit...
          
          He lunges forward, grabs the shoulder strap of Eli's pack.
          
          If you blinked, you missed it. But somehow Eli has now drawn
          his sword. A RIVULET OF BLOOD snakes down along the blade and
          drips onto the asphalt.
          
          Bandit leader's hand is still gripped firmly around Eli's
          shoulder strap. But it's no longer connected to his arm. The
          SEVERED HAND hangs there from the strap, dripping blood.
          
          Bandit leader staggers backward and raises the bloody stump
          where his hand once was. Looks at it in shock and horror.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    What... you just... he just cut my
                    fucking hand off! My fucking hand!
          
          Eli pries the hand loose from the strap and tosses it onto
          the road as bandit leader's legs give out and he slumps to
          the asphalt. His eyes dart around, as though confused.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    What you standin' around for? Kiss
                    him!
          
                              BANDIT #3
                    What's he talkin' about, kiss him?
          
                              ELI
                    He's in shock. He means "kill him".
          
          A tense BEAT. And then the four remaining bandits ATTACK ELI
          ALL AT ONCE, weapons flailing.
          
          Eli flourishes the sword. A BLUR, TOO FAST TO FOLLOW. But
          it's clear he is possessed of an inhuman level of skill.
          
                                                                    11.
          
          
          It is over in moments. The four bandits LAY SLAIN IN THE
          ROAD, blood pooling out onto the asphalt.
          
          The bandit leader crawls toward his severed hand, a few yards
          away. Eli steps in and kicks it out of his reach.
          
                               ELI
                    I told you you wouldn't be getting
                    that back.
          
          Bandit leader looks up to see the figure of Eli bearing down
          on him, silhouetted ominously against the sun. He looks for a
          moment like an avenging angel, something not of this world.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    Who are you?
          
                              ELI
                    My name is Eli.
          
          And with that, Eli runs him through with his sword.
          
          He turns to see the young woman slumped in the road, sobbing.
          She cowers again as he approaches, certain that she is next.
          
          He WALKS PAST HER. Sheathes his sword, then pulls out the
          shopping cart from the ditch and rights it. The woman watches
          incredulously as he gathers up her supplies into the cart.
          
                              ELI
                    Take it and go on your way. And
                    don't fall in with men like these
                    again. No good can come.
          
          She looks at him, puzzled.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Why are you doing this?
          
          Eli says nothing. Walks back to the slain bandits, crouches
          beside them and begins searching their bodies.
          
          He takes a scarf from around the neck of one. Finds a Zippo
          lighter on another, checks that it works and pockets it.
          
          LATER
          
          The five bodies are lined neatly in the ditch, half-covered
          with dirt. The best burial they are going to get.
          
          Eli stands before them, head bowed in prayer. He speaks
          quietly and quickly, a speech he has given many times.
          
                                                                   12.
          
          
                              ELI
                    God, the father of mercies, through
                    the death and resurrection of his
                    son has reconciled the world to
                    himself and sent the holy spirit
                    among us for the forgiveness of
                    sins.
          
          The young woman stands a few yards away, watching him,
          transfixed. She has never seen anyone like him.
          
                              ELI
                    Through the ministry of the church
                    may he give you pardon and peace,
                    and I absolve you from your sins in
                    the name of the father, and of the
                    son, and of the holy spirit. Amen.
          
          He turns and walks away down the road, passing the woman.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Thank you. You're... a good man.
          
                              ELI
                    There are no good men on the road.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Where are you going?
          
                              ELI
                    West.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Can... can I come with you?
          
          He doesn't even turn back to look at her.
          
                              ELI
                    No.
          
          He walks on, into the horizon.
          
          EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY
          
          Straddling the desert like a giant, crumbling monument to a
          long-dead civilization. Eli steadily climbs his way up.
          
          He comes to an abrupt stop as we realize suddenly that the
          overpass has COLLAPSED at mid-point. RUSTED IRON RODS jut out
          from where the roadway has been severed.
          
          Eli just stands there at the edge for a moment, feeling the
          wind whip around him, his coat fluttering in the breeze.
          
                                                                 13.
          
          
          The overpass's collapsed section is now just a MOUNTAINOUS
          PILE OF RUBBLE that leads down to the road below.
          
          Eli steps onto the rubble. About to make his way down when he
          FREEZES. He hears something. The faintest of sounds. He takes
          cover, peering down at the road beneath the overpass to see:
          
          TWO PEOPLE walking together on the road. We see everything
          from ELI'S P.O.V. - too far to make out much detail, but
          apparently it is a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE.
          
          The man pushes along an OLD WHEELBARROW covered by a tarp as
          the woman, seemingly his wife, walks alongside. The barrow's
          rusted wheel gives out a plaintive, rhythmic SQUEAK.
          
          Eli ducks down again as he hears something else. This time
          much louder. The menacing growl of MOTORCYCLE ENGINES.
          
          FOUR BIKES IN TOTAL. Riding out of the horizon, closing in on
          the couple. They see the bikes coming and panic. Try
          desperately to steer the barrow off the road.
          
          The bikes screech to a halt and the FOUR RIDERS dismount.
          Brandishing a variety of weapons. The couple make a run for
          it but they're quickly chased down and tackled to the ground.
          
          The woman SCREAMS and struggles helplessly as the bikers
          swarm over the man like a pack of predatory animals.
          
          The woman is pulled to the ground and the clothes stripped
          from her. Eli turns away. He knows what comes next.
          
          Eli listens as the woman screams and screams. He reaches for
          his shotgun... hesitates... then withdraws his hand.
          
                              ELI
                    It ain't your concern. Stay on the
                    path. It ain't your concern. Stay
                    on the path.
          
          Eli repeats it like a mantra. He clearly wants to intervene,
          but will not permit himself to. Instead, he simply sits and
          waits grimly as the woman continues to scream for help. And
          then finally, suddenly, is silenced.
          
          Down below, the bodies of the man and woman lay dead and
          bloodied in the dirt. The bikers tear the tarp from the
          wheelbarrow, spilling its contents onto the asphalt.
          
          They ferret through the items, scavenging a few items - we
          don't see what - and stuffing them into an old cloth satchel.
          They leave the rest strewn in the road and ride off in the
          direction they came, dust pluming in their wake.
          
                                                                 14.
          
          
          Eli waits until the sound of the motorcycles has receded into
          the far distance before emerging from his hiding place.
          
          EXT. ROAD BENEATH OVERPASS - DAY
          
          Eli crouches on one knee before the murdered couple. He signs
          a cross over their ravaged bodies as he mutters a prayer
          under his breath. Then stands and continues on down the road.
          
          EXT. ROAD FORK - DAY
          
          More desolate wasteland as far as the eye can see. The road
          forks again here. Eli arrives at the junction and stops.
          
          The road Eli is on leads further into the west. The other
          fork heads toward a SMALL TOWN just visible on the horizon.
          
          A HAND-PAINTED SIGN has been driven into the dirt nearby. No
          words, just a series of CRUDE PICTOGRAMS. A BED. A PLATE OF
          FOOD. A WATER FAUCET. AN ARROW points toward the town.
          
          Eli pauses, thinking it over. Retrieves the iPod from his
          pocket. Clicks the button, but no response. He sighs.
          
          He turns and heads down the other fork, toward town.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - OUTSKIRTS - DAY
          
          A primitive, sprawling village of tents and barn-like
          structures. Built from corrugated iron, rotted wood, molded
          plastic, tarpaulin - materials scavenged from the old world.
          
          HUDDLED RESIDENTS are dressed in little more than rags, many
          wearing goggles like Eli's to shield their eyes from the sun.
          
          Eli stands at the edge of town. Reluctant to enter, but he
          braces himself and walks on in. And as he rounds a corner,
          entering the center of town, an astonishing sight:
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
          
          The broad thoroughfare now all that remains of whatever town
          once stood here. Many of the old storefronts still largely
          intact but patched up with salvaged materials. The asphalt
          street warped and cracked, parking meters bent and smashed.
          
          It's a lot like the abandoned town Eli passed through
          earlier, except VERY MUCH ALIVE - BUSTLING WITH TOWNSFOLK.
          
          It's at once a familiar and also a disturbing sight - like an
          old Norman Rockwell painting of classic small-town America,
          but filtered through the devastating eye of an apocalypse. An
          unsettling juxtaposition of the old world and the new.
          
                                                                 15.
          
          
          The centerpiece of the town is a GRAND THEATER at the head of
          the main street. THE PALLADIUM. Like the rest of the town,
          badly damaged and shoddily fixed-up. But still standing.
          
          Eli walks down the street and approaches a BLACKSMITH,
          hammering out a metal plate over an anvil outside his store.
          
                              ELI
                    You got an engineer or a fuelman
                    around here?
          
          The blacksmith doesn't look up from his work but motions
          toward a storefront at the far end of the street.
          
                              ELI
                    Thanks.
          
          Eli heads down the street. Stopping when he comes across a
          STATUE erected in the center of the road. A TALL MAN crudely
          fashioned in clay. One hand placed paternally on the head of
          a SMALL CHILD, the other outstretched toward the sun.
          
          As he observes the statue, Eli notices that passing residents
          take a moment to PAUSE AND GENUFLECT before it. Worshipping.
          
          Curious, Eli reaches up and runs his hand over the statue's
          face. Then hears SHUFFLING FEET behind him and turns as a
          PARADE OF EMACIATED MEN AND WOMEN trudges past. Roped
          together at the waist, each man leading the one behind.
          
          Heads shaved, thin from malnutrition. And each one BLIND.
          They gaze at the ground with pale, dead eyes. They carry
          picks, shovels and other tools - a sightless CHAIN GANG.
          
          Eli watches as the pathetic parade shuffles past, herded like
          cattle by a brutish CHAIN GANG BOSS who swats at them with a
          stick to keep them moving and indicate direction.
          
                              CHAIN GANG BOSS
                    Come on, move it!
          
          The gang boss glares at Eli as he passes by. Eli doesn't
          return the look, just continues crossing the street as the
          blind are herded away. Headed toward a wooden building with a
          pictogram of a LIGHTNING BOLT suspended above the door.
          
          INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
          
          Whatever this place once was, it's now a kind of POST-
          APOCALYPTIC RADIO SHACK. Shelves display a variety of goods.
          Engine parts. Old electrical wiring. Small appliances.
          
          An old ELECTRIC GENERATOR rumbles noisily, powering strings
          of multi-colored CHRISTMAS LIGHTS that hang all around.
          
                                                                  16.
          
          
          Behind the main counter a convoluted Rube Goldberg-esque
          STILL is running. An ENGINEER in a leather apron pours the
          remnants of a can of motor oil into the still's funnel.
          
          Attached to the still is an old MOTORCYCLE MIRROR. In its
          reflection the engineer sees Eli checking out the store.
          
          Without turning around, he reaches surreptitiously behind the
          counter for something.
          
          Eli turns toward the counter - to find the engineer training
          a PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN right at him.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    I don't know you.
          
          Eli slowly raises his hands.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm not from around here.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    No shit. Who are you?
          
                              ELI
                    I'm just a customer.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    A customer with a shotgun?
          
          He nods toward the shotgun visible on Eli's backpack.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    You come in here to rip me off?
          
          The engineer's hands tremble, his finger tight on the
          trigger. This man needs to be talked down carefully.
          
                              ELI
                    No. I'll set it down. Okay?
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Slowly!
          
          Eli nods. Unhitches the pack and sets it down, steps away.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    You carry a gun in the outland, you
                    don't bring one into town less you
                    live there. Don't you know that?
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry, I forgot. I've been on
                    the road a long time.
          
                                                                    17.
          
          
          This seems to make the engineer more suspicious of Eli.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Show me your hand.
          
                                 ELI
                    I'm not a-
          
          The engineer jerks the shotgun at Eli nervously.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    I said show me your fucking hand!
          
          Eli raises his hand and holds it outstretched, palm faced
          downward. The engineer watches it closely for any sign of
          ticks or tremors, but Eli's hand stays steady as a rock.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm not one of them.
          
          The sight of the steady hand seems to reassure the engineer a
          little. Finally, he lowers the shotgun.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    What do you want?
          
                              ELI
                    I'm just passing through. I need
                    some help. I can pay.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    What kinda help? And what kinda
                    pay?
          
                              ELI
                    I'm going to get something out of
                    my pack. Okay?
          
          The engineer raises the shotgun nervously again.
          
                              ELI
                    I know, I know. Slowly.
          
          The engineer watches him like a hawk as Eli opens up his pack
          and pulls out the car battery. When he sees it, he gasps.
          
                                 ENGINEER
                    Holy shit.
          
          Eli places it on the counter. The engineer looks it over with
          awe, like it's a priceless historical artifact.

                    Where'd you find this?
          
                                                                 18.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Years ago, in the outland back east
                    aways.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Does it work?
          
                              ELI
                    Yeah, it just needs a charge. Can
                    you do it? I got the cables.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Depends if you also got the coin.
          
          Eli pulls the Zippo lighter from his pocket. The engineer
          picks it up, sparks the flint, watches the flame flicker.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    It'll take a couple hours. There's
                    a bar across the street you can
                    wait, they just opened up.
          
                              ELI
                    I'll wait here.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    You don't trust me?
          
                              ELI
                        (SMILES)
                    I don't know you.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - AUDITORIUM - DAY
          
          This once grand theater have been largely gutted - seats torn
          out, fixtures and fittings stripped, curtains ripped from the
          stage. But still, there's a sense of grandeur to this place.
          
          Looking out over the stage, a ROYAL BOX - once the most
          prestigious seat in the house - has been converted into an
          OFFICE of sorts. Seats removed and replaced by an ORNATE
          MAHOGANY DESK facing inward, a CHANDELIER suspended above it.
          
          The whole set-up is gaudy and ostentatious - the work of
          someone who wants to project an aura of power and wealth, but
          has no taste whatsoever.
          
          A TALL MAN is seated in a battered leather armchair behind
          the desk, deeply involved in an OLD PAPERBACK BOOK.
          
          The book's cover is faded and partially torn away, the title
          still just visible: 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE.
          
                                                                   19.
          
          
          The man is OLDER than most we've seen. His skin weathered by
          the elements and by a long life's experience. One of the very
          few people we've seen in this world close to Eli's age - and
          unlike everyone else we've seen, he appears healthy and well-
          groomed. A rich mane of hair, full set of teeth.
          
          He wears a tattered SUIT AND TIE. None of it matches,
          everything scavenged from different outfits and eras. But he
          looks almost civilized. Respectable. His name is CARNEGIE.
          
          He looks up from his book at the sound of a POLITE COUGH O.S.
          
          REDRIDGE stands before him. Tall, powerfully built.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What is it?
          
          His accent is like caramel. A RICH, DEEP-SOUTH DRAWL.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Survey team just finished up their
                    inspection. It ain't good.
          
          Carnegie lowers his book. Concerned.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    How bad is it?
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Pressure is down again, and going
                    by the new rod they sank levels're
                    lower than they've ever been.
          
          Carnegie stands. Thinking. This is bad news.
          
                                CARNEGIE
                    How long?
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Hard to say. Six months, maybe. A
                    little longer if we're careful. But
                    we're already-
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Halve the rations.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    We just halved `em last-
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So halve them again!
          
          BEAT. Carnegie stares Redridge down. Nobody but nobody
          questions his orders.
          
                                                                 20.
          
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    You're going to have to say
                    something. Folks were none too
                    happy last time. Gonna be worse
                    now, you can count on it.
          
          Carnegie sighs, rubs his brow. He knows Redridge is right.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY
          
          A LARGE CROWD OF TOWNSFOLK - several hundred strong - has
          assembled outside the Palladium theater. AN ARMED CREW OF
          CARNEGIE'S GOONS keeps watch over the crowd.
          
          Carnegie stands on a BALCONY above the theater marquee. He
          treats the balcony like a pulpit, speaking through a
          MICROPHONE connected to an old PA SYSTEM that carries his
          words to the far reaches of the crowd.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I want you all to remember how far
                    we've come together. And how far we
                    still can go, if only we believe.
                    When I brought us here to this
                    oasis - this promised land - we
                    knew there would be hardships. Knew
                    there would be sacrifices. But we
                    also knew that we were creating for
                    ourselves a world where we could be
                    safe from the horrors of the
                    forsaken lands beyond our borders.
          
          The crowd listens intently, hanging on Carnegie's every word.
          He is an incredibly charismatic and persuasive speaker - his
          cultivated image and inspiring, confident delivery remind us
          of a TELEVISION EVANGELIST.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    And I want you all to remember
                    above all that it is not the water
                    with which we have been blessed
                    that is the true lifeblood of this
                    town... but faith.
          
          This sends a MURMUR OF DISCONTENT through the crowd. Many
          don't like where they suspect this may be going. Carnegie
          senses this and dials up his rhetoric - delivering it now
          with the fire-brand passion of an old-time baptist preacher.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    It is our faith that sustains us,
                    brothers and sisters! Hallelujah!
          
                                                                 21.
          
          
          The crowd is divided. Many return the "Hallelujah" with
          varying levels of conviction. Others are not convinced. But
          Carnegie continues unabated, selling it harder than ever.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    And mark me, the ultimate
                    validation of that faith is coming!
                    The sacred Word of Our Lord that
                    formed the world before and will
                    reform it once again is coming to
                    this town to bring it succor, bring
                    it nourishment, bring it new life!
                    For the Almighty Himself has spoken
                    unto me and promised it!
          
          Carnegie is such an impassioned and inspiring speaker it's
          almost impossible not to get caught up and swept away by his
          words. His apparently unshakable belief is infectious.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    In the meantime, He has asked us
                    all to be patient. To walk the hard
                    road of the faithful just a little
                    longer. And to do that, we must
                    give just a little more.
                        (BEAT)
                    Water rations will be halved until
                    further notice.
          
          This sends a much broader ripple of discontent through the
          crowd - this news has not been received well at all. Some
          still "keep the faith" but many more are perturbed by this.
          
          Carnegie motions for the crowd to settle down.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I understand your frustration. The
                    road to salvation is a difficult
                    one - but what lies at the end of
                    that road is a greater glory,
                    beyond anything you can imagine.
          
          A DISCONTENTED VILLAGER steps forward, pushing through the
          crowd and jabbing his finger angrily up at Carnegie.
          
                              DISCONTENTED VILLAGER
                    We've heard this all before! When
                    are you going to-
          
          Carnegie's goons quickly move in and efficiently SILENCE THE
          MAN, removing him from the crowd. Dissent is not tolerated
          here. Carnegie goes on speaking as if nothing had happened.
          
                                                                 22.
          
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    I know each and every one of you
                    will understand the necessity of
                    this action. It was faith that
                    built this town - and faith that
                    will sustain it even through the
                    dark times that may lie ahead. But
                    it is always darkest before dawn -
                    and the new dawn is coming.
                        (BEAT)
                    May God go with you all.
          
          Carnegie steps back inside, leaving the crowd to talk among
          themselves, clearly mixed about what they have heard.
          
          As the assembled townsfolk disperse, FOUR MOTORCYCLES roar
          into town and pull up outside the Palladium.
          
          As the riders dismount, one detaches a CLOTH SATCHEL from his
          bike's cargo rack. The four riders head inside. They each
          have long, straggly hair and brutish expressions.
          
          We recognize them now as the BIKER BANDITS who killed the
          couple on the road under the freeway overpass.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - SECOND FLOOR - DAY
          
          Carnegie emerges into the second-floor hallway from the
          balcony, mopping his brow. Exhausted and stressed from his
          grand theatrical display, and from its mixed reception.
          
          Redridge climbs the stairs to meet him.
          
                               REDRIDGE
                    One of the road crews just rolled
                    into town.
          
          Carnegie looks at his cracked old wristwatch.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Of course they did, the bar's open.
                    Outlanders, always looking for
                    answers at the bottom of a bottle.
          
                               REDRIDGE
                    Not these guys.
                        (BEAT)
                    These guys say they got something.
          
          That gets Carnegie's attention.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Get them up here now.
          
                                                                 23.
          
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAY
          
          What was once a grand, gilded entrance foyer has, like the
          rest of the theater, been largely gutted. But it's still
          impressive - a spacious bar area with a grand staircase
          leading up to a second floor, entrance to balcony seats, etc.
          FADED OLD THEATER POSTERS still hang from the walls.
          
          The place has been shabbily converted into a kind of SALOON.
          Old ripped-out theater seats arranged around tables. A
          FIREPLACE sputters dimly.
          
          A MANGY TABBY CAT walks across the straw-laden floor. A dozen
          or so CUSTOMERS in the place, a mixed, rough-looking bunch.
          
          Redridge emerges from an upstairs room and nods to a group of
          his MEN who are holding the bikers at the foot of the stairs.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          Carnegie checks his reflection in a CRACKED HAND MIRROR,
          licks his palm and slicks his hair back. He adjusts his tie
          as Redridge's men usher the bikers into his "office".
          
          Carnegie wheels around and flashes a smile at them. Just as
          when he gave his balcony address, Carnegie is in performance
          mode - charismatic and slick like a campaigning politician.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Gentlemen! It's truly a delight to
                    see you again! I understand your
                    latest excursion into the outland
                    has been a profitable one?
          
          The bikers exchange looks. They understood maybe half the
          words in that sentence. The lead biker - named HOG - speaks.
          
                              HOG
                    We did good.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Well, let's see, shall we?
          
          Hog tips the satchel's contents out onto Carnegie's desk.
          
          BOOKS. About a dozen different volumes of all shapes and
          sizes. Carnegie rifles excitedly through the collection.
          
          We see various titles as he sorts through them. Treasure
          Island. The Da Vinci Code. A volume of encyclopedia. The
          Diary of Anne Frank. Tuesdays with Morrie.
          
          In amongst the books are a few MAGAZINES. An old issue of
          OPRAH magazine. A torn copy of SPORTS ILLUSTRATED...
          
                                                                 24.
          
          
          ...And a NEWSWEEK. The cover graphic illustrates OPPOSING
          NUCLEAR ARSENALS over a world globe. On one side the STARS
          AND STRIPES, on the other flags indicating a SINO-ISLAMIC
          ALLIANCE. The headline reads: "IS THERE NO TURNING BACK?"
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    No. No. No. No. No.
          
          As Carnegie rejects each book with growing disappointment and
          frustration, it's clear he's looking for a specific volume.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    It's not here.
          
                              HOG
                    These ain't worth nothin'?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    When you bring me the book I asked
                    you for, it'll be worth something.
          
          The bikers exchange more looks. An unspoken conversation.
          
                              HOG
                    We been doin' this a long time now.
                    Had to make a whole lotta corpses
                    to bring you all these books. You
                    want us to keep at it, reckon it's
                    worth more than a few free glasses
                    of that swill you call liquor.
          
          Carnegie's guards bristle, ready for a confrontation.
          Carnegie just smiles, always ready to smooth things over.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Gentlemen, gentlemen. I urge you
                    once again to take the long view
                    here. When we find this book - and
                    believe me, we will find it - we
                    are going to build a new world. A
                    world far greater, far more
                    righteous than this one. And you
                    and I are going to be perched right
                    on top of it, looking down upon it,
                    masters of all creation!
          
          As always, his carefully stage-managed rhetoric is delivered
          with the utmost conviction, every word dripping with passion
          and persuasion. He's a master salesman, a true huckster.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    And you know, I think you're
                    absolutely right.

                              CARNEGIE (cont'd)
                    That is worth more than a few
                    glasses of liquor. A whole lot
                    more.
          
          He steps forward and looks Hog right in the eye. His gaze
          like a laser beam, utterly disarming.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    The book I want is out there
                    somewhere, just waiting to be
                    found. Once there were millions of
                    copies - you only need to find one!
                    Find it and bring it here. And I
                    promise you, you will be rewarded
                    beyond anything you can imagine.
          
          It's impossible not to be swayed by this guy. He's just so
          full of fiery passion and infectious belief, you almost want
          to reach into your pocket and hand over your wallet.
          
          Hog snatches up his empty satchel.
          
                              HOG
                    This better not be bullshit.
          
          He turns and marches to the door, the other bikers following.
          The guards escort them out, only Redridge remains.
          
          Carnegie slumps back into his chair, frustrated, pissed off.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Might help if they knew just what
                    they were looking for.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Not one of them can read. How would
                    they even know when they found it?
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    So how's about you just tell me?
          
          Carnegie and Redridge lock eyes. BEAT.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Two years now you been sending
                    these crews into the outland.
                    Burning up gas we can barely spare.
                    For a goddamn book? What the hell
                    kinda book can be worth all this?
          
          Carnegie ignores him. Stands, walks toward the door. Redridge
          sighs, gestures toward the books piled on Carnegie's desk.
          
                                                                 26.
          
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    What about these?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Put them with the others.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAY
          
          Redridge stands by the marble fireplace, tossing the books
          into the fire. The flames flicker and leap around the books
          as their pages blacken and are consumed by the fire.
          
          INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - DAY
          
          Eli watches as the engineer charges the battery with the gas
          generator, which chugs noisily.
          
          He licks his lips, dry as sand. Unscrews his canteen to take
          a drink, but it's down to its last few drips.
          
                              ELI
                    What's this place across the
                    street? They got any water?
          
                              ENGINEER
                    We got our own underground spring
                    here. Only fresh water in a hundred
                    miles - if's you can pay for it.
          
          Eli thinks a while longer. Then stands and stuffs his shotgun
          inside his pack, shoulders his gear and makes for the door.
          
                              ELI
                    I'll be back.
          
          Eli stops in the doorway and turns back to the engineer.
          
                              ELI
                    If that battery ain't here when I
                    get back, I will use this gun on
                    your kneecaps and I will put this
                    building to the torch and I will
                    watch it burn to the ground with
                    you alive inside it. So help me
                    God.
          
          And with that he turns and leaves. The engineer gulps. Not a
          hint in Eli's voice that he didn't mean every word.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          This old second-floor DRESSING ROOM has been converted into a
          bedroom, simply furnished.
          
                                                                   27.
          
          
          A WOMAN stands in front of an old DRESSING ROOM MIRROR, the
          bulbs around the frame burned-out and broken. She washes her
          face in murky water in an old PORCELAIN BOWL on the dresser.
          
          Her name is CLAUDIA. Early 30s, pretty. She gazes into the
          mirror as she dries her hands, but it's so cracked and warped
          it's near impossible to see a reflection.
          
          The door opens and Carnegie enters. He still looks steamed.
          Claudia doesn't turn to look at him, keeps facing the mirror.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Is that you, honey?
          
          Carnegie says nothing. Just paces angrily up and down.
          Finally Claudia turns to face him.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Something wrong?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    More books came in from the road
                    today.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Oh? It's been a while.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    And it'll be a while longer. Just
                    another pile of useless junk. If we
                    don't find the right one soon - if
                    I can't give these people what they
                    want to hear...
          
          Carnegie trails off, the thought too awful to contemplate.
          Claudia adopts a sympathetic expression, supportive.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    You'll find what you're looking
                    for. It's out there somewhere. You
                    just have to have faith.
          
          This seems to anger Carnegie. He wheels on her.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Faith? Is that what you think we're
                    missing around here?
          
          She detects the aggressive tone in his voice and goes quiet,
          head bowed. Carnegie moves toward her angrily.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    My old man used to have faith. He
                    had it in spades. My mother, too.

                              CARNEGIE (cont'd)
                    You know where it got them? You
                    know where it got me?
          
          He's in her face now. Claudia avoids eye contact, submissive.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Faith is for the weak. It's for
                    them out there, the sheep. This
                    world is what you can see and touch
                    and taste. It's what you make it.
                    All these years with me, you still
                    don't have any grasp of that?
                    What's wrong with you, woman?
          
          He's shouting now, and she's trembling, afraid to speak.
          
                                 CLAUDIA
                    I'm sorry.
          
          Carnegie realizes he's frightened her. He softens.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
                    scare you. Hey. You okay?
          
          He lifts her chin up, wipes away a tear.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You just get me all riled up with
                    that kind of talk. It's not what I
                    need from you right now.
                        (SMILES)
                    You know what I need right now?
          
          He puts his hands on her lustfully. It's clear she's not in
          the mood, but she halfheartedly responds anyway. More out of
          a sense of wifely duty than reciprocated passion.
          
          As they kiss, Carnegie pushes her excitedly against the wall
          and feverishly begins unbuckling his pants.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAY
          
          The original customers have now been joined by the four
          bikers, who sit at their own table drinking a clear and
          pungent moonshine-type liquor from a shared jar.
          
          Eli enters. All eyes are on him immediately, regarding him
          with guarded interest as he pulls up a stool at the bar.
          
          The BARTENDER approaches, looks him up and down. Suspicious.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    Outlander? Let me see-
          
                                                                 29.
          
          
          Eli raises his hand as before. Holds it outstretched, steady.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    What'll it be?
          
          Eli places the canteen on the bar.
          
                              ELI
                    Water.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    That's the good stuff. Gotta eat
                    into my own ration to sell it - so
                    I don't sell it cheap.
          
          Eli takes off his scarf and puts it on the bar. The bartender
          takes it and looks it over. Not particularly impressed.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    That'll get you maybe half-way.
          
          The bartender spies Eli's silver Saint Christopher pendant.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    What about that?
          
          Eli stuffs the pendant inside his shirt. No way that's for
          sale. Instead, he reaches into his coat and produces the fur
          pelts he skinned from the dead cat, lays them out on the bar.
          
                              ELI
                    That's the best I got.
          
          The bartender takes a pelt and examines it. The mangy cat
          leaps up onto the bar and approaches. Sniffs at the pelts
          with suspicion and HISSES at Eli.
          
          Eli shoos the cat off the bar with a wave of his hand. At the
          biker's table Hog watches this, not happy about this.
          
          Satisfied with the pelts, the bartender gathers them up along
          with the scarf, then turns away toward the back room.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    Solara!
          
          A TEENAGE GIRL emerges from the back. No older than 16 or 17.
          Dressed in unflattering work clothes, face grimy, blonde hair
          tied back in a ponytail. But even through all this, it's
          clear she is a strikingly beautiful young woman.
          
          The bartender takes Eli's canteen and hands it to Solara
          along with a RATION CARD he keeps around his neck.
          
                                                                 30.
          
          
                              BARTENDER
                    Take this out back and get it
                    filled.
          
          Solara takes the canteen, pausing for a moment to look Eli up
          and down. Unsure quite what to make of him, but intrigued.
          There's something about him she can't put her finger on...
          
          He doesn't look back at her. She turns and exits.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
          
          Solara exits via the Palladium's STAGE DOOR and walks across
          the busy street to where TWO OF CARNEGIE'S ARMED MEN stand
          guard around an ENCLOSURE OF CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH
          RAZOR WIRE. TOWNSFOLK wait in line with bowls and buckets.
          
          One of the guards recognizes Solara and lets her cut to the
          front of the line. He punches two holes in her ration card
          and lets her inside the chain-link enclosure.
          
          Inside is an OLD RUSTED SPIGOT attached to a pipe emerging
          from the earth. Solara cranks hard on the handle - it takes a
          few pulls before the water comes, and then only at a weak
          trickle; it will take a while to fill the canteen.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
          
          As Eli sits at the bar, a SHADOW comes into view and looms
          large over him. Hog is standing behind him, glaring, cutting
          a menacing figure in his armored cycle leathers.
          
          Solara senses trouble brewing and moves off, taking Eli's
          canteen away into the back room.
          
                              HOG
                    That was my cat.
          
          Eli doesn't turn. Just looks straight ahead. Impossible to
          read him behind those mirrored goggles. Utterly inscrutable.
          
                              ELI
                    Fine specimen.
          
                              HOG
                    I saw you push him off the bar.
          
                              ELI
                    I didn't push him.
          
                              HOG
                    You raised your hand at him.
          
                                                                 31.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Sorry. It won't happen again.
          
          The bartender looks at Hog nervously.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    Hey, how about another drink, Hog?
          
                              HOG
                    That cat's been comin' in here for
                    nigh on two years. It got more
                    right to be here than you. Who the
                    fuck do you think you are?
          
                              ELI
                    I don't want any trouble.
          
          Hog grabs him by the arm.
          
                              HOG
                    Well, that's too bad, `cause-
          
          Blink. Suddenly Hog's head is pinned to the bar by nothing
          more than Eli's thumb. Pressed deep into a nerve cluster in
          his neck. Eli leans in close as Hog whimpers, paralyzed.
          
                              ELI
                    I know you. Murderer of innocent
                    travelers on the road. You're going
                    to spend eternity drowning in a
                    lake of fire for the things that
                    you've done. Did you know that?
          
          The other bikers stand and approach, the OTHER CUSTOMERS
          following suit. Eli senses the trouble gathering behind him.
          
                              ELI
                    You go on back to your table and
                    I'll be on my way. All right?
          
          It's all Hog can do to just barely nod his head. Eli releases
          his thumb. Hog staggers backward, gasping for breath.
          
          Eli stands and makes toward the door, but the bikers and
          other patrons have moved to block his exit.
          
                              BURLY PATRON
                    You push Hog, you push all of us.
          
          Eli sighs, looks down at the floor. He's been pushed one time
          too many today. For the first time, we see anger in his face.
          
                                                                    32.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Cursed be the ground because of
                    you. By toil shall you eat of it.
                    Thorns and thistles shall it sprout
                    for you. From the ground were you
                    taken. For dust you are.
          
          The patrons look at Eli strangely. Who is this guy?
          
          Eli reaches back and draws the samurai sword. Carves a line
          in the dirt at his feet with the tip of the blade.
          
                              ELI
                    And to dust you shall return.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          Carnegie has Claudia pinned against the wall, his pants
          bunched around his ankles, ass bared as he pounds away at
          her. Not making love. This is mechanical, loveless sex.
          
          Claudia stares vacantly over his shoulder into space as
          Carnegie thrusts into her again and again. Deeply
          uninterested, just waiting for it to be over.
          
          Suddenly, we hear a CRASH O.S. Carnegie stops and listens.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Did you hear that? What was that?
          
          Claudia sees an opening to get out of this.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Maybe you should go check.
          
          BEAT. Carnegie keeps listening. Then comes another CRASH.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What in the hell is going on?
          
          He pulls up his pants, grabbing a RIFLE propped by the door
          as he rushes out. Claudia just stands there for a moment,
          then reaches down and pulls up her panties.
          
          She moves from the wall and makes her way across the room,
          feeling her way with her hands, gazing off into nothingness.
          Only now do we finally realize that she is BLIND.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carnegie emerges from the bedroom onto the balcony. Looks
          down over the railing - and is stunned by what he sees.
          
                                                                 33.
          
          
          CHAOS in the bar below. Eli cutting a one-man swath of mayhem
          through the dozen brawlers. Most already lie dead. TWO MORE
          MEN ATTACK Eli and are effortlessly felled by his sword.
          
          Carnegie rushes hurriedly along the landing, banging loudly
          on the doors of the upstairs rooms.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Get your asses out here!
          
          ON ELI. Surrounded by the dead, only one man left standing.
          Hog. He backs away as Eli circles him like a predator. Sword
          held ready, the blade glistening with dark red blood.
          
          SOLARA re-emerges from the back room with Eli's refilled
          canteen. She stops and emits a horrified GASP when she sees
          the bloody carnage laid out in the bar before her.
          
          She watches, mortified, as Eli moves toward the helpless,
          terrified Hog, going in for the kill. Raising his sword...
          
          Suddenly, Solara steps forward and CRIES OUT:
          
                                 SOLARA
                    Stop!
          
          Eli FREEZES. Sword hanging in the air, poised to strike. He
          turns his head to where Solara stands behind the bar.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Please don't.
          
          BEAT as Eli considers. He looks back at Hog, still completely
          at his mercy... and then LOWERS THE SWORD.
          
                                 ELI
                    Go.
          
                              HOG
                        (CONFUSED)
                    ...What?
          
                              ELI
                    It ain't for me to judge you. Your
                    time for that's gonna come. Believe
                    me. Now go on. Get out of here.
          
          Hog stumbles backward through the door, into the sunlight.
          Eli moves toward Solara, who stands petrified behind the bar.
          Reaches out and gently pries the canteen from her loose grip.
          
                                 ELI
                    Thank you.
          
                                                                    34.
          
          
          In the exitway, Hog turns back inside, grabbing up a BROKEN
          BOTTLE from the bloody floor as he goes.
          
          Hog rushes Eli from behind. Solara sees him coming and goes
          to SCREAM - but before any sound can come, Eli flips his
          sword backward and Hog runs right onto it, SKEWERING HIMSELF.
          
          BEAT. Hog just stands there for a moment, eyes wide, frozen
          in shock. His fingers go limp, dropping the bottle.
          
          He slides off the sword and collapses to the floor, dead.
          
          Eli wipes the sword clean and sheathes it. Looks around at
          the bloodied, fallen bodies. Then back at Solara.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry for all the mess.
          
          As he turns and heads toward the door:
          
                              CARNEGIE (O.S.)
                    Hold it right there.
          
          Accompanied by the sound of MULTIPLE GUNS COCKING.
          
          Carnegie is on the landing, training his rifle down at Eli.
          Alongside him, FIVE GUNMEN do the same. They've got him cold.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          Carnegie sits at his desk, the huge auditorium and stage area
          visible behind him. Eli stands before him. Around him are the
          other gunmen, who keep their weapons trained on him.
          
          Standing at Carnegie's side are REDRIDGE and CLAUDIA.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So, who are you?
          
                              ELI
                    Nobody. A walker in the outland.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I've met walkers before. Not a
                    particularly civilized bunch. Some
                    have even taken to eating their own
                    kind, did you know that? You
                    wouldn't be one of those savages
                    now, would you?
          
          Carnegie's gunmen look him over, inspecting him warily.
          
                              CARNEGIE GUNMAN
                    He ain't got the shakes.
          
                                                                  35.
          
          
          Carnegie's confident gaze remains fixed on Eli throughout.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Good. This is a civilized town.
                    Under God. Do you know what that
                    means?
          
          Eli can't help but react at the mention of that word.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    It means we have laws here. Laws
                    set down long before any of us ever
                    walked this earth. And one of them
                    is, you don't eat the flesh of your
                    brother. Else you're no better than
                    an animal. And not welcome here.
          
          Eli doesn't respond. Just stands there in Carnegie's gaze.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So what's your business here,
                    friend? Walkers don't usually come
                    into town less they want something.
          
                              ELI
                    I had a battery needed charging and
                    a canteen needed filling. I didn't
                    come here looking for trouble.
          
          Barely noticeable, Carnegie gestures to one of the gunmen,
          who nods in acknowledgement and leaves.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Well, you sure as hell found it. Do
                    you know who I am?
          
                              ELI
                    No.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    My name's Carnegie. I own this bar.
                    I own the whole town. You've never
                    heard of me?
          
                              ELI
                    That's you out there on the street.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Remarkable likeness, isn't it?
                    You'd never guess half the men who
                    built it were blind. A small
                    tribute from a grateful people. I
                    was deeply touched.
          
                                                                 36.
          
          
                              ELI
                    You had slaves build you a monument
                    to yourself?
          
          The mention of that word rankles Carnegie. He walks around
          the desk toward Eli, waves an admonishing finger at him.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Don't call them slaves. That's an
                    old word. I'm not a slaver. I'm
                    trying to help these people.
          
          Carnegie can't help himself - once again he is in his natural
          element, spinning the argument his way, pitching. Selling.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    In the outland the sightless are
                    preyed upon like sick animals. Here
                    at least they're protected. They do
                    the essential work others don't
                    want. And in return they eat, they
                    drink, they survive. Last year, a
                    couple of them even got married -
                    performed the ceremony myself.
                        (BEAT)
                    You see, I'm not exploiting these
                    people - I'm saving them! Any one
                    of them is free to leave whenever
                    they wish. But here they stay. And
                    they thank me every single day for
                    their salvation!
          
          An impressive, impassioned performance. He sounds just like
          an old-school TV evangelist. But Eli is unmoved.
          
                              ELI
                    It's none of my business what you
                    do here. Like you said, it's your
                    town. I just want to be on my way.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What's your name, walker?
          
          Eli doesn't respond. Just stands there.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    All right, I guess we just call you
                    Walker. Don't see too many folks
                    your age these days. You lived in
                    the world before? You can read?
          
                              ELI
                    I read every day.
          
                                                37.
          
          
                    CARNEGIE
          That's good. Good man. We educated
          folk, we need to stick together, if
          we're ever going to rebuild this
          world. People like you and me,
          we're the future.
          
                    ELI
          What do you want with me?
          
                     CARNEGIE
          Straight to the point. I like that.
          Fact is, you could be in a lot of
          trouble. This is a peaceful town.
          You walk in here, armed, and the
          next thing a dozen of my good
          citizens are dead. I've hanged men
          for less. I could hang you.
              (BEAT)
          Or, you could come work for me.
          
                    ELI
          What?
          
                    CARNEGIE
          I never once saw anyone handle
          themselves the way you did down
          there in that bar. I don't know
          where you learned it, but I sure as
          hell could use it.
          
                    ELI
          I'm not interested.
          
                    CARNEGIE
          People who work for me can live
          better than any walker ever
          dreamed. Real beds, clean water,
          hot food. Women, even. You could do
          a lot worse, my friend.
          
                    ELI
          I'm not your friend. And I'm not
          staying. I got someplace I need to
          be. Out west.
          
                    CARNEGIE
          West? There is nothing west. It's
          all gone, a long time ago.
          
                    ELI
          I've been told different.
          
                                                                    38.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    By who?
          
          Eli doesn't reply. Carnegie smiles, dials up the charm.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    All right, look. I'm going to make
                    you an offer of goodwill. Stay the
                    night, think it over. Try a little
                    local hospitality. We'll talk again
                    in the morning. If you're still not
                    interested, you're free to go. No
                    hard feelings.
          
                              ELI
                    Thank you for your offer. But I'd
                    prefer to just leave right now. So
                    you can either let me out of here,
                    or I can kill my way out.
          
          The gunmen bristle, exchange nervous looks. Carnegie appears
          unfazed. He smiles. BEAT. He looks to the gunman at the door.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Let him go.
          
          The gunman opens the door. Eli turns and exits.
          
          INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - DAY
          
          The engineer stands behind the counter, looking worried. His
          heart sinks when he sees Eli enter.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Oh, shit...
          
                              ELI
                    How's my battery?
          
                              ENGINEER
                    It's, uh... it's gonna take a
                    little longer than I thought.
          
                              ELI
                    How much longer?
          
                              ENGINEER
                    It's gotta charge overnight. You,
                    uh, you can always stay here in
                    town, pick it up in the morning.
          
          Eli leans in a little closer. He smells a rat.
          
                                                                    39.
          
          
                              ELI
                    You remember what I said would
                    happen if I came back here and you
                    didn't have my battery?
          
                              ENGINEER
                    It's right here! It's just gonna
                    take a while longer. I swear.
          
          Eli looks at the engineer. Hard to be certain, but he's
          pretty sure he's lying. Somebody got to him.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          A VIOLENT COMMOTION is heard from down the hall. Suddenly one
          of Carnegie's henchmen comes flying into view as he is THROWN
          HARD INTO A WALL and slumps to the floor, unconscious.
          
          Eli storms into the box, pissed. MORE GUARDS rush in behind
          him. Carnegie, seated behind his desk, waves the guards off
          as he stands to greet Eli, smiling ingratiatingly as ever.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I knew you'd reconsider.
          
                              ELI
                    Yeah? How'd you know that?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    None of the walkers I've seen come
                    here from the outland were ever
                    what you'd call smart. I mean all
                    those years out there alone on the
                    road, some with their brains half-
                    fried from eating each other - it's
                    understandable why you people
                    aren't the brightest bulbs in the
                    box. But I never met one so dumb
                    that he'd turn down a meal and a
                    bed if it was offered.
          
                              ELI
                    So you didn't send someone across
                    the street to the engineer?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Engineer? I don't know what you're
                    talking about. If there's something
                    wrong, maybe I can help.
          
          Carnegie is a practiced liar. Much more difficult to read.
          
                                                                 40.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    This is Redridge. He's kind of my
                    right-hand man around here.
          
          Redridge - one of the two men who chased Eli into the room -
          steps forward. He regards Eli with a distrustful eye.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    He'll show you to your room.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - DUSK
          
          Redridge opens the door and ushers Eli inside.
          
          It's another of the dressing rooms converted into a bedroom,
          less well-appointed than Carnegie's own. A threadbare rug.
          Bed with relatively clean sheets. A sink for washing.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Enjoy your stay. There'll be
                    someone outside your room all
                    night. If you need anything.
          
          Redridge smirks and closes the door, leaving Eli alone. Eli
          paces across the room. Finally sits down on the creaky old
          bed. Trying to figure out how he managed to get stuck here.
          
          He unshoulders his pack, sets it down. Lies down on the bed.
          It's been a while since he felt a real bed on his back.
          
          A KNOCK at the door. Eli gets quickly to his feet.
          
                              ELI
                    Hello?
          
          The door opens and CLAUDIA enters. Carrying a metal tub of
          water in both hands and, atop that, a dinner tray.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I have this for you. Water for
                    washing and some food.
          
          Eli just stands there. Totally unfamiliar with this kind of
          situation, it's been too long. She smiles, embarrassed.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Well... are you going to take it?
          
                              ELI
                    Oh. Thank you.
          
          He takes the stuff from her, sets it on the table.
          
                                                                 41.
          
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    You're very welcome.
          
          We get the impression that Claudia is as unfamiliar with this
          kind of polite interaction as Eli. But she likes it.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    It'll be dark soon.
          
          She strikes a match and lights the oil lamp on the table. The
          room is lit by its flickering glow.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Can I get you anything else?
          
                              ELI
                    No, thank you.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Well. Have a good night.
          
          As she turns for the door:
          
                              ELI
                    You're Carnegie's woman?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Why do you ask?
          
                              ELI
                    Just making conversation is all.
                    Haven't had one of those in a
                    while. Not a real one, leastways.
          
          Claudia smiles. Neither has she.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    He found me in the outland. I was
                    sixteen, my family had been...
                    well, they were gone. There was
                    just me and my baby.
          
                              ELI
                    You had a baby?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I'd met some men on the road. Bad
                    men. They...
          
          BEAT. She trails off, struggling with this unhappy memory.
          Eli gets it, raises a hand reassuringly.
          
                              ELI
                    It's all right.
          
                                                                  42.
          
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I was on the road for a year after
                    that. I couldn't feed myself, let
                    alone my little girl. And then Bill
                    found us and he promised he'd take
                    care of us. He told me he was going
                    to make a place where we could be
                    safe. And he did. He did all that.
                    He built this whole town. He kept
                    us safe. And he raised that child
                    like she was his own. He's been so
                    good to both of us. He saved us,
                    really.
          
          There's a bittersweet quality to Claudia's words. As though
          there is more to the story than she is telling.
          
          Eli pulls out a chair at the table, offers it to her.
          
                              ELI
                    You want to eat some?
          
          She smiles and sits. Eli sits across from her.
          
                              ELI
                    When did you go blind? In the war?
                    You get caught in a flash?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    No, I was born this way. I think
                    I'm lucky like that.
          
                              ELI
                    Lucky?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    It's not like I ever knew what I'm
                    missing. I was already used to
                    being like this by the time... by
                    the time it all happened. So I got
                    around pretty good even when I was
                    on my own. And now it's easy. I
                    know every creaky old floorboard in
                    here, and it's not like I ever go
                    any place else. Bill would never
                    allow it. He worries about me so
                    much.
          
          Again, bittersweet. The sense that Claudia feels trapped.
          Thinking about it begins to upset her. She gets up.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I should go. He'll be wondering
                    where I am.
          
                                                                 43.
          
          
          Eli stands, escorts her to the door and opens it.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Thank you. I enjoyed our
                    conversation.
          
                                ELI
                    So did I.
          
          Eli closes the door, then sits back at the table.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Carnegie washes, looking at himself in the old dressing-room
          mirror. He sees Claudia enter the room in its dim reflection.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You took your time in there. How
                    long does it take to deliver a
                    plate of food and some water?
          
          A subtly accusing tone. It makes Claudia nervous.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    He wanted to talk.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Oh? What about?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Nothing really. He asked me what it
                    was like to be blind.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    He tell you anything about him?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    No. I don't think he likes to talk
                    about himself much.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Yeah, I got that.
          
          Claudia moves to the bedside, begins to undress.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I don't think he's going to change
                    his mind by morning. I don't think
                    he's going to stay.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What makes you say that?
          
                                                                44.
          
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Just strikes me as the kind of man
                    who's of a mind, is all. Doesn't
                    seem like the type to go changing
                    it once it's set.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Well, we'll just see about that.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    You saw him. He's not like the
                    others. You won't be able to smooth-
                    talk him and wrap him around your
                    finger like you usually do.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    Who said anything about me?
                        (BEAT)
                    I'm sending Solara.
          
          Claudia reacts suddenly to this. Shocked and angry.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    You're doing what?
                              CARNEGIE
                    You know how often these walkers
                    get laid? Never. Least not by
                    anything living or willing. Girl
                    like her can be very persuasive.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    You can't send her in there with
                    him. He's dangerous, he's a killer!
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You went in there readily enough.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    That's different. Solara's just a
                    child, she can't-
          
          Carnegie sighs, tiring of this.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    She's a grown woman now, Claudia.
                    Sooner or later you're going to
                    have to accept that. She has to
                    earn her keep around here, same as
                    the rest of us.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    By working as a whore? That's all
                    you think she's fit for?
          
                                                                    45.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    We've each been given a talent to
                    help us make our way in this world.
                    Some people's gift is more evident
                    than others. Solara's sure as hell
                    is.
          
          Claudia looks at Carnegie in disgust.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    What kind of a man are you?
          
          Now it's Carnegie's turn to get angry. He rounds on her
          menacingly. She backs off as he approaches.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I'm the kind of man who'd pull a
                    helpless blind girl off the road, a
                    girl who'd been beaten and raped,
                    and give her a place where she can
                    live without fear! Without me you'd
                    be just another no-eye, lying dead
                    in the outland, picked clean by the
                    buzzards, or shoveling dirt down
                    there with the others. That's the
                    kind of man I am!
          
          He has her against the wall, his face just inches from hers.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I don't live without fear. I
                    haven't for a long time now.
          
          Carnegie calms himself, backs off. Claudia goes to leave.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Where are you going?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I'm not going to let you do this.
          
          Carnegie surges forward and pins Claudia to the wall.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    You're not going to let me?
                        (BEAT)
                    Nobody tells me what I can and
                    can't do in my own town. Nobody. I
                    built this world, and I am God
                    here! So don't go thinking about
                    screwing with my plans. You know
                    how this works. Solara goes against
                    me, you get hurt. You go against
                    me, she gets hurt.
          
                                                                 46.
          
          
          He releases his grip on her.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So let's not see anybody get hurt.
                    Okay?
          
          He speaks more softly now. As he strokes his hand tenderly
          through Claudia's hair, a tear runs down her cheek.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Dark outside, but the room is brightly lit by the glow of the
          oil lamp. Eli sits up on his bed, quietly reading the old
          leather-bound book from his backpack.
          
          Another KNOCK at the door. Eli jumps up and hurriedly hides
          the book inside his shirt.
          
                               ELI
                    Come in.
          
          The door opens to reveal Solara. Looking very different than
          she did before. Cleaned up and wearing a flowery summer
          dress, blonde hair let down over her shoulders. Stunning.
          
          Unlike everyone else we have met, she seems - physically, at
          least - totally unscarred by the horrors of the times. Far
          too beautiful a thing to belong in a world like this.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Hi. Can I come in?
          
                              ELI
                    Someone was already here with food
                    and water. I got everything I need.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You sure about that?
          
          She glides into the room, closing the door. She's good. Very
          seductive. Eli is totally disarmed in her presence.
          
                              SOLARA
                    It's too bright in here. Mind if I
                    turn it down a little?
          
          She doesn't wait for an answer. Moves to the table and turns
          down the oil lamp. A darker, more seductive lighting scheme.
          
                              SOLARA
                    That's better. I'm Solara. You're
                    Walker, right?
          
                                                                   47.
          
          
                              ELI
                    No. My name's Eli.
          
                              SOLARA
                    That short for something? Elias?
          
                               ELI
                    Elijah.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Elijah. I never heard that one
                    before. It's kinda cute.
          
          She sits on the bed, kicks her legs playfully. Her light
          cotton dress revealing in all the right places. The
          silhouette of her body bathed in the seductive glow of the
          oil lamp. No red-blooded man on earth could resist her.
          
                              ELI
                    Look, I don't mean to be rude. But
                    I'm really not interested.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You sure about that? It gets mighty
                    lonely out there on the road.
          
          She leans over on the bed, resting on her elbow. Her hair
          cascades down. God damn, she looks good.
          
                              SOLARA
                    If you're worried about money, this
                    is all paid for. The whole night.
          
                              ELI
                    It's not that. You're a very nice
                    girl. But I'm not that kind of man.
          
          She slides off the bed, approaches him. Begins to work the
          buttons of his shirt.
          
                              SOLARA
                    They're all that kind of man.
          He moves her hand away. Gently pushes her back a step.
          
                               ELI
                    I'm not.
          
          She is stunned. No man has ever turned her down before. And
          then she seems a little insulted.
          
                              SOLARA
                    They told me you were crazy. Maybe
                    they were right.
          
                                                                 48.
          
          
          Eli opens the door for her.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry. Good night.
          
          Suddenly all her other emotions give way to fear. She moves
          to the door and slams it shut again. Looks Eli in the eye.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Please don't make me leave. I have
                    to stay the night. If I don't...
          
                              ELI
                    If you don't, what?
          
                              SOLARA
                    He'll hurt my mom.
          
                              ELI
                    Who will? Carnegie?
          
          She nods, fighting back a tear. This angers Eli.
          
                              ELI
                    Maybe he and I oughta have words.
          
          He goes for the door handle, but she stops him.
          
                              SOLARA
                    No! Please, don't!
          
                              ELI
                    He's hurting you. He's hurting your
                    mother. He's-
          
                              SOLARA
                    He's my dad.
          
          BEAT. Eli moves his hand away from the door.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Look, if you want to help me, just
                    let me stay here tonight. We don't
                    have to do anything. I'll sleep on
                    the floor. Tomorrow you can tell my
                    dad that we had a good time. I'll
                    be no trouble, I swear.
          
          She looks up at Eli imploringly. Transformed. No longer the
          teenage sex kitten. Now she's just a frightened little girl.
          
                              ELI
                    You want to have a conversation?
          
                                                                 49.
          
          
          She smiles, wiping the tear from her cheek.
          
          LATER
          
          Eli and Solara sit together on the bed. A silent BEAT. At
          first, it appears as though they have nothing to say.
          
                                ELI
                      You know, you don't have to be
                      afraid of me. What happened down
                      there in the bar...
          
                                SOLARA
                      I'm not afraid of you. I know you
                      didn't start that trouble. When I
                      first saw you, I knew you weren't
                      the type to go looking for it.
          
                                ELI
                      How'd you know that?
          
                                 SOLARA
                      My mom says I'm a good judge of
                      character. She says I can read
                      people. That I know a good man when
                      I see one.
          
          She smiles. Eli is surprised to find himself smiling back.
          
                                SOLARA
                      So... you're pretty old, right?
          
          Eli smiles, amused by the bluntness of the question.
          
                                SOLARA
                      I'm sorry. I just mean, I haven't
                      seen too many people your age. How
                      old are you exactly?
          
                                ELI
                      You know, I don't rightly remember.
          
                                SOLARA
                      But you're old enough. I mean, you
                      remember what it was like? In the
                      world before?
          
          Eli nods.
          
                                SOLARA
                      What was it like?
          
          Eli thinks about this. Dredging through old, old memories.
          
                                                                    50.
          
          
                               ELI
                    Better than this.
                        (BEAT)
                    People lived longer back then.
                    Longer than me. Some were more than
                    a hundred years old.
          
          Solara smiles like she's having her leg pulled.
          
                               SOLARA
                    Come on.
          
                              ELI
                    I swear, it's true. Nowadays it's
                    not the same. If you're sick or
                    you're weak or you're old you won't
                    last long out on the road.
          
                              SOLARA
                    So how come you have?
          
          BEAT. Eli thinks. Should he or shouldn't he?
          
                              ELI
                    Can I read you something?
          
                              SOLARA
                    Wait. You can read?
          
          Eli pulls the book from his shirt. Solara's eyes widen.
          
                              SOLARA
                    And you have a book?
                              ELI
                    Not just any book.
          
          For the first time we see that it's a KING JAMES BIBLE. An
          embossed GOLD CROSS on its old leather cover.
          
          Eli opens it up, scans the page with his finger until he
          finds the passage he's looking for.
          
                              ELI
                    The Lord is my shepherd. I shall
                    not want. He makes me lie down in
                    green pastures. He leads me beside
                    still waters. He restores my soul.
                    He leads me in the paths of
                    righteousness.
          
          ON SOLARA as she listens to Eli read. Transfixed.
          
                                                                  51.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Though I walk through the valley of
                    the shadow of death, I will fear no
                    evil. For you are with me. Your rod
                    and your staff, they comfort me.
                    You prepare a table before me in
                    the presence of my enemies. You
                    anoint my head with oil. My cup
                    runs over. Surely goodness and
                    mercy shall follow me, all the days
                    of my life. And I will dwell in the
                    house of the Lord forever.
          
                              SOLARA
                    That's beautiful. Did you write
                    that?
          
                                ELI
                          (SMILES)
                    No.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What book is it from? Is it poetry?
          
                              ELI
                    I guess you could think of it that
                    way. It's from the Holy Bible.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I never heard of it. What's it
                    about?
          
          BEAT as Eli thinks. How on earth to answer that?
          
                              ELI
                    It's about love, and forgiveness,
                    and life and death, and mercy, and
                    revenge, and the beginning and the
                    end of the world. I guess it's
                    about a little bit of everything.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    Can I see?
          
          She reaches out for the book but he snatches it away.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What? I'm not going to do anything.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry. I'm charged to protect
                    this book. I can't trust it with
                    anyone. Not even for a while.
          
                                                                 52.
          
          
                              SOLARA
                    What's so special about that book?
          
          BEAT. Eli runs his fingers across the embossed gold cross on
          the beat-up leather cover.
          
                              ELI
                    It's the last one. There are no
                    other books like this. All the
                    others are gone - destroyed by the
                    war or in the burnings that came
                    after. This is the only one that
                    survived until now. The last one
                    anywhere.
          
                              SOLARA
                    How can you know that?
          
                               ELI
                    I just know.
                        (BEAT)
                    For a long while after it happened,
                    I just wandered on the road like
                    most everybody else. There were
                    still a lot of people around back
                    then, in the beginning. I didn't
                    really know what I should do or
                    where I was going. I was just
                    moving from place to place, trying
                    to stay alive. And then one day I
                    heard this voice. I don't know how
                    to explain it, it's like it was
                    coming from inside me. But I could
                    hear it, clear as day. Clear as I
                    can hear you talking to me now.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What did it say?
          
                              ELI
                    It led me to this place, I don't
                    really know where. And I found this
                    book buried deep under some rubble.
                    No way no-one was ever going to
                    find it if they didn't know exactly
                    where to look.
          
                              SOLARA
                    But you knew because the voice told
                    you?
          
                              ELI
                    That's right. And that voice told
                    me to carry the book west.

                               ELI (cont'd)
                    It told me that a path would be
                    laid out before me, that I'd be led
                    to a place where this book would be
                    safe. It told me I'd be protected
                    against anyone or anything that
                    tried to stand in my way. If only I
                    would have faith.

                              SOLARA
                        (SKEPTICAL)
                    Because a voice you heard in your
                    head told you to.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm not crazy. I didn't imagine it.
                    I know what I heard.
          
                              SOLARA
                    So who was it? The voice?
          
          BEAT as Eli considers his answer.
          
                              ELI
                    A very important, very powerful
                    man.
          
                              SOLARA
                    More powerful than my dad?
          
                              ELI
                        (SMILES)
                    I should say so, yes.
          
          BEAT. The two of them sit in silence for a moment.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Would you teach me to read?
          
                              ELI
                    What?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I never learned. No-one around here
                    knows how. Only my dad, and he
                    won't teach me. I think he likes
                    being the only one who can read. I
                    think it makes him feel powerful.
          
                              ELI
                    I think you're probably right.

                              SOLARA

                              ELI
                    I'm sorry. I'm leaving tomorrow.
                    And I won't be back this way, ever.
          
          She looks down, sad. She likes this guy. She doesn't want him
          to leave. Eli can sense her sadness.
          
                              ELI
                    Are you hungry?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I guess a little.
          
                              ELI
                    There's some food on the table over
                    there. Let's eat.
          
          She walks over to where the dinner tray is covered by a small
          cloth. She whips it away - to reveal ELI'S RAT nibbling on a
          piece of cheese. Solara SHRIEKS and backs away.
          
          The rat scurries down the table leg and leaps up onto Eli's
          shoulder, just as afraid of her as she is of it.
          
                              ELI
                    It's okay, it's okay. He's with me.
                        (to the rat)
                    Don't be afraid, pal. This is
                    Solara. She's our friend.
          
          Solara approaches warily. Reaches out and strokes him. The
          rat scurries up her arm. She almost shrieks again.
          
                              ELI
                    It's okay. It means he likes you.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    It does?
                              ELI
                    Trust me, if he didn't like you,
                    you'd know about it.
          
          Solara pets the rat on her shoulder. Then:
          
                              SOLARA
                    Did you really mean that?
          
                                 ELI
                    Mean what?
          
                                                                 55.
          
          
                              SOLARA
                    That I'm your friend.
          
          BEAT. Eli finds himself surprised that he admitted such a
          thing. When is the last time he had someone he could call a
          friend? He can't even remember.
          
                              ELI
                    Sure.
          
          She smiles. Giggles as the rat's whiskers tickle her ear.
          
          Eli breaks the cheese in two and gives half to Solara. She's
          about to eat but stops as Eli clasp his hands in prayer.
          
                              ELI
                    Our father, we thank you for this
                    meal which you have been so
                    gracious to place before us.
          
          Unsure of what to do, Solara mimics Eli, putting her hands
          together and bowing her head.
          
                               ELI
                    We thank you for a warm bed and a
                    roof over our heads on a cold night
                    such as this.
                        (BEAT)
                    And we thank you for the gift of
                    friendship in these hard times.
          
          Solara looks at him, touched by that.
          
                               ELI
                    Amen.
                        (BEAT)
                    You say that last part too.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Amen. And now we eat?
          
                              ELI
                    And now we eat.
          
          They sit and eat together, sharing the simple meal.
          
          PULL OUT from the window as they eat, away from the theater.
          Away from the town and its flickering points of torchlight.
          Moving farther and farther away until the entire town is
          consumed by the darkness of the world.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAWN
          
          The pale sun rises over the town. To establish:
          
                                                                    56.
          
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - DINING ROOM - MORNING
          
          What was once the theater's COSTUME ROOM - OLD MANNEQUINS
          still stand around in the corners, creating an eerie feel.
          
          Carnegie and Claudia sit at a DINING TABLE, eating breakfast
          in silence. A third place is set, but no-one is seated there.
          
          Solara enters and sits down without a word.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Good morning, Solara.
          
          Solara doesn't say anything.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I said good morning, Solara.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Morning, dad.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    How was your night? Did you sleep
                    well?
          
          Claudia appears perturbed by Carnegie's subtle probing.
          Solara flashes him a frosty look.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I did like you asked. Isn't that
                    what you really want to know? Just
                    come out and say it.
          
          Carnegie glares at her sternly.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You don't speak to your father like
                    that. When I ask you a civil
                    question, I expect a civil answer.
          
          Solara lowers her head, scorned. Carnegie continues eating.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Did he say anything?
          
                              SOLARA
                    No. We didn't talk much.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Well, do you think you managed to
                    change his mind about staying?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I don't know. He said he had to go.
          
                                                                 57.
          
          
          Carnegie puts down his food, looks angrily at her.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So he did talk? What else did he
                    say? Come on, I want all of it!
          
                              SOLARA
                    That's all he said. That he was
                    going to be leaving this morning.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    We'll see. This is my town, nobody
                    leaves until I say they leave.
          
          He glances knowingly at Claudia.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Solara, honey, eat something.
          
          She looks at the food on the plate before her. Then closes
          her eyes and clasps her hands in prayer.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Our father, thank you for this meal
                    which you have been so gracious to
                    place before us.
          
          Claudia and Carnegie freeze. Carnegie stares at her, agape.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Thank you for my mother. Please
                    watch over her and keep her safe.
          
                                CARNEGIE
                    Solara...
          
                              SOLARA
                    Thank you for all the-
          
                                CARNEGIE
                    Solara!
          She snaps suddenly out of it, looks at her father.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What the hell are you doing?
          
          She doesn't respond. Looks embarrassed.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    God didn't put this food on the
                    table. Do you hear me?
                        (BEAT)
                    Who put this food on the table?
          
                                                                 58.
          
          
          Solara says nothing, just looks down at the table.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I said who put this food on the
                    table?
          
                              SOLARA
                        (SOFTLY)
                    You did.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Who taught you that?
          
                              SOLARA
                    Eli taught me.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                        (PUZZLED)
                    Who the hell is Eli?
          
                              SOLARA
                    The walker. That's his name.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    And he taught you how to say those
                    words? How did he know them?
          
                              SOLARA
                    He had them written down in a book.
          
          This piques Carnegie's interest greatly.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What kind of a book?
          
          He barks the question at her. Solara is rattled.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I don't remember! It was an old
                    leather book. It had kind of a...
                    thing on the front of it.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    Show me.
          
          Solara makes the SIGN OF A CRUCIFIX with her index fingers.
          Carnegie's eyes widen; he can barely believe it.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    He had a bible?
          
                              SOLARA
                    That's what it was. A holy bible.
                    Daddy, what's wrong? Did I...
          
                                                                 59.
          
          
          Carnegie BOLTS SUDDENLY FROM THE TABLE, overturning his chair
          and sending his plate of food crashing to the floor.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - LOBBY BALCONY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carnegie races across the landing, toward the ARMED GUARD
          posted outside Eli's bedroom. The guard steps aside as
          Carnegie flings the door open and barges inside.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Empty. No sign of Eli or his gear anywhere. The window is
          WIDE OPEN, the curtains fluttering gently in the breeze.
          
          INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
          
          His hands shaking, the engineer disconnects Eli's battery
          from the generator and places it on the counter.
          
          Eli stands on the other side of the counter with his SHOTGUN
          TRAINED RIGHT AT THE MAN'S HEAD. He takes the battery from
          him and stuffs it into his backpack.
          
          EXT. PALLADIUM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carnegie races from the lobby entrance and looks up at the
          open window to Eli's room. He could have easily jumped.
          
          Redridge emerges onto the street behind him.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Something wrong, boss?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Something wrong? Something wrong?
                    The walker's gone!
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    That can't be. I had a man outside
                    his room the whole time.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    He jumped out the window, you
                    idiot! You didn't think to put a
                    man outside the fucking window?
                        (beat; fuming)
                    Find him. Now!
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Boss, he could be anywhere. He...
                        (REALIZATION)
                    A battery. Didn't he say something
                    about a battery?
          
                                                                  60.
          
          
          They turn to face the engineer's storefront - just as ELI
          EMERGES ONTO THE STREET, shotgun still in his hand.
          
          EVERYBODY FREEZES. Like a wild west stand-off. Redridge's
          fingers play over the butt of the pistol on his hip.
          
          BEAT as time hangs perfectly still for a second... and then
          ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.
          
          Redridge draws and FIRES, SHATTERING A PARKING METER just
          inches from Eli and showering quarters all over the sidewalk.
          
          Eli rushes along the sidewalk, RETURNING FIRE. The shot wings
          Redridge in the shoulder. He goes down, wounded.
          
          Carnegie dives for cover as FOUR MORE GUNMEN rush from the
          theater. Carnegie waves frantically in Eli's direction.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Go! Go!
          
          They spot Eli sprinting away and rush off in pursuit.
          
          Carnegie gets to his feet and storms back inside the theater.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Solara and Claudia watch through the window. Turn suddenly
          when they hear the door slam open behind them.
          
          Carnegie stands in the doorway, glaring at them.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
          
          LOCAL RESIDENTS scream and rush to and fro in panic as Eli
          darts along the boardwalk.
          
          CARNEGIE'S GUNMEN pursue, firing their rifles wildly on the
          run. The bullets splinter wood, pierce barrels and crates,
          narrowly missing Eli as he dashes, keeping his head down.
          
          Eli aims the shotgun and FIRES without even looking. The shot
          HITS A GUNMAN SQUARE IN THE CHEST, dropping him to the dirt.
          
          Eli hits the deck, diving for cover behind a JUNKPILE as more
          gunfire ricochets all around him. He takes a moment to
          collect himself, reloads the shotgun.
          
          The three remaining gunmen close in on the junkpile warily.
          
          Eli signs a cross over himself with the shotgun, looks to the
          sky and offers up a silent prayer. Then emerges from around
          the junkpile back into the street. All three gunmen OPEN
          FIRE, their bullets whipping past on either side of him.
          
                                                                 61.
          
          
          In one swift motion Eli raises the shotgun and FIRES. Three
          shots in quick succession. And then there is silence. Smoke
          wisps from the shotgun's sawn-off barrel.
          
          The three gunmen LIE DEAD IN THE STREET. One hit square in
          the chest. The other two each have maybe one half of their
          heads remaining.
          
          Eli looks around. He's right at the end of the main road, the
          perimeter where the town meets the open desert. He's free.
          
          And then, A GIRL'S SCREAM. Distant but unmistakable.
          
          Eli whips around. In the upstairs window of the theater,
          Carnegie shoves Solara roughly against the wall. Barking
          angrily at her, shaking her.
          
          Eli looks at the road. Then up at the theater. Then back to
          the road again.
          
                              ELI
                        (quietly; to himself)
                    It ain't your concern. Stay on the
                    path.
          
          But he sounds less resolute now than before. Until today this
          was always a simple decision for him to make. But now...
          
                                ELI
                    Dammit...
          
          He marches back toward the theater, stepping over the fallen
          bodies of the gunmen, re-loading his shotgun as he goes.
          
          EXT. PALLADIUM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Redridge finally manages to clamber back up to his feet,
          wincing as he clutches his painful shoulder wound.
          
          He looks up just in time to see Eli coming right at him.
          Without breaking stride, he COLD-COCKS Redridge in the jaw
          with the shotgun, sending him back to the deck, out cold.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli kicks the door wide open, finds Carnegie holding Solara
          against the wall. She sobs, terrified. Eli levels the shotgun
          at Carnegie's head.
          
                              ELI
                    Let her go.
          
                                                                 62.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    That cannon of yours casts a pretty
                    wide net. I don't reckon you can
                    hit me without hitting her.
          
                              ELI
                    I reckon you're right.
          
          He holsters the shotgun. Then in the same fluid motion draws
          a PISTOL from his belt that we never even knew he had.
          
                              ELI
                    This, though? With this I'll shave
                    the hairs clean off your balls at a
                    hundred paces. You believe me?
          
          Carnegie releases his grip on Solara, steps away, hands up.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I believe you. I have to say I'm
                    surprised to hear that language
                    coming from you, though. I mean,
                    you being a holy man and all.
          
          BEAT. Eli glances at Solara.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    She told me all about it. Told me
                    all about the bible, too.
                        (BEAT)
                    Can I see it?
          
                              ELI
                    No.
          
          Carnegie takes a small step forward. Suddenly, his whole
          demeanor changes, and he now looks at Eli imploringly.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You know, I've been searching for a
                    book like that one for years. All
                    I've ever wanted was to bring the
                    word of God to these poor
                    unfortunates here. To shine its
                    light upon them and give them
                    something in this wretched world
                    that they could believe in.
                    Something to live for! It's why I
                    built this town, did you know that?
                    All we've been missing is the word
                    to show us the way. And now, praise
                    the Lord, you've brought it to us.
          
                                                                 63.
          
          
          Carnegie takes a step closer. He appears entirely sincere -
          but then he is very good at doing so.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    It's not right to keep that book
                    hidden away, all to yourself. The
                    word is meant to be shared with
                    others. It's meant to be spread!
                    Isn't that what you want? I could
                    help you do that. You and me, we
                    could do it together.
          
          BEAT. Eli seems to be considering what he's heard carefully.
          
                              ELI
                    The Lord himself told me that if I
                    carried this book west, one day I
                    would find the place where it was
                    needed. Where it would be safe.
                    Where it belonged.
          
          Carnegie smiles broadly... and then with a sudden blur of
          movement Eli PISTOL-WHIPS him to the floor.
          
                              ELI
                    But this ain't it.
          
          He turns to Solara and offers her his hand.
          
                               ELI
                    Come on.
          
          EXT. PALLADIUM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli emerges from the theater, leading Solara onto the street.
          RESIDENTS part before them, staring at Eli with astonishment.
          
          Eli passes the statue of Carnegie - and STOPS. Something
          about that thing is bothering him.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What? What is it?
          
                              ELI
                    You shall not make for yourself any
                    graven image...
          
          He turns, drawing his samurai sword and in the same fluid
          motion SLICING across the base of the statue.
          
          BEAT. And then the STATUE TOPPLES from the neat cut just
          below the knees, CRASHING DOWN to the ground and SHATTERING.
          The assembled residents GASP at this defiant display.
          
                                                                    64.
          
          
          Eli sheathes his sword and takes Solara by the hand again.
          
                              ELI
                    Now we can go.
          
          CRANE UP over the main street as they both head out of town.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          The town barely visible on the distant horizon behind Eli and
          Solara. Eli walks as he always has, his pace steady and slow.
          Still, Solara lags along behind. She's already tired.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Where are we going?
          
                              ELI
                    I told you where I'm going. You're
                    free to go wherever you want.
          
          She stops in the road.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Wait... I'm not coming with you?
          
                              ELI
                    You're only going to slow me down.
          
          Eli doesn't stop walking. Solara is forced to catch up.
          
                              SOLARA
                    So what the hell was all that about
                    back there?
          
                              ELI
                    The man was hurting you. I don't
                    like that, so I put a stop to it.
                    Now you're free. He can't hurt you
                    any more.
                        (off her stare)
                    No need to thank me.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Thank you? For what? What am I
                    supposed to do now?
          
                              ELI
                    Whatever you want. That's what
                    being free is.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Whatever I want. Except go with
                    you.
          
                                                                   65.
          
          
                              ELI
                    I have to get where I'm going. I
                    can't be worrying about someone
                    else along the way.
          
          Solara is incredibly hurt by this. Blinks back a tear.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I thought you were my friend.
          
          BEAT. Eli stops and turns back to face her.
          
                              ELI
                    It's dangerous in the outland. I
                    wouldn't want you to get hurt.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I'll be safe so long as I'm with
                    you. I know it.
          
          Eli sighs. He's not getting through to her. So now comes the
          harsh truth of it:
          
                              ELI
                    You don't want this life. I gotta
                    do what I gotta do. Don't have no
                    choice in it. But you do. And I
                    can't let you choose this. You
                    don't want to be like me. You don't
                    want to spend your life alone.
          
          Solara steps closer, her eyes pleading.
          
                              SOLARA
                    If I came with you, I wouldn't be
                    alone. And neither would you.
          
          A long BEAT as Eli considers this. For a moment it appears as
          though Solara might have won him over. But then:
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry. Look, maybe it's best
                    you just go on back to town.
          
          He turns and walks off, leaving her in the road. She stands
          there, furious, screaming at his back as he walks away.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Fine! I'll do just that! I had a
                    life there! A family! I didn't ask
                    you to save me! I didn't ask you
                    for anything!
          
                                                                 66.
          
          
          He doesn't turn or acknowledge her at all. Just keeps walking
          off into the horizon. Getting smaller all the time.
          
          Solara stands there in the road, weeping. All alone.
          
                              SOLARA
                        (SOFTLY)
                    Fine.
          
          She turns and walks back in the direction she came.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - BARNYARD - DAY
          
          A small, penned-in area to the rear of the Palladium
          containing an eclectic bunch of farmyard animals. Goats,
          sheep, geese, pigs. Mostly mangy, sad-looking specimens.
          
          Carnegie stands in the yard, tossing handfuls of animal feed
          from a nearby sack onto the ground. He watches with
          satisfaction as the animals gather at his feet to feed.
          
          Claudia emerges from the theater with an ice-pack.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Thank you, darling.
          
          Carnegie applies it to his jaw, red and swollen from Eli's
          pistol-whip. Redridge appears nearby, his arm in a sling.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He killed four of my men and walked
                    out of town without a scratch. They
                    shot off a hundred rounds at him
                    and he didn't get hit once. I never
                    even heard of anything like that.
          
          Carnegie doesn't appear to be listening. He is lost in a
          world of his own as he tends to the farm animals.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You know, I always thought of
                    myself as a shepherd. Bringing
                    together the wayward and the lost.
                    Tending to my flock. But all the
                    things I want to do, I can't do
                    them on my own. The one thing I've
                    needed is the one thing that's
                    always been missing. Then one day
                    it walks right into town - so close
                    I can almost touch it - and then
                    walks right on out again.
          
          Carnegie finally looks up from his animals, at Redridge.
          
                                                                 67.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I want you to put a crew together
                    and go out after him.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He's not going to work for you. I
                    think he's made that plain.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I'm not interested in him any more.
                    I only want the book he's carrying.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    If I'm gonna risk my ass hunting
                    down this maniac in the outland, I
                    need to know it's gonna be worth
                    it. I need to know what's so
                    special about this goddamn book.
          
          BEAT as Carnegie considers this.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You have no idea. You're too young,
                    you don't remember the world
                    before. But I do. I remember.
          
          He turns back to his animals, summoning up old memories.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    When I was a kid my parents used to
                    read that book every goddamn day.
                    My mother, she'd read it along with
                    this smooth-talking preacher on the
                    TV screen. They used to be able to
                    beam these guys right into your
                    house, into every house in the
                    world, through the air. Like magic.
                        (BEAT)
                    She worked two jobs and she sent
                    every spare penny she had to that
                    fucking guy on the TV. My old man,
                    he'd read that book, then he'd get
                    liquored up and kick my ass, tell
                    me all about the power and the
                    glory and how I was going to burn
                    forever in hell for the sins I was
                    born with. He made sure he beat it
                    into me good.
          
          He snaps out of his reverie and looks at Redridge.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Don't you see? It's not just any
                    book.

                    It has the power to motivate
                    people. It can give them hope, it
                    can terrify them. It can shape
                    them. Control them.
                        (BEAT)
                    Do you remember how I built this
                    town? It wasn't done with force,
                    and it wasn't done just with water.
                    It was done with the power of
                    words. I created this place out of
                    nothing, because people believed in
                    a promise that I sold to them.
                    Those guys on the TV, they were
                    richer than you could ever dream,
                    and it was all built the same way.
                    With words. With promises. And with
                    that book.
                        (BEAT)
                    That book is a weapon. Aimed right
                    at the hearts and minds of the weak
                    and the desperate. Just imagine
                    what I could do with it.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Boss... we're running out of water
                    and the people are running out of
                    patience. You're trying to tell me
                    that a book is going to keep them
                    in line?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Oh, it'll do much more than that.
                    The water in this town may run dry,
                    but faith - that springs eternal!
                    And that faith will help turn this
                    town into a city. And this city
                    into a nation. It will help me
                    build a new world. In my image.
                    People will come from far and wide
                    to hear what's inside of it.
                    They'll follow me anywhere just to
                    get a taste of it. And they'll do
                    whatever I tell them.
          
          As usual, Carnegie's slick rhetoric has worked - Redridge has
          totally bought into it. Claudia, however, looks appalled.
          
                               REDRIDGE
                    And what if this book don't work?
                    What if it don't say what you want
                    it to say?
          
                                                                 69.
          
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    Oh, it'll say what I want, I can
                    promise you that. Because I'm going
                    to rewrite it. I'll keep the parts
                    that work for me and make the rest
                    whatever I need it to be.
                        (BEAT)
                    A new bible, for a new world.
          
          He reaches out and takes Claudia by the hand.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What do you think, darling? A whole
                    new world, to do with as we will.
                    Won't that be grand?
          
          She smiles halfheartedly, but it's clear she is mortified.
          
          Carnegie turns back to Redridge.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Find that book.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He has half a day on us already.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So use the motor pool.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    There ain't much gas in reserve.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Whatever there is, use it.
          
          Redridge nods and goes to leave.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    What about Solara?
          
          BEAT. In all this excitement about the book, she had been
          completely forgotten about.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    She's still out there. With him.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Right. Right. Of course. Bring her
                    back, too, if you can. But-
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    The book. I know.
          
                                                                    70.
          
          
          Redridge turns and leaves. Claudia scowls at Carnegie, but he
          doesn't even notice, just goes back to feeding his animals.
          
          EXT. DESOLATE ROAD - DAY
          
          Solara wanders the road. She's tired. The sun beats down
          mercilessly. Nothing but desolation and wasteland all around.
          
          She comes to a FORK IN THE ROAD. Stops at the junction,
          unsure. Was this here before? She doesn't remember.
          
          There are no signs. Both paths look the same. Which one is
          which? She turns and looks back, looks around. She's lost.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Shit. Shit.
          
          She alternates her finger between the two paths. Eeny-meeny-
          miney-moe. Picks a path and follows it, headed down the road.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          Eli walks on. Slow and steady. His gaze, as ever, fixed
          firmly on the horizon. Takes a swig from his canteen.
          
          Suddenly, he STOPS and stands stock still in the center of
          the road. Impossible to know what he's thinking.
          
          He stands there for a long time.
          
          EXT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - DAY
          
          Solara comes upon an abandoned CHEVRON STATION. She doesn't
          remember passing this. Looks back up and down the road.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Where the hell am I?
          
          There's a RUSTED CAR parked at one of the pumps. Like every
          other car we've seen, stripped of its tires and engine.
          
          She walks around to the driver's side. A PETRIFIED FEMALE
          BODY lies on the ground, half-in, half-out of the car.
          
          Solara claps her hand to her mouth and recoils, horrified.
          
          In the dead woman's hand is a dusty bottle of MINERAL WATER.
          Solara hesitates. Not wanting to get closer. But so thirsty.
          
          She braces herself, grimacing, and tries to take the bottle,
          but the dead woman's hand is closed tight around it. She
          pulls harder and wrenches it free. In the process she falls
          on her butt and flips the corpse over onto its back.
          
                                                                  71.
          
          
          In the other woman's arm, she has a SKELETAL BABY cradled to
          her bosom. It seems to be staring right at Solara.
          
          Solara SCREAMS and frantically shuffles backward away from
          it. Gets to her feet and runs across the forecourt.
          
          She stops by the station shop and rests against the wall,
          hyperventilating, heart pounding. Trying to get it together.
          
          She inspects the water in the bottle. It looks clean.
          Unscrews the cap with shaking hands and takes a sip.
          
          She SPITS IT BACK OUT, coughing. It's rank. Undrinkable.
          
          INT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - FOOD COURT - DAY
          
          Solara enters. Gloomy inside. Comprehensively looted. Empty
          shelves coated in thick sheets of dust.
          
          She moves further in, searching for something, anything. But
          the place has been gutted. There's nothing. She checks the
          wall of dead refrigerators. Shattered glass, all empty.
          
          She's never known desolation and emptiness like this. It's
          beginning to scare her. She wheels around in a panic.
          
                              FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hello?
          
          Distant, calling from outside. Solara hears it and freezes.
          
                              FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hello? Can anyone help me?
          
          EXT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS
          
          She runs out across the forecourt, onto the road.
          
          A FEMALE FIGURE is hunched by the side of the road about
          fifty yards up ahead. Hard to see what she's doing from here.
          
                              SLUMPED FEMALE
                    Hello? Is anybody there?
          
          Solara starts walking toward her.
          
          The woman has her back to Solara. She's on her knees,
          muttering to herself. Gathering objects up from the road.
          
          As Solara moves closer, we see that the woman is struggling
          with an UPTURNED SHOPPING CART. Stuck in a roadside ditch,
          its contents spilled out next to a few BRACKEN BUSHES.
          
                                                                   72.
          
          
          We see her face now. It's the SAME YOUNG WOMAN from before.
          The same shopping cart. The same trap.
          
                                SOLARA
                      Are you all right?
          
          The woman looks around, sees Solara standing nearby. She's
          shocked to see that it's a girl.
          
                                YOUNG WOMAN
                      Oh. Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. You
                      go along, I'll be okay.
          
                                SOLARA
                      You look like you need some help.
          
                                YOUNG WOMAN
                      No, really! I'm fine. Really... I
                      need a man to help. Not you. You
                      just keep along. Please.
          
          The woman seems anxious to get rid of her. Tries to indicate
          the threat silently with her eyes, but Solara doesn't get it.
          
                                SOLARA
                      It'll just take a minute.
          
          She steps into the ditch and starts to haul the cart out.
          
                                YOUNG WOMAN
                      Really, it's fine! Please!
          
          Too   late. THREE ROAD BRIGANDS POUNCE FROM THE BUSHES. Every
          bit   as brutish and horrifying as the group that Eli killed on
          the   road in our opening. They grab Solara and drag her from
          the   road into the desert, screaming and kicking all the way.
          
                                YOUNG WOMAN
                      Let her go! She ain't got nothing!
          
          The BRIGAND LEADER looks Solara up and down lustfully.
          
                                BRIGAND LEADER
                      I ain't too sure about that.
          
          Solara is reviled by the man. He's filthy, his stench
          overpowering. One eye missing, just a dark, empty socket. He
          licks his lips, revealing a mouth almost devoid of teeth.
          
                                YOUNG WOMAN
                      This wasn't the deal!
          
          The brigand leader lashes out and grabs her by the throat.
          
                                                                    73.
          
          
                              BRIGAND LEADER
                    Shut your mouth, bitch. You oughta
                    be grateful you're getting a break.
          
          He releases her. She slumps to the dirt, whimpering.
          
                              BRIGAND LEADER
                    Never did care much for that dried-
                    up old snatch anyhow.
          
          He looks back to the struggling Solara.
          
                              BRIGAND LEADER
                    This one, though... this one looks
                    fresh. You a virgin?
          
          She says nothing, just sobs helplessly.
          
                              BRIGAND LEADER
                    Well, let's find out.
          
          He unbuckles his pants, lets them drop to his ankles.
          
          We hear a sound. It's hard to place. Something like a THHUP.
          
          The brigand leader is frozen in shock. His face goes pale,
          the blood draining from it. The two bandits holding Solara
          look at their leader in dismay. Staring down at his crotch.
          
          A quiet whimper escapes from his lips as he looks down.
          
          There is an ARROW IMBEDDED IN HIS CROTCH. What was once down
          there is now just a bloody mess of mangled meat. More blood
          streams down his thighs. A real horror show.
          
          He staggers backward, shrieking. Hands shaking. Staring down
          at the awful wound from which the long arrow shaft extends.
          
          The two other brigands release Solara and whip around,
          scanning the horizon. They see nothing. One of them has a
          RIFLE. He unslings it and aims it frantically around.
          
          Then they both see it. Coming right at them. The most
          terrifying thing either has ever seen.
          
          ELI, WALKING TOWARD THEM FROM THE ROAD, OUT OF THE SUN. His
          silhouette distorted in the rippling heat. An avenging angel.
          
          He pulls another arrow and draws it back as the rifle bandit
          trains his weapon on him, finger tightening on the trigger.
          
          Eli SHOOTS. The arrow sails through the air and RIGHT INTO
          THE RIFLE BARREL. The feathers at the end of the shaft
          plugging the muzzle tight.
          
                                                                  74.
          
          
          Rifle bandit pulls the trigger. The gun EXPLODES, BLOWING HIS
          HANDS CLEAN OFF. He falls to the ground, screaming.
          
          Eli only had two arrows. He shoulders the bow and draws his
          sword. All the remaining brigand has is a small knife. The
          two now square off at arm's length. A hopeless mismatch.
          
          BEAT. The knife brigand hesitates, trembling. And then RUSHES
          ELI WITH THE KNIFE. Eli deftly sidesteps, flourishes the
          sword. So quick it almost seems like he didn't move at all.
          
          The knife bandit staggers forward a couple more steps. His
          hand goes limp and drops the knife.
          
          And then his HEAD FALLS BACKWARD like a Pez dispenser. Almost
          completely decapitated, but not quite. Blood fountains from
          the neck stump as his body falls to the dirt.
          
          Eli moves to the other two bandits who lay horribly wounded
          on the ground, but still breathing. He stands over their
          fallen bodies. They stare back up at him, helpless.
          
          He crouches down between them in the dust.
          
                              ELI
                    I offer you both one final chance
                    in this life to seek forgiveness
                    for your sins so that your souls
                    may find salvation. Will you say
                    with me the act of contrition?
          
          The brigand leader defiantly spits blood at him.
          
                                BRIGAND LEADER
                    Fuck you.
          
          Eli sighs. Stands and looks down on him without pity.
          
                              ELI
                    Some might think it'd be most
                    fitting to leave you here like
                    this. Let you die slow in the sun.
                    But I know better. I know where
                    you're going. And the sooner you
                    get there, the sooner you'll get
                    what's coming to you.
          
          He plunges his sword into the bandit leader, finishing him
          off. Pulls the arrow from his crotch and wipes it clean.
          
          He turns to the other man, raising his sword.
          
                                RIFLE BANDIT
                    Wait!
          
                                                                   75.
          
          
          Eli pauses, sword hovering over him, poised to strike.
          
                              RIFLE BANDIT
                    I want to say it. I want to be
                    forgiven.
          
          Eli crouches once more by his side.
          
                              ELI
                    Repeat after me. Oh God, I am
                    heartily sorry for having offended
                    thee, and I detest all my sins.
          
          The bandit follows along with Eli, mouthing the words
          quietly. The life ebbing from him with each moment.
          
                              ELI
                    I firmly resolve, with the help of
                    thy grace, to confess my sins, and
                    do penance, and to amend my life.
                    Amen.
          
                              RIFLE BANDIT
                    Amen...
          
          His eyes roll back as his final breath leaves him. Dead. Eli
          signs a cross over his body, then stands and walks away.
          
          Solara sits on the ground nearby, a wreck. Eli approaches and
          gathers her up in his arms. She clings on to him tightly.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You came back for me.
          
                              ELI
                    What are friends for?
          
          She laughs, a tear rolling down her cheek. Grips him tighter.
          
          He helps her up and escorts her back to the road.
          
                              ELI
                    This is the deal. You keep up. You
                    pull your weight. You fall behind,
                    I can't help you. Okay?
          
                              SOLARA
                    Okay.
          
          She looks back at the young woman still slumped in the dirt.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What about her?
          
                                                                    76.
          
          
                              ELI
                    There's nothing can be done for
                    her.
          
          They walk on down the road.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY
          
          METAL GARAGE DOORS roll back to reveal darkness within.
          
          A PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS fires up. Full beam right at us.
          
          A VEHICLE roars out of the darkness onto the street. Heavily
          modified with plate armor and turret-mounted weapons. But its
          original form still recognizable underneath.
          
          It's a HONDA ODYSSEY minivan. Once the #1 choice of soccer
          moms, transformed now into an armored personnel carrier.
          
          Another minivan roars from the garage behind it. A DODGE
          GRAND CARAVAN, similarly customized and armed to the teeth.
          
          THREE MORE CARS follow. As eclectic an assortment as you
          could imagine. A MINI COOPER. FORD EXPLORER. A PRIUS. Each
          adorned with plate armor and weapons.
          
          In the lead Minivan is REDRIDGE, heavily armed. He nods to
          the DRIVER, who guns the engine.
          
          The fleet of armored vehicles moves out, kicking up a great
          funnel of dust in their wake as they roar out of town.
          
          EXT. DESERT - DAY
          
          Late afternoon. The sun hangs low on the horizon. We're far
          from the road. Nothing but scrub brush and a few PRAIRIE DOG
          BURROWS dotted around.
          
          A PRAIRIE DOG pops its head up, scans the horizon. Sniffing
          the air, whiskers twitching... and is SKEWERED BY AN ARROW.
          
          Thirty yards away, one of the pieces of scrub brush appears
          to COME ALIVE. And then we realize it is Eli's GHILLIE SUIT,
          camouflaging both he and Solara beneath it.
          
          Eli casts off the camouflage net and walks toward the dead
          prairie dog. Solara just stands there, appalled.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You killed it! That cute little
                    thing!
          
          Eli picks up the dead animal by the scruff.
          
                                                                    77.
          
          
                              ELI
                    It's good eating, is what it is.
          
          He yanks out the bloody arrow. Solara looks away.
          
          When she turns back, Eli is standing right there, holding the
          dead animal in front of her face. She YELPS in surprise and
          staggers backward, falling on her butt.
          
                              SOLARA
                    That's not funny.
          
                              ELI
                    If you're going to be on the road,
                    you can't be picky about what you
                    eat. You eat what's there to eat.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I'm not eating that.
          
                              ELI
                        (SHRUGS)
                    More for me.
          
          EXT. WASTELAND CAVE - DUSK
          
          Eli and Solara sit in the mouth of a desert cave, around a
          flickering campfire. The prairie dog roasts on a spit.
          
          Eli digs his knife into the carcass, the blade comes out
          clean. It's done. He clasps his hands together and gazes down
          penitently at the ground.
          
                              ELI
                    Father, we thank you for your
                    generosity in providing us with
                    this meal. Bless this food to our
                    use and us to thy service, and keep
                    us ever mindful of the needs of
                    others. Amen.
          
          Eli carves off a piece of meat. Juicy and succulent. He bites
          into it, teasing Solara by making a show of how good it
          tastes. He feeds a piece to the rat perched on his shoulder.
          
          Solara tries to appear uninterested, but she's starved.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What does that taste like?
          
          He takes another bite, thinks on this as he chews.
          
                              ELI
                    Tastes like chicken.
          
                                                                 78.
          
          
          She tries to fight the temptation to try it... but she can't.
          She reaches out and tears off a piece. Sniffs at it, takes a
          small bite... then quickly wolfs down the rest. Eli smiles.
          
          As she eats, she gestures toward Eli's Saint Christopher.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What is that?
          
          Eli reaches up and touches his hand to it.
          
                              ELI
                    It's a Saint Christopher medal.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Who's Saint Christopher? Is he a
                    character from your book?
          
          Eli smiles and shakes his head.
          
                              ELI
                    Christopher was a man who lived a
                    long time ago. He wanted to be a
                    good man, he wanted to help people.
                    So he would stand by a river that
                    had no bridge and carry people
                    across. He was a big strong man and
                    there was no one he couldn't carry.
          
          Solara listens, rapt. Eli is a good storyteller.
          
                              ELI
                    Then one day a young child came to
                    the river and asked to be carried
                    across. Christopher tried to carry
                    him but he was too heavy. He was
                    just a small boy but he was heavier
                    than any man he had ever carried.
                    The boy explained that he was the
                    son of God, and that he was so
                    heavy because he bore all the sins
                    of the world. After that,
                    Christopher was able to carry him
                    across and when they got to the
                    other side the boy baptized him in
                    the river. And that's how he became
                    a saint. Later on, he was known as
                    the patron saint of travelers.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What is a saint, anyway?
          
                                                                 79.
          
          
                              ELI
                    It's someone who spent their life
                    doing good things for others.
                    Enough that God himself took a
                    special interest in them.
          
          Solara looks at Eli tenderly, with admiration.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Someone like you.
          
          Eli looks away, down at the ground. He appears sad.
          
                              ELI
                    No. Not like me. Saints ain't
                    killers. And I done too much of
                    that. Spilled too much blood.
          
          BEAT. No words, just the flickering firelight.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Will you read me some more from the
                    book?
          
                              ELI
                    It's late. You should get some
                    sleep. Maybe tomorrow.
          
          LATER - NIGHT
          
          The fire down to its last embers. Eli sleeps next to his
          pack, half-hidden in the looming shadows of the cave. His hat
          and goggles hung up for the night on the hilt of his sword.
          
          Solara sleeps nearby... then opens her eyes. Not asleep after
          all. She looks over at Eli - his face hidden in shadow and so
          impossible to tell if he's asleep or awake.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Eli?
          
          No response. Quietly, she moves forward, kneeling by his
          side. She opens his coat and checks the pockets. Empty.
          
          She goes deeper, peeling back the layers of clothing,
          stealthily frisking him. She finds something on his lapel,
          hidden under several layers, that causes her to stop.
          
          It's a RECTANGULAR PLASTIC BADGE. The red, white and blue
          colors faded and worn. It reads:
          
                               WELCOME TO WAL-MART
                                 MY NAME IS "ELI"
                               HOW MAY I HELP YOU?
          
                                                                  80.
          
          
          She stares at it for a moment, not knowing what to make of
          it. Then moves on, continuing to pat him down.
          
          Whatever she's looking for is not here. She turns her
          attention to the backpack. Slowly, carefully, opens it up.
          
          There it is. THE BIBLE, wrapped carefully in its neat little
          package of cloth and twine. She reaches in for it.
          
          Suddenly, ELI'S HAND SHOOTS OUT AND GRABS HER BY THE WRIST.
          She cries out, startled. Eli sits up, his face just a dark
          shape in the shadows. For the first time he appears a little
          scary to Solara.
          
                              ELI
                    What are you doing?
          
                              SOLARA
                    You scared me! I thought you were
                    asleep.
          
                              ELI
                    On the road you sleep with one eye
                    open. I asked you what you were
                    doing.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I just wanted to see the book.
          
                              ELI
                    You want to see the book, you ask
                    me. Nobody touches it but me. Ever.
                    Until it gets where it's going. Do
                    you understand?
          
          He's very forceful. She nods, a little afraid of him.
          
                              ELI
                    Tell me you understand!
          
          He grips her wrist tighter.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Okay! I understand! Ow!
          
          Eli releases her wrist. Takes the pack from her and closes it
          up. Pulls it closer to him and lies back down.
          
                              ELI
                    It's no use to you anyway. You
                    don't know how to read it.
          
                                                                 81.
          
          
                              SOLARA
                    Well... now we have the time, maybe
                    you can teach me.
          
                              ELI
                    Maybe. Get some sleep.
          
          She lies back down beside him, but doesn't close her eyes.
          She just lies there, watching him.
          
          EXT. WASTELAND - DAWN
          
          The sun rises out of the east. And out of the sun comes the
          FLEET OF ARMORED VEHICLES. Racing side-by-side down the road.
          
          The lead vehicle comes to a halt. A door opens and Redridge
          gets out. MORE ARMED MEN emerge from the other vehicles and
          follow him as he marches into the wasteland by the roadside.
          
          The DEAD BRIGANDS are splayed out in the dirt where Eli slew
          them. A FLOCK OF BUZZARDS is picking their bones clean.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He's been here.
          
          Redridge looks at the footprints in the dirt headed from the
          bodies and back onto the road. Two sets of tracks.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    The girl's with him.
          
          He moves back to the cars.
          
                                REDRIDGE
                    Move out!
          
          The other men hold for a moment, still looking at the half-
          eaten bodies in the dirt. Redridge turns back.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    I said move out!
          
                              CARNEGIE GUNMAN
                    I heard this guy's protected
                    somehow, some... power from up
                    above. That there ain't nothing on
                    this earth can touch him.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He's just a man. You put a bullet
                    in him, he'll go down like any
                    other. I don't want to hear no more
                    of this superstitious horseshit!
          
                                                                 82.
          
          
          Hesitantly, they make their way back to the vehicles. The
          cars gun their engines and move on down the road, past the
          abandoned Chevron station. Dust pluming in their wake.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara walk together, passing by a few burned-out
          buildings. It appears we might be headed toward a town.
          
          Solara looks up at the sweltering sun. Then around at her
          surroundings. Nothing but devastation and decay.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You say you've been walking for
                    twenty-five years. Have you ever
                    considered that you might be lost?
          
                                 ELI
                    No.
          
                              SOLARA
                    But how can you know? How can you
                    know this is the right way?
          
                              ELI
                    I told you. My path has been laid
                    out before me.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Yeah, but laid out by who?
          
                              ELI
                    By Almighty God.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Well if this God guy's so mighty,
                    how come it's taking you so long to
                    get where you're going? Doesn't he
                    know the way?
          
          Eli wheels around and jabs a scolding finger at her.
          
                              ELI
                    You want to stay on this road with
                    me, don't ever let me hear you take
                    his name in vain like that again.
          
          Solara is surprised by the severity of his reaction.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    Sorry.
          
          Eli resumes walking.
          
                                                                  83.
          
          
                              ELI
                    God has a reason for everything
                    being the way it is. It's not
                    always apparent to us. But it is
                    his plan nonetheless.
          
                              SOLARA
                    So, is he talking to you right now?
                    Telling you where to go?
          
                              ELI
                    It's not like that. It's kinda hard
                    to explain. I'm guided by faith.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I don't know what that word means.
          
          BEAT as Eli thinks on how to explain it.
          
                              ELI
                    It means you know something even
                    though you don't know it.
          
          Solara thinks about this, shakes her head.
          
                              SOLARA
                    That doesn't make any sense at all.
          
                              ELI
                    It doesn't have to.
          
          They walk on.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - DAY
          
          On the outskirts of a small town that lies in ruins. Almost
          every building burned or reduced to rubble.
          
          Except for one SMALL HOUSE. The building is damaged and worn
          but in mostly decent condition. It stands out among its
          surroundings for being the only structure still intact.
          
          The windows are BARRED. The outer structure fortified with
          SHEET METAL and other custom patch-ups. The whole plot
          surrounded by a CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH RAZOR WIRE.
          
          Eli and Solara crouch behind a pile of rubble nearby.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I don't get it. It looks almost...
                    normal. Like nothing ever happened.
                    How can it still be out here?
          
                                                                  84.
          
          
                              ELI
                    I don't know.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Maybe we should look inside. There
                    might be food.
          
          BEAT as Eli considers. Then stands and unhooks his shotgun.
          
                              ELI
                    Stay behind me.
          
          They approach the house cautiously. Arrive at the perimeter
          fence. There's a gate held in place by a PADLOCK.
          
          Eli pulls a pair of BOLT-CUTTERS from his belt and snips the
          padlock free. Swings open the gate with a metallic SQUEAK.
          
          They move inside, up the garden path. Though the soil in the
          yard is dead, it's been carefully raked and tended. WEEDS
          arranged in thoughtful patterns, like real flowers.
          
                              SOLARA
                    This is weird.
          
                              ELI
                    Yeah.
          
          Eli steps forward, his foot planting on a CRACKED PAVING
          STONE that shifts almost imperceptibly under his feet.
          Accompanied by a barely audible SOUND. He looks down.
          
                              ELI
                    Shit.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What?
          
          A ROPE NOOSE suddenly whips around their feet, tightening at
          their ankles and YANKING THEM UPSIDE-DOWN INTO THE AIR. Eli
          drops his shotgun to the ground.
          
          They hang there for a moment, twisting in the breeze.
          
          The front door to the house SWINGS OPEN to reveal...
          
          AN ELDERLY COUPLE. The woman's gray hair tied into a neat
          bun. The man bald, squinting through wire-frame glasses. They
          look like the couple from Grant Wood's "American Gothic."
          
          Instead of a pitchfork the man holds a 12-GAUGE RIOT SHOTGUN
          which he keeps trained from the hip on Eli and Solara.
          
                                                                 85.
          
          
          They step outside, regarding their new visitors carefully.
          The man seems more suspicious than his wife. He drags Eli's
          shotgun toward him with his foot, hands it to his wife.
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    Who are you?
          
                              ELI
                    My name is Eli. This is Solara.
                    We're travelers, that's all. We
                    don't mean you any harm.
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    You cut my padlock. I saw you.
                    Trying to break into our house.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry. We didn't think anybody
                    lived here. We thought it was
                    abandoned, like all the rest.
          
          This seems to annoy the man.
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    Take a look around you. Look at
                    this yard. Does it look abandoned
                    to you?
          
          Clearly he's proud of the work he's done with the pitiful
          means at his disposal.
          
                              ELI
                    No, sir. I... like what you've done
                    with the place.
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    What's your business here?
          
                              ELI
                    No business. We're sorry to have
                    troubled you. If you'll let us down
                    we'll happily be on our way.
          
          The wife steps forward, she's much warmer, less guarded.
          
                              ELDERLY WOMAN
                    George, look at them! They're not
                    robbers or road agents! One of
                    them's just a girl!
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    Seen that before. Oldest trick in
                    the book.
          
                                                                   86.
          
          
                              ELDERLY WOMAN
                    Oh, stop! It's no trick. Let them
                    down!
          
          The woman glares at him. The husband reluctantly accedes and
          moves to the concealed trap apparatus. Releases the rope,
          dropping Eli and Solara to the ground in a heap.
          
          The old woman helps them to their feet. They shake off the
          noose from their ankles.
          
                                ELDERLY WOMAN
                    I'm so sorry about my husband. We
                    so rarely get visitors these days,
                    he's suspicious of everybody.
                         (BEAT)
                    I'm Martha and this is my husband
                    George. Would you care for some
                    tea?
          
          Eli and Solara exchange a look. What the hell is this?
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
          
          It's like something out of the world before. The interior is
          almost perfectly preserved. Chintzy couches. A mahogany
          table. A TV set in the corner. Lace curtains. Unreal.
          
          Eli and Solara sit on the couch, feeling self-conscious and
          looking entirely out of place in this cozy environment.
          
          George sits across from them on the couch, scowling at them
          inhospitably. The shotgun resting across his lap.
          
          Martha emerges from the kitchen, carrying a tray laden with a
          tea pot and old china cups. Cracked and faded, but intact.
          She places the tray on the coffee table and sits.
          
                              MARTHA
                    I'm afraid we don't have any cake
                    or biscuits for the tea. They ran
                    out some time ago.
          
          She lifts the tea port and pours into the cups. But it's not
          tea, only water. Somewhat murky water. Eli and Solara stare
          at the cups, unsure. Martha gestures toward them.
          
                              MARTHA
                    Please.
          
          They raise their cups and take a sip. Martha watches eagerly.
          It's clearly a thrill for her to be doing something as
          civilized and elegant as serving "tea" to guests.
          
                                                                 87.
          
          
                              MARTHA
                    How do you like it?
          
                              ELI
                    It's.. uh...
          
                              SOLARA
                    It's very good.
          
          Martha smiles, delighted. She lifts her own cup to her lips.
          HER HANDS TREMBLE, the cup rattling against the saucer.
          
                              ELI
                    Have you always lived here?
          
                              MARTHA
                    For almost forty years now. This
                    home is our pride and joy, isn't
                    it, George?
          
          George just grunts. Not interested in conversation.
          
                              MARTHA
                    We refused to leave, even during
                    the troubles. We said, didn't we
                    George, we said if we're going to
                    die anywhere, we're going to die
                    right here, in our own home.
          
                              ELI
                    I don't understand how you've
                    survived out here this long.
          
                              MARTHA
                    Well, George is something of a
                    handyman, aren't you, dear? He did
                    a lot of work on the place, making
                    it safe. We may be old, but we're
                    resilient. We've had more than a
                    few who've tried to take this place
                    from us. Haven't we, George?
          
                              GEORGE
                    Yes. Yes we have.
          
          He stands and moves toward the back door. Opens it up and
          beckons Eli and Solara to come look.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli and Solara stand in the doorway, looking out on the yard.
          Solara is horrified by what she sees.
          
                                                                 88.
          
          
          The entire back yard is a GRAVEYARD. Maybe twenty human
          graves dug shallow into the earth. Some were dug long ago,
          others look like they're very recent.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Are these... graves?
          
                              MARTHA
                    Of course. It would be uncivilized
                    not to bury them. We're not
                    barbarians.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Plus, it's good for the soil.
          
                              MARTHA
                    Come on back inside. I think I
                    might be able to rustle up some
                    sandwiches.
          
          George and Martha go back inside, leaving Eli and Solara
          gazing at the little graveyard.
          
                              ELI
                    We have to get out of here.
          
                              SOLARA
                    They look so sweet... I would never
                    have believed they were killers.
          
                              ELI
                    They're worse than that.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    What?
          
                               ELI
                    They didn't just kill these people.
                        (BEAT)
                    They ate them.
          
          Solara is stunned.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    They what?
                              ELI
                    There's a disease in the outland.
                    Spread by eating human meat. It
                    affects the brain. Dementia, loss
                    of motor function. Did you notice
                    the old woman's hands shaking?
                    She's got it. They've both got it.
          
                                                                 89.
          
          
                              SOLARA
                    Oh my God...
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli and Solara re-enter. Solara looks at George nervously.
          He's still carrying that shotgun.
          
          Martha's voice drifts in from the nearby KITCHEN.
          
                              MARTHA (O.S.)
                    I found some meat for those
                    sandwiches! Are you hungry?
          
                              SOLARA
                    No! Thank you!
          
                              ELI
                    We really must be going.
          
                               GEORGE
                    So soon?
          
          An unnerving glint in his eye. Eli moves toward the door.
          
                              ELI
                    Yes, I'm afraid so.
          
          As he gets to the door, George moves to intercept. Hard to
          tell if he's blocking his path or moving to open the door for
          him. A tense BEAT.
          
          Martha emerges from the kitchen.
          
                              MARTHA
                    Are you sure you won't stay?
          
                              ELI
                    Yes. Thank you again for the tea.
          
          Eli stares George down. Reluctantly, George steps aside. Eli
          opens the door and escorts Solara outside.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli and Solara emerge into the sunlight. Walk down the garden
          path. And FREEZE IN THEIR TRACKS.
          
          THE ARMED VEHICLES ARE COMING. Driving toward them out of the
          horizon in a hazy cloud of dust.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Oh no... it's my dad. It's his men.
          
                                                                 90.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Are you sure?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I recognize the cars.
          
                              ELI
                    Back inside.
          
          Eli bundles Solara back into the house. George stands in the
          doorway, squinting at the approaching convoy.
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          George follows them back in, furious.
          
                              GEORGE
                    What did you bring upon us?
          
                              MARTHA
                    George? What's wrong?
          
                              GEORGE
                    A whole convoy of armed
                    degenerates, that's what's wrong!
                    Coming here for them! And they led
                    them right to us!
          
          Martha rushes to the window, pulls aside the lace curtain.
          Outside she sees the armored vehicles SCREECHING TO A HALT.
          
          The men spill out from the vehicles and take cover behind
          them, locking and loading weapons.
          
                              MARTHA
                    Oh no they don't...
          
          She rushes across the room, teeth gritted with determination.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Martha, what are you doing?
          
                              MARTHA
                    I finally got this house just the
                    way I want it. I'm not going to let
                    anybody tear it apart!
          
          She goes to the couch and yanks off the seat cushions.
          Underneath is a WOODEN LID which she throws open to reveal:
          
          A HUGE CACHE OF WEAPONS. Automatic rifles. Shotguns. Pistols.
          Grenades. And enough ammunition for everything.
          
                                                                 91.
          
          
          She pulls out an M-60 MACHINE-GUN, slings the strap over her
          shoulder and locks in a CHAIN OF BULLETS. She looks like a
          post-apocalyptic Martha Stewart.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Where did you get all this stuff?
          
          George pulls out an AK-47, slots in a magazine.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Took `em off them who came looking
                    to take the place from us. Built up
                    quite the stash over the years.
          
          He offers a .44 MAGNUM to Solara.
          
                              GEORGE
                    You know how to fire a gun?
          
                              SOLARA
                    My daddy showed me once.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Just like riding a bike.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I never rode a bike.
          
          George sighs, turns instead to Eli.
          
                              GEORGE
                    How about you, you know how to-
          
          Eli is already reloading his shotgun, checking the barrel.
          Readying the weapon in the practiced manner of an expert.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Never mind.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Redridge steps forward, raises a BULLHORN.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    We know you're in there! Come on
                    out with your hands up and your
                    weapons on the deck and nobody
                    needs to get hurt.
          
          SILENCE. No sign of activity inside the house.
          
          Redridge turns back to his men. Their hands trembling. They
          didn't sign up for this, and they're not ready for it.
          
                                                                    92.
          
          
          Redridge turns back to the house. Into the bullhorn:
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    All right, look. I'm gonna make it
                    easy on y'all. Bring out the girl
                    with the book.
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli is crouched beneath the window. George and Martha have
          taken up positions at other windows, peering out.
          
                              REDRIDGE (O.S.)
                    That's all we want. The girl and
                    the book. The rest of you's can go
                    your way.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What are we going to do?
          
          BEAT as Eli thinks.
          
                              ELI
                    Hand me my pack.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - DAY
          
          Redridge waits. Still no sign of a response. His nervous
          gunmen exchange worried looks.
          
                              CARNEGIE GUNMAN #2
                    They ain't comin' out. They-
          
          Redridge raises his hand to silence him. Looks up as an
          UPSTAIRS WINDOW slides open.
          
          A CLOTH PACKAGE is tossed from the window. It lands in the
          dirt outside the perimeter fence a few yards from Redridge.
          
          Cautiously, he approaches. The package is wrapped in cloth
          and tied up with twine. It looks like Eli's bible.
          
          He picks it up and tugs at the twine, untying it. Folds away
          the cloth wrapping. Looks for a moment in puzzlement at the
          object, at the words written on the front of it.
          
                                THIS SIDE TO FACE ENEMY
          
          It's a MINIATURE CLAYMORE MINE. The small red light on top of
          the unit ILLUMINATES WITH A BEEP. Armed.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Holy shi...
          
                                                                    93.
          
          
          He drops the package in the dirt and races for his life back
          toward the vehicles.
          
                                REDRIDGE
                      Get down! Everybody get down!
          
          He dives across the trunk of the Explorer into cover as THE
          MINE EXPLODES, SHATTERING EVERY WINDOW OF EVERY VEHICLE. The
          lightweight Mini Cooper takes the main brunt and EXPLODES,
          cartwheeling through the air, a burning wreck.
          
          Redridge looks around. Three men lie dead already. Flaming
          wreckage all around him. Suddenly, it's a war zone.
          
          MACHINE-GUN FIRE ERUPTS FROM THE HOUSE, peppering the
          vehicles' armor. The gunmen cower behind cover.
          
                                REDRIDGE
                      Damn you, return fire!
          
          Redridge aims at the house and OPENS FIRE. Inspired by his
          example, the others follow. A HAIL OF BULLETS CRISS-CROSS
          BACK AND FORTH. The house's faded paint facade is shredded.
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Martha continues firing wildly with the M-60. Screaming at
          the top of her lungs, loving every minute of it.
          
                                MARTHA
                      Come and get it, you god-damn sons
                      of mother-fucking bitches!
          
          George and Eli also open fire from their windows,
          periodically ducking to take cover from incoming fire.
          
          Solara sits across the room, in the corner, sobbing.
          
                                ELI
                      It's all right. We're going to be
                      all right. Trust me.
          
          MORE GUNFIRE splinters the window frame above his head.
          
                                ELI
                      You remember what I told you about
                      faith?
          
          She nods.
          
          Eli peeks out and FIRES OUT THE WINDOW, dropping one of the
          enemy gunmen with a crack shot. Ducks back down as the return
          fire impacts around him.
          
                                                                 94.
          
          
                              ELI
                    We're going to get out of this
                    alive. Both of us. I know.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Because God told you?
          
                              ELI
                    Because God told me.
          
          Amidst all the chaos and gunfire, George has been listening
          to this exchange.
          
                              GEORGE
                    What about us?
          
          BEAT.
          
                              ELI
                    He didn't mention you.
          
          BEAT. George chambers a round and RESUMES FIRING.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Redridge's men continue the hail of gunfire. Six of them dead
          now, six more still standing. No lessening of fire from
          inside the house. They're losing.
          
          Redridge races between the vehicles, ducking from gunfire
          until he makes it to the back of the Dodge Caravan. Pops the
          trunk and pulls out a ROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADE LAUNCHER.
          
          He sets it on his shoulder, rests on the trunk to steady his
          aim. And FIRES. The rocket screams toward its target, tearing
          through the chain fence and TEARING AN ENTIRE CORNER FROM THE
          HOUSE in a fiery explosion.
          
          INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Filled with smoke. The sounds of COUGHING.
          
          Dazed, George pushes his way through the smoke, waving his
          arms to clear it. A BLOODY GASH on his forehead.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Martha? Martha!
          
          He finds her lying on the tile floor in what remains of the
          kitchen. Or at least her top half. The rest of her is gone.
          
          George slumps to his knees with tear-filled eyes. Takes his
          wife tenderly by the hand for a moment.
          
                                                                    95.
          
          
          Then the anger returns. He gets up and turns, consumed now by
          a wild fury. Firing with rage over the torn brick wall. He
          CLIPS ANOTHER GUNMAN IN THE HEAD, killing him.
          
          George moves back toward the LIVING ROOM, firing as he goes.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Redridge moves between the cars again, staying behind cover.
          George's hail of gunfire has them pinned down.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    We got any more of those RPGs?
          
                              CARNEGIE GUNMAN #3
                    That was it.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Screw this.
          
          Redridge jumps into the driver's seat of the minivan, turns
          the key in the ignition. Jams the accelerator down with the
          butt of his rifle, then shifts the transmission into DRIVE.
          
                                 REDRIDGE
                    Get clear!
          
          The gunmen leap clear as the minivan HURTLES TOWARD THE
          HOUSE, engine roaring. CRASHES THROUGH THE CHAIN FENCE.
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli looks up from cover and see the van coming RIGHT AT HIM.
          He dives clear as the van CRASHES THROUGH THE WALL INTO THE
          LIVING ROOM. It SMASHES INTO THE FAR WALL, finally coming to
          a stop.
          
          More dust and debris, more coughing. Eli tries to get up, but
          winces in pain. Puts his hand to his side, it comes back WET
          WITH BLOOD. A bad wound. He covers it with his coat, stands
          and moves through the smoke.
          
                                 ELI
                    Solara?
          
                                 SOLARA (O.S.)
                    Eli!
          
          He finds her in the smoke. She embraces him.
          
                              ELI
                    Are you all right?
          
                                                                 96.
          
          
                                SOLARA
                    I'm fine.
          
          As the smoke clears, Solara sees George PINNED AGAINST THE
          WALL BY THE MINIVAN. His body crushed. Dead.
          
                                SOLARA
                    Oh God...
          
                              ELI
                    Come on. We're going out the back.
                    We're running.
          
          As he helps her to her feet, we hear the sound of MOVEMENT
          THROUGH THE RUBBLE.
          
          They turn around. The gunmen are ENTERING THE HOUSE, passing
          through the smoking hole left by the minivan.
          
          Eli reaches for his sword. Met by the sound of MULTIPLE GUNS
          COCKING. Redridge steps out from among the gunmen. Smiles.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Go ahead and try it, holy man. You
                    ain't that fast.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara are shoved out of the house at gunpoint and
          marched past the torn perimeter fence to the vehicles.
          
          Eli has been stripped of his weapons and backpack. Redridge
          faces him and points a pistol at his head.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Where's the book?
          
          BEAT. Eli doesn't answer. Redridge cocks the pistol.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    I ain't playing.
          
          Redridge stares him down. Eli just stares right back. Totally
          unflappable. Redridge motions to his men.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Check the pack.
          
          The gunman carrying Eli's pack opens it up and tips its
          contents out onto the ground. The ghillie suit, battery, some
          old canned goods, other odds and ends. No sign of the book.
          
                              CARNEGIE GUNMAN #4
                    It ain't here.
          
                                                                 97.
          
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    It's gotta be.
          
          Redridge holsters his gun and frisks Eli, going through his
          pockets. Finds nothing. He opens Eli's coat and checks the
          inside pockets. Digs around deep inside.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Hello, what have we here?
          
          And then suddenly he SHRIEKS IN PAIN. Yanks his hand out to
          reveal ELI'S RAT, TEETH SUNK DEEP INTO HIS FLESH.
          
          Redridge flails around violently, trying to get the rat off
          him, but it won't let go. His hand is bleeding badly.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Fuck! Get it off! Get it off me!
          
          He finally manages to shake it free. It hits the floor dazed.
          Redridge STOMPS ON IT with his boot, reducing it to a bloody
          smear in the dirt. Eli lowers his head in sadness.
          
          Redridge clutches his bloody hand, glares at Eli furiously.
          Pulls his gun again and marches right up to him, pressing the
          muzzle tight against his forehead.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    If you don't got the book, what
                    fucking use are you?
          
          His finger tightens on the trigger.
          
                                SOLARA
                    Wait!
          
          She breaks from the gunmen holding her and rushes toward
          Redridge. Reaches inside her dress and PRODUCES THE BIBLE.
          
                              SOLARA
                    It's here! I've got it! Please
                    don't kill him.
          
                                ELI
                    Solara...
          
                              SOLARA
                    It's just a book, Eli. No book is
                    worth giving up your life for.
          
                              ELI
                    You're wrong.
          
                                                                   98.
          
          
          Satisfied, Redridge takes the book. Runs his hand over the
          leather cover, gazes admiringly at the gold-embossed cross.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    You did good, sweetheart. Your
                    daddy would be proud. He knew you'd
                    come through for him.
          
          Solara looks at Eli guiltily. She feels terrible.
          
                              SOLARA
                    He said he would hurt my mom. If I
                    didn't help him.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                        (SMILING)
                    Daddy's little girl...
          
          Solara stands between him and Eli. Deadly serious now.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I want you to let him go.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    What?
          
                              SOLARA
                    You've got what you came for. You
                    don't need him. Let him go.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He's killed a dozen of my men.
          
                              SOLARA
                    If you hurt him, I'm not coming
                    back with you. You'll have to drag
                    me kicking and screaming.
          
          Solara glares at Redridge. He sighs. He can tell she means
          it. It's not worth the aggravation. He turns back to Eli.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Take your shit and get out of here.
          
          Eli gathers up his stuff into his pack. Shoulders it and goes
          to pick up his sword, but Redridge puts his boot on it.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    No weapons.
          
          Eli still has a half-dozen guns trained on him. He turns and
          walks away, toward the road. As he passes Solara:
          
                                                                   99.
          
          
                              ELI
                    I told you we'd both live. Now do
                    you have faith?
          
          A tear runs down Solara's cheek as she watches him walk away.
          
          Redridge grabs her by the arm and pulls her toward the
          vehicles as his men load up and prepare to move out.
          
          IN THE REARMOST VEHICLE
          
          Solara sits in the back seat, staring out the rear window as
          it drives down the road at the tail end of the convoy.
          
          She watches as Eli moves away down the road, getting smaller
          and smaller until he is just a speck on the horizon.
          
          She bursts into floods of uncontrollable tears.
          
          LATER
          
          Solara in the back seat, calmer now. The tears dried on her
          cheeks. She sits staring blankly at the DRIVER in front.
          
          And then she LUNGES VIOLENTLY FORWARD. Clawing and biting at
          the driver, who struggles to fight her off. His hands come
          off the wheel and the car FISHTAILS WILDLY.
          
          REDRIDGE'S VEHICLE
          
          The DRIVER sees something odd in the rear-view mirror.
          
                              DRIVER
                    What the hell...?
          
          Redridge turns to see the car behind VEERING ERRATICALLY then
          SLAMMING ON THE BRAKES, stopping in the middle of the road.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Stop, stop!
          
          The car screeches to a halt. Redridge watches through the
          rear window as the driver's side door opens and the driver is
          KICKED OUT ONTO THE ASPHALT.
          
          The door closes again, the engine revs and the car TURNS
          AROUND, racing back down the road in the direction it came.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Shit. Turn around!
          
                              DRIVER
                    We ain't got the gas for it!
          
                                                                   100.
          
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    She's getting away!
          
                              DRIVER
                    We got the book! And we got barely
                    enough gas to make it back as it
                    is! We can't go chasin' her!
          
          BEAT. Redridge knows he's right.
          
                               REDRIDGE
                    Stupid little bitch...
                        (BEAT)
                    Drive on.
          
          The car moves on, following the rest of the convoy.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - DAY
          
          Solara screeches the car to a halt outside the smoking
          wreckage of the besieged house. She runs from the vehicle to
          where ELI'S SWORD lies in the dirt and grabs it up.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DUSK
          
          Solara races down the road in the car, pedal to the metal.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Come on, come on...
          
          Eventually, she sees him. At first just a dot on the horizon.
          But unmistakably Eli. By now, she'd know him anywhere.
          
          Suddenly the engine SPLUTTERS. She checks the fuel gauge; the
          needle deep in the red. She pounds the wheel in frustration.
          
                                SOLARA
                    No... No!
          
          The car grinds to a halt, dead. She flings open the door and
          leaps out of the vehicle, rushing after Eli on foot.
          
          ON ELI. As always, his pace steady and slow. The sun directly
          ahead of him as it sets on the horizon. Headed always west.
          
          Solara is running up behind him, a hundred yards back.
          
                                SOLARA
                    Eli! Eli!
          
          He doesn't stop or look back. Just keeps on walking.
          
          She finally catches up with him, breathing hard, exhausted.
          
                                                                  101.
          
          
                                 SOLARA
                    Eli...
          
                              ELI
                    Thought you'd gone back to town.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I can't go back there. Eli, I'm so
                    sorry.
          
                                 ELI
                    For what?
          
                              SOLARA
                    For what? I betrayed you! I gave
                    them the book!
          
                              ELI
                    You did what you believed you had
                    to.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You're not mad at me?
          
          BEAT.
          
                              ELI
                    I forgive you.
          
          She continues walking alongside him. Trying to process this.
          This kind of compassion is totally foreign to her.
          
          She holds out the sword, offering it to Eli by way of
          atonement.
          
                               SOLARA
                    Here. I thought you might still
                    need this.
          
          Eli seems appreciative that she would think to return it to
          him. He takes it and slings it over his shoulder.
          
                                 ELI
                    Thank you.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What are you going to do now?
          
                              ELI
                    Same as always. Keep heading west.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Why? I mean, you don't have the
                    book any more.
          
                                                                  102.
          
          
                              ELI
                    But I still have my faith.
          
          They walk on together, into the sunset.
          
          EXT. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA - MONTAGE - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara follow the road through burned-out towns and
          retail neighborhoods. Gutted and dead, like every place else.
          
          But something is different here. Things are greener. Tufts of
          grass here and there. They attract Solara's attention.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What's that?
          
          Eli reaches down and runs his hand through the grass.
          
                              ELI
                    It's grass. It used to grow all
                    over the place.
          
                              SOLARA
                    How come it's here?
          
                              ELI
                    I don't know. Less poison in the
                    air this near to the ocean, maybe.
          
          They keep walking. Eli groans, clutches his side. Does his
          best to hide his pain from Solara. She notices anyway.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What's wrong?
          
                              ELI
                    Nothing. Just a cramp.
          
          EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT
          
          They walk on through the night. Eli stops and sniffs the air.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    What?
          
                              ELI
                    Do you smell that?
          
                              SOLARA
                    Smell what?
          
                              ELI
                    Salt in the air. We're close to the
                    ocean. We're almost there.
          
                                                                103.
          
          
          EXT. CALIFORNIA ROAD - DAWN
          
          They keep on along the road. A shallow uphill incline. They
          follow it uphill, finally reaching its crest, where they stop
          and take in the view before them.
          
          THE PACIFIC OCEAN. Straddled by the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - the
          once-great structure has partially collapsed from decades of
          neglect and disrepair. The span sags and hangs low over the
          ocean, the asphalt cracked and ruptured.
          
          On the other side of the bay, SAN FRANCISCO - or the little
          that remains of it. The city has been almost TOTALLY
          DESTROYED - entire areas reduced to rubble, the few buildings
          still standing looking on the verge of collapse.
          
          Solara looks at it all in horrified awe. Eli, unperturbed,
          keeps on moving, still clutching his side.
          
                               ELI
                    Come on.
          
          EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara make their way south across the bridge, side-
          stepping the fractures in the road.
          
          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO RUINS - DAY
          
          Eli leads Solara through the rubble of what used to be San
          Francisco. It's like walking through the wreckage of 9/11's
          Ground Zero, but a hundred times the scale. Horrifying.
          
          They pass by the wreckage of a HOTEL, nothing but the lobby
          still standing. A HILTON sign protruding from the rubble.
          
          Eli uses his sheathed sword as a walking stick, poking around
          ahead of him for loose rubble underfoot. He steps carefully.
          
                              ELI
                    Watch your footing. Step where I
                    step.
          
          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAY
          
          More buildings are still standing here, but they're nothing
          more than great dead monoliths. Solara looks up at the
          blasted skyscrapers - she's never seen anything like it.
          
          The buildings loom over her like giant tombstones. It scares
          her - like walking through the graveyard of a dead world.
          
                              SOLARA
                    This... this is the world before?
          
                                                                104.
          
          
                              ELI
                    What's left of it.
          
          They keep walking, passing the TOPPLED TRANSAMERICA PYRAMID.
          
          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - FISHERMAN'S WHARF - DAY
          
          Once a bustling oceanside tourist spot, now a ghost town.
          
          Eli and Solara walk along the litter-strewn street, passing
          the old RIPLEY'S BELIEVE-IT-OR-NOT and WAX MUSEUMS. The
          celebrity mannequins are still in fair condition, but slumped
          at their feet are CHARRED HUMAN SKELETONS.
          
          Eli is struggling now. He looks pale from the blood loss. His
          breathing labored. Solara takes him by the arm to help him.
          
          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - PIER 39 - DAY
          
          A dead, ruined place, like everywhere else. We hear the sound
          of SEAGULLS nearby - the only sign of life at all.
          
          Eli and Solara walk along the pier, until they reach its end.
          The original end has long since collapsed into the sea, but a
          RICKETY HAND-MADE ROPE BRIDGE has been affixed to the pier's
          sheared-off edge.
          
          Eli and Solara stand at the pier's end, looking out to sea.
          
                              ELI
                    Do you see that?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I see it. Is that it?
          
                                 ELI
                    That's it.
          
          Reveal now that the rope-bridge leads out across the bay to:
          
          ALCATRAZ ISLAND
          
          Looking much the same as it always has, old and dilapidated.
          The coastal fog shrouding it gives it an ethereal look. It
          feels almost like a mythic place - the "promised land" Eli
          has sought for so many years.
          
          A tattered STARS AND STRIPES still flutters in the breeze
          atop the prison lighthouse.
          
                                                                  105.
          
          
          EXT. BAY ROPE BRIDGE - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara make their way carefully across the bridge. It
          feels highly unstable and sags low over the bay, the waters
          below close enough to lap around their ankles.
          
          EXT. ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara arrive at the prison gates. Securely locked.
          As they inspect it for a possible way to enter:
          
                              VOICE (O.S.)
                    Who goes there?
          
          They look up. A GUARD in paramilitary fatigues is stationed
          in one of the perimeter towers. Training a rifle on them.
          
                              ALCATRAZ GUARD
                    Identify yourselves!
          
          In the opposite tower ANOTHER GUARD has his rifle trained on
          them too. Eli looks up, raises his hands.
          
                              ELI
                    My name is Elijah Stone. I have a
                    message for your boss. I need you
                    to tell him that I have a King
                    James Bible in my possession.
          
          BEAT.
          
                              ALCATRAZ GUARD
                    Remain where you are! Do not
                    attempt to move or you will be
                    fired upon!
          
          Keeping the gun trained on them, the tower guard uses his
          free hand to talk into a WALKIE-TALKIE RADIO. We don't hear
          the conversation. All Eli and Solara can do is wait.
          
          The guard puts away his radio and shouts back down:
          
                              ALCATRAZ GUARD
                    Be prepared to surrender any
                    weapons at the gate!
          
          BEAT. And then the massive front gates SLOWLY OPEN ON
          MECHANICAL RUNNERS with the low groan of rusted iron.
          
          Eli and Solara look at each other, then step gingerly inside.
          
                                                                106.
          
          
          INT. ALCATRAZ - MAIN GATES - CONTINUOUS
          
          As soon as they step inside they are SURROUNDED BY DOZENS OF
          HEAVILY-ARMED SOLDIERS. Not U.S. military, more like a semi-
          official militia. But every bit as deadly.
          
          Eli and Solara raise their hands. A pair of SOLDIERS take
          Eli's pack and sword, pat them both down for other weapons.
          
                              SOLDIER
                    They're clean.
          
          The soldiers before them part - to reveal a THIN, BALDING MAN
          wearing spectacles. He wears Kevlar body armor over his tweed
          jacket and tie. Professorial, academic.
          
          He approaches, shakes Eli's hand vigorously - very excited.
          
                              THIN MAN
                    Welcome, both of you. I'm Professor
                    Lombardi. I'm the curator here.
          
                              ELI
                    Elijah Stone.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    Solara.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Solara. What a delightful name. Is
                    that by any chance Shakespearean?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I, uh, I think it's Japanese.
          
                                 LOMBARDI
                    Wonderful.
          
          He turns back to Eli.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Is it true what they tell me? You
                    have a King James Version?
          
                              ELI
                    Been carrying it with me for twenty-
                    five years.
          
          Solara looks at Eli, puzzled. Lombardi finds it hard to
          contain his excitement.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    My goodness. I can't tell you how
                    exciting this is. Well, come, come!
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                107.
          
                              LOMBARDI (cont'd)
                    I'll give you the nickel tour and
                    then we can all sit down and take a
                    look at it.
          
          He leads them across the courtyard into the prison buildings.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY
          
          Redridge's remaining vehicles drive back into town and come
          to a halt outside the theater. Redridge emerges from his car,
          carrying the bible. Walks up to the Palladium and enters.
          
          INT. ALCATRAZ - CELL BLOCK - DAY
          
          What was once a cell block is now an IMMENSE LIBRARY. Stacked
          floor to ceiling with books. Lombardi shows Eli and Solara
          around. Behind them, a pair of ARMED GUARDS follow closely.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Yes, we've been doing this for some
                    time now. Collected over thirty
                    thousand volumes from generous
                    donors all across the nation. We
                    even have a printing press that we
                    hope to have operational soon.
          
          Solara is stunned as she surveys the endless stacks of books.
          She's never seen anything like it.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You turned the whole prison into a
                    library?
          
                               LOMBARDI
                    Well, not exactly. We're more like
                    a storage facility. We're holding
                    these books here in trust, if you
                    like. When society gets back on its
                    feet and no longer needs us to
                    preserve these volumes, they'll be
                    here waiting.
                        (BEAT)
                    I must ask you, how did you hear
                    about us? We've been doing
                    everything we can to get the word
                    out, but we always like to know
                    where our benefactors come from.
          
                              ELI
                    I was sent here by God.
          
          Lombardi raises a quizzical eyebrow.
          
                                                                 108.
          
          
                               LOMBARDI
                    Is that right? Well, it's good to
                    know we're getting such high-
                    profile referrals these days.
                        (BEAT)
                    I must say, I am so excited that we
                    finally have a King James. You
                    know, we have a Talmud here, we
                    have two Korans, we even have that
                    Scientology book. But never a
                    Christian bible, until now. I
                    honestly believed it was the one
                    book I'd never see again, after
                    what happened...
          
          BEAT. Lombardi appears sad for a moment.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    May I ask what condition it's in?
          
                              ELI
                    It's a little beat-up. But it'll do
                    the job.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Well, then. What say we take a look
                    at it?
          
          Lombardi looks at Eli with anticipation. So does Solara,
          interested to know where this is going to go next.
          
          Eli winces in pain, puts his hand to his side.
          
                              ELI
                    Is there someplace we could sit?
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Of course. Right this way.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          Redridge appears. Carnegie looks at him eagerly.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Did you get it?
          
          Redridge holds the bible up proudly. Carnegie beams.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    Show me.
          
          Redridge hands it over. Carnegie sits back in his chair,
          running his hand lovingly over the battered leather cover.
          
                                                                   109.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    The new world begins here...
          
          He opens the book and looks inside.
          
          BEAT. And then he looks up at Redridge, confused.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What the fuck is this?
          
          INT. ALCATRAZ - CAFETERIA - DAY
          
          Eli, Solara and Lombardi sit at one of the long lunch-room
          tables. The two armed guards keep watch nearby.
          
                              ELI
                    Do you have something you can write
                    with?
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Mmm? Oh, yes of course!
          
          He pulls a pen from his pocket, motions to one of the guards.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Could you please bring us some
                    writing paper?
          
          The guard nods and moves toward the door. As he does so:
          
                              ELI
                    Bring a lot of it.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          Carnegie looks at the open bible, jaw hanging loose, his
          complexion ashen. Like he's just been slapped in the face.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    What? What is it?
          
          INT. ALCATRAZ - CAFETERIA - DAY
          
          The guard brings a THICK SHEAF OF WRITING PAPER to the
          cafeteria table, sets it down by Lombardi.
          
                              ELI
                    Are you ready?
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    What exactly am I writing?
          
                                                                 110.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Pay close attention and write down
                    every word exactly as I say it.
          
          Eli removes his goggles. Solara can't believe what she sees.
          
          His eyes are pale, milky-white, dead. TOTALLY BLIND.
          
                              ELI
                    The First Book of Moses called
                    Genesis. Chapter one, verse one. In
                    the beginning God created the
                    heavens and the earth. Verse two.
                    The earth was without form, and
                    void; and darkness was on the face
                    of the deep. And the spirit of God
                    was hovering over the face of the
                    waters. Verse three. And God said,
                    "Let there be light," and there was
                    light.
          
          Lombardi hurriedly writes down every word.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          Carnegie sits at his desk, still in shock. Eli's bible sits
          open on the desk before him.
          
          A BRAILLE BIBLE.
          
          Claudia is ushered in by a guard.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    What's wrong?
          
          He rushes forward and thrusts the bible into her hands.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You told me once that you know how
                    to read this. This blind language.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Well, a long time ago, when I was a
                    little girl...
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You're going to read it for me.
                    Every word. And I'm going to write
                    it down. Start at the beginning.
          
          As Carnegie hunts on his desk for a paper and pen, Claudia
          opens the book and trails her fingertips across the raised
          lettering.
          
                                                                111.
          
          
          For a moment there is a glimmer of recognition... a faint
          smile... but then it fades as Carnegie turns back to her,
          eagerly clutching the writing materials.
          
                               CLAUDIA
                    I'm sorry. It's been so long. I
                    don't remember. I don't remember
                    any of it.
          
          Carnegie is aghast. BEAT as the anger swells within him,
          threatening to explode...
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    God fucking dammit!
          
          He swipes violently at the bible, knocking it out of
          Claudia's hands. He grabs it up and tries to rip it in two,
          but it's too thick to tear. Red-faced with rage, he tosses it
          out over the box balcony. It lands somewhere in the dark
          auditorium below, between the rows of gutted theater seats.
          
          As he paces angrily back past Claudia:
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Bill, is there something-
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Just go. Just get out of my sight.
          
          He slumps in his chair, exhausted and furious. Claudia sadly
          turns and leaves him alone with his thoughts.
          
          INT. ALCATRAZ - CAFETERIA - NIGHT
          
          Some considerable time later. Great stacks of paper have been
          filled with Lombardi's handwriting.
          
          Lombardi's pen races across the paper, struggling to keep up
          with Eli's recitation.
          
          Solara is curled up on a nearby bench, asleep. Eli's coat
          covering her to keep her warm.
          
          Eli clutches his wound painfully as he continues to recite.
          He looks paler now than ever. Close to death.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Dear Lord, thank you for giving me
                    the strength and the conviction to
                    complete the task you entrusted to
                    me. Thank you for guiding me
                    straight and true, through the many
                    obstacles in my path.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                112.
          
                              ELI (V.O.) (cont'd)
                    And for keeping me resolute when
                    all around seemed lost.
          
          EXT. ALCATRAZ - EXERCISE YARD - PRE-DAWN
          
          The prison yard shrouded in the dim light just before dawn.
          
          Solara crosses the yard. She looks more mature somehow.
          Determined and strong. She carries with her ELI'S SWORD - and
          something else, tucked under her arm.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Thank you for your protection and
                    for your many signs along the way.
          
          She stops in a nondescript corner of the yard.
          
          At her feet is a SHALLOW MOUND OF DIRT. At the head of the
          mound, a SIMPLE TOMBSTONE.
          
          She kneels and places a SINGLE FLOWER on the grave.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Lit only by the pale moonlight, barely enough to see by.
          
          Carnegie sleeps soundly in bed. Next to him lies Claudia,
          wide awake. She checks that Carnegie is sound asleep, careful
          not to wake him before she creeps out of bed and exits.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
          
          Claudia is on her hands and knees in the darkness, searching
          blindly in the aisles and beneath the theater seats.
          
          She finds Eli's bible in some litter strewn on the floor.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Thank you for the good that I have
                    done. For whatever light you were
                    able to shine into the darkness of
                    this world through me.
          
          Sitting in the darkness, Claudia opens the book and runs her
          fingers across the braille, reading. And though we can barely
          see in the dim light, we see the smile on her face. The joy.
          
          EXT. ALCATRAZ - EXERCISE YARD - DAWN
          
          As Solara kneels by the grave, we see now that she wears
          Eli's SAINT CHRISTOPHER PENDANT around her neck.
          
          The tombstone reads:
          
                                                                113.
          
          
                               HERE LIES ELIJAH STONE
                                DIED AUGUST 21, 2048
                            FAITHFUL SERVANT TO THE LORD
                                AND FRIEND TO SOLARA
          
          She unsheathes Eli's sword, plants it in the ground before
          his grave. Takes the BOOK from under her arm and opens it up.
          
          It's a NEW BIBLE. Crudely typeset from Lombardi's original
          transcription and printed on the prison press.
          
          She opens it up and begins to read a passage from the bible
          over Eli's grave. We don't hear what she says.
          
          As Solara finishes her reading and closes the bible, LOMBARDI
          appears behind her.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    You know, you don't have to leave.
                    You're welcome to stay here with
                    us. You'll be safe.
          
                               SOLARA
                    Thanks.
          
          She stands, pulling Eli's sword from the earth.
          
                              SOLARA
                    But I gotta do what I gotta do.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Where will you go?
          
          BEAT. Solara looks at the sword, her fingers playing across
          its hilt. The blade glimmers in the light of the rising sun.
          
          There is a determined, purposeful look in her eye.
          
                               SOLARA
                    Home.
          
          EXT. ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAWN
          
          The sun rises through the fog on the horizon.
          
          The great iron gates grind open. Solara emerges from inside
          the prison, steps out onto the island rock.
          
          She is dressed in a flak jacket, combat pants and boots.
          Eli's old pack across her back. Hair tied in a neat pony
          tail. Atop that, Eli's ragged fur hat.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Thank you for the friend I made.
          
                                                                114.
          
          
          In her hand she clutches a copy of the newly-printed bible.
          Eli's sword slung over her shoulder.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Please watch over her as you
                    watched over me.
          
          MONTAGE as Solara walks back along Fisherman's Wharf...
          through the San Francisco rubble... across the Golden Gate
          bridge...
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Thank you for allowing me finally
                    to rest. I'm so very tired. The
                    time of my departure is at hand and
                    now I surrender my soul into your
                    care, at peace in knowing that I
                    have carried out your will. That I
                    have done right with my time on
                    this earth.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          ...and finally back onto a desolate road leading off into the
          desert wasteland. She looks up and down the road, then turns
          and heads toward the sun on the horizon. Headed east.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    I have fought the good fight. I
                    have finished the race.
          
          As she walks away into the sun, her lonely silhouette on the
          road reminds us of Eli as we saw him so many times before.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    I have kept the faith.
          
          She grows smaller and smaller as she walks into the distance,
          until she consumed by the rising sun and we
          
                                                          FADE OUT:

          EXT. BOYLESTON STREET, BOSTON -- MORNING


          
          The boulevard is empty, eerie silence. No cars, no people. A man
          walks down the middle of the street, long trench, dark shades.
          Though he does not speak, we hear...

          

                                 MAN V.O.
                     There's two kinds of people in this
                     world when you boil it all down. You
                     got your talkers and you got your
                     doers.

          
          We recognize this man as ROCCO. He crosses Copley Square toward the
          looming dome of the Trinity Church.

          

                                 ROCCO V.O.
                     Most people are just talkers. All they
                     got is talk. But when all's said and
                     done, it is the doers who change the
                     world. And when they do that, they
                     change us. That's why we never forget
                     them...So, which one are you? Do you
                     just talk about it? Or do you stand up
                     and do something about it? Because
                     believe you me all the rest of it is
                     just coffee house bullshit.

          

          FADE TO BLACK...

          

          EXT. DEEP COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY


          
          SUBTEXT:   "Ireland"

          
          From behind we see two men perched atop a boulder. A flock of sheep
          encircles them. Their army sacks and shotguns are nearby. They roll
          their own cigarettes with effortless synchronicity and light up.
          CONNOR and MURPHY MacMANUS (30's) now have long hair with heavy
          facial growth. Rugged. Piercing eyes. Looking to the horizon...

          

                                 MURPHY
                     Looks like a storm's comin'.

          

                                 CONNOR
                     Aye.

          

          EXT. FIELDS -- LATER


          
          MOODY MUSIC: The brothers drive the flock across jewel green hills.
          Murphy cuts a sheep from a thicket and sets it off.

          

                                 POPPA M V.O.
                     Peace, they say, is the enemy of
                     memory. So it had been for my boys.

          

                                                                           2.

          

          
          Connor shares some jerky with a sheep dog as the flock surges.

          

                                POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
                    For some time now, their past had felt
                    like a dream to them...faded and worn.

          
          Murphy touches the faded Celtic Cross tattoo on his forearm. Connor
          sees. The music takes us to a secluded, pioneer-esque ranch.

          
          CLOSE ON: POPPA M's (58yrs) face as he coughs and watches his sons
          approach from his rocking chair on the porch.

          

                                POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
                    And then suddenly, as if not a day had
                    passed...it was back. I could see it
                    in their eyes.

          

          INT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT


          
          Poppa M and his sons eat a rustic dinner.   It storms outside.

          

                                POPPA M V.O.
                    I could feel it, heavy in their
                    presence. Something calling them back.

          
          Poppa M looks to his boys who just keep eating. DIP TO BLACK...

          

          INT. FARMHOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- NEXT MORNING


          
          Very early dawn, shadowy morning light. Connor and Murphy sip
          coffees and look out into the rain. Lightening lights up the flock.

          
          Through the open door behind them, Poppa M stokes a warm fire.

          
          Connor touch the Celtic Cross tattoo on his forearm. The boys look
          at each other as the rain suddenly stops and all the "little sounds"
          of morning cease. Something's amiss. Thunder. Ominous music as...

          

          EXT. BOSTON, TRINITY CHURCH -- NIGHT


          
          From behind, we see a man with a CREW CUT, staring at the dome of
          the Trinity.

          
          SLO-MO, CLOSE ON: Crew Cut's boots as he paces toward.    The
          threatening music bleeds over to...

          

          EXT. FARM -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Just inside the trees, a pack of wolves stalk the sheep flock...

          
          SLO-MO, CLOSE ON:   A wolf's paws as it paces toward...

          
          We intercut between BOSTON and IRELAND as chaos erupts...

          

                                                                           3.

          

          
          BOSTON:    Crew Cut quickly enters the church.

          
          IRELAND:    The wolves burst from the tree line.

          
          BOSTON: A frantic priest in his 50's weeps and begs as Crew Cut
          slams him to his knees with a .9 mm to his head.

          
          IRELAND:   The wolves savagely attack the screaming sheep.

          
          BOSTON:    Muzzle flash, blood splatters on the altar.

          
          IRELAND: BOOM! BOOM! Connor and Murphy blast shotguns at the
          wolves. One is hit, the rest retreat. The boys perform mercy
          killings on the wolf and one sheep.

          
          Everything calms as Poppa M rushes up with a mag light and stops.
          He coughs roughly. Moody choral music begins...

          

                                  POPPA M V.O.
                      "And they cried out, How long O'Lord
                      dost thou not judge and revenge our
                      blood upon them that dwell on the
                      earth?"

          

          EXT. FIELD -- LATER


          
          The boys toss the wolf carcass onto a bonfire.     It rains again.

          

                                  POPPA M V.O.
                      And God said, "All will fear the wrath
                      of the lamb. For the great day of
                      their reckoning hath come."

          
          Poppa M looks across the blaze to his sons. Connor and Murphy stare
          into the fire, bathed in the light of angry flames.

                                  POPPA M
                      "And they that holdest my name shall
                      come with the shaking of the earth and
                      the roiling of the oceans."

          

          EXT. FARM -- NIGHT


          
          Downpour. A rugged old jeep tears through the mud. It stops at the
          farmhouse. Poppa M and the boys come out onto the porch. A dark
          figure with a fedora and rain slicker exits the jeep and hurries to
          the porch. Meet Uncle SIBEAL (62yrs). He wears a priest's collar.

          

                                  SIBEAL
                      Something's happened.

          

                                                                           4.

          

          

          EXT. CHURCH -- MORNING


          
          Breaking news. REPORTER #1 is live from outside a church.   Squads,
          coroner's vans, CSI etc. Police hold back crowds.

          

                                REPORTER #1
                    There is no new information on the
                    victim found slain this morning inside
                    Trinity Church. As you can see the
                    size of the crowd here has increased
                    substantially over the last couple of
                    hours. People are demanding answers as
                    to how a priest could be murdered in a
                    church. But perhaps more shocking, we
                    have confirmed that the body was
                    ritualized with pennies in the eyes.
                    Many remember this as the grisly
                    calling card of the prolific vigilante
                    killers known as the Saints, who went
                    on a murder spree here in Boston.

                    footage from that harrowing day, our
                    singular tiny glimpse of these infamous

          We are back with Reporter #1 at the church.

          

                                REPORTER #1
                    As police have yet to confirm the
                    Saints' possible involvement, the
                    ominous question hangs heavy in the
                    air. "Are they back?"

          

                                                                         5.

          

          

          INT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT


          
          Sibeal, Poppa M, Connor and Murphy sit around the table.   The boys
          have a look of controlled anger. Presently...

          

                                  MURPHY
                    The priest.    Did they release his name?

          

                                SIBEAL
                    No. But I made a few calls, still got
                    some friends in the diocese there.
                    McKinney. Father Douglas McKinney.

          
          The boys flash with recognition.

          

                                SIBEAL (CONT'D)
                    You knew him?

          

                                CONNOR
                    Knew of him. Everybody did. A regular
                    Mother Theresa. Youth hostels, soup
                    kitchens. Even made it into the
                    newspapers sometimes.

          
          Sibeal considers this.    He genuflects and turns.

          

                                SIBEAL
                    Listen boys. I think it's best that ya
                    just stay put and we'll try ta figure
                    out what...

          
          Connor and Murphy are out the door and headed for the barn.
          Confused, Sibeal looks to Poppa M, who just sips his coffee.

          

          INT. BARN -- MOMENTS LATER

          MOODY MUSIC: The boys begin to look more like "themselves" as the
          they cut their hair and beards with sheep sheers.

          
          The brothers lift a chest from a hole in the barn floor. They load
          guns and money into black duffel bags and place their signature
          rosaries around their necks, clasping their hands in prayer...

          

          INT. TRINITY CHURCH, ALTER -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Detective GREENLY (38yrs) is alone on the alter. Police line all
          around as Greenly stares at the body like the detective has seen a
          ghost. He turns and nervously staggers toward the front vestibule.

          

          INT. VESTIBULE -- SAME TIME


          
          Detectives DOLLY and DUFFY are scared.   In hushed tones...

          

                                                                           6.

          

          

                                DUFFY
                    We need to keep our heads, here.   It's
                    probably not even them.

          

                                DOLLY
                    Of course it ain't them but that
                    doesn't really matter, does it. Our
                    skeletons just came screaming out of
                    the closet. We're fucked.

          

                                DUFFY
                    We're not fucked.

          
          Greenly enters from the church proper.   Dolly and Duffy turn.

          

                                GREENLY
                    We are totally fucked!

          Greenly, disguised as a correctional officer, lets Connor, Murphy
          and Poppa M out of a paddywagon. FLASH!

          
          The Saints enter the Suffolk Courthouse, undetected.   FLASH!

          
          Dolly, dressed as a civilian, pulls the fire alarm.    FLASH!

          
          The Saints execute Poppa Joe Yakavetta before many terrified
          witnesses, the alarm blaring in the b.g. FLASH!

          

          INT. BACK TO PRESENT, VESTIBULE -- MOMENTS LATER


          

                                GREENLY
                    ...and not just fucked, like elephant
                    dick, pounded in the ass, no reach
                    around, jungle fucked!

                                DUFFY
                    Now's not the time to panic, Green
                    beans!

          

                                GREENLY
                    Oh, I disagree. Now's the perfect time
                    to panic. We're all Accessories to...

          

                                DOLLY
                    Don't you fucking say it!

          
          They all argue over one another. OFFICER #1 peaks his head in the
          front door. The detectives grind to a halt.

          

                                OFFICER #1
                    Her E.T.A. is ten minutes.

          CLOSE ON:   a gravestone.   "Paul M. Smecker,    1956 - 2003"

          
          We reveal a pair of sexy female legs, expensive "Jimmy Choo" heels.
          From behind we see the woman rest a rose at Smecker's Grave. "Legs"
          turns and walks toward a waiting squad car in b.g.

          

          EXT. CHURCH -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Dolly, Duffy and Greenly stand outside in the entry way of the
          church. Though still on edge, they have calmed.

          

                                  DOLLY
                      I didn't even know he had a protege.
                      What is this bullshit?

          
          Duffy whips out his trusty note pad.

          

                                  DUFFY
                      Special Agent Eunice Bloom, 32 years
                      old. Smecker plucked her right out of
                      class at Quantico.

          

                                  GREENLY
                      Smecker hand picked her? Aw, man.
                      This brawd's gonna be a nightmare.

          

                                  DUFFY
                      She was assigned to OCD two years back.
                      She can shoot a gun, set three course
                      records during her training.

          

                                 GREENLY
                      Great. A bull dike, Annie Oakley wanna-
                      be. We gotta get rid of her.

                                  DUFFY
                      She is also an authority on the Saints
                      case. Which means Smecker must have
                      walked her through it.

          
          The cops suddenly flush with fear.

          

                                  DOLLY
                      And the hits just keep on comin'.

          

          INT. FARMHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Sibeal waits as Poppa M thinks, then shakes his head.

          

                                                                       8.

          

          

                                POPPA M
                    Naw...I'm in no condition.   I'd just
                    slow 'em down.

          

                                SIBEAL
                    Well, are ya at least gonna try ta talk
                    them out of this?

          
          Poppa M shakes his head.

          

                                SIBEAL (CONT'D)
                    We don't even know what this is yet!
                    Somebody could just be tryin' ta get
                    away with murder here!

          

                                POPPA M
                    Aye. Only there's about a thousand
                    easier ways ta do that. Trust me.
                    Someone's callin' them out, Sibeal. Ya
                    kill a priest in a church and make it
                    look like they did it. Bring 'em back
                    with a vengeance. Don't know who.
                    Don't know why. But someone thinks
                    he's real fuckin' clever. Only one
                    problem with his little plan.

          

                                  SIBEAL
                    What's dat?

          

                                  POPPA M
                    It worked.

          
          Fear and frustration burst from Sibeal.

          

                                SIBEAL
                    Jesus Christ! D'er's too much we don't
                    know and if you're won't at least try
                    ta talk some sense into them, I will!

          
          The door opens and in comes Connor and Murphy. Sibeal notes the
          change in appearance. The boys stand at the kitchen table's
          opposing end, hands in their pockets. Their resolve fills the room.

          
          The brothers face off with Poppa M and Sibeal: a bizarre board

                    Exactly what do you intend to do?

          
          Silence. Nobody moves. Connor withdraws a hand from his pocket and
          looks down. He flips a penny on the table. It clatters to a stop.

          

                                                                          9.

          EXT. CHURCH -- LATER


          
          A squad pulls up.    Dolly, Duffy and Greenly turn.

          

                                  DOLLY
                     Game time.   How are we playing this?

          

                                 DUFFY
                     Feds love to pull the divide and
                     conquer routine. We hard line her.
                     Stick together on this. Agreed?

          

                                  DOLLY
                     Agreed.   We're a brick wall.

          
          They all nod and stiffen their resolve.

          

                                 GREENLY
                     Let's rock this bitch.

          
          Rockin' music fades in as a uniform opens the squad door.

          
          SLO-MO:   EUNICE BLOOM (32yrs) exits the squad and moves toward.

          
          She is simply delicious: sexy, blonde hair, a woman's business
          suit, short skirt, brass rimmed specs. Each detective's face drops.
          Soon she is before them. Music cuts. She smiles and speaks with a
          southern drawl a la Doc Holiday.

          

                                 EUNICE

                     Eunice Bloom. A pleasure.

          
          Dolly and Duffy shake and manage a nod.    Greenly is still enamored.

          

                                 EUNICE (CONT'D)

          She chuckles.   Dolly and Duffy fume.

          

                                                                            10.

                    Excuse me?

          

                                EUNICE
                    You see there's a "special" before my
                    "agent." If we are going to address
                    each other formally, I'd prefer if you
                    popped it in there. Makes me feel, I
                    don't know...special. Of course, I'd
                    hoped we could be a little more
                    personable. In fact, I'd like you to
                    call me Eunice.

          
          The cops are dumbfounded.      Duffy snaps out of it.

          

                                DUFFY
                    O'kay, Eunice. I don't see why the

                    Whoa, whoa, "fuck?" This isn't a
                    "fuck" situation, is it? I can see a
                    "God Damn" or two but why skip all the
                    way to "fuck" right off the bat? Let's
                    start slow and work our way up to it.

          

                                DUFFY
                    What is the Fed's interest in this?
          The detectives harden, brick wall.     Eunice furrows her brow.

          

                                EUNICE
                    Their interest, Detective, is capturing
                    the men responsible for the murders of
                    22 of Boston's finest criminals. Y'see
                    public perception is that these boys
                    stepped in, did our jobs for us and
                    then disappeared into thin air as we
                    fecklessly searched for them. The FBI
                    tends to take exception to such things.
                    They coulda sent anyone. They sent me.
                    Why do you think that is?

                    It is because I am so fucking smart
                    that I make smart people feel like
                    retards. Now, we seem to be getting
                    off on the wrong foot here. I'd
                    appreciate a bit of cooperation. Let's
                    chalk it up to paying respect to the
                    memory of a dearly departed mutual
                    friend. A man who taught me everything
                    I know.

          
          After a moment of consideration, the cops concede with nods.

                                DUFFY
                    The victim was killed late last night.
                    When people gathered for morning mass,
                    they found the front entrance chained
                    and padlocked. A locksmith came out,
                    cut the chain and surprise, surprise.
                    Cell phones. Half of them called the
                    cops. Half of them called the media.
                    But regardless...word's out.

          
          Eunice turns and looks over the crowd.

          

                                EUNICE
                    And it looks like that's just the way
                    somebody wanted it. What say we scrape
                    the shit off this cow's ass, fellas?
                    Detective Greenly? Escort a lady onto
                    the crime scene?

          

                                 GREENLY
                    What?   No, yeah, no.   Of course.

          
          Greenly escorts her as Dolly and Duffy walk behind, mystified.

          Eunice stands, looking down the aisle at the altar. Behind her, the
          Detectives are curios as Eunice slides on pink latex gloves.

          She puts in ear plugs and all ambient sound ceases.   She starts
          slowly down the aisle...

          
          TOTAL SILENCE AS...Eunice inspects the smashed door of a
          confessional booth. She looks over the body closely then turns from
          the altar and walks to the detectives. She pulls her earplugs and

          The detectives nod.

                    never commit such an act on sacred

                                DOLLY
                    All their vics were criminals. Clearly
                    not the case here. So, it wasn't them
                    which means this is a local matter and
                    it falls under our jurisdiction. No

                    "With all due respect." Because it is

          Close up on Greenly's enraptured face. We pull back and see he is
          on his knees before Eunice and staring longingly between her legs.

                    Very well, David.

          
          Duffy and Dolly stand behind Greenly, chest to chest, each mimicking
          guns to the back of the kneeling cop's head.

          This is torture for Greenly and he turns his head from Eunice's
          crotch. She immediately adjusts him back into place.

                    Eyes front, David. The position of the
                    victim and the angles produced by the
                    killers' stance created a unique
                    scenario. The bullets criss crossed in
                    the skull and exited the eye sockets.
                    Here, this did not occur. The rounds

                    the back of the victim's head and out
                    the front. Which happens when...

          She aims both hands to the back of Greenly's head.

          tongue to the Giant and he stops and rests.

          Romeo catches his opponent's wrist and wraps his chain around. A
          kick in the stomach drops the Giant to his knees. Romeo locks the
          man's head between his legs, scissor hold.

                    ourselves up again, brick by brick.
                    And now that we've re-acquiesced our
                    original power, can we really afford to
                    have these guys pop out of the woodwork
                    someday and try to finish the job when
                    we least expect it? Now, for those of
                    you who have forgotten, let's recap.
                    These fuckers walk into rooms full of
                    gangsters...
                             (denotes surroundings)
                    Outnumbered, outgunned. They kill
                    everyone...and leave.

          
          Some look as if they are starting to get his point.

                    You think I don't know that each one of
                    you's been waking up in night sweats
                    over this the last couple years? These
                    sons of bitches prison fucked us with
                    no lube, wiped their dicks on our
                    drapes and walked away! And we been
                    living in silent fear ever since. Oh,
                    we don't talk about it. Rape victims
                    often don't. But it's there. Knowing
                    they're still out there, somewhere.
                    Thinking...what if?

          
          Fear and realization.

          

                                CAPO #4
                    Concezio is right. Pretending you
                    don't got a problem don't solve
                    nothing.

          
          Heads nod in shameful agreement.

          

                                                                        21.

          

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    Thank you, Doctor Phil. So, let's take
                    a moment to look at the serendiplious,
                    diperous, serendip...

                             (FRUSTRATION)
                    ...type situation we find ourselves in
                    here. There's a good chance they'll
                    show. No catching us with our pants
                    down this time. We can deal with them
                    proactivitously. The cops were
                    embarrassed by these guys too. With a
                    second bite at the apple, they got
                    every reason in the world to crank up
                    the heat. And as for their doting
                    public. I'd imagine they're gonna lose
                    a few fans.

          
          Heads nod all around.   Sold.

          

          INT. BERTH -- LATER


          
          Murphy sits, bare chested on a crate. With the rigged pen, he
          tattoos his brother's back. Connor cooks something, in a pot, on
          the hot plate. The resin of anger is evident.

          
          TATTOOS: Murphy's back has the crucified feet of Christ and
          Connor's shows Christ's downcast head on the cross.

          

                                CONNOR
                    The prodigal son, huh?   He wants us,
                    he's fuckin' got us.

          

                                MURPHY
                    But why would he do something so
                    public?

                                CONNOR
                    Think about it. People figure we did
                    it. Makes it more likely someone will
                    drop a dime. Way easier to get to us
                    in prison, isn't it, now.

          
          The berth door is slightly ajar. In pops a bottle of Whiskey, then
          Romeo's head. He's expecting a cheer but the brothers have their
          backs to him. He's instantly taken by their ink.

          

                                MURPHY
                    But how would anyone recognize us?

          

                                CONNOR
                    You don't remember those sketches on
                    the news channel?

          

                                                             22.

          

          

                                MURPHY
                    Shit. That's right. Y'know, every
                    time they show those composites on TV
                    and then they catch the guy, it looks
                    nothin' like him. But ours?

          

                                CONNOR
                    Just our luck. We get Leonardo fuckin'
                    Divinci as a sketch artist.

          
          Romeo listens with suspicion.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Maybe we should dye our hair.

          

                                CONNOR
                    What?

          

                               MURPHY
                    Yeah. These guys are always dyin'
                    their hair. You know, like in "The
                    Fugitive." It's covert and shit.

          
            Connor smirks privately.

          

                                CONNOR
                    What color would you dye it?

          

                                MURPHY
                    I don't know...lighter, I guess.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Y'mean...blonde?

          

                                MURPHY
                    I didn't say that!

                                CONNOR
                    California, surfer boy, gay, gay
                    blonde?!

          

                                MURPHY
                    I'm warnin' ya!

          

                                CONNOR
                    Just keep your hands off my ass back
                    there and, "stay gold, Pony Boy."

          
          Connor laughs heartily.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Fuck you!

          

                                                                         23.

          

          
          Murphy stabs the ink pen into his brother's shoulder.

          

                                CONNOR

                    AAAAAH!

          
          Connor bolts up, knocking over the pot. Hot water and pennies
          spread across the floor. Connor pulls the pen out.

          

                                CONNOR (CONT'D)
                    You motherfucker!

          
          Romeo steps inside and sees the pennies.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Serves ya right!

          
          The boys are just about to fight when...

          

                                ROMEO
                    Oh, shit.

          
          The brothers snap their heads toward.   A stunned Romeo points to
          them, then the pennies.

          

                                ROMEO (CONT'D)
                    I know who you are. You guys are the
                    fuckin'....

          

                                MURPHY

                    SHUT IT!

          
          Murphy moves behind Romeo, shuts the door and shoves him in.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Oh, this is so fucking cool, man. I'm
                    from Boston. I love you guys. Shit,
                    everybody does! I mean, holy fucking
                    shit! Maybe I could get in on this,
                    you know? Bring some La Raza ta this
                    thing. Spice it up a little. Hey, is
                    it true you guys say a prayer before
                    you grease somebody?

          
          Connor pulls a gun. The boys jump on Romeo and pin him to the
          floor. Murphy clasps a hand over Romeo's mouth. Connor puts the
          gun to Romeo's head. Their faces glaze over, religious ecstasy...

          

                                CONNOR
                    And an awesome wailing was heard
                    throughout heaven...

          
          Romeo's eyes go wide and muffled cries of terror are heard.

          

                                                                      24.

          

          

                                MURPHY
                    ...as the terrible hand of the Lord
                    struck upon the earth.

          

                                CONNOR
                    And as Almighty God created you...he
                    now calleth you home.

          
          He pulls the trigger - "click."

          

                                CONNOR (CONT'D)
                    Ooops. Busy signal. We'll hafta
                    calleth back.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Let's have a shot while we're waitin'.

          
          The boys laugh, snatch the bottle.   Romeo is in shock.

          

                                ROMEO
                    That shit was NOT funny, man!

          
          The brothers laugh harder. Romeo rolls on his side and slides a
          hand down the back of his pants. He seems relieved.

          

                                ROMEO (CONT'D)
                    Oh, thank you, Jesus. Thought I
                    greased my drawers.

          

          INT. BERTH -- LATER


          
          The boys and Romeo smoke and pass the bottle around.

          

                                CONNOR
                    No.

                                ROMEO
                    But I got conex all over Bean Town.
                    Romeo'll hook you up like a tow truck!

          

                                MURPHY
                    No.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Why not?!

          

                                MURPHY
                    We don't hafta give you reasons.
                    Forget it.

          

                                ROMEO
                    It's because I'm Mexican, isn't it!

          

                                                              25.

          

          

                                CONNOR
                    How dare you, sir, insinuate such a
                    thing? The fact that you're a greasy
                    spic's got nothin' ta do with it.

          
          The boys laugh.

          

                                ROMEO
                    I'm gonna let you have that one. Look.
                    I can do this. It's not rocket
                    science. You two find bad guys doing
                    bad shit and you kill them, right?

          

                                CONNOR
                    It's not that simple.

          

                                 MURPHY
                    Yes it is.

          

                                CONNOR
                    S'pose you're right. I'd sorta hoped we
                    were a little more artistic than that.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Well, you ain't. Can't you guys see
                    it? This shit's fate, man. Like
                    preordained type shit. Mea fucking
                    Culpa! Why do you think you just
                    happened to be in that hatchway today?

          

                                MURPHY
                    Oh, don't start gettin' all super
                    fuckin' natural on us. We saw those
                    guys goin' in there!

          

                                ROMEO
                    Ah, ha! That's what you say. I say it's
                    because Jeeeeesus wanted it that way!

          

                                 CONNOR
                    Oh, no.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Fine. Then what exactly do you intend
                    to do when you hit U.S. soil?

          

                                CONNOR
                    We'll go after all Yakavetta's people
                    and operations till we get to the man
                    himself.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Yeah, work our way up the food chain.

          

                                                                      26.

          

          
          The brothers seem pleased with themselves.

                    So, what's your first gig?    What's the
                    first thing you gonna do?

          
          The boys look to one another.   They're stumped.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Well, I don't suppose we have a
                    succinct plan, y'know, per se.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Yeah. It's not fully developed yet,
                    y'know, as it were.

          
          A slow smile splits Romeo's face.

          

                                ROMEO
                    You two need to chill in the green
                    room, sip on some Pellegrinos and let
                    your manager handle the details. And
                    you better get my Cub Scout badge
                    ready. Cuz if you want to kick
                    Yakavetta in the nuts, let him know
                    you're in town...Romeo's got an ace in
                    the hole for you.

          

          INT. / EXT. NEWS FOOTAGE, MAN ON THE STREET INTERVIEWS


          

                                HOT DOG VENDOR
                    These guys have gone "mad dog" here.
                    They need to be put down.

          

                                CAB DRIVER
                    I think it's disgusting.   I wish they'd
                    have stayed gone.

          

                                PEDESTRIAN
                    I don't believe it for a second!   No
                    bleep-in way the Saints did it!

          

          INT. BOSTON P.D., WAR ROOM -- MORNING


          
          The CHIEF (50's) sits, arms folded. The detectives are present.
          Eunice stands before a wall adorned with crime scene photos,
          reports, Concezio and his Capos.

          

                                EUNICE
                    And that's all she wrote. Everything
                    points in the same direction.

          
          She taps Yakavetta's picture on the wall.

          

                                                              27.

          

          

                                CHIEF
                    Why would Yakavetta want them back
                    here? Him of all people.

          

                                DUFFY
                    To have them executed. Revenge.
                    Oldest motive in the book.

          

                                GREENLY
                    The Saints killed his daddy six years
                    ago, right? He was inside when that
                    happened doing a nickel for extortion.

          

                                DOLLY
                    Yeah. From inside he could only do so
                    much. Since he got out nine months
                    ago, the Yakavetta's have regained
                    their original strength. Looks like
                    their clearing all their open accounts.

          
          The Chief rubs his chin.

          

                                CHIEF
                    Well...it's a theory.

          

                                EUNICE
                    More than just a theory, Chief.

          
          She nods to Duffy.

          

                                DUFFY
                    C.I.'s came back. Cold hits all
                    around. Concezio Yakavetta and his six
                    Capo Regime, all blood relatives, have
                    disappeared.

                               CHIEF
                    So?

          

                                GREENLY
                    So, it fits. He's gone to the
                    mattresses with his top brass. He's
                    protecting them till this is over.

          

                                EUNICE
                    And word's been put to all his
                    lieutenants that the Saints are to be
                    taken out, on sight.

          

                                DOLLY
                    That means his resources on the streets
                    are battening down the hatches, waiting
                    for them to show.

          

                                                                          28.

          

          

                                CHIEF
                    Look, I been stone walling the media on
                    this thing but the Mayor's been riding
                    me like a rented mule here. I got half
                    of New England thinking the Saints
                    whacked a priest and the other half
                    thinking their innocent. Its a powder
                    keg. I'm talking riot gear at Celtics
                    games, here. I could clear them of
                    this murder, take the piss right out of
                    this thing, keep the peace in the
                    Commonwealth. Gimme one good reason
                    why I shouldn't go public right now.

          

                                EUNICE
                    Walk with me, Chief.    Let's talk.

          
          He stands and she takes his arm as they exit.     Duffy quietly closes
          the door and turns. Hushed tones...

          

                                DUFFY
                    This is not good.   She's gunning for
                    the boys hard.

          

                                DOLLY
                    This brawd, trying to put a feather in
                    her cap is gonna get us locked up.

          

                                DUFFY
                    Just calm down.

          

                                GREENLY
                    And you know they'll send us to the
                    Hoag. We put half those deranged sex
                    freaks in there. I hope you guys like
                    cock sandwiches. Cuz we'll be eating
                    them for breakfast, lunch and dinner!

          

          INT. PRECINCT HALL -- SAME TIME


          
          The Chief and Eunice walk down the hall.

          

                                EUNICE
                    I understand you got a job to do,
                    Chief. But if Yakavetta even sniffs
                    that we're onto him, he puts a bullet
                    in Napoleon's head, plants him at the
                    bottom of the ocean and walks. This
                    pint sized killer is the only thing
                    that puts Yakavetta right in the middle
                    of this. It is imperative that we find
                    this man.

          

                                                                        29.

          

          
          The Chief looks as if he is sold.

          

          INT. WAR ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          In hushed tones.

          

                                DUFFY
                    We need to figure what we're gonna do
                    when the boys show and start doin' what
                    they do best. Cuz that's when the
                    shit's really gonna hit the fan.

          

                                DOLLY
                    That's another thing. Everyone's
                    assuming that they're going to come
                    back. I mean, we got no way of knowing
                    that for sure.

          

                                GREENLY
                             (ray of hope)
                    Yeah. That could totally happen.    They
                    could not come back.

          

                                DUFFY
                    What dream world did you two just slip
                    into?!

          
          They argue.   Duffy snaps a photo of the dead priest from the wall.

          

                                DUFFY (CONT'D)
                    Point blank! We know the boys. Is
                    there any part of you that thinks
                    they're are just going to let this
                    slide? Believe this. They are either
                    on their way...or they're already here.

          EXT. BOSTON, DOCKS, PARKING LOT -- NIGHT


          
          CLOSE ON: Connor, Murphy and Romeo peaking over a concrete wall.
          Three sets of eyes.

          
          Our trio is atop a dumpster, peaking over at the loading dock.
          Chinese Gangsters supervise unloading of crates onto a flatbed.

          

                                ROMEO
                    It's been all over the papers the last
                    two years. Yakavetta's in bed with the
                    Chinese. They're using international
                    shipping routes to smuggle it in. This
                    is Little Yaka's shit.

          
          Connor and Murphy smile.

          

                                                                     30.

                    Let's follow 'em down the rabbit hole,
                    Alice.

          
          Murphy claps Romeo on the shoulder.

          

                                MURPHY
                    You just scored a few points, Rome.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Well, dust off my "Members Only"
                    jacket.
                             (pulls set of keys)
                    Cuz the kid has also supplied the ride!

          

          INT. CAR -- LATER


          
          Murphy looks displeased. We hear a stressing motor. Romeo drives,
          Murphy sits shotgun. Connor is in back, loading guns. Pull back to
          reveal our trio rides in a '68 VW Bug. It is green with patches of
          Bondo, exposed engine, low-pro rims, neon runner board lights - a
          low riding "work in progress."

          

                                MURPHY
                    I thought you said your car was
                    inconspicuous.

          

                                ROMEO
                    I don't like words that got 'spic'
                    right in the middle. Besides, it
                    is...where I live.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Where's that? Pimpville?

          

                                ROMEO
                    Hey! I hail from a colorful people.
                    Besides, you wouldn't know style if it
                    pitched a tent in your ass!
                             (looks into rear view)
                    What do you think of the ride, Conman?

          

                                CONNOR
                    The only way I could be more
                    embarrassed right now is if I was
                    ridin' a moped.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Yeah...while fuckin' a fat girl.

                    Yeah...rollin' through the gym at my
                    high school reunion.

          INT. WAREHOUSE -- LATER


          
          CHINESE GANGSTERS #1-#5, shovel mounds of coffee grounds out of
          crates and pull kilos of white powder. Machinery noise in b.g.

          

          EXT. WAREHOUSE -- SAME TIME


          
          CLOSE ON:   Three sets of eyes peaking over oil drums.

          
          Our trio watches as a DOCK WORKER (22yrs) drives a forklift,
          unloading the crates from the flatbed and driving them through the
          huge open bay doors. The boys and Romeo huddle up.

          

                                  CONNOR
                      O'kay, here's the plan.

          

          EXT. "THE PLAN," WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT


          
          The "Queen" classic, Another One Bites the Dust, presides over this
          fantasy sequence. The boys, looking more "quaffed," do a pointless
          slow motion walk toward the forklift, throwing up their collars.

          
          Romeo, also looking polished, executes a "Dan Tana" pistol whipping
          on the Dock Worker who perfectly out of frame.

          
          INSIDE WAREHOUSE: The lift pulls to a stop before the gangsters,
          crate on the forks. Romeo is behind the wheel.

          
          SLO-MO: Connor and Murphy pop from the crate and fire on their
          Asian foe, hitting each squarely in the chest.

          
          SLO-MO: The boys leap down and light cigs as Romeo does the "one
          arm action star hang" off the side of the lift in b.g. WHIP PAN...

          EXT. WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

                      We skin out, go ta Doc's for a shot of
                      Irish. We're home in time for tacos.

          
          Murphy looks unsure.     Connor turns to his brother.

          

                                   CONNOR (CONT'D)
                      What?

                      Well, it's...uh...you know, it's...

          

                                                                        32.

          

          

                                ROMEO
                    It's genius. I can even drive an F-
                    lift, man. Got my class "D" license
                    and everything.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Now, dat's the spirit.

          

                                ROMEO
                    I need a gun.

          

                                 CONNOR AND MURPHY
                    Forget it.

          

                                ROMEO
                    What the fuck? I'm in on this shit,
                    man! I'm working here!

          
          The boys look to each other. Murphy shrugs. Relenting, Connor
          pulls a metallic object and shoves it in Romeo's hand.

          

                                CONNOR
                    You can consider yourself a fuckin'
                    pledge until we say different.

          
          Romeo holds up the gun in displeasure, a tiny .22 caliber lady's
          purse pistol. Murphy snickers.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Can I consider myself your girlfriend,
                    too?

          

                                CONNOR
                    That's what you get.   Is there a
                    problem?

                               ROMEO
                             (beat, fuming)
                    It's fine.

          
          Connor scopes the warehouse.   Murphy claps Romeo on the shoulder.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Don't worry, Rome.   Shit like this
                    builds character.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Yeah, the character of a little bitch.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Now, dat's just unprofessional.

          
          He turns and joins his brother as Romeo continues sulking.

          

                                                                       33.

          

          

                                MURPHY (CONT'D)
                    What do we think?

          

                                CONNOR
                    I think Yakavetta murdered a good man
                    just to send us a message.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Well...let's send him one back.

          
          As they spirit themselves off.   DISSOLVE TO...

          CRIME SCENE: Crime scene workers toil. We do not see specifics of
          the scene, just enough to see the place is trashed and the bodies.

          
          Greenly prowls the scene with his iPod playing. His musical choice
          is the 80's Nightranger standby, "Motoring." He riffs on air guitar
          while assessing. Dolly and Duffy look on...

          They reach the Detectives.      Greenly, still rockin', doesn't notice.

          She smiles and nods.   Greenly removes his ear pieces.

                    It's them.

          
          Greenly looks emasculated. Dolly and Duffy smirk at him. Eunice
          stands and prowls the scene, intense, intrigued, in her own world...

          EXT. FLASHBACK, WAREHOUSE -- EARLIER


          
          On the flatbed, the brothers shovel coffee out of the final crate
          which rests on the forks of the lift. Below them stands the Dock
          Worker holding his bleeding head. Romeo covers him with his 22.

          

                                DOCK WORKER
                    You didn't have to bash me in the
                    skull.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Sorry, man. We got a plan going, here.
                    Technically, I was supposed to knock
                    you out.

          

                                DOCK WORKER
                    Christ! You got a gun. You could have
                    just pointed it at me and said SCRAM!

          
          Connor points his gun at the Dock Worker.

          

                                  CONNOR

                    SCRAM!

          

                                  DOCK WORKER
                    You got it!

          
          He runs off.   Romeo turns up to them.

                                ROMEO
                    So, let's not let this one, small
                    incident get in the way of...

                    Shut up and get behind the fuckin'
                    wheel!

          
          Romeo hops into the driver's seat.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Well, at least the plan is off to a
                    winning start.

          

                                CONNOR

          They pull wrapped white kilos.    Connor dips in a finger and tastes.

          

                                CONNOR (CONT'D)
                    It's heroin.

          

                                MURPHY
                    How the fuck would you know?

          

                                  CONNOR
                    Fuck you.    I know shit.

          

          INT. WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Romeo's winging it, jerky moves, grinding gears as the forklift
          staggers across the mammoth warehouse toward the gangsters at the
          opposing end. The crate blocks Romeo from view. He's driving blind
          as the rickety crate jiggles on the forks.

          
          INSIDE CRATE:   Connor and Murphy are sardined, back to back.

          

                                  MURPHY
                    Jesus!    What the fuck's he doin'?!

          

                                CONNOR
                    He can't see where he's goin'!

          
          Murphy peaks through a crack.

          

                                  MURPHY
                    Shit!    Tell him to go left, now!

          
          Connor puts his mouth to a knot hole.

          

                                  CONNOR
                    Go left!    Go left!

                                 ROMEO
                    What?!

          
          Connor sticks his finger out the hole and points. Romeo wrenches
          the wheel and they narrowly avoid machinery. The crate rocks...

          

                                MURPHY
                    I can't fuckin' believe I let you talk
                    me into this! This is a stupid plan!

          

                                CONNOR
                    I didn't notice you throwin' out any
                    ideas, ya creative asshole!

          

                                 MURPHY
                    Fuck you!

          

                                                                        37.

          

          
          The boys start elbowing each other in a close quarters scrap while
          hurling obscenities.

          

                                 ROMEO
                    Hey!   What's goin' on in there?!

          
          INSIDE CRATE: Murphy suddenly stops, eyes wide as he looks through
          the crack. They are headed for a "Mechanic's Well."   A long,
          rectangular cement hole in the floor six feet deep.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Jesus Christ! Tell him to stop!

          
          Connor slams his mouth to the knot hole.

          

                                 CONNOR

                    BRAKES!   BRAKES! BRAKES!

          
          A few of the Chinese turn as Romeo slams on the brakes, screeching
          to a halt just before the well. The crate slides right off and
          falls in, disappears from sight. CRASH!

          
          A large cloud of coffee dust plumes.   A wide eyed Romeo is exposed.
          The Asian gangsters stare in shock.

          
          Hard techno music! Suddenly, Romeo whips it in reverse, cranks the
          wheel guns it and navigates the well. Speeds toward the gangsters.

          
          MECHANIC'S WELL: (SLO-MO) The brothers burst from the debris,
          covered in coffee grounds and white powder. They draw their weapons
          and walk toward the ramp at the well's opposing end.

          
          The Chinese pull and start firing. Romeo dives off and rolls behind
          some machines. The lift continues on target.

          
          The brothers emerge and tear right in, firing at the gangsters.
          Romeo fires his useless 22. In the ensuing fire fight the brothers
          kill all but Chinese Gangster #3.

          
          The forklift crashes through the table with the stacked heroin.

          
          SLO-MO: The brothers slam the final Gangster to his knees and level
          to the back of his head and recite the following in synchronicity...

          

                                BROTHERS
                    And shepherds we shall be, for Thee, my
                    Lord, for Thee. Power hath descended
                    forth from Thy hand, that our feet may
                    swiftly carry out Thy command. So, we
                    shall flow a river forth to Thee and

                        Just got a call from my best snitch.
                        Never steered me wrong. He says its
                        this guy.

                        "Gorgeous" George Tuffano. He's
                        trusted bruglione to Yakavetta but not
                        blood. He's been left control of the
                        streets. He's running all of it.

          
          Eunice looks over the mug shot.

          

                                    GREENLY
                        They call him "Gorgeous" cuz he likes
                        his silk suits and jewelry. He's even
                        got the 'out of season' fake bake going
                        on, a real peacock, this guy.

                        gun...to a gunfight.

                    Well, I'm having a hard time believing
                    that one of the three most lethal
                    individuals on the planet just switched
                    over to bird shot.

          

                                DOLLY
                    Maybe we're reading it wrong. The
                    priest was a frame job, right?

          

                                DUFFY
                    Yeah, maybe somebody's trying to
                    eliminate some competition here.

          
          Eunice considers this.   The Detectives seem hopeful.

                    have ourselves a change in the line up,
                    here.

          
          The detectives all look at one another nervously.

          

                                GREENLY
                    Fine, they're back.   What's the plan?

                    figure out where Yakavetta's hiding.

                    me a face to face with these boys one
                    way or the other.

          
          She walks off.   The cops look terrified.

          "Gorgeous" GEORGE (47yrs) is face down as a female masseuse works
          his back, incense, mood music. Eunice silently slides in flashing
          her badge, a finger to her pursed lips.

          
          Uneasy, the woman continues her work as Eunice lotions her hands.
          She covertly replaces the masseuse and motions her out of the room.
          Eunice digs in as the fatted mobster moans with pleasure.

          Eunice grabs a large massage paddle with rubber fingers. She whips
          George's towel off, winds up and smacks him on his bare ass, HARD!!

                    Don't you agree?

          

                                GEORGE
                    Y, yeah...I'm with that.

          

                                 EUNICE
                    Good.   Now sit your fat ass down.

          

                                                                      44.

          

          
          George sits. Eunice reholsters, wiggles her skirt straight and sits
          on the massage table. George looks at her legs as she slowly
          crosses them. Trepidation as he covers his genitals. Eunice smiles
          as she flashes her FBI credentials. George relaxes.

                                GEORGE
                    I don't know.

          

                                EUNICE
                    Yeah. There's a lot of stuff you don't
                    know, Hoss. For instance, why aren't
                    you safely tucked away in some ivory
                    tower with all the other big wigs,
                    sucking on cannoli and shrimp cocktail?
                    Why are you the one he left on the
                    streets, George?

          

                                GEORGE
                    Someone's gotta run our legitimate
                    businesses. Someone's gotta make sure
                    that...

          

                                EUNICE
                    Someone's gotta chum the waters.

          

                                GEORGE
                    That's bullshit and I ain't saying
                    another fucking word to you.

          

                                EUNICE
                    Good. Then you can just listen. The
                    jig is up. We know Concezio had that
                    priest killed.

          
          George snaps his head to Eunice in shock, then recovers.

          

                                EUNICE (CONT'D)
                    Oh, surprise, surprise. Another thing
                    you don't know, I reckon. But why
                    would he tell you? You and your guys
                    on the streets, you're his bait. Y'all
                    just got thrown into a meat grinder.

          
          Eunice goes to leave but stops and turns back.

          

                                EUNICE (CONT'D)
                    Gorgeous George, huh? Expendable
                    George is more like it.

          EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT, "EL CAVA" RESTAURANT -- DAY


          
          A Mexican joint, tucked away down by the docks.

          

                                ROMEO V.O.
                    You wanna find something in Boston that
                    don't wanna be found you go to the
                    Oracle, ese. My Uncle Cesar is hooked
                    up with the Underground.

          

          INT. RESTAURANT -- SAME TIME


          
          The boys, Romeo and UNCLE CESAR (58yrs) sit in a booth. Cesar is
          noble looking, silver hair. Silence as he looks them over.

          

                                CESAR
                    Word is, Yakavetta's gunning for you
                    boys hard. The whole city's on edge.
                    I even heard he posted a reward like
                    Jesse James style and shit. Any of his
                    guys that take you out gets his palm
                    crossed, two hundred and fifty grand.

          

                                 ROMEO
                    Whew.   A quarter of a mill for us?

          

                                CESAR
                    Us? What the fuck are you talking
                    about "us?"

          
          They begin to argue in Spanish.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Uncle, why do you have to disrespect me
                    in front of them?!

          

                                CESAR
                    Cool it, Mr. Big Shot! A year ago you
                    were washing my pots and pans!

          

                                ROMEO
                    Well, I don't wash fucking pots
                    anymore! I'm part of this, Uncle!

          

                                CESAR
                    Hey! This isn't my first bar-b-que!
                    Now shut up and stop interrupting! Let
                    me talk to them and I'll figure out
                    whether your in on this or in your own
                    fucking fantasy world!

          

                                                                       46.

          

          
          Romeo swallows his anger.   Murphy speaks Spanish.

          

                                 MURPHY
                    He's in.   All the way in.

          
          Cesar looks at Murphy surprised.   In English.

          

                                CESAR
                    Is my nephew pulling his weight?

          
          Connor nods while tapping his chest.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Mucho corazon.

          
          Cesar looks to his nephew with a new found respect and touches his
          hand. Romeo is very affected by this. Back to business.

          

                                CESAR
                    Gorgeous George is running the show for
                    Little Yaka. Drugs, prostitution,
                    sharking, the whole cha cha. If
                    anybody knows where he is, it's that
                    fat fucking pedico. I'll put it out on
                    the wire.

          

          INT. THE GREEN MACHINE -- LATER


          
          Romeo quietly weeps as he drives. The brothers are "highly aware"
          and give respectful silence. As Romeo sniffles we show slow motion
          remembrances of Cesar nodding and giving Romeo a look of respect and
          then touching his nephew's hand.

          
          Back in the Green Machine - an excruciating amount of time passes.
          Murphy tries to break the ice.

                                MURPHY
                    Hey, uh, maybe we should...

          

                                 CONNOR
                    Shut up.   Romeo's crying.

          
          A moment of silence....then all three burst into laughter.

          

                                ROMEO
                    You fucking assholes!

          

          INT. PRUDENTIAL BUILDING, LUXURY APARTMENT -- DAY


          
          A sprawling high rise apartment, overlooking Boston: buffet table,
          plasma screen, etc. The Capos are taking advantage of the
          amenities. Concezio's not here. Capo #5 - #6 fill their plates...

          

                                                                          47.

          

          

                                CAPO #5
                    That shipment of "H" was gonna square
                    our books for six months. Shit.

          

                                CAPO #6
                    We always bounce back. Besides, look
                    at the bright side. Better the chinks
                    than us, right.

          

                                CAPO #5
                    I guess.  Like the boss said...
                             (Concezio impression)
                    "This is war. There's gonna be
                    casuwalities."

          
          They laugh. Suddenly, George enters with an overnight bag.      The
          Capos are confused. Feigning a capitol mood...

          

                                GEORGE
                    Oh! Like the Roman Empire in here!
                    Where's all the concubines and shit?

          
          George laughs. Nobody else does. He looks at the food table.      We
          pull close on shrimp cocktail and cannoli. A look of dread.

          

                                  CAPO #3
                    George.    What gives, here?

          

                                GEORGE
                    I need to see the Boss, right away.

          

                                CAPO #4
                    Jimmy the Gofer!

          
          In hustles JIMMY THE GOFER (20's), skinny, weak looking.

                                CAPO #2
                             (to Jimmy)
                    Il cortina.

          
          Jimmy draws back a large curtain, exposing a steel panic room. Next
          to the vault door, is a video screen which displays the unamused
          face of Concezio. His voice booms over loudspeakers.

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    Get over here!

          

                                 GEORGE
                    Whoa!

          
          George hustles over.   He stands before the screen, confused.

          

                                                                       48.

          

          

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    Uh.   Hey, Boss! I just came by to...!

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    Push the talk button, numb nuts.

          

                                GEORGE
                    Oh.
                             (he does)
                    Can you here me? Over.

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    I can hear you fine, Smokey and the
                    Bandit. Now, what the fuck are you
                    doing here?

          

                                GEORGE
                    Everything's in motion. All our guys
                    are gunning for these Jesus Freaks. I
                    figure, no need for me to be on the
                    streets no more. So, which room do I
                    take, eh?

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    You stupid motherfucker! I told you,
                    you're on the streets till this is
                    over! Now get the fuck outta here!

          
          A terrified George hustles for the door.

          

                                CONCEZIO (CONT'D)
                    And don't come back here till I tell
                    you to, you fat fucking waste of space!

          
          George trips over his luggage.   The Capos giggle.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM -- EVENING


          
          Cheap, depressing room. Crew Cut, in his underwear, repairs a
          broken rosary chain with string and puts it on.He pulls a shoe box
          from a shopping bag. The brand is "Hushes." Slogan: "Measure up
          to your dreams."

          
          He puts on one shoe. Crew Cut stands before the mirror going up and
          down on the one shoed foot, noting the height that has been added.
          The shoe has been cleverly constructed to disguise the higher heel.

          

          EXT. AUTO BODY -- EVENING


          
          We are out back, among scrap cars. George talks with JO JO RHAMA
          (38yrs). Jo Jo is built like a fire plug and clearly a hoodlum.

          

                                                    49.

          

          

                       JO JO
          A priest.   The sick fuck.

          

                      GEORGE
          And he leaves all of us on the streets
          holding the bag while him and his are
          living it up at the Taj fuckin' Majal,
          not a care in the world.

          

                      JO JO
          So, until the Saints get popped, we're
          all lambs to slaughter?

          

                      GEORGE
          Yeah! And he don't care how many of us
          they wipe out in the meantime!

          

                      JO JO
          What do you need me to do, Skipper?

          

                      GEORGE
          Spread the word to all the brugliones.
          No bullshit. From your mouth to their
          ears.

          

                      JO JO
          Everyone? North and South?   That could
          get a little dicey.

          

                      GEORGE
          Fuck their old grudges. All of them
          are in this, like it or not. Tell them
          everything we discussed.

          

                      JO JO
          Even the panic room thing?

                        GEORGE
          Sure.

          

                      JO JO
          Good. That's a nice ice breaker.
          They'll get a kick outta that. I
          didn't even know those things were
          real. I thought they made that shit up
          for that movie? With that brawd and

          Crew Cut looks through his binoculars as he continues to bounce up
          and down on his special shoe. He smiles at the site of George.

          Eunice finds a baggy with a tiny wooden bead in it. Greenly enters.

                    Rosary bead. They found it pushed into
                    the carpet near the victim. Father
                    McKinney wasn't wearing a rosary so
                    it's probably been there a while.
          Duffy comes in with a stack of papers.   He heaves it down.

                    like Mike Tyson.

          
          Eunice suddenly re-enters the room with emergency.

          Eunice is absorbed a photo on the wall of the priest's hand.

          Crew Cut finishes ritualizing the priest and looks deeply at his
          victim. He removes a glove and places his tiny hand next to
          McKinney's large one. Silent rage. Bare handed, Crew Cut snatches
          the priest's rosary from about his wrist, breaking the bead chain.

          

          INT. MAUSOLEUM -- MORNING


          
          The brothers and Romeo walk through the Mausoleum. They approach a
          grave slate with respect. The name reads, "David Della Rocco."
          There is a picture of him. Murphy narrows his eyes and leans in.

          

                                MURPHY
                    What the...did they use his mug shot?

                    embarrassed cuz the guy had to hold up
                    all his long hair behind his head?

                    Look at that.

          
          We see Murphy's finger denote a bad "airbrush" job.

          

                                MURPHY (CONT'D)
                    That's an arm.

          
          Connor looks close.

                    Oh...that's fuckin' harsh.

          
          The boys look at one another, then bust out laughing.

                    You, sir, are no David Della Rocco.

          
          A sound. Instantly, the boys turn and level weapons. There stands
          ROY (32yrs) thick glasses, geeky. He drops his flowers.

          The Manager lets George slip in. He steels into a tanning room.A
          Mexican towel boy has spied George. He picks up a phone...

          INT. MAUSOLEUM -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Romeo snaps his phone shut and turns to the boys.

          The three walk for the door, leaving Roy behind.

          The brothers and Romeo sneak up to the tanning bed. George sings a
          Sinatra tune as his fat stomach props the cover up like a half open
          clamshell. Suddenly, Murphy leaps up and sits on the cover. George
          is being crushed beneath his weight. Connor kneels.

          The boys pull weapons and throw him against the wall in a Jesus
          Christ pose, pinning his hands with their guns.

                    got the key.

          

                                MURPHY
                    It's down by the docks.   Dead as a
                    doornail at night.

          

                                                                           56.

          

          

                                CONNOR
                    Yeah. You could set off fourth of July
                    fireworks in dat place and nobody would
                    hear. How's Mexican for you, George?

          

                                GEORGE
                    No difference to me. I think I just
                    shit my Speedos, anyway.

          

          INT. EUNICE'S MERCEDES -- NIGHT


          
          Eunice drives.   Her cell rings.   She checks the I.D. then...

          

                                EUNICE
                    How do, David?

          
          Greenly is at his desk.   Alternating coverage.

          

                                GREENLY
                    Hey, DMV came up dry on the partial.
                    INTERpol's still working it. Should
                    only be another couple of hours.

          

                                 EUNICE
                    Lovely.   Anything else?

          

                                GREENLY
                    Yeah. Nothing big. We just dumped a
                    text message from George's cell. Just
                    two words. "El Cava." It's a Mexican
                    joint down by the docks. He sent it to
                    his enforcer, Jo Jo Rhama. Guess
                    gangsters gotta eat too, huh?

          

                                EUNICE
                    I think I'll drop in on their supper,
                    see if I can shake them up a little.

          

                                GREENLY
                    You need a body guard?

          

                                EUNICE
                    No thank you, Mike Tyson.    Bye now.

          

                                GREENLY
                    Bye.

          
          She hangs up and we are left with Greenly.   Red handed.

          

                                GREENLY (CONT'D)
                    Oh, shit.

          

                                                                        57.

          

          

          INT. "EL CAVA," KITCHEN -- LATER


          
          Close up, three shot. George, looking very uncomfortable, is
          flanked by the brothers. He is positioned to covertly view the
          restaurant from the kitchen.

          
          We see NORTHSIDE BRUGLIONEs #1 - #3 and SOUTHSIDE BRUGLIONES #1 and
          #2 are at the bar.

          

                                GEORGE
                    Just two more to go. Uh...You guys are
                    gonna let me go, right?

          

                                MURPHY
                    We'll see, won't we.

          
          George grimaces.   Looks as if he'll cry.

          

                                GEORGE
                    Jesus, this is some embarrassing shit.

          
          We see the three men from behind. George is still in his Speedos,
          which now have a pronounced shit stain in back.

          

          INT. EL CAVA, BAR -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Romeo, frazzled and in a busboy uniform, has got two blenders of
          margaritas going. The Brugliones mow through appetizers.

          
          Northside doesn't interact with Southside and there is an empty bar
          stool between them. N.S. Bruglione #1 slides Romeo a platter.

          

                                N.S. BRUGLIONE #1
                    Yo, spicaroo. More nachos and mas
                    salsa, capisce?

                                S.S. BRUGLIONE #1
                    Hey and I need a refill there, pepe?

          

                                ROMEO
                    Si, muchachos.

          
          SOUTHSIDE BRUGLIONE #3 enters behind everyone.   All suddenly turn,
          going for their guns.

          

                                  S.S. BRUGLIONE #3
                    Whoa!    Easy...Jesus.

          
          Everyone calms. S.S. Bruglione #3 gives a respectful nod to the
          Northside guys but sits with his own.

          

                                                                         58.

          

          

          INT. EL CAVA, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          We do not see George just below frame as the boys are "working on
          him" in some way, putting on finishing touches. Romeo barrels in.

          

                                ROMEO
                    These dagos are getting antsy and I'm
                    getting Spicaroo'd and Pepe'd. The
                    kid's about to go Poncho fucking Villa
                    out there!

          

                                CONNOR
                    Stick it out. Waitin' on one more.

          

          EXT. PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Jo Jo exits his Cadillac and walks toward El Cava.   There is a
          "closed for private function" sign on the door.

          

          INT. JACKED UP SUV, NEARBY -- SAME TIME


          
          Crew Cut watches Jo Jo.   He dials his cell.

          

          INT. GREENHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          From behind we see the Old Man gardening.    He answers a ringing
          phone, nearby. We do not see his face.

          

          INT. SUV -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          The following conversation is in Italian.

          

                                CREW CUT
                    He is not with them.

          

                                OLD MAN
                    Are you certain?

          

                                CREW CUT
                    Yes. It is only the sons. They have a
                    Spaniard with them. They will
                    slaughter everyone.

          

                                OLD MAN
                    Let them. If you kill the sons...the
                    father will come.

          
          Crew Cut develops a sinister smile.

          

          INT. EL CAVA, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Connor watches Jo Jo greet the others.    He turns to Romeo who is
          angrily cooking up a storm.

          

                                                                       59.

          

          

                                CONNOR
                    The gang's all here.

          
          Without missing a beat, Romeo slams the hot pans into a dish sink.
          He stands fuming with his hands on his hips.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Gimme my fucking bee bee gun.

          

                                 MURPHY
                    Naw.   You've earned your stripes, Rome.

          
          Murphy throws him a .9 mm.   Romeo smiles.

          

          INT. BAR -- MOMENTS LATER


          

                                JO JO
                    So....where's Gorgeous?

          
          Suddenly, George comes rolling out of the kitchen, unconscious and
          tied, face down, to a bus cart. There is writing on his back.
          Everyone pulls their weapons and moves toward.

          

                                N.S. BRUGLIONE #2
                    What the fuck is going on, here?

          

                                S.S. BRUGLIONE #2
                    Where's that spic barkeep? Yo, Pepe!
                    Where you at?!

          
          As the gangsters achieve the cart, the brothers creep over the bar
          in the b.g. Brugliones look down on George, painted on his back...

          

                                S.S. BRUGLIONE #3
                    "Erin go brah?" What the hell does
                    that mean?
          Connor and Murphy are standing 25 feet behind them.

          

                                MURPHY
                    It's Irish for "You're fucked."

          
          Hard core music as the Brugliones turn in horror. Everyone begins
          firing and we have slow motion gunplay to pulsating music.

          
          Several are chewed up as chests explode and they are blown into
          George on the cart, knocking it over. George comes to.

          
          Romeo appears and tears in, sending several more crashing into the
          salad bar.

          
          Murphy, while firing, dives back over the bar as bottles explode.
          Connor rapid fires as he dives into a booth.

          

                                                                         60.

          

          
          The boys rise and lay out a second barrage, blasting the rest into
          buffet tables and a soda fountain. The music cuts.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Viva La Mejico, bitches!

          
          George bolts up.    The bus cart is still tied to his fat belly.

          

                                GEORGE
                    Uh, I've seen the light! You guys have
                    really turned me around on this! I'm
                    like born again and shit! I swear!

          

                                MURPHY
                             (to Connor)
                    What do ya think? Let him go?

          
          Connor slips one bullet in a revolver, spins the barrel and snaps it
          shut. He points it to George's forehead. George weeps in earnest.

          

                                CONNOR
                    We'll let God decide if you get a
                    second chance.

          
          He slowly cocks the hammer back, pulls trigger, "click."

          

                                CONNOR (CONT'D)
                    Well, praise the Lord.

          
          The terrified ex-gangster staggers toward an exit while wriggling
          out of his bonds. Just as he touches the door.

          

                                 CONNOR (CONT'D)
                    George?
                             (George turns)
                    All good boys go to heaven.
          George nods and exits. Romeo is confused as our trio gathers.
          Connor tosses the bullet he palmed to Romeo and he nods.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Now, that was, perhaps the finest
                    example of spiritual guidance that I
                    have ever had the good fortune ta
                    witness.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Well, thank you very much.     Mysterious
                    ways. Mysterious ways.

          
          SLO-MO: Suddenly, Eunice bursts through the kitchen door and levels
          her weapon at the brothers and Romeo. Romeo levels back.

          

                                                                      61.

          

          
          Eunice fires as the boys dive on Romeo. Crew Cut is revealed behind
          our trio, firing from the shadows. Eunice and Crew Cut exchange
          fire as the boys reload.

          
          Eunice hits Crew Cut in the side. The assassin has a moment of
          outrage but persists firing as he makes a hasty exit.

          
          In the confusion it is a few moments before anyone realizes he is
          gone. Silence falls. Presently, Romeo and the boys bolt up. Romeo
          goes for the door and the boys level at Eunice.

          

                                CONNOR (CONT'D)
                    Drop the gun! Drop it!

          
          She "places" her gun on a nearby table.

          The boys reholster.    She drops her arms.

                    kind of a retard.

          
          They all laugh, cheers and drink. Conversations buzz all around.
          Eunice chats with the boys as she sips a cosmo.

          She stops at the door and turns.    Her face shows concern.

          INT. GREENHOUSE -- LATER

          Crew Cut lies on the shop table. He's lost a lot of blood and is in
          shock. Using gardening utensils, the Old Man removes the bullet.
          We see his face for the first time. Unremarkable. In Italian...

          

                                CREW CUT

          INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT


          
          The Irish GUN DEALER (30's) from the first film leads the brothers
          and Romeo through a basement to a large, steel vault door.

          

                                                                       71.

                    last. Word got out who may or may not
                    have outfitted ya. Turns out ya got
                    quite the underground followin'.

          
          He swings the vault open. Romeo and the boys stand in angelic light
          at the gates of Heaven. Cheesy music as they enter...

          

          INT. VAULT -- CONTINUOUS


          
          Expanded indeed. Gleaming weapons everywhere. Sheer awe.
          Something catches Romeo's eye and he moves off. To boys...

          

                                GUN DEALER
                    Please, gentlemen. Preferred customers
                    select from my private reserve.

          
          He withdraws two Mahogany boxes.

          

                                GUN DEALER (CONT'D)
                    If I may make a suggestion.

          
          He lifts the lids. In each box is a pair of Desert Eagle .50 cal
          "Black Outs". The triangular barrels have been fitted with matching
          triangular silencers. The boys are mystified.

          

                                MURPHY

                    now.

          
          He pulls a few duffel bags.

          

                                GUN DEALER
                    Full accessory packages.      I'm sure
                    you'll find them useful.

          
          Romeo suddenly appears and slaps down a metal box.

          

                                ROMEO
                    I'll take these.

          
          The boys look to him.    He sniffles.   Red eyes.

          

                                                                       72.

                    Have you been crying again?

          
          Romeo snaps to him, eyes wide in challenge.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Yeah!  Tears of joy!
                              (to Dealer)
                    How much?

          

                                GUN DEALER
                    You guys are on the house.

                             (to Romeo)
                    Let's see.

          
          Romeo withdraws two gold plated .45's, intricately engraved, pearl
          handles with a Mexican flag. The boys snicker.

          

                                 ROMEO
                    What?

                                  MURPHY
                    No.    You just hail from a colorful...

                             (to Dealer)
                    You don't know me. You think these
                    make me look gay?
          Romeo poses.    The Dealer shrugs.

          

                                GUN DEALER
                    You look like you might have seen one
                    up close.

          

          EXT. COMMON HOME -- MORNING


          
          This is a common home at the end of a cul de sac. The Old Man picks
          up the paper on his front stoop and shuts the door.

          
          He opens the paper with shock. A big picture of Crew Cut on the
          front, "SAINTS INNOCENT, NEW SUSPECT IN PRIEST'S MURDER" He reads
          frantically. "New evidence discovered at the crime scene..."

          

                                                                       73.

          

          

                                 OLD MAN
                    Evidence?

          
          He ambles into the house and to a...

          

          INT. BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS


          
          The Old Man moves to Crew Cut's bedside. He sees the rosary about
          the slumbering man's neck and rips it off. Crew Cut bolts awake!

          

                                OLD MAN
                    Foolish, arrogant boy!   What have you
                    done?!

          
          He whips Crew Cut with the rosary, until he cowers in the corner,
          weeping profuse apologies in Italian.

          

          INT. PANIC ROOM -- AFTERNOON


          
          Monitors show angles of the apartment outside. This small space is
          equipped for single living. Yakavetta is frazzled, baggy eyed in a
          robe. Jimmy the Gofer sits quietly as Concezio babbles to himself.

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    That wiley old fox not as clever as we
                    thought. Or maybe he played me from the
                    git. Y-you think he played me?

          

                                JIMMY
                    Uh, Boss. Maybe you aught not to be
                    telling me this stuff. I'm just...

          
          Concezio smacks him across the face.

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    A little sensitivity, huh? You
                    heartless cocksucker! I need to
                    vindicate my feelings here! I can't
                    tell those goombas outside! They'll
                    serve up my balls over a plate of

          With this, the panic room door slides open and Concezio emerges
          holding a bag. He dumps a bunch of cell phones on the coffee table.

          At the hall's opposing end, two maintenance workers move toward.
          Romeo sees and quickly puts his head down. Soon, Romeo and the
          maintenance men converge. They turn, entering opposing elevators.

          As the doors close, Romeo looks into the opposing elevator. The
          maintenance men are Duffy and Greenly, ball caps, duffel bags.

          As the elevator ascends, Romeo swipes off the laundry, pulls the

          A demolished environment. The towering windows are blown out,
          providing a threatening view of the city below. Here, Eunice
          stands, looking out over the panorama.

                    saying that five times fast.

          
          She turns and walks the marble floor which is like a runway, lined
          with pulverized statues. A long table of ravaged food extends.
          Crime scene personnel toil. Ritualized bodies everywhere.   Greenly
          is by the panic room. He pushes the "talk" button.

                    He won't come out.

          
          He joins Dolly and Duffy who stand on the periphery. Eunice is dead
          center, absorbing the scene when suddenly, FBI Agent JOHN KUNTSLER
          barrels in with his G-MEN #1 - #3.

          He holds up his I.D.   A collective groan from crime scene personnel.

          The detectives look to Kuntsler's G-men as if squaring off.

                    to take credit for all your hard work.

          
          He chuckles as all return to work.   Kuntsler turns to Eunice.

          

                                KUNTSLER (CONT'D)

          Kuntsler's shit eating grin disappears.   He leans in.   Hushed tones.

          Dolly, Duffy and Greenly chorus the affirmative. Kuntsler looks
          unsure then phonies up some bravado. Looks around...

                    was broken down. We've got our point
                    of entry. The assailants fired in this

                    gunfire coming from inside the room,
                    the glass would have been blown
                    outward. As you can see, most of it is

                    that called you here like glue. You
                    arm yourselves to the teeth, pick your
                    own crews. These bible banging psychos
                    will make an attempt. It's your job to
                    blow their souless hearts out of their

          They halt before a window washing scaffold.

          Duffy, Greenly and the boys descend the tower. Greenly works the
          controls as Duffy helps the boys tie on harnesses.

          

                                MURPHY

                    It happens ta be a useful thing!

          
          The boys start yelling over each other.   Duffy turns to Connor.

          

                                DUFFY
                    You didn't get this from a movie...did

          Murphy regards his brother, "well?"   Pause.

          INT. JANITOR CLOSET -- SAME TIME


          
          Romeo peeks out a cracked door at a Mafioso guard. LLOYD (33yrs), a
          janitor, gagged and duct taped to a hand truck. He has a shiner.
          Romeo looks through his wallet.

                    O'kay Lloyd Cranston of 135 Liberty
                    Lane, apartment 3C.
                             (shows him wallet pic)
                    Lovely wife and kids. How old are
                    they? Nevermind. Here's the
                    situation, Lloyd. Me and a couple of
                    friends of mine are fittin' to do some
                    killin' here tonight. I'm talking
                    bullets and blood, custom-wholesale
                    slaughter. You following me, Lloyd-O?
                             (Lloyd nods)
                    Good. Now, I've run into a little
                    snag. I need to figure out a tag line.
                    You know, something cool to say when
                    it's all over like..."I'll be back,"
                    but mine, y'know? I need to own this
                    one. I think this'll help me get
                    through the quote, unquote event. I'm
                    going to take your gag off and you and
                    me are going to riff a little, o'kay?
                    Let's have fun with this.

          
          Lloyd nods and Romeo rips off his gag.

                                LLOYD
                    I can't believe you! I'm a fucking
                    janitor. What do I know about bullets
                    and slaughter and shit?

          

                                ROMEO
                    Not riffing, Lloyd! Now, I need an
                    "Hasta La Vista" line, toute fucking
                    suite and you're gonna help me think of
                    one!

          

          EXT. SCAFFOLD -- LATER


          
          Eunice stands alone on the end of the scaffold.

          

                                                                       82.

                    And you can count on it like the U.S.
                    mail. Through rain, sleet, hail or
                    snow...something always seems to go
                    wrong for these poor sons o' guns.

          
          The scaffold suddenly stops.

          

                                CONNOR
                    What the fuck?

                    OH, SHIT!

          
          The boys look over the edge.     Long way down.

          

                                CONNOR

                                CONNOR
                    If we're even a few seconds late,
                    Romeo's dead! We gotta go!
                             (looking up)
                    We're down thirteen stories!

                    Eleven more to go!     Ball park it!

          
          They start counting out lengths of rope by feeding them through
          their hands and extending their arms out to the sides.

          

                                BROTHERS

          Lloyd struggles to think.

          

                                LLOYD
                    Uh..."Take that, suckers!"

                    Uh, "Merry Christmas, mother fuckers!"

                    Hang on, you might be onto something
                    with the buffet thing, like with food,

                    for a minute.

          

          EXT. SCAFFOLD -- SAME TIME

          The boys' ropes are secured and they each pull a Rambo knife.

          Romeo, pushing his cart, jives down the hall toward the guard,
          singing "La Couca Racha." The guard puts out a halting hand.

          Eunice stands before the looming windows.    The immaculate food table
          stretches before her.

          
          She is now in full cowgirl regalia: Leather chaps, rawhide coat,
          boots, cowboy hat and a pair of gleaming six guns on her hips.

          
          With the brim of her hat slung low, Eunice bursts into twirling
          gunplay with her Colts. She spins them all around, flipping them,
          catching them, etc. She holsters and stops.

          First, Connor jumps off, then Murphy.    They fall down and out in

          SLO-MO: Two bullet holes pierce the windows behind Eunice as she
          levels her Colts. The mammoth panes shatter but stay in the frame.

          with the boys' rounds. Some pull weapons.

          

          INT. HALL -- SAME TIME


          
          Romeo pulls his .45's and takes out the guard.   He kicks in the door
          and rushes in...

          

          INT. LUXURY APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          SLO-MO: The brothers smash through the glass.    They fire as they
          swing over Eunice's head.

          
          SLO-MO: Eunice leaps onto the table as the boys cut their ropes in
          mid air with the Rambo knives. The brothers land on their knees.
          Their momentum carries them, sliding on either side of the table.

          
          SLO-MO: Eunice runs along the table top, crushing food and keeping
          pace with the boys as all three let the led out.

          
          SLO-MO:   The gangsters and button men return fire in chaos.

          
          SLO-MO: Gangsters are torn up as they are blown over furniture,
          into walls. Romeo blasts. Slow motion gun battle.

          
          SLO-MO: Yakavetta runs toward his panic room. At the last second,
          Jimmy the Gofer hip-checks him and dives in. The door slides shut.

          
          For a few moments the gun battle rages around Eunice who stands in
          the center rapid firing at the gangsters.

                     Lord, for Thee. Power hath descended
                     forth from Thy hand, that our feet may
                     swiftly carry out Thy command.

                                BOTH (CONT'D)
                     So, we shall flow a river forth to Thee
                     and teeming with souls shall it ever
                     be.

          
          Romeo watches in awe.

          

                                 BOTH (CONT'D)
                     In Nomine Patris, e Filii, e Spiritus
                     Sancti.

          
          Boom.   Concezio drops.   Romeo's been waiting, guns up and...

          

                                 ROMEO
                     "Who ordered the whup ass fajita!?"

          

                                  MURPHY
                     What?

          

                                 CONNOR
                     Whup ass fajita?

          
          The brothers turn to each other.

          

                                 CONNOR AND MURPHY
                     That's fuckin' stupid.

          
          Eunice whistles in sympathy as she lifts her brim with a Colt.

          

                                 EUNICE
                     Hold up, now.

          
          Everything freezes in place.     Eunice shuffles over to Romeo.

          

                                 EUNICE (CONT'D)
                     Was that the best you could do?

                     Ya broke down the door, didn'tcha?

          
          Romeo snaps his head toward the entry with inspiration in his eyes.
          QUICK CUT: He breaks down the door. QUICK CUT: The brothers shoot
          Yakavetta. QUICK CUT: Romeo, guns up and once more with feeling...

          

                                 ROMEO
                     Ding dong, motherfucker, diiiing dong!

          
          The brothers look at Romeo, then to each other.

          

                                                                       87.

          

          

                                 MURPHY
                    Exactly.

          

                                CONNOR
                    You said it.

          

          WHIP PAN...

          

          INT. BACK TO PRESENT, LUXURY APARTMENT -- LATER


          
          Eunice stands before the panic room door.   She is totally
          disheveled. She swipes her hair back.

          

                                EUNICE
                    And that, gentlemen...is the sound of
                    the fat lady singin'.

          
          Everyone stands in shock, Kuntsler, his G-men, the detectives even
          crime scene workers. Greenly whispers to Duffy...

          

                                GREENLY
                    Should we...clap or something?

          

                                 DUFFY
                    Shut up.

          
          Suddenly, the panic room door slides open and Jimmy yanks Eunice
          inside. The door shuts. Everyone rushes toward.

          

                                 KUNTSLER
                    Hey!

          
          Duffy bangs on the door.

          

                                  DUFFY
                    Eunice!    Oh, shit!    Eunice!
          Greenly slams the talk button.

          

                                GREENLY
                    If you hurt her, you piece of shit, I
                    will kill you! Do you fucking hear,
                    me? I'll kill you!

          
          Greenly wheels around, facing Kuntsler.

          

                                GREENLY (CONT'D)
                    Get a hostage negotiator down here and
                    put some stank on it! He could be in
                    there all...touching her and shit!

          

                                                                        88.

          

          

          INT. PANIC ROOM -- CONTINUOUS


          
          Eunice has Jimmy pinned face down to the couch, arm twisted behind.

          

                                 JIMMY
                    I'm sorry!   I'm sorry!   I wasn't gonna
                    hurt you!

                    You bet your ass you weren't.

          

                                JIMMY
                    Just lemme explain. I have
                    information, like pertinent
                    information. Ouch! Look, I was
                    listening to you out there and that's,
                    like, exactly what happened. That's
                    what made me think you were the person
                    to talk to.

          
          Eunice lets him go and stands.   Jimmy sits up.

          

                                EUNICE
                    Yakavetta had a partner, didn't he.

          
          Jimmy looks scared.

          

                                 JIMMY
                    Yeah.

          

                                EUNICE

                                JIMMY
                    Yeah. It was only one time and just
                    for a second but I think I could ID
                    him. I don't know his name, though.
                    Concezio always called him the "Old
                    Man" accept one time when he called him
                    something else, like he fucked up and I
                    wasn't supposed ta hear it.

          

                                EUNICE
                    What was it?

          

                                JIMMY
                    He called him...the Roman.

          

          EXT. LUXURY APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Panic room door opens and Eunice emerges with Jimmy in tow.

          

                                                                       89.

                                EUNICE
                    Easy, David. I'm fine. C'mon gents,

                    problem, now.

          

                                KUNTSLER
                    Hey! What happened in there?      What was
                    said to you, Agent?

          
          Jimmy is cuffed by two uniforms.

          

                                EUNICE
                    You got him in custody. Ask him
                    yourself. You're the professional.

          
          She walks out and the detectives follow.

          

                                DOLLY
                    Yeah, professional moron.

          

          EXT. PRUDENTIAL BUILDING, GROUND PLAZA -- NIGHT


          
          There are coroner vans and moderate police activity here as Eunice
          talks with the detectives who all seem perplexed.

          

                                DUFFY
                    I got no idea. That's just weird. The
                    Roman? What do you think it means?

          

                                EUNICE
                    Feels like our ghost ta me.

                                DOLLY
                    What do we do now? I mean, the
                    brothers ain't goin' nowhere until we
                    get Panza or they do.

          

                                EUNICE
                    We've all had enough excitement for one
                    night. Let's sleep on it.

          

          EXT. ALLEY ACROSS FROM PLAZA -- SAME TIME


          
          Crew Cut watches Eunice and the detectives from the dark alley.    He
          has shaved his head bald, giving him a sinister look.

          

                                                                        90.

          

          

          INT. MCGINTY'S -- LATER


          
          The place is empty except for Connor and Murphy having a celebratory
          shot at the bar and cleaning their weapons.

          

                                MURPHY
                    When's Romeo returnin' to the "hide
                    out?'

          

                                CONNOR
                    Soon as he's done apologizin' to his
                    uncle for wreckin' his restaurant.

          

                                MURPHY
                    And he should be sorry.   The
                    disrespect.

          
          They chuckle as a loud knocking is heard.   As Doc peeps through the
          spy hole and unchains the front doors...

          

                                DOC
                    Hold your damn horses!

          
          He lets Greenly in and locks it behind him. Greenly takes a few
          steps in, stops and grabs his crotch with both hands.

          

                                GREENLY
                    Sack-o-matic, I said!

          
          As the boys guffaw, BOOM! A shotgun blast through the door sends
          Greenly to the floor with a gaping wound in his back.

          
          Crew Cut bursts in with a smoking pig nose shotgun hanging from a
          shoulder strap. He pulls two Sigs and rapid fires at the brothers.

          
          The boys jump over the bar frantically try to reassemble their
          weapons. Connor and Murphy check their clips.

          

                                MURPHY
                    I got nothin'!

          
          Connor racks his .50 cal and looks in the chamber.

          

                                CONNOR
                    One in the hole.

          
          They see a shotgun behind the bar. Murphy grabs it.   Just as they
          are about to stand, they hear Doc cry out.

          

                               DOC
                    Boys!

          

                                                                       91.

          

          
          They stand and level. Crew Cut has Doc from behind, .9mm to his
          temple. Thick accent...

          

                                CREW CUT
                    Put dem down! Throw dem over!

          
          The boys do not flinch. Crew Cut pushes his gun into Doc's temple
          hard. He cries out in pain.

          

                                CREW CUT (CONT'D)
                    Throw dem over!

          
          The boys toss their guns over the bar. Crew Cut levels toward them,
          holding Doc in place. He whispers in Doc's ear.

          

                                CREW CUT (CONT'D)
                    Brothers, eh? Which one first?      This
                    one?
                             (re: Murphy)
                    Dee other, eh?

          
          He cocks back his hammer. A silence POP! rings out from the
          shadows. Crew Cut's hand is hit. He drops, crying out in pain.

          
          SLO-MO: Poppa M emerges from the shadows and moves to Crew Cut with
          a smoking, silenced Walther pistol in hand.

          
          The brothers have just a moment of shock before Greenly chokes up
          some blood. They jump the bar and rush to him.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Jesus Christ!

          

                                 CONNOR
                    Doc!   Call da fuckin' ambulance!
          As they hold Greenly and beg him to hold on, we move to Poppa M
          standing over Crew Cut. Crew Cut looks up at him in awe.

          

                                CREW CUT
                    You.

          

                                POPPA M
                    Where is the Old Man?

          

                                CREW CUT
                    Never.

          
          Poppa M pulls two .38 revolvers. He snaps the rotary chambers out,
          puts one bullet in each gun, spins the chambers and snaps them shut.
          He holds them out to Crew Cut. The boys weep, oblivious to this.

          

                                                                         92.

          

          

                                MURPHY
                    Just hold on.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Hang in there, brother.     They're
                    comin'.

          
          Greenly struggles to speak.

          

                                GREENLY
                    Naw, boys...it's over. Don't
                    worry...proudest day of my life.

          
          He seizes violently and dies. The brothers are in anguish. Crew
          Cut picks a .38 and stands. He and Poppa M level to each other's
          foreheads. Crew Cut is excited. Poppa M is calm, tranquil. The
          brothers bolt up in shock.

          

                                  BROTHERS
                    Da!

          

                                  POPPA M
                    Easy, boys.

          
          The boys watch in horror, trying to figure it out. Poppa M motions
          for his opponent to go first. Crew Cut cocks his hammer back with a
          "click." The brother's eyes go wide.

          

                                MURPHY
                    What the fuck's he doin'?

          
          Crew Cut pulls the trigger, "click!"

          

                                BROTHERS

                    JESUS CHRIST!
          Connor rushes over and grabs up the shotgun.

          

                                CONNOR
                    I'm gonna blow this mother fucker's
                    brains out, right now!

          
          He cocks it and levels to Crew Cut's head.

          

                                  POPPA M

                    CONNOR!

          
          Connor stops.   Poppa M holds out his free hand.   Halt.

          

                                POPPA M (CONT'D)
                    Son...Daddy's workin'.

          
          Connor lowers the gun.    Poppa M pulls back the hammer, "click."

          

                                                                           93.

          

          

                                 POPPA M (CONT'D)
                     Where is he?

          
          Crew Cut is unsure of himself. He thinks. Shakes his head.       The
          brothers focus on Poppa M's gun as he tenses on the trigger.

          

                                  CONNOR AND MURPHY

                                (WHISPER)
                     Come on.

          
          Crew Cut clenches up, bracing for impact. Poppa M pulls, "click."
          The brothers drop to their knees and pray hard. Crew Cut recovers.
          He smiles, pulls back the hammer. In Italian...

          

                                 CREW CUT
                     Make me famous.

          
          "Click!"   Crew Cut's eyes widen in fear.

          

                                  POPPA M
                                (pulling back hammer)
                     Where?

          
          The brothers pray faster as Crew Cut thinks in horror.

          

                                   CREW CUT

                     FUCK YOU!!!

          
          BOOM!   Crew Cut falls dead.

          

          INT. UNCLE CESAR'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- LATER


          
          The boys sit at the kitchen table with Poppa M.      Romeo is propped up
          on a counter, nearby. Cesar sets out coffee.

          

                                 POPPA M
                     I'm so sorry, boys.      This is all my
                     fault.

          
          Cesar takes Romeo and leaves, giving them some privacy.

          

                                 MURPHY
                     What are ya talkin' about, Da?

          
          Poppa M strokes the faded "butterfly" tattoo on the back of his
          hand. Presently...

          

                                 POPPA M
                     I was an immigrant to the U.S. in 1958.
                     I was sixteen. I came to New York
                     where my father, Jacob MacManus, was a
                     cobbler.

                                 (MORE)

          

                                                                       94.

                                POPPA M (CONT'D)
                    Had a little shop and I was to learn
                    the family business. Mafia was
                    everywhere in those days.

          

          INT. FLASHBACK, COBBLER SHOP -- DAY


          
          Italian THUGS #1-4 talk to JACOB MacManus (43yrs). In these
          flashbacks we will refer to young Poppa M as "Noah." NOAH (16)
          works in back but watches.

          

                                POPPA M V.O.
                    Simple extortion...protection money.
                    But your grandfather was proud.

          

                                JACOB
                    I can't help ya with dat, lads. Ya got
                    problems with your shoes, I'd be happy
                    to have a look, got fair prices.

          

                                POPPA M V.O.
                    I just...watched.

          
          Noah stands shaking as he watches his father beat to death. We fade
          into later as he holds his father's body, wailing. An Italian kid
          with a leg brace, LOUIE (18yrs), staggers in and hobbles to Noah.

          

                                LOUIE
                    Il ochio de dio! We gotta call the
                    polizia, Noah! We gotta call somebody!

          

          EXT. FUNERAL -- MORNING


          
          Noah, Louie and a priest are the only ones present at this modest
          affair. Louie weeps. Noah is emotionless.

          

                                POPPA M V.O.
                    I buried my father, then I buried the
                    men who killed him. Louie, my best
                    friend, helped me...

          

          INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT


          
          Noah holds a knife to Thug #1's throat at a card table. He has THUG
          #2's head pinned to the table top with a .38 cal. Nearby, Louie
          holds a large .44 magnum with shaking hands. Seated Thugs #3 and #4
          hands raised, are scared as they look at Noah's dead eyes.

          

                                THUG #3
                    Come on, kid. It was an accident.
                    We can work dis out. Whatever you want.

          

                                                                         95.

          

          

                                THUG #4
                    He ain't gonna do shit.
                             (to Thug #3)
                    I'll take two.

          

                                THUG #3
                    What da fuck's da matter with you?
                    Can't you see...

          

                                THUG #4
                    I see just fine. Deal.

          

                                THUG #1
                             (in Italian, to Louie)
                    You're Italian, kid. Help us out here.
                    Put one in the back of his head and you
                    get anything you want!

          

                                LOUIE
                    I, I, I...am his friend.

          

                                THUG #4
                    Fuck him and fuck his friend. Deal the
                    cards! He ain't got the balls.

          
          Noah shoots Thug #2 then cuts Thug #1's throat. The other Mafiosi
          scream in horror. Louie kneels and weeps. Noah shoots Thug #3 in
          the heart and calmly takes aim at Thug #4. He shoots him in the
          throat and he is blown to the floor, grasping his bleeding neck.

          
          Noah rounds the table and takes aim. The man is choking on his own
          blood. Noah slowly lowers his gun and just watches.

          

          INT. COBBLER SHOP -- AFTERNOON


          
          Louie works on a pair of shoes.   They are both a bit older.

                                POPPA M V.O.
                    It started out slowly. Just the ones
                    who were a threat to us.

          
          MAFIOSO #1 and #2 talk to the stoic Noah.

          

                                MAFIOSO #1
                    Come on, kid. It's good for you, good
                    for us. We'll move it right out the
                    back of the place.

          

                                MAFIOSO #2
                    It'll never touch you. You got the
                    word of the Bonnavese family on that.

          
          No response from Noah.   Dead eyes.

          

                                                                           96.

          

          

                                MAFIOSO #1
                    What's da matter with you, eh?

          
          We see Louie peeking through the curtains.

          

                                LOUIE

                             (WHISPERING)
                    Easy, Noah...easy friend.

          

                                MAFIOSO #2
                    What are you, stupid or something?

          
          He smacks Noah across the face.

          

                                                          CUT TO:

          

          EXT. WOODS -- NIGHT


          
          Noah and Louie bury the bodies of Mafioso #1 and #2.      Louie stops
          and rests. He watches Noah and thinks.

          

          INT. COBBLER SHOP -- DAY


          
          "CLOSED" sign in the door.   Noah and Louie eat sandwiches.

          

                                POPPA M
                    Then one day...

          

                                LOUIE
                    Why should we not help others who
                    suffer these Mafia thugs?

          
          Noah puts down his sandwich. Louie talks to Noah with passion,
          m.o.s. and he listens while nodding his head.

          

                                POPPA M V.O.
                    Then it began.

          
          Over dialogue and music we see the following images...

          
          Noah cuts out a chalk sketch on a large sheet of shoe leather.

          
          Louie helps Noah make a "serious looking" leather vest.

          
          Louie hobbles in with a sack.   He dumps a bevy of handguns on a
          table. All different makes.

          

                                POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
                    Louie would pick the marks and plan
                    everything in detail.

          
          Louie draws a map on a note pad and speaks m.o.s.

          

                                                                       97.

          

          
          Holsters and bullet belts are sewn into the vest.

          
          Noah loads the vest with guns as Louie tightens the buckles, stands
          back and looks Noah over. Ominous.

          

                                POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
                    And I would go in and do the jobs.

          
          A mob boss and two body guards wait for an elevator. The doors
          open. Insides is Noah, dark jacket, English Mac (hat). He opens
          his coat, revealing the vest. He draws two weapons, executes them
          all and calmly hits a button. The doors close.

          

                                POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
                    I would execute, over and over again,
                    those who had taken my father from me.

          
          We do a montage of Noah killing Mafiosi in many different ways.

          

                                POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
                    So it went for years.

          

          EXT. BACK TO PRESENT, KITCHEN -- LATER


          
          We pan to the gaping mouthed brothers.

          

                                  MURPHY
                    Jesus.

                    So...how'd ya end up inside, Da?

          

                                POPPA M
                    Back in '75, I did a hit, came out and
                    the police were waitin' for me. He set
                    me up, 25 to life.

                                MURPHY
                    Wait...why did he set you up?

          

                                POPPA M
                    Can't wait ta ask him.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Why didn't ya flip on him? Cut down
                    yer time? The guy fucked ya.

          

                                  POPPA M
                    I couldn't.

          

                                CONNOR

                      He'd learned of the birth of my sons.

          
          Connor and Murphy hang their heads.      Connor looks up.

          

                                  CONNOR
                      Do you know Louie's full name?

          

                                  POPPA M
                      Aye.

          
          The boys look at each other.

          

          EXT. SIDE WALK OUTSIDE MCGINTY'S -- SAME TIME


          
          Greenly's bagged body is about to be loaded into an ambulance.
          Eunice stops the EMTs, unzips it and touches his face. She weeps
          and then crushes into Dolly's chest.

          
          He holds her and cries too as Duffy watches in anguish. Eunice's
          cell rings. She ignores it and Dolly pulls it from her pocket and
          tosses it to Duffy, never letting go of Eunice.

          

                                  DUFFY
                      Hello.

          Connor hands the phone to Poppa M.      DISSOLVE TO...

          

          INT. POLICE STATION -- LATER


          
          Eyes still red from crying, Eunice covertly works at a computer.
          She types. Soon a picture of the Roman comes on up. Eunice looks
          at his face with trepidation and then...

          

                                  EUNICE

                                                                           99.

          

          
          We drift by a poker game and young Italian thugs, betting horses and
          sports. T.V.s and smoke are abundant.

          
          The phone is set on a back table. PATRONAZZI (75yrs), an ancient
          Italian man drinking espresso picks up.

          

                                  PATRONAZZI
                    Si.

                    Many years.    Are you in need?

          

                                OLD MAN
                    Yes. I am making marinara and alas, I
                    have run out of tomatoes. To help an
                    old friend...how many can you spare?

          
          Patronazzi looks up.    Slowly, many of the young thugs turn.

          

                                PATRONAZZI
                    I am in good supply of tomatoes.

          

          INT. UNCLE CESAR'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT


          
          The boys slumber. We push in on their staggered profiles.       They
          simultaneously take a deep breath. FLASH TO WHITE...

          

          INT. DREAM SEQUENCE, FENWAY PARK -- DAY


          
          The boys stand in a huge cement access corridor of Fenway Park.        It
          is empty and quiet as a church. A man walks toward them. They
          struggle to see. Presently, we reveal ROCCO. He passes them.

          

                                   ROCCO
                    Come on.     The game's starting.

          
          The brothers follow him.    Red Sox emblems are abundant.

          

                                ROCCO (CONT'D)
                    Funny thing about the Red Sox. We
                    never gave up hope, y'know? It's what
                    kept us going all those years. And
                    they did it. They finally fuckin' did
                    it. What are we all gonna do now, huh?

          
          They emerge into the stands.    Perfect baseball field, empty park.

          

                                                                       100.

          

          

                                ROCCO (CONT'D)
                    I lost a lot of money on 'em. But I
                    gotta admit. Always felt
                    better...betting the underdogs.

          
          Rocco walks on.   The boys follow.

          

          EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          The boys stand on the mound.   Rocco walks a circle around it.

          

                                ROCCO
                    So, how's things going?

          
          The boys drop their heads.

          

                                ROCCO (CONT'D)
                    Yeah. I know. It's rough having your
                    faith shaken.

          
          The brothers have a pained expression.

          

                                ROCCO (CONT'D)
                    But it happens to all of us.

                             (BEAT)
                    You know what's always tripped me out?
                    How hundreds of years ago, a bunch of
                    desperate gamblers in leaky ass ships,
                    crossed the ocean blue. They had no
                    clue what was on the other side of it.
                    Took real balls. But they sailed into
                    infinity and made it all the way to the
                    shores of the New fucking World...
                             (re: surroundings)
                    ...and all they had was their faith.
                    I'm always surprised how so many people
                    miss the simple fact that faith...is
                    the reason all of us are even here.
                    You can't underestimate the power of
                    it. Shit, you were the ones that
                    taught me that.

          
          Rocco looks to his left and right.   Secretly.

          

                                ROCCO (CONT'D)
                    Listen, your my boys so I'm gonna give
                    you some inside. The Sox are gonna do
                    it again this year. The line in Vegas
                    is huge. Put everything you got on it.

          
          The boys look to each other.   Eyes wide.

          

                                                                       101.

                                CONNOR
                    You're sure, Roc? You know this?

          
          Rocco smiles.

          

                                  ROCCO
                    No...I   just have faith. And for a
                    second   there, you almost did too.
                    Y'see,   it's contagious. And if enough
                    people   catch it...look out, baby.

          
          A roaring cheer arises, shaking the very foundations of the arena.
          The boys turn in awe. The stands are still empty.

          She is overcome and weeps.   Poppa M holds her.

          Poppa M, the brothers and Romeo walk kneel at the altar before a
          memorial to McKinney: Candles, pictures, cards, flowers etc.

          
          As they pray, a dozen or so church patrons who are in the pews begin
          to realize who they are. Our foursome stands and walks back down
          the aisle. They make eye contact with a few people.

          
          When the Saints are gone, the churchgoers gather in the aisle and
          stare at the front door in disbelief. Excited whisperings. One guy
          opens his cell phone. Then he thinks...and closes it.

          The Roman's common, two story home looms in the b.g. at the end of a
          cul-de-sac. Walking down the middle of the street, is Poppa M:
          black trench, hat, dark shades. He opens the door and enters the...

          

          INT. COMMON HOME -- CONTINUOUS


          
          Poppa M listens, far off scratchy music. He moves quietly through
          the house, stopping at the foot of the stairs...listens. He removes
          his rosary, hangs it on the banister and moves on, pulling a weapon.

          

          INT. GREENHOUSE -- SAME TIME


          
          The Roman, swirls a tomato in a plate of salt and bites into it.
          Beside him, a horned phonograph plays 40's Jazz. Behind him, we see
          that the greenhouse is merely an extension of the home.

          
          The Roman sits in front of a sunken fire pit at a low flame. Across
          the pit, an empty chair. Extended before him is a stunning garden,
          standing in stark contrast to the common house: vines, flowers,
          cobblestone walks, fountains. The center piece is a Turkish pool
          with pure white Lillys afloat.
          Poppa M slowly approaches the Roman from behind. He holsters his
          weapon and sits. The Roman halts the phonograph.

          

                                POPPA M
                    Hello, Louie.

          The Roman smiles and gestures the surroundings.

          The Roman flicks a photo over. It lands in Poppa M's lap.    It is
          the picture we saw earlier. A woman holding two babies.

          Poppa "M" stands, throwing open his trench and revealing his leather
          vest, a six gun rig in the front. The Roman in awe.

          
          The double doors crash in and men barrel through as Poppa M turns,
          pulls two weapons and fires upon them, hitting one.

          
          The boys crash through the glass ceiling of the greenhouse on either
          side of Poppa M. They fire as they fall, hit the ground and roll.

          
          Romeo bursts into the fray from inside the house, blasting away with
          his gold .45's, a shotgun hanging on his back.

          
          The garden is being torn apart as the brothers, Poppa M and Romeo
          hit their marks and the hit squad returns fire. The boys dive
          behind fountains which are then pulverized.

          
          The gun battle rages around the Roman who remains seated in the very
          mouth of madness. His heart breaks as his sanctuary is shredded.

          
          Romeo fires as a large rack of wine behind him is torn apart.

          
          Murphy fires over a statue and bodies crash into the pool.

          
          Connor stands, firing in a Jesus Christ pose.

          
          Poppa M drops his empty weapons and pulls two more, laying down a
          second barrage.

          
          Romeo is simultaneously hit in the leg and shoulder. He falls,
          dropping his .45s. He struggles to fire the shotgun.

          
          Poppa M takes one in the chest.

          
          Connor is wounded in the shoulder but continues firing.

          
          Murphy is hit in the leg but continues firing.
          The boys and Romeo manage to take out the last of the Thugs, who are
          blasted into the Turkish pool. It is over. The music fades...

          They get him to his feet. Poppa M turns to the Roman. He levels a
          revolver toward the seated man. With his last bit of strength...

          

                                 POPPA M (CONT'D)
                     I'll see you in a minute, Louie.

          
          Poppa M fires one right between the Roman's eyes.    Poppa M crumbles.
          His sons lay him down.

          Poppa M smiles as he looks up at the sun through the blown out glass
          ceiling. A plume of butterflies escape.

          

                                 POPPA M
                     It's a beautiful day.

                     Aye.    It is...it is, Da.

          
          He dies. The brothers weep. Nearby, Romeo is slumped and bleeding,
          on the edge of consciousness. A strange calm comes over the
          brothers as they stand and look to one another.

          
          S.W.A.T. can be heard surrounding the perimeter. The boys look to
          Romeo. He smiles at them and nods. The brothers turn and walk into
          the house. The echoed voice of Poppa M.

                       The young men, who's names Police are

                       utter a word since their capture. Even

          Five guests, BALLPLAYER, COMEDIAN, ACTOR, POLITICIAN and a HOST are
          seated in the midst of an "audience in the round." The format is
          similar to "Politically Incorrect."

          

                                   BALLPLAYER
                       It doesn't change anything. What they
                       did is still more important. It's
                       still the issue.

          

                                                                       111.

                                POLITICIAN
                    They deserve the death penalty.

          
          Arguments erupt.

          

          INT. PRISON HOSPITAL -- DAY


          
          The arguments are heard as the boys awaken in their hospital beds at
          the same moment.

          

                                PRIEST V.O.
                    Only God can judge!

          

                                ACTOR V.O.
                    Oh, save it for group, father!

          
          They are bandaged and hooked to machinery.

          

                                BALLPLAYER
                    Well, I know this! They certainly
                    don't belong in prison.

          
          The boys turn and look out the windows at a group of cons in the
          yard, staring up at them.

          

                                HOST V.O.
                    Oh, I don't know.

          
          Connor and Murphy's faces split with evil grins.   They mimic guns at
          the cons and gesture as if shooting them.

          

                                HOST V.O. (CONT'D)
                    Maybe that's just the place for them.

          EXT JERSEY CITY- DAY
          
          Dec 21st. Clear sky, snow on the ground. Cold as fuck. With
          the sounds of laughter and music, we MOVE IN ON:
          
          
          INT NEWSPAPER OFFICE- DAY
          
          An office Xmas party in progress, not a pretty sight: tipsy
          receptionists laugh and spill drinks on the rug, red-faced
          reporters loosen their belts and burp cocktail weiners...
          
          MOVING QUICKLY THROUGH THE PARTY TO AN OPEN OFFICE DOOR.
          Arriving just in time for the door to SLAM in our face.
          
          
          INT OFFICE- DAY
          
          A woman stomps back over to her desk and picks up her pen.
          MEET CASSIDY DALEY (dirty blond, striking, manic energy). Ink-
          stained fingers, notepads in every pocket: Cass doesn't have
          time for office parties, she's working.
          
          Her door cracks open and STEWART (almost as good looking as
          he thinks he is) appears, holding a Kahlua bottle.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm working, Stewart.
          
                              STEWART
                    Come on, take a break. (enticing)
                    I've got Kahlua...
          
          Cass picks up a stapler and LAUNCHES it at Stewart's head.
          Stewart DUCKS OUT just in time. The phone rings. Answering:
          
                              CASS
                    Cassidy Daley. Talk to me.
          
                              JIMMY (O.S.)
                    It's Jimmy. Tell me you love me.
          
                              CASS
                    Depends on what you got.
          
                              JIMMY (O.S.)
                    I've got a confirmed place and
                    time.
          
          Cass is on her feet, excited.
          
                              CASS
                    I love you! So, when? Where?
          
                                                                   2.
          
          
                              JIMMY (O.S.)
                    You think I'm gonna say this shit
                    over the phone? I could get killed.
                    Just meet me at the usual place.
                    Oh, and Cass? This one's gonna cost
                    an extra hundred.
          
          CLICK. He hangs up. Cass drops the phone, grabs her stuff.
          
          
          INT NEWSPAPER OFFICE- DAY
          
          Cass races for the elevator, Stewart hot on her heels:
          
                              STEWART
                    Where ya going?
          
                              CASS
                    Hooters. I go there for the hot
                    wings.
          
                              STEWART
                    Please. Nobody goes there for the
                    hot wings. You got a tip.
          
                              CASS
                    You got a hundred bucks on you?
          
          Stewart considers this, then hands her 5 20's.
          
                              STEWART
                    Now are you gonna let me in on it?
          
                               CASS
                    Sorry. No can do. I have to protect
                    my source.
          
                              STEWART
                    You know what? We need to talk
                    about our relationship.
          
                              CASS
                    We don't have a relationship. We
                    made out 3 years ago in the copy
                    room. I was drunk. I was broken-
                    hearted. I would have made out with
                    the xerox machine.
          
                              STEWART
                    Yes, but you made out with me.
          
                              CASS
                    I have to go.
          
                                                                   3.
          
          
          She exits. He shouts after her:
          
                              STEWART
                    I want in on that story!

          Cass driving like a maniac, doing the one thing she loves:
          TRACKING A STORY...
          
          
          EXT DUNKING DONUTS PARKING LOT- DAY
          
          MOVING IN ON- A BEAT-UP HONDA CIVIC (JIMMY'S CAR) IN THE BACK
          CORNER OF THE LOT...
          
          INT JIMMY'S CAR- DAY
          
          JIMMY (20's, goatee, Mets baseball hat, nervous) sits in his
          car, rolling a cigarette while he waits for Cass.
          
          Jimmy puts the cigarette in his mouth and pulls out a
          lighter. Just as he flips the lighter open, HIS FRONT
          WINDSHIELD EXPLODES. A MAN HOLDING A TIRE IRON (MAHLER,
          heavyset, crew-cut, rarely speaks, all business) reaches
          through the broken window, AND DRAGS JIMMY OUT OF THE CAR...
          
          
          EXT DUNKING DONUTS PARKING LOT- DAY
          
          Cass drives into the lot and pulls up next to Jimmy's car.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey, Jimmy, I...
          
          She realizes he is not in the car. THEN SHE SEES THE BROKEN
          GLASS ALL OVER THE DRIVER'S SEAT.
          
                                 CASS
                    Jimmy?
          
          SCREECHING TIRES behind her. Cass glances up and sees JIMMY'S
          BASEBALL HAT IN THE BACK WINDOW OF A GREY CHEVY. The Chevy is
          racing out into traffic. Cass throws her car into reverse...
          
          
          INT CASS' CAR- DAY
          
          Cass tries to follow the grey Chevy, but GETS STUCK AT A RED
          LIGHT. Shit. She looks around, decides fuck it, and HITS THE
          GAS. Her car leaps into the intersection. SIRENS.
          
                                                                   4.
          
          
          Cass looks into her rearview mirror: A PATROL CAR IS RIGHT
          BEHIND HER, signalling for her to pull over. Up ahead, the
          Chevy is getting away.
          
          Cass debates: pull over? Or follow the story? No contest. SHE
          SLAMS ON THE GAS AND HER CAR SURGES OUT OF FRAME...
          
          
          EXT STREET- DAY
          
          Cass' car SPEEDS down the street, A COP CAR IN CLOSE
          PURSUIT...
          
          
          INT CASS' CAR- DAY
          
          Cass is losing sight of the Chevy. She races around traffic
          and is suddenly HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE SIDE OF A MOVING VAN.
          She panics, WRENCHING the wheel to the right...
          
          
          EXT STREET- DAY
          
          CASS' CAR JUMPS THE CURB, CROSSES A LAWN, AND SKIDS TO A HALT
          ON THE FRONT STEPS OF A CHURCH. THE COP CAR RACES UP AND
          BLOCKS HER IN.
          
          
          EXT CHURCH- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Cass is out of her car now, arguing with a cop who has her by
          the arm:
          
                              CASS
                    Let go of me, I'm a reporter, I'm
                    warning you...
          
          The cop pulls her towards his squad car. Cass leans over and
          SINKS HER TEETH INTO THE COP'S HAND. The cop screams.
          
          FREEZE FRAME.

          hair, head tilted coyly, smile that says "I'm on top of the
          world. Beneath the photo, the byline: "CASSIDY DALEY".
          
          Someone whistles "We Wish You a Merry Xmas" as a MARKER
          improves on the photo: MOUSTACHE, BUCK-TEETH, PIMPLES. Then a
          MATCH enters frame, and SETS THE PHOTO ON FIRE.

          Holding the flaming photo, MEET MILO: rumpled shirt, messy
          hair, looks like he slept on the floor. The bartender
          (CRYSTAL, 50's, Eastern European) scowls at him:
          
                              CRYSTAL
                    What did I say about the fires?
          
                              MILO
                    You said "please set fires in my
                    bar". Wait, no, that's not right.
                    "Please don't set fires in my bar".
                    (off her look) Ok, jeez, you try to
                    get in the holiday spirit...
          
          He drops the flaming photo to the floor, pours his drink on
          it, then GRINDS IT TO PIECES WITH HIS SHOE.
          
                              CRYSTAL
                    Shouldn't you be working?

                    That's the beauty of my job,
                    Crystal. Tracking down idiots is
                    something you can do pretty much
                    anywhere. See, there's one...
          
          He points to A DRUNK DRAPED OVER THE JUKEBOX, MOURNFULLY
          SINGING ALONG TO CHRISTINA AQUILLERA'S "I AM BEAUTIFUL".
          
                              MILO
                    And there's another one...
          
          Pointing to A WOMAN TRYING TO RIP A PAY PHONE FROM THE WALL.
          
                              MILO
                    And there's...
          
          Glances at the TV, which is showing LIVE FOOTAGE OF AN XMAS
          PARADE. Looks closer, recognizes someone, groans:
          
                              MILO
                    I don't believe it. That idiot. (to
                    Crystal) Save my seat.
          
          Tosses back his drink and SPLITS.

          He takes a last bite then tosses the sandwich and pulls away
          from the curb, tailing the Cadillac.
          
          
          EXT JERSEY CITY- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          MOVE IN ON- the parade we just saw on TV. Baton twirlers in
          Santa Hats. Men dressed like reindeer, pulling a sleigh. A
          boys choir singing "Joy to the World", the kids dressed like
          orphans that escaped a Broadway musical.
          
          A beautiful scene, if you like that sort of thing.
          
          RACK TO- the Cadillac, half a block away, cruising sideways
          into a spot just beneath a "TEMPORARY TOW-AWAY" sign. MILO
          climbs out of the car. Shoves his way through the crowd to
          the curb, cracking open a can of Pabst.
          
          Milo does not like this sort of thing. He scans the crowd
          impatiently.
          
          Meanwhile, THE CAR THAT WAS FOLLOWING HIM parks half a block
          away. DWIGHT emerges and heads for:
          
          MILO, who has just found what he's looking for. The reindeer
          are passing him and he makes eye contact with RUDOLPH, who
          does a double-take.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah, you. Rudolph. Come here, you
                    fucking ding-dong.
          
          Milo takes a step towards Rudolph and DWIGHT APPEARS IN
          MILO'S PATH, BLOCKING HIM.
          
                              DWIGHT
                    We have to stop meeting this way.
          
                                                                      7.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Not now, Dwight.
          
                              DWIGHT
                    You owe my boss money.
          
                              MILO
                        (LAUGHING)
                    Hey, I owe everybody money.
          
          Suddenly, DWIGHT PUNCHES MILO IN THE GUT. Milo doubles-up,
          gasping, then BRINGS HIS HEAD UP QUICK, CATCHING DWIGHT ON
          THE CHIN. Dwight goes flying sideways and MEETS A POLICE
          BARRIER FACE-FIRST. Ouch.
          
          The barrier tips over, knocking over the one next to it. THE
          REST GO LIKE DOMINOS. Milo turns to see that RUDOLPH HAS
          DISAPPEARED. Then he catches sight of the ANTLERS, working
          their way through the crowd. Milo lunges after him and
          Rudolph drags other reindeer with him as he tries to avoid
          Milo. THE SLEIGH FLIPS. Santa tumbles from the sled. PACKAGES
          RAIN DOWN ON REINDEER LIKE SHRAPNEL.
          
          All of a sudden, IT'S THE XMAS FROM HELL: BLOODY REINDEER
          STUMBLING AROUND, SANTA UNCONSCIOUS IN THE GUTTER, KIDS
          SCREAMING, PARENTS PANICKING. Meanwhile, MILO IS GAINING ON
          RUDOLPH, who picks up one of the packages and throws it. IT
          CRACKS MILO IN THE HEAD. Just what Milo has been waiting for:
          
                              MILO
                        (BEAMING)
                    I am so happy you did that.
          
          Milo TACKLES RUDOLPH TO THE GROUND. Around them, people
          scream and scatter. One boy bursts into tears:
          
                              BOY
                    That man is killing Rudolph!
          
          SIRENS. Uh-oh. Cops SWARM the scene, surrounding Milo and
          Rudolph, GUNS DRAWN. The LEAD COP (GELMAN, short, over-
          zealous) steps forward:
          
                              GELMAN
                    Release the reindeer!
          
          Release the reindeer? Milo looks around. He's got 8 or so
          guns pointed his way and Rudolph gasping at his feet. MILO
          STARTS TO LAUGH. Gelman bristles:
          
                              GELMAN
                    Hands behind your head, asshole!
          
                                                                     8.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Take it easy, skippy, I'm just
                    doing my job.
          
          Milo flashes his ID. Gelman inspects it, rolls his eyes.
          
                              GELMAN
                    Bounty hunter. Figures. Why don't
                    you get a real job?
          
                              MILO
                    So I can be like you patrol boys
                    and sit around all day with my
                    thumb up my ass?
          
          Gelman turns bright red.
          
                              GELMAN
                    What did you just say?
          
          Suddenly, a sergeant (BOBBY, late 30's, obnoxious but
          likeable, Milo's ex-partner) marches onto the scene, takes
          one look at Milo and laughs.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Milo Boyd. I shoulda known.
          
                              GELMAN
                    Sarg, you know this asshole?
          
                              BOBBY
                    Yeah. I know this asshole. Guy used
                    to be one of us.

          EXT STREET- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Milo drags Rudolph through the crowd towards his car. Bobby
          follows, shaking his head, bemused expression on his face.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Look, Milo, I know this is a tough
                    time of year for you...
          
                              MILO
                    This isn't a tough time of year for
                    me. It's Christmas. Who doesn't
                    love Christmas?
          
                              BOBBY
                    ...and I try to be sensitive to
                    your situation...
          
                                                                    9.
          
          
                              MILO
                    What situation? Being a man who
                    works his own hours and has his
                    freedom and lives the high life?
          
                              BOBBY
                    ...because I realize you're
                    unhappy.
          
                              MILO
                    Unhappy? Are you kidding me, Bob?
                    Look at me: I'm the happiest man
                    alive.
          
          Just then, they come to where Milo left his car. IT'S GONE.
          Bobby squints at the huge "TOW-AWAY" sign:
          
                              BOBBY
                    That sign is pretty hard to see.
          
          And with that, Milo loses it:
          
                              MILO
                    AAAHHH!
          
          He rips the sign off the pole. Stomps on it. Kicks it. Tries
          to shred it with his teeth. Hmm. He doesn't really seem like
          the happiest man alive. Rudolph, to Bobby:
          
                              RUDOLPH
                    Take me to jail. Please?
          
          
          INT BOBBY'S CAR- EARLY EVENING
          
          Bobby's car is decorated with photos of his many children,
          all of whom look exactly like him, even the girls, poor kids.
          
          Milo's in front by Bobby, Rudolph's handcuffed in the back.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Ok, I got one for ya: why doesn't
                    Santa have any children? Cause he
                    only comes once a year and when he
                    does, it's down a chimney.
          
          Rudolph snickers. Milo does not. Bobby glances at Milo.
          
                              BOBBY
                    So. Have you talked to her lately?
          
                              MILO
                    Talked to who?
          
                                                                  10.

                    you think?
          
                              MILO
                    I haven't talked to her in three
                    years, why would I talk to her now?
          
                              BOBBY
                    Well, for one thing, so you can
                    stop taking out your rage on
                    innocent bystanders.

                        (piping up from the back)
                    Talk to her, man. For real.
          
          Milo reaches back, gags Rudolph with his own scarf.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Do what you want. But this kind of
                    shit will eat a hole in your
                    intestines, you don't deal with it.

          They pull up. Milo exits the car, pulls Rudolph from the
          back. Bobby leans out.
          
                              BOBBY

                    bash?

                    I'm not invited. I'm not a cop
                    anymore, remember?
          
                              BOBBY
                    Fuck that, I'm inviting you.

                              BOBBY
                    That's what I'm worried about.
                    (sighing) Just...take it easy, Ok?
          
          Bobby really seems worried, but Milo waves him off. Bobby
          drives over, parks by other cop cars. Gets out, mingles with
          some cops. Laughter, inside jokes. Milo watches from afar.
          
                                                                   11.

          sorta tight, Milo's best friend) peers down at us:

                    You're drooling on my sofa.
          
          Milo unsticks his face from the leather couch, wobbles
          upright. Are the walls throbbing, or is it just him?

          Swearing under his breath, Sid is trying to stuff a Xmas tree
          into the back of a station wagon. At least half of the tree
          is hanging out of the back. Milo drinks a beer and watches.
          
                                                                 12.

                              MILO
                    Is that a trick question?
          
          Sid glares at him. Milo sighs, puts down his beer, and grabs
          part of the tree.
          
                              SID
                    So I told her, fine, I'd handle
                    Xmas this year. I mean, what's to
                    handle? You buy a tree, some gifts,
                    cook a ham, hang some lights. An
                    idiot could do it.

                    put your fist through a wall?
          
                                 MILO
                    Jealous?
          
          The tree is definitely not going to fit. They let it go, and
          Sid pulls out a small hand saw.
          
                              SID
                    Then forget it.

                    I've got an open bond, but your
                    thing sounds like more fun. I'll
                    give it to Doug instead.
          
          Sid starts hacking away at the tree.
          
                                                                 13.

                    Whoa. Hold up, Heidi. What the
                    fuck. I want the job, I'm in the

                        (SIGHING)
                    The truth is, I'm not sure you're
                    the right person for this job. It
                    could be a total disaster. On the
                    other hand, when one friend sees
                    another friend stagnating in his
                    own filth, he has to do something,
                    right?
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. I just woke up. I was gonna
                    shower.
          
          Sid drops the saw. With one final shove, the tree is in.
          Phew. Sid slams the back shut.
          
                              SID
                    Ok. But remember: you asked for it.
          
          He reaches into his pocket and extracts A FOLDED PIECE OF
          PAPER. Hands it to Milo. Milo unfolds it, gives it a quick
          look. A second look. A third.
          
          TIME STOPS. THE WHOLE STREET GOES SILENT.
          
                              MILO

                    I'm gonna have to kill you.
          
                              SID
                    It's not a joke.
          
                              MILO
                    She got arrested? And then she
                    jumped bail?
          
                              SID
                    Apparently the whole thing started
                    with some reckless driving, and
                    ended with her assaulting a police
                    officer.
          
          Milo gives him a questioning look.
          
                              SID

          Milo snorts.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah. That sounds like her.
                    But here's my question: why the
                    hell did you post her bail?
          
                              SID

                              MILO
                    No, not "whatever". I dumped her.
          
                              SID
                    The point is, I'm aware you guys
                    have issues, but I'm running a
                    business here. A person needs bail,
                    I don't have time to check with you
                    first.
          
                              MILO
                    Well, had you checked with me
                    first, you wouldn't be out of a
                    bond right now.

                    pick her up. It's five grand to
                    bring her back by 9am, Xmas day.

                    to go pick up my ex-wife and bring
                    her to jail. (beat) On Xmas.

                    You're a good listener.
          
          Milo takes a deep, calming breath. Then he EXPLODES into
          whoops and hollers. He throws himself into a snow bank and
          thrashes around. He does a Fred Astaire around a lamp post.
          
                              SID
                    I take it you're interested.
          
          Milo grabs Sid and pulls him into a crushing bear hug.
          
                              MILO
                    I love you! You're the best friend
                    a guy could ever have!

                    Ok, take it easy...
          
          TERESA (mid 40's, overly made-up, popping gum) pokes her head
          out the front door:
          
                              TERESA
                    Sid, you got a DUI on line one.
                    (off their looks) What's going on?
          
          Milo drops Sid, grabs Teresa, and gives HER A LONG, INTENSE
          KISS. He releases her. She stumbles back a bit.
          
                              TERESA
                    Ok. (beat) Can I have my gum back?
          
                              MILO
                    Right. Sorry.
          
          He reaches into his mouth, extracts her gum and hands it to
          her. She retreats back inside. Milo beams at Sid.
          
                              MILO
                    You know what this is, don't you?
                    Karma! Payback! You know how they
                    say "What goes around comes

          Sid shakes his head.

                    I can't believe you guys broke up
                    over a stupid article.
          
                              MILO
                    We didn't break up over a stupid
                    article. We broke up because she is
                    a cheating, manipulative liar.
          
                              SID
                    Are you sure you can handle this?
          
                              MILO
                    Why wouldn't I be able to handle
                    this?
          
                              SID
                    Let's face it: you're not exactly
                    rational around her. I mean, if I
                    was a cop working a case and some
                    reporter came snooping around, I'd
                    say "no comment". Not "no comment,
                    but care for a cocktail"? And then
                    a month later, running off to some
                    love shack called "Caveman's Cabin"
                    and tying the knot? Who does that?
          
                              MILO
                    That's not even close to what
                    happened. For one thing, it was
                    called "Cupid's Cabin". And for
                    another, that was before I knew how
                    conniving she was. Now I know. So
                    all I have to do is track her down,
                    cuff her up, and bring her in.
                    (checking his watch) And I've got,
                    what, two days? Shit, man. Easy as
                    pie.

          for them to pass, when her phone rings.
          
          She checks it ("PAY PHONE") and answers:
          
                                CASS
                    Jimmy?
          
          SPLIT-SCREEN
          
          Nope, NOT JIMMY. Milo doesn't speak. Cass listens for a
          moment. She can hear breathing. What the fuck? An evil grin
          crosses Milo's face. Cass goes pale.
          
          Milo takes a step forward. Cass takes a step back. Milo
          LUNGES and CASS DROPS HER PHONE AND BOLTS OUT OF FRAME.

          Milo smirks at the receiver.
          
                                                                   19.

          Sid shuts his door, then speaks into his phone, low:
          
                              SID
                    Yeah. He took the job. But if this
                    thing goes bad, I'm blaming you.
          
          He hangs up.
          
          
          EXT STREET- DAY
          
          Milo sips from a coffee cup and watches:
          
          MILO'S POV- THE FRONT DOOR OF A FANCY BROWNSTONE. A woman
          with a toy poodle emerges from the building, struggling with
          the heavy door..
          
          
          EXT BROWNSTONE- DAY
          
          Milo appears next to the woman and holds the door for her:
          
                              MILO
                    Nice dog. Very compact.
          
          The woman exits and Milo enters.

          Milo stops in front of 303, and knocks on the door.
          
                                 MILO

          No answer. Milo glances around, then works the lock...
          
          
          INT APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- CONTINUOUS
          
          Milo slips inside, pulling the door shut behind him. It's
          dark and quiet. He glides through the room, scoping it out.
          The place is huge, white rug and couch, flat screen TV.
          
          And lining the bookshelves are FRAMED ARTICLES, AWARDS,
          PHOTOS OF CASS WITH VARIOUS PUBLIC FIGURES: the home of a
          successful and dedicated journalist.
          
                                                                    20.
          
          
          Milo is halfway across the room when he realizes he has left
          a set of MUDDY PRINTS across the formerly pristine white rug.
          
                              MILO
                    Whoops.
          
          
          EXT APARTMENT/BACK DOOR- DAY
          
          Cass enters frame. Nervous looks all around as she tries the
          knob. Surprise: THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN. She hesitates.
          
          
          INT APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- DAY
          
          NOW THERE ARE FOOTPRINTS CRISS-CROSSING THE FLOOR, RUNNING UP
          OVER THE COUCH, ETC. Looks like Milo had a little field day
          here. He is taking a closer look at the shelves: no photos of
          a boyfriend, family, pets: IT'S ALL WORK.
          
          He picks up one of the framed articles with the headline
          "LOCAL REPORTER WINS AWARD FOR BREAKING UP 13TH STREET DRUG
          RING". There's a photo of CASS SHAKING HANDS WITH THE AN
          IMPORTANT-LOOKING OFFICIAL.
          
          Milo's face clouds over.

          Cass slips inside and the door swings shut behind her with a
          soft CLICK.
          
          
          INT APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- DAY
          
          Milo's head whips around. SOMEONE'S IN THE KITCHEN. Big grin
          as he replaces the frame and draws his gun. A couple careful
          steps across the room and a floorboard CREAKS.
          
          
          INT APARTMENT/KITCHEN- SIMULTANEOUS
          
          Cass startles. SOMEONE'S IN THE LIVING-ROOM. Grabs a heavy
          saucepan off the stove. Grips it like a weapon, soft-foots it
          towards the hallway...
          
          
          INT APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- DAY
          
          Milo reaches the hallway entrance. Positions himself up
          against the wall, waiting...
          
                                                                    21.

          Milo holds his breath. A SHADOWY FIGURE STEPS INTO THE ROOM.
          Milo puts his gun to their head:
          
                              MILO
                    `Allo, love.

          THE PAN CONNECTS SOLIDLY WITH A CAT. Cat goes flying, bounces
          off wall, lands on the coffee table, fangs bared.
          
                              CASS
                    Whoops.

                    ever gets out of jail, I'm sure
                    you'll be very happy together.

                    Hello, Cass.
          
                              CASS
                    Hello, Milo.
          
          A MILLION DIFFERENT EMOTIONS CROSS CASS' FACE. Surprise,
          anger, anxiousness. All the mixed emotions you have when you
          suddenly run into THE MAN WHO BROKE YOUR HEART.
          
                              MILO
                    Fancy meeting you here.
          
                              CASS
                    Yeah. Fancy that.
          
          Strange, charged moment as they look at each other. Then they
          have a casual contest:
          
                                                               32.
          
          
                              MILO
                    How are you?
          
                                 CASS
                    Fine. You?
          
                              MILO
                    Swell. Nice day.
          
                                 CASS
                    Bright.
          
                                 MILO
                    Brisk.
          
                                 CASS
                    Crisp.
          
                              MILO
                    Invigorating.
          
                              CASS
                        (can't hold out anymore)
                    What are you doing here?
          
          Milo smirks.
          
                              MILO
                    "Building a sand castle, drinking
                    from a coconut". Man, once a liar,
                    always a liar.
          
          Cass immediately stands.
          
                              CASS
                    You know what? I don't have time
                    for this, I'm working.
          
          She grabs her stuff. Milo blocks her with his leg.
          
                              MILO
                    Working? Hey, me too.
          
                              CASS
                    Congratulations. Move your leg.
          
          Milo doesn't budge. Spelling it out for her:
          
                              MILO
                    What I do is, I track down
                    criminals. People who jumped bail.
                    Idiots who decided to go on the run
                    after biting police officers. I
                    find them, and I take them to jail.
          
                                                                  33.
          
          
          Cass stares at him, eyes wide:
          
                              CASS
                    Now, hold on just a second, Milo...
          
                              MILO
                    Tell you what: I'll give you more
                    than a second. I'll give you 10.
                    For old times sake.
          
          Milo moves his leg, kicks back, starts to count.
          
                              MILO
                    10...9...8...
          
          Cass stares at him, her jaw working, trying to decide what to
          do. Then, all of a sudden, she BOLTS. Milo smiles. THE
          LOUDSPEAKERS ANNOUNCE: "AND THEY'RE OFF!"
          
          
          EXT RACETRACK PARKING LOT- AFTERNOON
          
          Cass jumps into her car and turns the key. NOTHING. She tries
          again, then hears soft laughter. MILO IS SEVERAL YARDS AWAY,
          HER BATTERY IN HIS HAND.
          
                              MILO
                    Strike one.
          
          Cass leaps from the car and runs.
          
          
          INT STADIUM- AFTERNOON
          
          Cass runs for the elevator. It opens and people exit,
          REVEALING MILO:
          
                              MILO
                    Strike two.
          
          Cass turns heel and bolts.
          
          
          EXT STADIUM- AFTERNOON
          
          Cass races out, flagging a taxi. Milo pulls up:
          
                              MILO
                    Strike three. Get in.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm not going to jail, Milo.
          
                                                                     34.
          
          
                              MILO
                    I beg to differ.
          
          She heads for the cabs. Milo exits his car, GUN IN HAND.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh please. Like you're gonna shoot
                    me.
          
                              MILO
                    Nope. (loudly) I'm gonna shoot a
                    cab driver.
          
          Head whip around in his direction. THEN EVERY CAB IN THE
          PLACE GOES OFF-DUTY. Cass stomps her foot, furious.
          
                              CASS
                    Chicken shits.
          
          Cass marches back over to Milo.
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, look: let's talk about this.
          
                               MILO
                    Ok.
          
          With that, Milo sweeps her up into his arms. AND THEY FIND
          THEMSELVES FACE TO FACE. BREATHING ON EACH OTHER. THEIR LIPS
          INCHES APART.
          
          Cass stares at Milo. Is he gonna kiss her? Again, she feels
          weird. Confused.
          
                              CASS
                        (UNCOMFORTABLE)
                    Listen, Milo, I'm not sure we
                    should...
          
          Suddenly, MILO DUMPS HER IN THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey, wait a minute!
          
          He smiles at her, waves, then SLAMS down the lid.
          
          CUT TO BLACK. Well, now she knows exactly how she feels:
          FURIOUS:
          
                               CASS (O.S.)
                    Bastard.
          
          CHIRON: "2:00 PM. ROUTE 9 NORTH. 43 HOURS TO GO".
          
                                                                 35.
          
          
          And immediately: A PHONE RINGS.
          
                              CASS (O.S.)
                    Great. Perfect timing.
          
          A match is struck, illuminating the trunk as Cass scrambles
          for her phone. Trying to sound professional:
          
                              CASS
                    Cassidy Daley.

          CLOSE ON- JIMMY, head tilted back, tense smile on his face.
          PULL BACK a little to reveal the GUN MAHLER IS HOLDING UNDER
          HIS CHIN.
          
                              JIMMY
                    It's me. Jimmy.
          
                              CASS
                        (exhaling with relief)
                    Shit, Jimmy, I thought you were
                    dead.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Don't be silly. (hurrying on)
                    Listen: you didn't happen to go to
                    my place and find that envelope I
                    left, did you?
          
                              CASS
                    I did, but I don't really get it,
                    what's "Sparrow"?
          
                              JIMMY
                    It doesn't matter. Did you tell
                    anyone else about this story?
          
                              CASS
                    Are you kidding? You think I want
                    to share a story like this?
          
                              JIMMY
                    Ok. Good. Cause the truth is, there
                    is no story. I made the whole thing
                    up. So you should just drop it...
          
                              CASS
                    Uh-uh, no way are you backing out
                    on me now, Jimmy. This story is way
                    too good...
          
                                                                 36.

                        (QUICKLY)
                    Where are you?
          
                              CASS
                    I'm at the Atlantic City Boardwalk.
                    Actually, I'm in the trunk of my ex-
                    husband's car. Long story. More
                    importantly, where are you?
          
                                 JIMMY
                    I'm...
          
          CLICK. MAHLER DISCONNECTS THE PHONE.
          
          ON CASS- she stares at her phone. Uh-oh:
          
                              CASS
                    Jimmy? Hello?
          
          Suddenly, MUSIC KICKS IN and we hear MILO SINGING AT THE TOP
          OF HIS LUNGS:
          
                              MILO (O.S.)

                    Ok, just tell him I got her and
                    I'll be back in 2 hours. I want a
                    bonus for bringing her in so quick.

                    Yeah? I want a bonus for getting
                    through the holidays without
                    stabbing anyone with a fork.

                    Don't be such a pessimist. You
                    still have time.
          
          His phone beeps. IT'S CASS CALLING FROM THE TRUNK.
          
                              MILO
                    Gotta go. I got another call.
          
          He clicks over.

                    You're disgusting. Let me out of
                    the trunk.
          
                              MILO
                    Hmm. Nope. By the way, your
                    boyfriend Stewart's been following
                    me. Unfortunately, I had to ditch
                    him at the track.
          
                              CASS
                    Why is Stewart..? (realizing) And
                    wait: who said he's my boyfriend?
          
                              MILO
                    Aw, don't be embarrassed. These
                    things happen. You were drunk when
                    you guys hooked up, right?
          
          Cass turns bright red. She was drunk when they hooked up.
          Changing tactics, she tries to flatter him:
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
                              CASS
                    You know what, Milo? I shouldn't
                    have run from you like that. I
                    was...I don't know. You caught me
                    off-guard. The truth is, I'm kind
                    of in some trouble and I could
                    really use your help.
          
                              MILO
                    Bad news for you, then. I wouldn't
                    help you if you were the very last
                    baby sea turtle in the world,
                    dragging its tiny weak body across
                    the burning hot sand while sea
                    gulls circled overhead. I'd just
                    pull up a chair, sip a pina colada,
                    and let nature take its course.
          
          Long beat. Suddenly, CASS STARTS TO SOB. LOUD, HYSTERICAL
          SOBS. Milo listens for a moment, out of a purely clinical
          interest, then:
          
                              MILO
                    Hey, I used to be a sucker, but no
                    more. You can cry til the cows come
                    home, for all I care.
          
          Cass instantly stops crying and slams her phone shut.
          
          CUT TO BLACK. Then, the sound of a trunk opening, and WE ARE
          INSIDE A CAR TRUNK, LOOKING UP AT: MAHLER.
          
          
          EXT TRUMP CASINO PARKING LOT- AFTERNOON
          
          Mahler reaches into his trunk and REMOVES HIS HANDGUN. Checks
          the cartridge, pockets the gun. Slams the trunk shut.
          
          He climbs into his front seat, and as he pulls out of the
          lot, we see CASS' NEWSPAPER PHOTO THAT HAS BEEN RIPPED FROM
          THE PAPER, on the passenger seat.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          Milo drives along happily humming when, suddenly, A SMALL
          TRAIL OF SMOKE drifts over his shoulder. What the hell...? He
          glances into the rearview mirror and:
          
          SMOKE IS POURING OUT OF THE TRUNK!
          
                              MILO
                    Holy shit! (calling out) Hey, um,
                    Cass? (no response) Cassidy?
          
                                                                  39.
          
          
          Still nothing. Milo jerks the car to the right, and SLAMS on
          the brakes.
          
          
          EXT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          The car screeches to a halt on the embankment. Milo leaps out
          of the driver's door and races to back, fumbling with his
          keys. SMOKE CONTINUES TO POUR OUT OF THE TRUNK.
          
                              MILO
                    It's Ok, hang on, I'm coming...
          
          Gets the key in, pops the lid and sees: CASS, HANDKERCHIEF
          OVER HER NOSE, PACK OF FLAMING MATCHES IN HAND. Cass tosses
          the matches and handkerchief, AND PUNCHES MILO IN THE BALLS.
          
          Milo groans and crumbles to the ground. Cass jumps out of the
          trunk and stands over him:
          
                              CASS
                    You know something, Milo? You're
                    one of the most gullible...
          
          BAM, Milo grabs her ankle and JERKS and Cass hits the ground.
          Next thing you know, IT'S WWF TIME, THE TWO OF THEM ROLLING
          IN THE DIRT.
          
          Milo gets her pinned, but Cass grabs his ear and TWISTS:
          
                                 MILO
                    AAAAHHH...
          
          He pulls her arm behind her back...
          
                              CASS
                    Ow ow ow...
          
          ...and she jerks her head back, SMACKING him in the nose.
          
                              MILO
                    Son of a...
          
          He gets her in a BEAR HUG...
          
                                 CASS
                    AAGH...
          
          ...and she BITES him.
          
                                 MILO
                    OW...
          
                                                                  40.
          
          
          Finally, he has her on her back, TRAPPED. He gets his face
          right over hers and STARTS TO LET A GLOB OF SALIVA FALL FROM
          HIS MOUTH TOWARDS HER FACE.
          
                              CASS
                    NOOOO! Uncle, uncle, uncle!
          
          Milo collapses onto the ground next to her, laughing. She
          looks at him and she starts laughing too.
          
                              CASS
                    Dirty fighter.
          
                              MILO
                    Me? I'm the dirty fighter?
          
          They both laugh harder. Then Milo stands and offers her a
          hand. She takes it, and he helps her up. Awkward pause as
          they look at each other.
          
                               CASS
                    Should we...I don't know...hug, or
                    something?
          
                              MILO
                    Sure. What the hell.
          
          He opens his arms. She moves closer. They hug. Milo feels her
          hands moving towards the gun in his belt. He smirks. CLICK.
          HE SNAPS SOME HANDCUFFS ONTO HER WRISTS.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey. I had to try, right?
          
                              MILO
                    Get in the car.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          They are driving along, both a little dishevelled, ONE OF
          CASS' HANDS CUFFED TO THE PASSENGER DOOR. They pass casinos
          as they head out of Atlantic City.
          
                              CASS
                    Your windshield's cracked.
          
                              MILO
                    Thanks, Captain Obvious.
          
          Cass turns to inspect him more closely.
          
                                                                  41.
          
          
                               CASS
                    And you look like shit, Milo. What
                    have you been doing, sleeping on
                    the floor?
          
          Milo has been sleeping on the floor.
          
                              MILO
                    I enjoy sleeping on the floor.
                    Matter of fact, I love sleeping on
                    the floor. I love everything about
                    my life. Great job, good friends,
                    hot girlfriend...
          
                              CASS
                    You have a girlfriend?
          
                              MILO
                        (he does not)
                    Yes I do.
          
          Cass is skeptical:
          
                              CASS
                    Really? What's her name?
          
                              MILO
                        (the first name that pops
                         into his head:)
                    Teresa. Rocking hot body. Likes to
                    cook pasta for me and perform strip-
                    teases.
          
                              CASS
                    Wow. Is she missing a chromosome?
          
                              MILO
                    Oh, she has all her chromosomes,
                    believe you me.
          
          Cass thinks this over, then counters:
          
                              CASS
                    Well, my life is great, too.
          
                              MILO
                    I can tell. You and Stewart make a
                    great couple, by the way. You and
                    me made a terrible couple. But you
                    two? Like peas in a pod.
          
          About to deny that she and Stewart are a couple, it occurs to
          Cass: Milo seems a little JEALOUS. She jumps on this:
          
                                                                  42.
          
          
                              CASS
                    You know what I like about Stewart?
          
                              MILO
                    I can't imagine.
          
                              CASS
                    He's not you.
          
                              MILO
                    Not even on his best day.
          
                              CASS
                    Or his worst.
          
                              MILO
                    I'll bet he has a lot of those.
          
                              CASS
                    Still betting, huh?
          
                              MILO
                    You can't win if you don't play.
          
                              CASS
                    Or, in your case, even if you do.
          
          He shoots her a sharp look. She stares back, waiting.
          
                              MILO
                    I win all the time.
          
                              CASS
                    Really? I hadn't noticed.
          
          Ok. That is definitely a challenge.
          
                              MILO
                    You know what? Seeing as how I'm
                    about to come into five grand...
          
          Milo makes a SUDDEN TURN OFF THE HIGHWAY and pulls into the
          parking lot of BALLY'S CASINO.
          
                               MILO
                    I think I'll do a little betting
                    right now.
          
                              CASS
                    Don't you have to take me back?
          
                              MILO
                    Please. I have two days. A monkey
                    could get you back in two days.
          
                                                                 43.
          
          
          Again: famous last words. Milo exits the car. Cass smiles to
          herself. This is obviously what she hoped would happen. She
          glances around, spots THE DUFFLE in the back seat. PEEKING
          OUT OF THE TOP OF THE DUFFLE IS THE TASER GUN. Hmm...
          
          
          EXT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          Milo opens her door.
          
                              CASS
                    Aren't you afraid I'll get away?
          
                                 MILO
                    Nope.
          
          He uncuffs her from the door, CUFFS HER TO HIS OWN WRIST.
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- AFTERNOON
          
          Stewart is heading back to the city, cursing his bad luck,
          when he happens to glance over and see MILO AND CASS HEADING
          INTO BALLY'S CASINO.
          
                              STEWART
                    Damn, I'm good!
          
          He makes a quick turn off the highway and into the Bally's
          parking lot.
          
          
          INT BALLY'S CASINO- AFTERNOON
          
          The clerk at the chips cage recognizes Milo as he and Cass
          APPROACH:
          
                              CLERK
                    Merry Xmas, Mr Boyd!
          
          Behind the clerk, a FEMALE CLERK perks up at this name...
          
                              CLERK
                    What a nice surprise! Let's hope
                    your luck is better today.
          
          Milo glances at Cass.
          
                              MILO
                        (QUICKLY)

                    better than great, which is how my
                    luck has been lately. Great.

          Lorraine on the phone, listening intently. Then she hangs up,

                    The idiot just showed up at
                    Bally's.
          
                               DWIGHT
                        (QUICKLY)
                    I'm on it.
          
                              LORRAINE
                    Uh-uh. Not you. (calling out) RAY.
          
          RAY appears next to her.
          
                              LORRAINE
                    Go get this asshole.
          
          Ray cracks his knuckles, smirks at Dwight, and exits.
          
          
          INT BALLY'S BLACKJACK TABLE- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Milo sits at a blackjack table, pulling Cass into a seat next
          to him.
          
                              MILO
                    Prepare to observe the master.
          
          He bets while Cass sits next to him, scheming:
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, how about this:
          
          She uses her free hand to pull out her wallet:
          
                              CASS
                    If I give you all the cash in my
                    wallet, will you let me go?
          
                              MILO
                    Hmm. Lemme see...
          
                                                                 45.
          
          
          He takes the cash from her and thinks for a moment.
          
                              MILO
                    Nope. Guess not.
          
          Milo adds her cash to his bet on the table.
          
                              MILO
                        (to the dealer)
                    Hit me.
          
                              CASS
                    I'd really like to.
          
          The dealer deals the cards.
          
                              DEALER
                    Dealer wins.
          
                              CASS
                    Nice going, master.
          
          Milo quickly lays out some more money. A WAITRESS (smells
          like an ashtray) appears:
          
                              WAITRESS
                    And for the couple over here?
          
                              MILO
                        (QUICKLY)
                    We're not a couple.
          
                              CASS
                        (just as quick)
                    Why would you think we were a
                    couple?
          
                              MILO
                    We used to be together. Back when I
                    was young and foolish.
          
                              CASS
                    And I was confused.
          
                              MILO
                    And I was slumming.
          
                              CASS
                    And I was drunk.
          
          The waitress looks back and forth between them.
          
                                                                 46.
          
          
                              WAITRESS
                        (BORED)
                    Great story. I have to get back to
                    work now.
          
                              MILO
                    Wait. Champagne! I'm celebrating.
          
          The waitress rolls her eyes and leaves. Milo turns to see he
          has lost more money.
          
                              MILO
                        (under his breath)
                    Son of a bitch.
          
          Ok. Cass has had enough of this. She leans closer:
          
                              CASS
                    Look, Milo, the truth is...my Mom
                    is in the hospital.
          
          Milo perks up.
          
                              MILO
                    Oh? Old Lois not feeling up to par?
          
                              CASS
                    She might be really sick. That's
                    why I had to jump bail.
          
                              MILO
                        (overly sincere)
                    Taking care of her, huh? Putting
                    aside your career for a loved one?
                    Golly, that's so you.
          
          "Golly"? Cass stares at him, realizing:
          
                              CASS
                    You've already been to see her.
          
                              MILO
                    Impressive. No wonder you got all
                    those awards. So lemme guess: the
                    real reason you jumped bail is
                    cause you're on a story.
          
          Cass narrows her eyes:
          
                              CASS
                    Stewart. Stewart told you.
          
                                                                 47.
          
          
                              MILO
                        (CAUGHT)
                    I would have figured it out on my
                    own, trust me.
          
                              CASS
                    I wouldn't trust you if you were
                    the last man alive.
          
                              MILO
                    You think about that much? Me being
                    the last man alive? Am I naked in
                    this fantasy?
          
          Cass takes a deep breath. This is getting her nowhere. But
          she is clearly hesitant to give him the real story.
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, you're right. I'm on a story.
                    A very important story. It just so
                    happens that I'm possibly about to
                    uncover a whole ring of dirty cops.
          
          Milo snorts.
          
                                CASS
                    What?
          
                              MILO
                    Please. Isn't the whole "dirty cop"
                    thing kind of old? Maybe you should
                    do a story about something people
                    are interested in. Like internet
                    porn. Or lesbians.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm serious, Milo. This is gonna be
                    big. And here's what I'm willing to
                    do (magnanimous): I'm willing to
                    credit you in the article.
          
                              MILO
                    Oh, sure, like you credited me in
                    the 13th Street Article?
          
          Cass stares at him.
          
                              CASS
                    Why on earth would I have credited
                    you? I worked my ass off for that
                    story.
          
                              MILO
                    That's one way of putting it.
          
                                                                48.
          
          
                              CASS
                    What's that supposed to mean?
          
                              MILO
                    Forget it. I don't want to be in
                    your article. In fact, I would
                    rather eat a bowl of broken glass
                    than have my name in any way
                    associated with one of your lousy
                    articles...
          
                              CASS
                    Fine. Forget I mentioned it.
          
                              MILO
                    I already have.
          
                              CASS
                    I mean, you're not a cop anymore,
                    right? What do you care if people
                    were murdered?
          
                              MILO
                    Please. Nobody was murdered.
          
                              CASS
                    Just my source.
          
                              MILO
                        (SUSPICIOUS)
                    Oh yeah? How? Bullet to the back of
                    the head?
          
                              CASS
                    Well...
          
                              MILO
                    Dumped in a reservoir?
          
                              CASS
                        (FLUSTERED)
                    I don't know.
          
                              MILO
                    Car accident?
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, ok, maybe he wasn't murdered
                    yet. But I wouldn't be surprised
                    if...
          
          Milo breaks out into loud guffaws. Cass is furious.
          
                                                                   49.
          
          
                              CASS
                    Maybe this whole thing sounds like
                    no big deal to you...
          
                              MILO
                    You know what it sounds like? It
                    sounds like you're going to jail.
          
          Cass can't believe this.
          
                              CASS
                    Milo, listen, you have to believe
                    me, come on, you know me...
          
                              MILO
                        (getting red)
                    Exactly! I do know you. Which means
                    I know you are a deceptive, cold-
                    hearted bitch who is going to jail
                    where she belongs.
          
          Wow. That was pretty harsh. Cass looks at him, stunned. They
          stare at each other in silence.
          
          The waitress arrives with the drinks:
          
                              WAITRESS
                    Champagne. So. What are we
                    celebrating?
          
                              CASS
                        (GRIMLY)
                    I have to use the bathroom.
          
                              WAITRESS
                    Alrightee, then. Cheers.
          
          
          EXT BALLY'S CASINO PARKING LOT- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Stewart taps his steering wheel restlessly, watching the door
          of the casino for signs of Cass and Milo. Waiting in this
          parking lot is boring. Finally, he exits his car. Sidles over
          to Milo's car. Checks the door handle.
          
          IT'S UNLOCKED. Stewart glances around, then climbs in.
          
          
          INT BALLY'S CASINO BATHROOM- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Cass enters and Milo follows:
          
                              CASS
                    Can I have some privacy, please?
          
                                                                  50.
          
          
          Milo checks the room. Looks like there is no escape from
          here. He UNCUFFS HER, but then:
          
                              MILO
                    I'm gonna have to frisk you.
          
                              CASS
                    Get it over with, then.
          
          Milo checks her pockets. Her ankles. Her legs. He goes behind
          her and checks her shoulders. Her back. He reaches around and
          checks her belly.
          
                              MILO
                    You gain a little weight?
          
                              CASS
                        (snapping back)
                    You lose a little hair?
          
          Milo reaches higher and:
          
                              CASS
                    Yeah. Right. I'm hiding a weapon in
                    my breasts.
          
          Milo backs off, turning red.
          
                              MILO
                    Make it quick.
          
          He exits. As soon as he is gone, CASS PULLS MILO'S TASER GUN
          FROM HER CLEAVAGE.

          Stewart is rummaging around inside Milo's car when he looks
          up and sees: RAY, standing there, smiling at him.
          
                              STEWART
                    Shit, man, you startled me. (beat)
                    Can I help you?
          
                              RAY
                    Night-night.
          
          Suddenly, Ray GRABS STEWART'S HEAD AND SMASHES IT INTO THE
          STEERING WHEEL, KNOCKING HIM OUT COLD.
          
          
          EXT CASINO BATHROOM- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Milo checks his watch, then raps on the door.
          
                                                                    51.
          
          
                              MILO

          Cass squints at the taser gun, trying to read the tiny
          instruction label on the side:
          
                              CASS
                    "Put open end in direct contact
                    with skin. Press button..."
          
                              MILO (O.S.)
                    Hello? Ok, that's long enough, I'm
                    coming in...
          
          He comes in and SHE JAMS THE TASER GUN INTO HIS NECK AND HITS
          THE BUTTON. HE SCREAMS AND HITS THE FLOOR. SHE SCREAMS, DROPS
          THE TASER GUN, AND FLEES.
          
          
          EXT CASINO- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          CASS RUNS OUT, BANGS INTO SOMEONE...
          
                               CASS
                    Sorry...
          
          ...and keeps going. She hurries to the curb and tries to flag
          down a ride.
          
          RACK TO- SEVERAL YARDS AWAY, THE PERSON SHE BUMPED INTO IS
          STARING AFTER HER. IT'S MAHLER. Mahler compares her to the
          newspaper photo he is holding. Yup: THAT'S HER.
          
          Cass glances around, keeping an eye out for Milo, and SPOTS
          MAHLER STARING AT HER. Suddenly, he starts heading towards
          her. Cass backs up slightly, nervous. WHO IS THAT GUY?
          
                              VOICE
                    Need a lift?
          
          Cass looks around. A trucker has pulled up next to her.
          Relieved, she quickly climbs on board.
          
          RACK TO- MAHLER, WATCHING THE TRUCK PULL AWAY. He doesn't
          seem worried. He turns and heads for his car.
          
          
          INT TRUCK- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Cass is fixing her hair, pulling herself together.
          
                                                                  52.
          
          
                              CASS
                    He says we made a terrible couple.
                    Which is true. I know that. I'm the
                    one who thought that first. I'm the
                    one who came up with that. The fact
                    is, I don't want to be with someone
                    who can't admit he was wrong.
          
                              DRIVER
                    So you're available.
          
          Cass looks at him. He smiles coyly.
          
                              CASS
                    Available for what?
          
                              DRIVER
                    I have a waterbed in my trailer.
          
                              CASS
                    I hope you don't think you're
                    telling me something that interests
                    me.
          
                              DRIVER
                    You know what I want for Xmas?
          
          The driver mouths something at her we can't see. Cass leans
          over and SMACKS HIM AS HARD AS SHE CAN.
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          The truck SCREECHES to a halt by the side of the road. Cass
          gets booted out the passenger door. The door is slammed shut
          behind her. Cass gives the guy the finger as he drives off.
          
          She turns to see a car headed her way. She starts flagging it
          down. But wait... Yup, IT'S MILO. Shit. She looks around, but
          where's she gonna go? Meanwhile, as Milo nears, HE SEEMS TO
          BE SPEEDING UP. Cass stares. He keeps coming, an evil look on
          his face. IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS GOING TO RUN HER OVER.
          
          She turns and STARTS TO RUN.

                    You better run.

          Cass runs into a field. Milo drives off the road and follows.
          He gets her cornered by a pen. He looks triumphant. She
          scowls. Then she throws open the pen, REVEALING A HUGE BULL.
          Now she looks triumphant. He scowls.
          
          CUT TO- BULL RAMS INTO MILO'S CAR, SLAMMING MILO'S FACE INTO
          THE STEERING WHEEL. CASS LAUGHS. THE BULL TURNS AND NOTICES
          CASS FOR THE FIRST TIME.
          
          CUT TO- BULL CHASES CASS. MILO LAUGHS. CASS RUNS FOR THE CAR.
          MILO LOCKS THE DOORS.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey, it's locked!
          
                              MILO
                        (GRINNING)
                    I know.
          
          THE BULL IS SPEEDING THEIR WAY:
          
                              CASS
                    Open the door, you son of a bitch!
          
          Finally, Milo opens it. She DIVES INTO THE CAR AND SLAMS THE
          DOOR just before the BULL RAMS INTO THE SIDE OF THE CAR.
          
          Cass and Milo watch, stunned, as the bull looks at them for a
          moment, THEN TOPPLES OVER, UNCONSCIOUS. Milo and Cass hear a
          strange sound, and look over to see A SMALL HERD OF BULLS,
          GETTING READY TO CHARGE.
          
                               CASS

          MILO HITS THE GAS AND THEY FLEE THE SCENE, THE HERD OF BULLS
          IN MAD PURSUIT. CASS AND MILO ARE BOTH NOW LAUGHING

          Ray THROWS open the bathroom door to reveal: A VERY
          DISGRUNTLED STEWART, HANDCUFFED TO THE TOILET. Stewart blinks
          up at them, disoriented.
          
          Lorraine hands Dwight THE GOLF CLUB.

                    sure you get the right guy. I don't
                    have time for this shit.

          Milo and Cass are back on the highway, both looking a little
          worse for wear. Milo's nose is swollen, Cass' clothes are
          muddy.
          
                                                                 55.
          
          
          Milo MOVES HIS WEAPONS FROM THE DUFFLE INTO HIS OWN JACKET
          WHILE HE DRIVES. He smirks at Cass.
          
                              CASS
                    Clever. (noting all the weapons)
                    Wow. You were gonna use all that
                    stuff on me?
          
                              MILO
                    A guy can dream, can't he?
          
          NOW HIS JACKET IS FULL OF WEAPONS. He turns his attention
          back to the road. Cass studies his profile.
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, look, Milo, let's just clear
                    the air, Ok? So maybe it was a
                    mistake, thinking we could be
                    involved while working on the same
                    case...
          
                              MILO
                    Hey, I know it was a mistake. Don't
                    think you're telling me something I
                    don't know, cause you're not.
          
                              CASS
                        (deep breath)
                    Ok. Fine. But can we just put aside
                    our differences for two seconds?
                    Because back at the casino, I think
                    I saw someone following me.
          
                              MILO
                    Sure that wasn't me?
          
                              CASS
                    I don't think so. This guy was
                    lacking your trademark smell of
                    booze and KFC.
          
                              MILO
                    Ha ha.
          
          Milo surreptitiously sniffs himself.
          
                              CASS
                    Anywho. If these dirty cops have my
                    source hostage somewhere...
          
          Milo starts to laugh. Cass flushes:
          
                              CASS
                    What's so funny?
          
                                                                  56.
          
          
                              MILO
                    You think dirty cops are trying to
                    kill you? Look, I know you think
                    you're hot shit and everything, but
                    I'm pretty sure the only one around
                    here who might want to kill you is
                    me.
          
          Cass SEES A DARK CHEVY in the rearview mirror, gets a look at
          the driver and goes pale.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh no.
          
                              MILO
                    What?
          
                              CASS
                    Behind us. It's him. The guy I saw
                    back at the casino.
          
          Milo glances into the mirror, checking the guy out.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah? He doesn't look like a cop to
                    me.
          
                              CASS
                        (freaking out)

                    second and...
          
                              CASS
                    NO!!
          
          Cass kicks a leg over and SLAMS HER FOOT ONTO THE GAS. The
          car LEAPS forward...
          
                              MILO

          Milo tries to push her foot off the gas while they wrestle
          for the wheel. THE CAR DOES A CRAZY ZIG-ZAG BACK AND FORTH...
          
                              MILO
                    LISTEN, YOU MANIAC...
          
                              CASS
                    MILO...
          
                                                                   57.
          
          
                              MILO
                    ...LET GO...
          
                              CASS
                    MILO...
          
                              MILO
                    ...NO ONE IS TRYING TO KILL YOU...
          
                              CASS
                    MILO!!!
          
          She points past him. Milo turns to see MAHLER DRIVING BESIDE
          THEM, GUN POINTED AT MILO'S HEAD.
          
                              MILO
                    SHIT!!!
          
          They both duck as Mahler starts firing. GLASS SHATTERS ALL
          AROUND THEM. MILO PULLS OUT HIS GUN and STARTS FIRING BACK...
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- EARLY EVENING
          
          BOTH CARS VEER WILDLY FROM LANE TO LANE AS MILO AND MAHLER
          FIRE AT EACH OTHER...
          
          CLOSE ON- THE CADILLAC'S REAR TIRE, AS IT GOES FLAT FROM A
          BULLET...
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING
          
          MILO GRIPS THE WHEEL AS THE CAR STARTS TO DRAG AND LOSE
          GROUND. Cass is hunched over in the passenger seat, excited
          and frightened at the same time.
          
          Mahler pulls alongside them again and Milo WRENCHES the wheel
          to the left, SLAMMING THE CADILLAC INTO MAHLER'S CAR.
          Mahler's car goes skidding across the road, hits a ditch and
          FLIPS ONTO ITS SIDE.
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- EARLY EVENING
          
          The cadillac SPEEDS away, leaving Mahler's car behind.
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- EARLY EVENING
          
          The Cadillac is parked on the shoulder, Milo changing the
          tire, Cass standing by the passenger door, still handcuffed,
          EXCITED:
          
                                                                  58.
          
          
                              CASS
                    I told you they were trying to kill
                    me!
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah, well, no one's killing you
                    until I get you to jail.
          
          Cass whips her head around to look at him:
          
                              CASS
                    You're still taking me to jail? But
                    it's the cops who are after me.
          
                              MILO
                    First of all: that guy was not a
                    cop. Second of all, we just left
                    him unconscious in a ditch. You'll
                    be fine.
          
                              CASS
                    But...this is important! This is my
                    job!
          
                               MILO
                    And this...(pointing between them)
                    is my job.
          
                              CASS
                    Milo, you don't understand what's
                    going on!
          
          Milo rolls his eyes and straightens up.
          
                              MILO
                    I'll lay it out for you: some loser
                    with a minor sheet calls you up and
                    says, hey, I've got a big story for
                    you, you interested? It'll only
                    cost you a couple hundred bucks,
                    and I'll tip you onto some criminal
                    activity, it's your chance to
                    expose some bad guys and write the
                    story of your life. Then the moron
                    gets himself caught, he's probably
                    in cold storage somewhere, and now
                    you think the bad guys are after
                    you. (beat) See? I get it. I just
                    don't care.
          
          Milo finishes with the tire, throws the jack in the back, and
          heads back around to the driver's seat.
          
                                                                 59.
          
          
          Cass watches him closely, getting an idea. She reaches into
          her pocket and pulls out the paper from Jimmy.
          
                               CASS
                         (CASUALLY)
                    If only I knew exactly when and
                    where this deal was going down.
                    Course, if I can't figure out that
                    part, then you definitely can't
                    figure out that part, because we
                    both know I'm much smarter than
                    you.
          
          Milo flinches, then forces a laugh.
          
                              MILO
                    Please. My brain can dance circles
                    around your brain.
          
                              CASS
                    I don't even know what that means.
          
                              MILO
                    Case closed.
          
                              CASS
                        (SHRUGGING)
                    Fine. Guess we'll never know.
          
          Milo hesitates. Then decides: fuck it. He strides around the
          car and SNATCHES the paper from her hand. He reads:
          
                              MILO
                    "Atlantic City. Xmas Eve. Sparrow."
                    What's "Sparrow"?
          
                              CASS
                    I knew you couldn't figure it out.
          
                              MILO
                        (QUICKLY)
                    It's a business.
          
                                CASS
                    No.
          
                                MILO
                    Casino.
          
                                CASS
                    Nope.
          
                                MILO
                    Stripper?
          
                                                                 60.
          
          
                              CASS
                    I don't think so. What kind of
                    strip bars have you been going to,
                    anyway?
          
          Milo stares at the paper, wracking his brain. Cass sighs
          loudly and SNATCHES the paper back.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh, well, forget it, I knew you
                    couldn't do it.
          
                              MILO
                    Please. I could crack that story
                    and still get you to jail on time.
          
                                 CASS
                    Oh yeah?
          
          Cass stares him in the eye and says the magic words:
          
                                 CASS
                    Wanna bet?
          
          Milo stares at her. She stares back. Long beat. Milo's face
          is red. He clenches his fists. He unclenches them. Fuck. He
          thrusts out his hand:
          
                                 MILO
                    You're on.
          
          They shake.
          
                              MILO
                    I have to make a call.
          
          He starts to walk away.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey. Aren't you going to uncuff me?
          
                              MILO
                    Why? You going somewhere?
          
                                 CASS
                    Um...no.
          
                              MILO
                    Then you don't need to be uncuffed.
          
                                                                  61.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Cass sits in the passenger seat and watches in the rearview
          mirror while Milo paces behind the car, on the phone.
          
                              CASS
                        (to herself)
                    Asshole.
          
          
          EXT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING
          
          Milo is talking to Sid:
          
                              MILO
                    So there's just gonna be a little
                    delay...
          
          SPLIT-SCREEN:
          
          INT MALL- EARLY EVENING
          
          Sid's at the mall. On Dec 23rd. With all the other desperate,
          last-minute shoppers. In other words, HE'S IN HELL.
          
                              SID
                    I don't get it. Why are you helping
                    her?
          
                              MILO
                    But that's the beauty of it, Sid,
                    I'm not helping her, she only
                    thinks I'm helping her.
          
                              SID
                    Yeah? If you're not helping her,
                    what are you doing?
          
          Milo notices Cass watching him and turns his back slightly.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING
          
          Cass narrows her eyes:
          
                              CASS
                        (to herself)
                    What is he up to?
          
          
          EXT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING
          
          Milo is making this up as he goes along:
          
                                                                  62.
          
          
                              MILO
                    I'll tell you what I'm doing: I'm
                    gonna crack this case first, and
                    I'm gonna take all the credit. Who
                    knows, maybe I'll even get my job
                    back....
          
                              SID
                    You are so full of shit. You don't
                    want your job back. You just want
                    to prove you're smarter than she
                    is.
          
                              MILO
                        (instantly heated)
                    I am smarter than she is. I would
                    have cracked that 13th Street case
                    way before she did if she hadn't...
          
                              SID
                    ...cheated, right, I know, you've
                    told me a million times. Did it
                    ever occur to you that a normal
                    couple wouldn't compete the way you
                    guys do in the first place?
          
          Sid spots what he is looking for. So does another last-minute
          shopper. They both reach for the toy.
          
                              MILO
                    This from the man currently trying
                    to prove to his wife he can handle
                    Xmas.
          
                              SID
                        (instantly heated)
                    I can handle Xmas!
          
          Sid WRENCHES the toy from the other shopper.
          
                              MILO
                    Just..trust me, Ok?
          
                              SID
                    Do I have a choice?
          
                              MILO
                    Nope.
          
          Milo hangs up and gets in the car.
          
                                                                 63.

                    So. Atlantic City. Xmas Eve...
          
          
          EXT HOTDOG STAND- EVENING
          
          Milo buys a chili dog while talking to Cass who stands next
          to him, handcuffed.
          
                              MILO
                    ...so what exactly are these dirty
                    cops supposed to be doing?
          
                              CASS
                    Stealing evidence from property
                    rooms. Then destroying it, for the
                    right price.
          
          Milo stares.
          
                              CASS
                    What?
          
                              MILO
                    Nothing. It's just...it's a good
                    idea. If it weren't, you know.
                    Wrong. (continuing) So. Your plan
                    is to catch them red-handed before
                    they can destroy the evidence, then
                    write an expose for the paper and
                    win yourself another big award.
          
                              CASS
                    Something like that.
          
                              MILO
                    Only, you don't know what Sparrow
                    is. (thinking) Could be a nickname.
                    Or the place where the evidence is
                    stashed. Or a code word of some
                    kind. But the guy who knows has
                    gone missing, and you think the
                    dirty cops got a hold of him.
          
                                                                  64.
          
          
                              CASS
                        (NODDING)
                    When Jimmy called earlier, someone
                    else was there. And they
                    disconnected the call.
          
          Milo is staring at her.
          
                              MILO
                    So we find your source, we find the
                    dirty cops. Gimme your phone.
          
          She hands it to him. Milo checks the record of incoming calls
          and smiles.
          
                                CASS
                    What?
          
                              BOBBY (O.S.)
                    Milo! Merry Xmas!

          Bobby talks into his cell phone while supervising a parade of
          hookers being loaded into a van:
          
                              BOBBY
                    Here's one: why did the snowman
                    pull down his pants? Cause he heard
                    the snowblower was coming!
          
                              MILO
                    Funny. Listen, Bob, I need a favor.
          
                                BOBBY
                    Anything.
          
                              MILO
                    I need an address to go with a
                    phone number. But I need it ASAP.
                    Kinda got a guy on my tail...
          
          
          EXT GARAGE- EVENING
          
          A tow truck is pulling up, towing Mahler's car. The tow truck
          driver turns to Mahler, who is in the passenger seat:
          
                              TOW TRUCK DRIVER
                    The garage is closed for the night.
                    Guess you'll have to wait til
                    tomorrow.
          
                                                                 65.
          
          
          Mahler thinks this over, then SMACKS THE DRIVER ACROSS THE
          FACE WITH THE BUTT OF HIS GUN. The driver crumples in his
          seat.
          
                                 MAHLER
                    Guess not.
          
          Mahler leans across him, opens the driver's side door, and
          BOOTS him out of the cab.
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- EVENING
          
          The tow truck is driving away from the garage.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- EVENING
          
          Milo climbs back into the car, holding a piece of paper with
          the words "Trump Casino, room 2504" on it. He grins at Cass.
          
                              CASS
                    Pretty proud of yourself, ey?
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. You're a reporter. Great. But
                    I used to be a cop. Let's face it:
                    I'm naturally gonna be one step
                    ahead of you.
          
                              CASS
                        (under her breath)
                    You weren't last time.
          
          Milo whips his head around:
          
                              MILO
                    What did you say?
          
                              CASS
                    I said you're doing a great job.
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- EVENING
          
          The Trump Casino on the strip, coming into view...
          
          
          EXT TRUMP CASINO- EVENING
          
          Milo pulls into the crowded parking lot and checks the
          cartridge of his gun. Beside him, Cass is bubbling over with
          excited energy:
          
                                                                  66.
          
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, here's what I think we should
                    do: I'll go up first, Jimmy knows
                    me, so if anything's wrong I'm sure
                    he'll give me a sign...
          
                              MILO
                    Excellent plan. Oh, except you're
                    staying in the car.
          
          Milo exits the car.
          
                              CASS
                        (shouting after him)
                    But...it's my story!
          
          But he is already headed for the casino entrance. He waves at
          her and disappears inside.
          
                                CASS
                    Asshole.
          
          
          INT TRUMP CASINO- EVENING
          
          Milo glides through the casino, past the blinking lights of
          the slot machines, headed for the elevators. A DRUNK GUY in a
          Hawaiian shirt is coming towards him and HE AND MILO
          COLLIDE...
          
                              MILO
                        (steadying the guy)
                    You Ok? My bad.
          
                              DRUNK GUY
                    Watch where you're going. (under
                    his breath) Prick.
          
          The drunk guy continues past. Milo holds up THE ROOM CARD KEY
          HE HAS JUST SWIPED FROM THE GUY:
          
                              MILO
                        (calling after him)
                    Merry Xmas to you, too!
          
          
          INT TRUMP CASINO 25TH FLOOR- EVENING
          
          The elevator dings and Milo exits. He turns a corner and
          heads down the hall. Another elevator DINGS behind him.
          
          Milo continues down the hall. Suddenly, he STOPS and looks
          behind him. No one is there.
          
                                                                    67.
          
          
          He turns another corner and FINDS 2504. There is a "DO NOT
          DISTURB" sign on the door. HE GOES PAST IT AND TAPS LIGHTLY
          ON 2505.
          
                              MILO
                    Room service.
          
          No answer. He glances down the hall and sees a slight
          movement. SOMEONE IS WATCHING HIM. He moves away from the
          door, continues down the hall, THEN SLIPS INTO THE ICE
          MACHINE ROOM...
          
          
          INT ICE MACHINE ROOM- CONTINUOUS
          
          Milo hits the light switch off and waits just inside the
          door. Someone steps in, and MILO GRABS THEM AND THROWS THEM
          AGAINST THE WALL. The person SCREAMS. Milo slaps a hand
          across the person's mouth and switches on the light. And
          finds himself face to face with:
          
          CASS.
          
                              MILO
                    What the...?
          
          He looks at the handcuff dangling from her wrist, STILL
          ATTACHED TO THE CAR DOOR ARM REST.
          
                              MILO
                        (loud whisper)
                    What the hell are you doing?
          
                               CASS
                        (SAME)
                    It's my story, I don't break
                    stories by staying in the car!
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah, well, (re: the armrest)
                    you're paying for that.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh, ok. Here's a nickle.
          
          Suddenly, Milo goes still. THERE IS A CREAKING SOUND as
          someone creeps down the hall. Milo puts a finger to Cass'
          lips.
          
          Then he peeks out the door.
          
          MILO'S POV- THE CLEANING CART BEING SLOWLY WHEELED DOWN THE
          HALL BY THE MAID. The maid stops by a room and enters.
          
                                                                  68.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Perfect. (to Cass) Play along.
          
          
          INT HALLWAY- EVENING
          
          Milo passes the maid's cart, glancing at her ROOM RECORD
          SHEET, then continues on to room 2505. He uses the CARD HE
          SWIPED on the door. Of course, IT DOESN'T WORK.
          
                               MILO
                        (LOUD)
                    Godammit. Son of a bitch.
          
          The maid peeks out into the hall.
          
                              MILO
                        (to Cass)
                    This is like the third card they've
                    given me...
          
                              CASS
                        (playing along)
                    Take it easy, honey...
          
                              MILO
                    Don't tell me to take it easy, now
                    we have to go all the way
                    downstairs again...
          
          Cass looks pleadingly at the maid.
          
                              MAID
                    What's the name?
          
                              MILO
                    Davenport. Room 2505.
          
          The maid checks her chart, then crosses the hall and USES HER
          PASS KEY TO OPEN THE DOOR.
          
                              MILO
                    You're an angel.
          
          Milo and Cass go inside.
          
          
          INT ROOM 2505- EVENING
          
          Milo closes the door carefully behind them, then tiptoes
          across the room to the connecting door, Cass close on his
          heels. All is silent.
          
                                                                    69.
          
          
                              CASS
                        (WHISPERING)
                    Wait a second: where's my gun?
          
                               MILO
                        (SAME)
                    I don't know. Where is your gun?
          
                              CASS
                    I don't have one.
          
                              MILO
                    Then you've answered your own
                    question.
          
          Milo tiptoes closer to the door. Cass pulls on his sleeve.
          
                              CASS
                    Come on, give me something. You've
                    got, like, a million weapons in the
                    jacket.
          
          She reaches for his jacket, and Milo pulls away.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. These are not toys. You can't
                    just give them to someone and have
                    them know how to use them.
          
                              CASS
                    I seem to remember doing just fine
                    with your taser gun.
          
          They are at the door. Milo puts a finger to his lips and
          tries the doorknob: LOCKED. He is about to work the lock when
          THEY HEAR SCREAMS COMING FROM THE LOCKED ROOM.
          
          No time to do this quietly. MILO TAKES A STEP BACK, THEN
          KICKS THE DOOR IN...
          
          
          INT HALLWAY- EVENING
          
          Halfway down the hallway, THE MAID HEARS THE DOOR BEING
          KICKED IN. Nervous, she backs away, headed for the
          elevators...
          
          
          INT ROOM 2504- CONTINUOUS
          
          Milo QUICKLY ENTERS THE ROOM, GUN RAISED. THE SCREAMING IS
          COMING FROM THE TV. Milo clicks it off and checks the room.
          The place appears to be deserted. He crosses to the bathroom
          and peers in: EMPTY.
          
                                                                 70.
          
          
          Meanwhile, Cass has cautiously entered the room and sees
          spots on the rug:
          
                              CASS
                    Oh, god, is that blood?
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. Columbo. Wait by the door.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm just trying to...
          
                              MILO
                    This could be a crime scene. There
                    are clues all over this room that
                    only a trained eye can find. And as
                    I seem to recall, you were the one
                    who was unable to figure this out
                    by herself.
          
          Oooh. Cass grits her teeth.
          
                              CASS
                        (under her breath)
                    He is unbelievable.
          
                              MILO
                    Who are you talking to, your
                    imaginary friend Leslie?
          
                              CASS
                        (BLUSHING)
                    Hey. Lots of kids have imaginary
                    friends, despite what my mother
                    believes.
          
                              MILO
                    Whatever. You wait by the door. And
                    I'll handle this.
          
                              CASS
                        (PISSED)
                    Fine.
          
          She moves back to the door. As she does, she notices a
          matchbook on the floor: IT'S A GREEN MATCHBOOK WITH A BLACK
          SILHOUETTE OF A HORSE.
          
                              CASS
                    So you're saying you don't want my
                    help.
          
                              MILO
                    I'm saying I don't need your help.
          
                                                                 71.
          
          
                                CASS
                          (SHRUGGING)
                    Ok.
          
          As he turns away, SHE SLIPS THE MATCHBOOK INTO HER PURSE.
          Milo catches this movement out of the corner of his eye and
          glances back:
          
                              MILO
                    What was that?
          
                              CASS
                        (INNOCENTLY)
                    What was what?
          
                              MILO
                    Did you find something?
          
                              CASS
                    How could I find anything? I'm not
                    the detective.
          
                              MILO
                    Lemme see your purse...
          
          Milo takes a step closer to her, but:
          
                                VOICE
                    FREEZE!
          
          Cass and Milo turn to see A HOTEL SECURITY GUARD IN THE
          DOORWAY, EXCITEDLY POINTING HIS GUN AT THEM. Milo rolls his
          eyes.
          
                              GUARD
                    Hotel security! Stay where you are!
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, Ok, no problem. You're probably
                    gonna want this.
          
          Milo holds up HIS GUN.
          
                              GUARD
                        (PANICKED)
                    DROP THE WEAPON, NOW!
          
                              MILO
                    Take it easy. I'm just gonna unload
                    it.
          
          Milo drops the cartridge, then TOSSES THE GUN RIGHT AT THE
          GUARD'S FACE.
          
                                                                   72.
          
          
          The guard instinctively raises his hands and Milo CHARGES
          him, tackling him to the ground, then handcuffing him to the
          table.
          
          Milo GRABS Cass hand and races from the room.
          
          
          INT HALLWAY- EVENING
          
          Cass and Milo run up to the elevators. ALL CARS ARE RISING:
          BACK-UP IS ON THE WAY. Milo hits the fire alarm and pulls
          Cass into the stairwell...
          
          
          INT STAIRWELL- EVENING
          
          Milo and Cass are almost to the bottom, WHEN SECURITY APPEARS
          IN THE STAIRWELL BENEATH THEM. Milo looks up. SECURITY IS
          COMING FROM ABOVE, AS WELL. Shit. Milo cracks the stairwell
          window and peers out: THEY ARE 4 STORIES UP.
          
                              MILO
                    You're gonna have to jump.
          
                                 CASS
                    I can't.
          
          Milo considers this, then picks her up and TOSSES HER OUT THE
          WINDOW.
          
          
          EXT TRUMP CASINO- EVENING
          
          Cass screams as she falls. Milo falls next to her. They fall
          and fall and BOOSH: THEY LAND IN A SNOW BANK AND TUMBLE TO
          THE GROUND.
          
          Seconds later, they are on their feet, RUNNING FOR THE CAR.
          
                              BOBBY (O.S.)
                    Ok, so some guy you're looking for
                    has disappeared. You want me to put
                    out an all-points on him?
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- EVENING
          
          Milo and Cass are speeding away from the Trump Casino.
          
                              MILO
                        (into phone)
                    The thing is, Bob: Cass thinks
                    dirty cops might be involved.
          
                                                                 73.

          INT POLICE STATION- EVENING
          
          Bobby is in his office. His door opens onto the squad room,
          busy with police activity. Bobby sits up straighter in his
          chair.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're with
                    Cassidy? Shit, Milo, you know when
                    you're around her your brain turns
                    to mush.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah, well, that doesn't change the
                    fact that someone took a couple
                    shots at us.
          
          Beat.
          
                              BOBBY
                    You get a plate number?
          
                              MILO
                    Happened too quick. But it was a
                    dark 4-door Chevy, blue or grey,
                    New Jersey plates, and the car was
                    wrecked, I know that.
          
          Bobby thinks this over.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Ok. Lemme look into it. See what I
                    can find. Just hold tight, Ok?
          
          Milo checks his watch.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok. But we're kinda on a clock
                    here.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Milo, don't fuck around with this.
                    If there are dirty cops in the
                    house, we all have a problem. So do
                    me a favor: get off the strip, find
                    somewhere to lie low and wait for
                    my call.
          
                                                                   74.
          
          
          EXT BACK OF TRUMP CASINO- EVENING
          
          The scene has calmed down a little. A DARK SEDAN appears and
          RAY AND DWIGHT exit the car, looking like a an ugly,
          dangerous Odd Couple.
          
          An employee slips out the back door and hands Ray a PHOTO
          FROM SECURITY OF MILO AND CASS IN THE CASINO PARKING LOT.
          Dwight snatches the photo from Ray.
          
                              DWIGHT
                    Yeah, that's him.
          
                              RAY
                    Who's the chick?
          
                              DWIGHT
                    Who gives a fuck? Anyway, they
                    can't be far.
          
          It's true. They aren't too far. They are:

          A LUXURIOUS, ROMANTIC B&B. Xmas lights winking on the trees,

          CHIRON: "9:00 PM. ROUTE 9 SOUTH. 36 HOURS TO GO."
          
          The whole scene looks beautiful, peaceful, romantic...
          
                              CASS (O.S.)
                    Ok. Kill me now.
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL MILO AND CASS, parked in front. REVEAL
          THE SIGN NEXT TO THEM: "WELCOME TO CUPID'S CABIN". Yup. The
          place Milo and Cass ran off to and got married 3 years ago.
          
                              MILO
                    I'm sorry, it's the only place I
                    know off the strip.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm not going in. What if they
                    remember us?
          
                              MILO
                    They won't remember us. Why would
                    they remember us? Just...try to act
                    normal.

          hair, glasses, moccasins) greets them with a smile:

          She looks behind her at a bulletin board. At photos of all
          the happy couples who have passed through her. And finds: A

          CHAMPAGNE, CASS SHOWING OFF AN ENGAGEMENT RING.

          A balding man in flannel comes out, takes one look, and
          clasps both hands to his chest.
          
                              EDMUND

                    what, 3 years?
          
          Milo and Cass both try to downplay:
          
                                 MILO
                    Has it?

                              EDMUND
                    What an honor for us!
          
                              CASS
                    Actually, we're not...
          
                               DAWN
                    You know what? In light of this
                    special special occasion: it's on
                    the house!
          
          Before Cass can protest more, MILO GRABS HER ARM.
          
                              MILO
                    Honey? Can I talk to you?
          
          He pulls her slightly aside.
          
                              MILO
                        (LOW)
                    You have any money?
          
                               CASS
                        (SAME)
                    No, as you recall, I gave you all
                    my money at the blackjack table...
                    (realizing) You blew all the money!
          
                              MILO
                    Hey! I would have won it back if
                    someone hadn't tasered me in the
                    bathroom!
          
                              CASS
                    So. Use a credit card.
          
                              MILO
                    Mine's max'd. Lemme have yours.
          
                              CASS
                    Mine's max'd too. (off his look)
                    What, I like to shop.
          
          They give each other a horrified look as they both realize
          what this means. Then they turn back to the couple, put their
          arms around each other, and smile:
          
                              MILO/CASS
                    It's our third anniversary!
          
                              DAWN/EDMUND
                    Congratulations!

                    Thanks!
          
          Milo and Cass snuggle closer. He surreptitiously squeezes her
          ass. She surreptitiously STOMPS on his foot.

          couples, straight couples. Even a dog couple snuggled up by
          the fire.
          
          And then there's Milo and Cass, bruised and dishevelled,
          being served an elaborate romantic meal. They smile
          uncomfortably as Edmund arrives with a tray of oysters:
          
                              EDMUND
                    To begin: a little aphrodisiac!
          
          He gives them both a broad wink.
          
                                 MILO
                           (GRIMLY)
                    Wow.
          
                                 CASS
                        (SAME)
                    Great.
          
                              EDMUND
                    So tell me: how have you managed to
                    keep the romance alive all this
                    time?
          
                              MILO
                    Well, I'll tell you, Edmund.
                    The secret to our success is that
                    the little woman here knows her
                    place. She cleans for me, cooks for
                    me, and every night when I come
                    home she gets down on her knees and
                    massages my feet.
          
          He beams at Cass. Cass grins through her teeth.
          
                              CASS
                    Yes, Edmund, it's true. I massage
                    his feet to help him feel like a
                    man. It's important, especially
                    when your husband has such a teeny
                    tiny...
          
          Just then, Dawn hustles over, interrupting:
          
                                                                 78.

                    How is everything? Is it like that
                    magical night 3 years ago?
          
                              CASS
                    Uh-huh.
          
                              MILO
                    Yup. You betcha.

                    This calls for a toast!
          
          She raises a glass, tapping it with a spoon. Milo and Cass
          both groan under their breath.
          
                              DAWN
                        (to the room)
                    May I have your attention please?
                    Edmund and I would like to share
                    with you the most romantic moment
                    we have ever seen. It was three
                    years ago today, in this very
                    restaurant, when this lovely young
                    man here, right in the middle of
                    the meal, threw down his napkin,
                    got down on one knee, and said
                    marry me, right now, right this
                    second, I want to go to sleep
                    tonight knowing you're my wife!
          
                              EDMUND
                        (jumping in)
                    And she said yes, with tears in her
                    eyes and a tremble in her hand,
                    let's get married, and they ran out
                    to the all night chapel and came
                    back an hour later, man and wife!
          
          The whole restaurant starts clapping. Milo turns to Edmund:
          
                              MILO
                    Can I get a whiskey?
          
                              CASS
                    Make that two.

          Milo and Cass stumble down the hall, laughing hysterically,
          falling down drunk.
          
                                                                  79.
          
          
                              MILO
                    After we broke up, I was so mad at
                    you, I told everyone I know you
                    have herpes.
          
                               CASS
                    I told everyone you flunked out of
                    3rd grade.
          
                               MILO
                    I told everyone you have a
                    moustache.
          
                              CASS
                    I told everyone you like to wear my
                    panties.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey!
          
          This one is obviously true. Both laugh harder.
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B HONEYMOON SUITE- NIGHT
          
          Milo and Cass stagger in, blinking hazily at their new
          surroundings. A heart-shaped bed. Champagne. A bubble bath. A
          fireplace. The works. Like Cupid threw up in here.
          
          The laughter slowly fades. Long beat. Then:
          
                              CASS
                    Wow. This would be really awkward
                    if we still had feelings for each
                    other. Which we don't...
          
                              MILO
                    That's right. Luckily, we're
                    different people now. We don't feel
                    the way we used to.
          
                              CASS
                    Right. We've moved on.
          
                              MILO
                    We have no feelings about each
                    other whatsoever.

                       Feels fantastic.
          
                                 MILO
                       A platonic relationship. Working
                       together.
          
                                 CASS

                                 MILO
                       Trusting each other.
          
          Which reminds them: THEY DON'T TRUST EACH OTHER. Awkward
          pause. Then:
          
                                 CASS
                       Well. Mind if I shower?
          
                                 MILO

          Cass disappears into the bathroom, closing the door behind
          her. Beat. Then MILO HURRIES OVER TO THE DOOR AND LISTENS.

          As soon as Milo hears the water, HE HURRIES OVER TO THE BED

                    back...
          
                              CASS
                    Why should I have to win him back?
                    He should have to win me back! And
                    who says I want him back, anyway?
          
                              MOM
                    I have never understood this
                    competitive streak of yours...

                        (losing her patience)
                    Look, the reason I called: I
                    remember you worked at this one
                    place where they had these bright
                    green matches with, like, this
                    silhouette of a horse on them?
          
                              MOM
                        (immediately defensive)
                    That was a long time ago! And all I
                    did was serve drinks...
          
                              CASS
                    I just need to know the name of the
                    place.
          
                              MOM
                    Charley's. And Ok, I admit, maybe I
                    did a little dancing, but how often
                    do you make 200 an hour in tips?
          
                              CASS
                    I gotta go.
          
                              MOM
                    I want grandkids!
          
          Cass hangs up. She sits for a moment, staring at her phone.
          Is her mother right? Is she making a mistake right now? She
          looks around the bathroom. Candles, flowers, thick robes.
          
          A bottle of champagne chilling by the heart-shaped tub. She
          slowly stands and checks herself out in the mirror, brushing
          back her hair with her hands.
          
          Suddenly, on impulse, she grabs the bottle of champagne and
          two glasses. WHAT THE HELL, WHY NOT?
          
                                                                    83.
          
          
          They're here, maybe they should seize the moment. She peeks
          out the bathroom door and sees...

          Milo hears the water go off. HE POCKETS THE MATCHES, tosses
          the purse away and lies on the bed, striking a casual pose.
          
          Cass emerges.
          
                              MILO
                    Good shower?

                              CASS
                    You know what's great? Trusting
                    each other.
          
                                MILO
                    I agree.
          
          He holds up the handcuffs:

          SNOW IS FALLING OUTSIDE. PAN FROM THE WINDOW, ACROSS THE ROOM
          TO THE BED, ACROSS A SNORING MILO TO CASS, EYES CLOSED, HAND
          CUFFED TO THE HEADBOARD.
          
          Suddenly, CASS' EYES SNAP OPEN. She sits up a little and
          glances over at MILO'S NIGHT TABLE WHERE HE LEFT THE KEYS AND
          GUN IN PLAIN VIEW. She smiles...
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B SUITE- TEN MINUTES LATER
          
          Cass is doing a slow, careful, ACROBATIC CLIMB ACROSS MILO'S
          BODY in an attempt to reach the gun without waking Milo up.
          She puts a hand on the headboard. She is lifting her knee
          over him, when he stirs.
          
          She freezes, waiting for him to settle. It's like playing
          Twister, only if the person you're playing with finds out,
          HE'S GOING TO KILL YOU.
          
          She manages to get herself STRADDLING HIM, arms stretched,
          THE GUN ALMOST WITHIN REACH, when:
          
                                 MILO
                    Excuse me.
          
          Cass FREEZES.
          
                              MILO
                    What are you doing?
          
          She looks down. Milo is watching her, wide awake. Hmm. This
          is going to be a tough one to explain.
          
                                 CASS
                    Um...
          
                              MILO
                    Are you trying to seduce me?

                    Yes. Yes I am.
          
          She tries to reach for the gun while they talk.
          
                              MILO

                    I didn't know you were still so
                    attracted to me. I mean, I remember
                    how you used to like to greet me at
                    the door in nothing but a...

                    Yes, it's true, I'm still attracted
                    to you.
          
          Her hand is groping around blindly, where the fuck is it? She
          stretches more, bringing her face even closer to Milo's.
          
                               MILO
                    Really? Wow. That's great news. You
                    know what would be really sexy
                    right now?

                    If we both just went to sleep?
          
                              MILO
                    No. If you talked dirty to me.
          
          The gun seems to be getting father away. THEIR LIPS ARE
          ALMOST TOUCHING NOW...

                    attraction to me.
          
                              CASS
                    Um...I can't stop thinking about
                    you.
          
                              MILO
                    Really? What part of me?
          
                              CASS
                    Just...all of you.
          
                              MILO
                    Be specific.
          
          Cass blushes fiercely. If she didn't want that gun so bad...
          
                              MILO
                        (HELPFULLY)

                    Or...something lower like...
          
          He reaches down and WHIPS OUT:

                    My gun?
          
          THE GUN IS IN HIS HAND. That's why she couldn't reach it. HE
          KNEW WHAT SHE WAS UP TO THIS WHOLE TIME. She flips off him
          and back onto her side. Milo sits up, flipping on the lights.
          
                              MILO
                    I knew I couldn't trust you!

                    When were you gonna tell me you
                    have no intention of helping me
                    with my story?

                    You're right. I'm not helping you.

                    get to come out on top! Karma,

                    Oh my god, would you get over it
                    already! So I cracked the case
                    before you did, it was 3 years ago,
                    it happened, stop being such a baby
                    and move on!
          
                               MILO
                    Oh I'm moving on. You know how I'm
                    moving on? By cracking this case
                    before you, then taking you in so
                    you can spend this Xmas in jail,
                    all alone.
          
          He rolls over, turning his back to her. Cass stares at the
          ceiling, fuming.

                    cleaned out her wallet in 3 years.

          Next to an ambulance, Milo is unconscious on a stretcher. An
          EMT prepares a HUGE SYRINGE, picks a spot on Milo's chest,
          then PLUNGES THE NEEDLE INTO IT.
          
                                                                  91.

                    kill me.
          
          The EMT exchanges a look with the ambulance driver, then
          helps Milo off the stretcher.

                    Sure. Charley's, on the boardwalk.
                    And just FYI: when they say "don't

                    with any part of your body, not
                    just your hands.
          
          The EMT folds the stretcher, loads it into the ambulance, and
          THEY DRIVE AWAY, leaving Milo in the parking lot.

          LIKE SOMEONE TRYING TO CALL OUT THROUGH A GAG. She looks
          around. There is a window higher up on the wall. Cass drags a
          trash can beneath the window, stacks another one on top of
          it, and cautiously climbs up.
          
          The window is locked and she can't see through it. Hmm. Fuck
          it. She takes her purse and SMASHES a pane of glass.

          Relieved, Jimmy starts gesturing excitedly for her to come

          and ungags him.

                              RAY
                    I think he hung up.

          Milo is pulling up. Sees Charley's. Then SEES HIS OWN CAR. He
          glances around: CASS MUST BE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.
          
          His phone rings again.
          
                              MILO
                    Hello, Lucky's Libations!

          Dwight tries to explain:
          
                              DWIGHT
                    Look, Milo, I don't think you
                    understand: we're gonna hurt her.
          
          Milo hears MUSIC COMING FROM DWIGHT'S END. DANCE MUSIC.
          SLEAZY MUSIC. UNMISTAKABLY STRIP-CLUB MUSIC.
          
          He heads for CHARLEY'S. Into phone:
          
                              MILO
                    Oh, I understand, alright, and I
                    don't blame ya. I want to hurt her
                    all the time.
          
          Cass grabs the phone from Dwight. Into phone:
          
                              CASS
                    Milo, listen, they're not kidding,

          Milo slips inside and scans the room. HE SEES CASS IN A BOOTH
          ACROSS THE ROOM WITH DWIGHT AND RAY. Into phone:
          
                              MILO
                    Ok. Fine. Say you were wrong.
          
          Cass hesitates. Into phone:
          
                                CASS
                    For what?
          
                              MILO
                    For what? For poisoning me with

                              MILO
                    Ok. Now. Admit that the only reason
                    you were able to crack that case
                    three years ago was because you
                    looked through my files.
          
          Long pause.

                    Thrilled. Now tell them I'll be
                    there in 20 minutes. Meanwhile,
                    stop shifting in your seat like
                    that and just tell them you have to
                    use the bathroom.
          
          Cass sits up straighter. Wait a second, he's here?
          
                              MILO
                    Don't look around. Just do it.

          Cass enters. Milo is behind the door. He SLAMS the door
          closed after she is in, and blocks her escape.
          
                              MILO
                    You know what my mistake was? I
                    never should have let you out of
                    the trunk. I'm fine, by the way.
                    The doctor said I may have been
                    technically dead for a few seconds,
                    but I'm fine now.
          
          Cass is not impressed. She stares at him coldly.
          
                              CASS
                    So that's what you really think?
                    That I stole information from you?
          
                              MILO
                    It's not what I think, it's what I
                    know. How else did you beat me?
          
                              CASS
                        (as though to a 5 yr old)
                    Did it ever occur to you that I
                    just might be good at my job?
          
          Milo stares at her. Huh. It actually didn't occur to him...
          
                              CASS
                    That's what I thought. You know
                    what, Milo? You're an even bigger
                    asshole than I previously
                    suspected, and you deserve
                    everything that's happened to you.
                    (beat) And everything that's about
                    to happen to you.
          
          "About to happen"? Milo is just starting to realize...
          
                              MILO
                    You wouldn't...
          
                              CASS
                        (SCREAMING)
                    MILO BOYD IS IN HERE!

          Son of a bitch. The bathroom door SHOOTS open and DWIGHT AND
          RAY ENTER. They back Milo into a corner. Cass smiles at Milo,
          waves, and exits.

          Cass comes flying out of the club and runs right into:
          MAHLER. HE TAKES ONE LOOKS AT HER AND PUSHES HER BACK INSIDE.

                    Wow. You always carry this much
                    gear?
          
                              MILO
                    Only during the holidays.
          
          
          INT CHARLEY'S- CONTINUOUS
          
          Milo is pushed out of the bathroom, and comes face to face
          with CASS. MAHLER APPEARS FROM BEHIND HER, TAKES ONE LOOK AT
          MILO AND POINTS HIS GUN AT MILO'S HEAD.
          
                              MAHLER
                    Remember me?
          
                              DWIGHT
                    What the fuck?
          
          Dwight steps forward from behind Milo, AND POINTS HIS GUN AT
          MAHLER. MAHLER REACTS, SHIFTING THE GUN TO DWIGHT. RAY STEPS
          UP, GUN POINTED AT MAHLER.
          
          Momentary stand-off. Stuck between the bad guys, MILO AND
          CASS GIVE EACH OTHER EVIL LOOKS.
          
          A half-naked dancer appears:
          
                                DANCER
                    Lapdance?
          
          Everyone looks at her. She is just realizing...

          STOMPING ON MAHLER'S FOOT, CAUSING HIM TO LOOSEN HIS HOLD ON
          HER, MILO SLAMMING HIS ELBOW BACK ONTO RAY'S ABDOMEN.
          
          RAY'S GUN GOES OFF AS CASS AND MILO BOTH HIT THE FLOOR.
          MAHLER REACTS, FIRING AT RAY. DWIGHT FIRES AT MAHLER...
          
          TOTAL PANDEMONIUM. Girls screaming, patrons running for the
          exit.
          
          MAHLER AND DWIGHT BOTH GET HIT. Milo crawls over to a moaning
          Dwight and recovers his gun. He looks up in time to see CASS
          DISAPPEARING OUT THE FRONT DOOR.

          Milo comes out. THE BOARDWALK IS PACKED, CASS IS LOST IN THE
          CROWD. Milo raises his gun in the air and FIRES. People duck
          and scatter REVEALING CASS, climbing into the Cadillac.

          away, victorious, WHEN THERE IS A SOUND ON THE ROOF.
          
          MILO'S FACE APPEARS, UPSIDE-DOWN, IN THE WINDSHIELD,
          GRINNING.
          
                                CASS
                      Get off the car, Milo.
          
          He gives her the finger.
          
                                CASS
                      Get off the car, you psychopath.
          
                                MILO
                      Oh, I am a psychopath, and you know
                      why? Cause you made me that way.
                      And if I'm going crazy, I'm taking
                      you with me.
          
          He reaches a hand through the driver's window, grabbing at
          her. Cass SCREAMS, squeezes her eyes shut and HITS THE GAS.

                              MILO
                    Yeah?

          Bobby, ocean in the background, furious:
          
                              BOBBY
                    What the fuck are you doing? I
                    thought I told you to lie low.
          
                              MILO
                    I was lying low...
          
                              BOBBY
                    Yeah? Then how is it that a
                    statewide all-points was just put
                    out on the two of you?
          
                              MILO
                        (SIGHING)
                    It's a long story.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Ok, look, you guys better come to
                    me, I'll protect you til we figure
                    this out. Can you get to Pier 19?
          
          Milo looks around. He can just make out Pier 19 in the
          distance, a mile or two away.
          
                                                                 102.
          
          
                                 MILO
                       Yeah.
          
          
          EXT PIER 19- EVENING
          
          Milo and Cass drive up in the Cadillac and park out of sight.
          They exit the car and look around. The pier seems to be
          deserted. Then they hear a soft motor, and BOBBY APPEARS IN A
          MOTORBOAT.
          
                                 BOBBY
                       Get in.
          
          
          EXT OCEAN- EARLY EVENING
          
          The sound of a motorboat chugging along.
          
          
          INT MOTORBOAT- EVENING
          
          Bobby is at the back of the boat, steering. Cass and Milo are
          up front, explaining:
          
                                 CASS
                       So, these guys have a bunch of
                       stolen evidence stashed somewhere
                       in Atlantic City...
          
                                 MILO
                       And we think they're ditching it
                       tonight.
          
          A SMALL YACHT APPEARS ON THE HORIZON. Bobby steers the
          motorboat towards it. MILO AND CASS TURN TO LOOK AS THE YACHT
          COMES INTO VIEW. AND AT THE SAME MOMENT, CASS AND MILO MAKE
          OUT THE NAME ON THE SIDE OF THE BOAT:
          
          "SPARROW".
          
                                 BOBBY
                           (CASUALLY)
                       You know, if I was them, I'd store
                       the evidence on a boat, drive the
                       boat about 30 miles out, and blow
                       the whole thing up.
          
          Cass and Milo both slowly turn to find BOBBY POINTING A GUN
          AT THE TWO OF THEM. Off Milo's disappointed look:
          
                                 BOBBY
                       Hey, man. I got mouths to feed.
          
                                                                 103.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Aw. That's what all the dirty cops
                    say.
          
          Bobby quickly frisks Cass, and frisks and disarms Milo. He
          steers the boat one-handed up next to the yacht and cuts the
          motorboats engine.
          
          Milo makes a sudden LUNGE for Bobby and BOBBY CRACKS HIM OVER
          THE BACK OF THE HEAD WITH THE BUTT OF THE GUN, SENDING MILO
          SPRAWLING TO THE BACK OF THE BOAT, RIGHT ON TOP OF THE MOTOR.
          
          Milo struggles back up to a seated position.
          
                              BOBBY
                    You've always been such a stubborn
                    asshole, Milo. You just don't
                    listen. All you had to do was stay
                    where I told you and none of this
                    would have happen. Now the two of
                    you are gonna have to go down with
                    the boat.

          IMAGINABLE: GUNS, VIDEOTAPES, DRUGS, ETC...

          PAN TO MILO AND CASS SEATED ON THE FLOOR, TIED TOGETHER, BACK
          TO BACK, ARMS STRAPPED TO THEIR SIDES.
          
          PAN TO THE DOORWAY, where Bobby stands, inspecting the room.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Ok. Guess that's it. Gotta go.
                    (checking them out) You know what?
                    You guys make a great couple.
          
          Bobby exits and Cass and Milo are alone.
          
          Suddenly, CASS STARTS GIGGLING.
          
                              MILO
                    What's so funny?
          
                              CASS
                    My mom was worried I wouldn't have
                    plans for Xmas Eve.
          
                                                                    104.
          
          
          Cass is laughing harder and harder until MILO REALIZES:
          
                              MILO
                    Hey, are you crying?
          
                              CASS
                        (SOBBING)
                    No. I'm not...
          
          Milo doesn't know what to do. His hands are trapped in front
          of him, he can't even pat her on the shoulder.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, just don't...
          
                              CASS
                    I'm not crying.
          
                              MILO
                    I know you're not.
          
                              CASS
                    I just...(miserable) I can't
                    believe I going to die by being
                    blown up and sinking to the bottom
                    of the ocean with someone who
                    thinks I'm a total liar.
          
                              MILO
                    We're not gonna die.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh yeah? What's the plan?
          
                              MILO
                        (THINKING)
                    Well...
          
          Milo looks around. There is a SMALL PORTHOLE IN ONE WALL.
          Milo assumes a take-charge manner:
          
                              MILO
                    Ok. Here's what we do. We're going
                    to synchronize our efforts in order
                    to cross the room and manipulate
                    the bomb out of the room and into
                    the water in order to diffuse the
                    explosive impact.
          
          Beat.
          
                              CASS
                    You mean we're going to throw the
                    bomb out the window?
          
                                                                105.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Uh, yeah. Or we can just wait to
                    get blown up.
          
          CLOSE ON- THE TIMER: "1:19, 1:18, 1:17..."
          
                              CASS
                        (QUICKLY)
                    I'm with you. Go, team, go.
          
                              MILO
                    That's the spirit. Ok, first we're
                    going sideways: to the left...
          
          Milo leans one way, Cass leans the other: THEY DON'T MOVE.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok. My left this time...
          
          They both lean to the left and topple over. Milo is facing
          the direction of the bomb.
          
                              MILO
                    Now we're gonna work our way over
                    to the bomb.
          
          They start moving like a sideways inchworm, creeping along.
          
                              MILO
                    And I don't think you're a total
                    liar, but in my own defense, I was
                    one of the top detectives in my
                    division, I had been working that
                    case for months, and then you just
                    waltzed in and solved it.
          
                              CASS
                    I didn't just "waltz in". You know
                    I had been working it for months,
                    too. Isn't it possible that we're
                    both good at our jobs, and I just
                    happened to come out ahead?
          
          Beat.
          
                              MILO
                        (FUMBLING)
                    Oh. Well, I...(blurting out) Look,
                    I was confused, I had never been in
                    love before!
          
                              CASS
                    Well, neither had I!
          
                                                                    106.
          
          
          Milo seems surprised to hear this. But before he can respond,
          THE BOAT ROCKS ON A WAVE AND THEY ARE SENT ROLLING IN CASS'
          DIRECTION. AS THEY ROLL:
          
                                CASS
                    Ow...
          
                                MILO
                    Shit..
          
                                CASS
                    Dammit...
          
          They are stopped when MILO'S FACE IS SLAMMED INTO THE SIDE OF
          THE BOAT. Milo lets out a grunt. Beat.
          
                                CASS
                    Milo?
          
                              MILO
                        (MUFFLED)
                    I'm Ok. Ok, we need to turn to the
                    right, and wait for the next wave.
          
          They both start turning separate ways:
          
                                MILO
                    My right.
          
          They turn to the right and wait. After a moment:
          
                              MILO
                    So. You were in love with me?
          
                              CASS
                    Of course I was in love with you,
                    why do you think I married you?
          
          No response. Behind her back, Milo looks sheepish. Cass
          REALIZES:
          
                              CASS
                    Oh. My. God. You think I married
                    you so I could get info on the
                    case? Who am I, Mata Hari?
          
          Milo looks confused. He is trying to figure out...
          
                              CASS
                    She's a spy, Milo.
          
          Aaah.
          
                                                                 107.
          
          
                              MILO
                        (QUICKLY)
                    I know that. Everybody knows that.
                    Mata Hari the spy.
          
          Beat. Milo clears his throat.
          
                              MILO
                    Well. It might be a little late for
                    this. But...nice job on the
                    article.
          
                              CASS
                    You know, if I had something sharp
                    right now, I would stab you.
          
                              MILO
                    No, really, I mean, it was well-
                    written and...
          
                              CASS
                    Can you just get us out of here,
                    please?
          
          Suddenly, A WAVE HITS THE BOAT, AND THEY GO ROLLING TOWARDS
          THE BOMB. AS THEY ROLL:
          
                              CASS
                    Umph...
          
                              MILO
                    Ughh...
          
                              CASS
                    Son of a...
          
                              MILO
                    Ow...
          
          And they come to a stop, MILO'S FACE PRESSED RIGHT UP TO THE
          BOMB. He watches the timer: "00:44, 00:43, 00:42..."
          
                              CASS
                    Can you see the bomb?
          
                               MILO
                    Uh, yeah. I can see the bomb. Now
                    we get up.
          
          MILO GRABS THE BOMB AND HOLDS IT AGAINST HIS BELLY. Cass and
          Milo push against each other, and struggle up to a standing
          position.
          
          Great. So far, so good.
          
                                                                 108.
          
          
          Only, MILO CAN'T RAISE HIS ARMS. AND THE PORTHOLE IS SIX FEET
          ABOVE THE GROUND. NOW WHAT?
          
                              CASS
                    Did you throw it?
          
                              MILO
                    Not exactly.
          
                              CASS
                    Well, what are you waiting for?
          
                              MILO
                    I'm waiting for a pig to fly in
                    here and grab it.
          
                              CASS
                        (starting to panic again)
                    Milo...
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, Ok. Um, on 3, I need you to
                    jump.
          
          Beat.
          
                              CASS
                    What?
          
                              MILO
                    You know: "jump, jump, jump around,
                    jump."
          
                              CASS
                    Are you serious?
          
                              MILO
                    No. I'm fucking with you. For fun.
                    Just for my own personal
                    enjoyment...
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, Ok.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok: 1, 2, 3...
          
          
          EXT PORTHOLE- EVENING
          
          We see MILO'S HEAD POP INTO VIEW, THEN DISAPPEAR.
          
          CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:11, 00:10, 00:09..."

          MILO'S HEAD POPS UP HIGHER...
          
          CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:06, 00:05, 00:04..."
          
          This time, MILO POPS UP HIGH ENOUGH THAT WE SEE HIS HANDS...
          
          CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:03, 00:02, 00:01..."
          
          And finally, MILO IS HIGH ENOUGH THAT HE CAN THRUST THE BOMB
          OUT THE WINDOW...
          
          CLOSE ON THE BOMB AS IT CRASHES INTO THE WATER...
          
          
          INT HULL OF BOAT- EVENING
          
          Milo and Cass, both a little out of breath, stand still,
          listening. Silence.
          
                              CASS
                    Think the water defused it?
          
                              MILO
                    Lemme ask you this? Has anything
                    gone our way yet?
          
          SUDDENLY, A LOW ROAR FROM BENEATH GROWS AND RISES UP BENEATH
          THE BOAT, ROCKING IT WILDLY AS WATER EXPLODES ON ALL SIDES.
          
          Cass and Milo get drenched, BUT ARE SAFE.
          
                                CASS
                    Nice job.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. You, too.
          
                                CASS
                    Thanks.
          
                              MILO
                    Now lets find something to cut
                    these ropes off...
          
                              CASS
                    Think we can catch that cop?
          
                              MILO
                    Trust me: we can definitely catch
                    that cop.
          
          Because at this very moment...
          
                                                                    110.
          
          
          INT MOTORBOAT- NIGHT
          
          ...Bobby is paddling frantically, pausing every once in a
          while to curse the motor, WHICH FOR SOME REASON REFUSES TO
          START. He see the lights of another boat coming up behind
          him, and he paddles faster.
          
          
          EXT DECK OF YACHT- NIGHT
          
          Milo steers the yacht right up behind Bobby, dwarfing the
          motorboat. Calling out:
          
                              MILO
                    Hey, Bobby. I got one for ya...
          
          Bobby looks up to see MILO POINTING AN ASSAULT RIFLE HE
          GRABBED FROM THE EVIDENCE BOXES:
          
                              MILO
                    What's the difference between a
                    snowman and a snowwoman? (holding
                    something up) The spark plug.
          
          Bobby checks the motor: SO THAT'S WHY IT WON'T RUN. MILO
          GRABBED THE SPARK PLUG. Milo and Cass grin down at Bobby
          while he kicks the motor and swears.
          
          
          EXT PIER 19- DAWN
          
          CHIRON: "6:00 AM. PIER 19. 3 HOURS TO GO."
          
          Cops are everywhere. Cass and Milo are seated on a bench,
          exhausted, watching as THE COPS UNLOAD BOXES OF STOLEN
          EVIDENCE FROM THE YACHT. Bobby is cuffed in the back of a
          squad car.
          
          After a moment:
          
                              MILO
                    Merry Xmas. I got you this.
          
          Milo hands Cass some seaweed.
          
                              CASS
                    You shouldn't have.
          
          Milo checks his watch.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. I've still got three hours to
                    get you to jail. Looks like I'm
                    gonna win that bet after all.
          
                                                                  111.
          
          
          Cass' eyes go wide. Suddenly, she JUMPS UP and BOLTS.
          
                              MILO
                        (to himself)
                    You have got to be kidding me.
          
          
          EXT BEACH- DAWN
          
          Like an action sequence in slo-mo, Cass stumbles across the
          sand, exhausted, Milo at her heels. Finally, he makes one
          last effort, LUNGES for her, brings her down and SNAPS on the
          cuffs.
          
                               CASS
                        (muffled, face in the
                         SAND)
                    I'm not going without a fight.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah. I'm getting that.
          
          He pulls her to her feet.
          
          INT JERSEY CITY POLICE STATION- MORNING
          
          Milo leads Cass up to the clerk, both of them looking like a
          mess. He checks his watch:
          
                              MILO
                    9am. See? Easy as pie.(nudging
                    Cass) Go on, say it.
          
                              CASS
                        (to the clerk)
                    I'd like to turn myself in. (can't
                    resist) Though I didn't do anything
                    wrong...
          
                              MILO
                    Stop talking.
          
                              CASS
                    ...and I was unjustly arrested...
          
          To shut her up, Milo GRABS HER AND KISSES HER. THEN SHE IS
          KISSING HIM BACK. TIME STOPS FOR A MOMENT.
          
          Then Milo hands her over to the clerk.
          
                              MILO
                        (to Cass)
                    See ya.

                        (a little disoriented)
                    Oh. Ok.
          
          The clerk leads her into the jail.
          
          
          EXT POLICE STATION- MORNING
          
          Milo exits. He passes some cops on their way in. ONE GELMAN,
          THE COP HE INSULTED IN THE BEGINNING.
          
                              GELMAN
                    Hey. It's that jerk-off bounty
                    hunter.
          
          Milo stops in his tracks. Mentally weighs the pros and cons.
          DECIDES:
          
                              MILO
                    Ah, what the hell.
          
          He turns around, walks back to Gelman, AND SMASHES HIM IN THE
          FACE WITH HIS FIST.

                              MILO
                    Hey. I couldn't let you spend Xmas
                    alone. Besides, I didn't really
                    have any plans other than drinking
                    some cheap whiskey and putting my
                    fist through a wall.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm touched that you would give
                    that up for me.

               DARKNESS. THE SOUND OF WIND AND SPRAY.

               MUSIC. TITLES.

               EXT. OCEAN -- NIGHT

               The darkness is actually water. A SEARCHLIGHT arcs across 
               heavy ocean swells. Half-a-dozen flashlights -- weaker beams -- 
               racing along what we can see is the deck of an aging FISHING 
               TRAWLER.

               FISHERMEN struggling with a gaff -- something in the water --

               A HUMAN CORPSE.

               EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- NIGHT

               THE BODY sprawled there. The Sailors all talking at once -- 
               three languages going -- brave chatter to mask the presence 
               of death --

                                     SAILOR #1
                         -- Jesus, look at him --

                                     SAILOR #2
                         -- what? -- you never saw a dead man 
                         before? --

                                     SAILOR #3
                         -- look, look he was shot --
                              (nudging the body --)

                                     SAILOR #1
                         -- don't, don't do that --

                                     SAILOR #2
                         -- he's dead, you think he cares? --

                                     SAILOR #1
                         -- so have some respect -- it's a --
                              (stopping as --)

               THE BODY MOVES! -- convulsing -- coughing up sea water -- 
               the Sailors -- freaked -- jumping back -- standing there, as --

               THE MAN begins to breathe.

               INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- NIGHT

               A wreck. Too small for all the people in here right now -- 
               SAILORS sweeping off the table -- rough hands laying THE MAN 
               down --

               THE CAPTAIN -- brutal and impatient -- watching from the 
               door as --

               GIANCARLO tears through the clutter -- searching for a medical 
               kit buried in the shambles. GIANCARLO is sixty. A bloodshot 
               soul.

                                     GIANCARLO
                         -- it's here -- hang on -- it's here 
                         somewhere -- give me a minute -- get 
                         some blankets -- get some blankets 
                         on him --
                              (finding the kit --)
                         -- here we go -- here it is --

               GIANCARLO with an old trunk -- just getting it open, as --

                                     THE CAPTAIN
                         Giancarlo.
                              (Giancarlo turns back --)
                         We pick him up? Okay, we have to 
                         pick him up. But that's as far as it 
                         goes.

                                     GIANCARLO
                         He needs a doctor.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Fuck that. He lives? He dies? I don't 
                         care. We've wasted two hours on this 
                         shit already. You do what you can, 
                         but we're not going back.
                              (pure steel now)
                         You understand me?

                                     GIANCARLO
                         Yes, sir.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (to the rest of them)
                         Let's get back to work!

               GIANCARLO watching them run out. Snagging a quick pull on a 
               pint of rum he's got stashed and --

               INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- DAWN -- TIME CUTS

               Transformed into a makeshift operating room. A light swings 
               overhead. THE MAN layed out across the table. Sounds -- groans -- 
               words -- snatches of them -- all in different languages.

               GIANCARLO playing doctor in a greasy kitchen apron. Cutting 
               away the clothes. Turning THE MAN on his side. Two bullet 
               wounds in the back. Probing them, judging them.

               Now -- GIANCARLO with a flashlight in his teeth -- TINK -- 
               TINK -- TINK -- bullet fragments falling into a washed-out 
               olive jar.

               Now -- something catching GIANCARLO'S EYE -- A SCAR ON THE 
               MAN'S HIP -- another fragment -- exacto knife cutting in -- 
               tweezers extracting A SMALL PLASTIC TUBE, not a bullet at 
               all, and as it comes free --

               THE MAN'S HAND SLAMS down onto GIANCARLO'S and we SMASH CUT 
               INTO A --

               FIRST PERSON POV -- we are staring up at --

                                     GIANCARLO
                         You're awake. Can you hear me?
                              (we're blinking --)
                         You've been shot. I'm trying to help 
                         you.
                              (we're trying to find 
                              our voice --)
                         You were in the water. You've been 
                         shot. It's okay now.

                                     THE MAN
                         Where am I?

                                     GIANCARLO
                              (switching to English)
                         You're American. I thought so. From 
                         your teeth -- the dental work --

                                     THE MAN
                         Where am I?

                                     GIANCARLO
                         You're on a boat. A fishing boat. 
                         Italian flag. We're out of Vietri.
                              (he smiles)
                         It's the cold that saved you. The 
                         water. The wounds are clean. I'm not 
                         a doctor, but the wounds, it looks 
                         okay. It's clean.

                                     THE MAN
                         How did I get here?

                                     GIANCARLO
                         You we're lost at sea. They pulled 
                         you out.
                              (we say nothing)
                         Who are you?
                              (still nothing)
                         You were shot -- two bullets -- in 
                         the back. You understand me?
                              (we try to nod)
                         Who are you?

               Long dead pause.

                                     THE MAN
                         I don't know.

               EXT. OCEAN -- DAY

               The Trawler plows through heavy seas.

               INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- DAY

               GIANCARLO is hunched over a desk -- tweezers and flashlight -- 
               busy working at that strange plastic tube that came out of 
               THE MAN's hip.

               THE MAN is bandaged. He's sitting up, and it must hurt like 
               hell, but physical pain is not the thing troubling him right 
               now. He's staring around the room -- at his body -- at the 
               walls -- haunted --

                                     THE MAN
                         What if it doesn't come back?

                                     GIANCARLO
                              (still working that 
                              tube)
                         I told you. You need to rest.

               Silence. THE MAN can't rest. Too busy trying to make sense 
               of all this.

                                     THE MAN
                         I can read. I can read that sign on 
                         the door. I can count. I can talk...
                              (focusing now --)
                         What are you doing?

               GIANCARLO rummaging around -- finding a magnifying glass --

                                     THE MAN
                         What is that?

               INSERT -- MAGNIFIED POV -- a slip of plastic from the tube -- 
               written there -- 000-7-17-12-0-14-26.  GEMEINSCHAFT BANK, 
               ZURICH.

                                     GIANCARLO
                         It came from your hip. Under the 
                         skin.
                              (turning back --)
                         You have a bank in Zurich.
                              (waiting)
                         You remember Zurich?

                                     THE MAN
                         No.

               GIANCARLO staring at him now. Different suddenly. Suspicious.

                                     GIANCARLO
                         Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? 
                         I'm an engineer. Whatever this is, 
                         it's not for me to be involved, okay?

                                     THE MAN
                         I don't remember Zurich.

               GIANCARLO pulls his pint. Takes a hit.

                                     GIANCARLO
                              (offering the bottle --)
                         You drink rum?

                                     THE MAN
                         I don't know.

               EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- NIGHT

               THE MAN stands at the rail, staring out to sea. So lost. He 
               turns to head inside -- there, a surfcasting rod propped 
               against a locker.

               THE MAN picks up the rod -- flips the bail -- traps the line -- 
               now he's casting far out into the darkness. And for the first 
               time, he smiles.

               INT. FISHING BOAT GALLEY -- NIGHT

               A ratty old espresso machine. THE MAN standing there, staring 
               at the thing like it's a test. Then his hands begin to move -- 
               trying to pack a grind -- trying to fit it in -- turning on 
               the steam and --

               The whole thing explodes.

               EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- DAY

               THE MAN alone doing chin-ups on the deck rail. He's still 
               bandaged and the wounds must hurt like hell, but he's pushing 
               himself. Using the pain -- bathing in it -- maybe even hoping 
               that it will hold some answer for him.

               INT. FISHING BOAT GALLEY -- NIGHT

               A chess board. Wooden pieces jumbled in a box. THE MAN 
               hesitates -- takes a black knight from the box -- lingers 
               for a moment -- and then places it on the board. He's off 
               and running. He knows this. Placing pieces faster and faster -- 
               still setting it up, as we --

               INT. FISHING BOAT HEAD -- NIGHT

               One of the ugliest bathrooms on the planet. THE MAN standing 
               before a pitted, tarnished, cataract of a mirror. Staring at 
               himself.

               And then he speaks.

                                     THE MAN
                              (in perfect French)
                         I don't know who I am. Do you know 
                         who I am? Do have any idea who I am?

               And then he stops. Blinks. Wipes away the perspiration just 
               beading on his forehead.

                                     THE MAN
                              (in perfect Dutch)
                         Tell me who I am. If you know who I 
                         am, please stop fucking around and 
                         tell me.

               No answer. Just that face. His face. Who am I?

               And what else is inside there?

               EXT. FISHING BOAT -- DAY

               SAILORS hauling in the nets. THE MAN -- still bandaged, but 
               healing -- working beside them. Earning his keep. Getting 
               healthy.

               EXT. ITALIAN COASTLINE -- DAWN

               A small, colorful fishing village. The trawler motoring in.

               INT. THE FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- SAME TIME

               THE MAN buttoning up borrowed clothes. GIANCARLO pulling 
               some cash from his pocket --

                                     GIANCARLO
                              (offering the money)
                         It's not much, but it should get you 
                         to Switzerland.

                                     THE MAN
                         I won't forget this.

               GIANCARLO gives him a look. Shakes his head, and --

               INT. POKEY ITALIAN TRAIN STATION -- DAY

               The ticket window. THE MAN and a TICKET AGENT.

                                     TICKET AGENT
                         Una sola via?

                                     THE MAN
                         Si. One way. Una sola via.

               EXT. TGV -- DAY

               A HELICOPTER SHOT -- a bullet train speeds through snow- 
               capped Alps. We move in on a window -- and staring out is...

               INT. TGV TRAIN -- DAY

               ...THE MAN. People all around him -- families -- businessmen -- 
               normal people going about their lives. THE MAN turns back to 
               the window, but he's not watching the scenery -- he's looking 
               at his reflection. So lost. His face suddenly plunged into 
               darkness as the train bombs into a tunnel...

               EXT. TRAIN -- NIGHT

               ...and out of the darkness into night and the HELICOPTER 
               SHOT, as the train races toward ZURICH.

               INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

               A VIDEO MONITOR -- FULL FRAME -- meet WOMBOSI. He's an African 
               ex-dictator, think Idi Amin crossed with Mobutu. He's in 
               some sort of throne room. And he's angry. Bodyguards and a 
               translator hovering nervously around him. What this is, is 
               NEWS FOOTAGE -- an interview conducted by a German TV station.

                                     WOMBOSI
                              (he speaks english)
                         ...no, no, no -- the time is not 
                         right, my enemies are too strong. 
                         I'm telling you to wait for this, 
                         you understand? I'm telling you this, 
                         and I'm making a warning to all those 
                         peoples out there that think that my 
                         powers have become so weak that they 
                         can play with me as they wish. You 
                         will see -- I will tell you when the 
                         evidence is clear. Then you will 
                         have a story. My old friends will 
                         hear about themselves.
                              (stopping, freezing 
                              on that image, and --)

               MARSHALL, a CIA bigwig has the remote control. And the floor.

                                     MARSHALL
                         That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking in 
                         Paris the day before yesterday. I'm 
                         sure most of you have a passing 
                         knowledge of Mr. Wombosi. Some of 
                         you on the African desks have worked 
                         with him over the years. Some of you 
                         very closely...

               TWELVE CIA MANDARINS sitting around the table like kids in 
               detention. We will tour the faces as MARSHALL continues, but 
               the guy we're interested in is named WARD ABBOTT. Picture a 
               sawier, slicker John Poindexter.

                                     MARSHALL
                         ...He was an irritation before he 
                         took power. He was a problem when he 
                         was in power. And he's been a disaster 
                         for us in exile.
                              (the tape --)
                         Wombosi likes to send us messages 
                         through the European media. This is 
                         an interview we pulled down from a 
                         local German television station in 
                         Dresden. We've been getting these 
                         little broadsides every couple of 
                         months. He knows this -- he knows 
                         that -- he's writing a book about 
                         the Agency's history in Africa -- 
                         he's going to name names. It's 
                         basically a shakedown...

               ABBOTT'S FACE says this is news to him. HIS HANDS suggest 
               otherwise.

                                     MARSHALL
                         This interview -- and I'll make the 
                         tape available for anyone who wants 
                         it -- he goes on to claim that he 
                         has just survived an assassination 
                         attempt. He says it's us. He says 
                         he's got proof.
                              (beat)
                         The overwhelming negative 
                         ramifications of this should be 
                         obvious.
                              (hard and dry)
                         The Director wants to know if there 
                         is any possible shred of truth in 
                         this accusation.

               Long pause. No hands go up.

               INT. ZURICH TRAIN STATION -- NIGHT

               THE MAN wandering through the terminal. Passing A PIZZA PLACE 
               closing up for the night.

               THE MAN checks his funds. Just enough for one cold slice.

               EXT. ZURICH STREETS -- NIGHT

               THE MAN walking aimlessly.

               EXT. ZURICH PARK -- NIGHT

               THE MAN trying to get comfortable on a bench. It's chilly 
               but this will have to do until morning.

               Just settling in, when --

                                     ZURICH COP #1 (O.S.)
                              (authority German)
                         Can't you read the signs?

               THE MAN turns. TWO ZURICH COPS coming toward him.

                                     ZURICH COP #2
                         On your feet. Let's go. Right now.

               THE MAN makes his feet. They're on top of him now.

                                     ZURICH COP #1
                         The park is closed. There's no 
                         sleeping in the park.

                                     ZURICH COP #2
                         Let's see some identification.

               THE MAN not sure what to do. Eyes moving. Mouth shut.

                                     ZURICH COP #1
                         Come on. Your papers. Let's go.

                                     THE MAN
                         I've lost them. I've...
                              (German now)
                         My papers. They are lost.

                                     ZURICH COP #1
                              (not sympathetic)
                         Okay. Let's go. Put your hands up.

                                     ZURICH COP #2
                              (pulling his nightstick)
                          -- come on -- hands up -- up --

               THE MAN raising his hand slowly -- ZURICH COP #1 reaching up 
               to pat him down --

                                     THE MAN
                         -- look, I'm just trying to sleep 
                         okay? --
                              (German again)
                          -- I just need to sleep --

               ZURICH COP #2 has heard enough -- giving a sharp poke with 
               the nightstick -- into THE MAN's back -- and that's the last 
               thing he'll remember because --

               THE MAN is in motion.

               A single turn -- spinning -- catching COP #2 completely off 
               guard -- the heel of his hand driving up into the guy's throat 
               and --

               COP #1 -- behind him -- trying to reach for his pistol, but 
               THE MAN -- still turning -- all his weight moving in a single 
               fluid attack -- a sweeping kick and --

               COP #1 -- he's falling -- catching the bench -- trying to 
               fight back but -- THE MAN -- like a machine -- just 
               unbelievably fast -- three jackhammer punches -- down-down- 
               down and -- COP #1 -- head slammed into the bench -- blood 
               spraying from his nose -- he's out cold and --

               COP #2 -- writhing on the ground -- gasping for air -- 
               struggling with his holster -- THE MAN -- his foot -- down -- 
               like a vise -- onto COP #2's arm -- shattering the bone -- 
               COP #2 starting to scream, and then silenced because --

               THE MAN -- he's got the pistol -- so fucking fast -- he's 
               got it right up against COP #2's forehead -- right on the 
               edge of pulling the trigger -- he is, he's gonna shoot him --

                                     ZURICH COP #2
                              (gasping, pleading)
                         -- no -- please God no -- please 
                         don't -- please no -- my Go

               -- stopping as --

               THE MAN slams the gun against his temple and --

               This fight is over.

               THE MAN standing there. In the silence. Two unconscious cops 
               at his feet. Blood on his pants. What just happened? How did 
               he do this? And there's THE GUN in his hand. And God, it 
               just feels so natural -- checking it -- stripping it down -- 
               holding it -- aiming it -- like this is something he's done 
               a million times before...

               This is something he definitely knows how to do.

               And then he stops cold. Throwing down the gun. Running off 
               into the darkness --

               INT. TREADSTONE -- DAY

               A deep, inner office. An ops office. Operations. Unlabeled 
               and anonymous. A backwater project center hidden deep within 
               the Langley facility. Utilitarian. Several rooms linked like 
               a suite.

               Small staff. SEVERAL TECHNICIANS. One or two for 
               communications. A couple for research. People are at their 
               posts. And it's all quiet. But they are busy. Quietly urgent. 
               This is a place under siege.

               ZORN is the number two here. Brilliant bloodless lapdog. 
               He's coming through the suite. Coming through quickly. Heading 
               toward the boss's little office at the back --

               TED CONKLIN. Ivy League Ollie North. Buttoned down. Square 
               jaw. Everything tucked away. But there's tension in the air. 
               Work on the desk. Cot in the corner.

                                     CONKLIN
                              (looking up)
                         What?

                                     ZORN
                         Abbott wants to talk.

                                     CONKLIN
                         Tell him we're busy.

                                     ZORN
                         I tried.

               INT. CIA COMMISSARY -- NIGHT

               ABBOTT with coffee. CONKLIN not lingering.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It 
                         looks like rain and I don't have a 
                         thing to wear.

                                     CONKLIN
                         I don't know what we're talking about.

                                     ABBOTT
                         We're talking about Marseille. We're 
                         talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And 
                         I'm asking you if this abortion in 
                         Marseille has anything to do with 
                         Treadstone.
                              (silence)
                         Was this Treadstone?

                                     CONKLIN
                         You're asking me a direct question?

                                     ABBOTT
                         Yes.

                                     CONKLIN
                         I thought you were never going to do 
                         that.

               Silence. Pressure drop.

                                     ABBOTT
                         They're putting together an agency 
                         oversight committee. They're going 
                         to look through everyone's budgets. 
                         Treadstone is a rather sizable line 
                         item in my ledger.
                              (beat)
                         What am I going to do about that?

                                     CONKLIN
                         You'd want to make that go away. 
                         You'd want to remind them that 
                         Treadstone is a training organization. 
                         That it's all theoretical. You'd 
                         want to sign off on that.

                                     ABBOTT
                         And what if I couldn't do that?

                                     CONKLIN
                         Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. 
                         And you'd have to explain how you 
                         let me get this far.
                              (silence)
                         Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, 
                         does it?
                              (Abbott staring)
                         We'll clean up the field. You clean 
                         up your budgets.

               EXT. ZURICH -- DAY

               Morning in the financial district. Upscale. Uptight.

               GEMEINSCHAFT BANK just one of many elegant fortresses on 
               this street. Everything just now opening for business. TWO 
               GUARDS unlocking the front door and --

               THE MAN across the street. Tucked in the shadows. Checking 
               for cops and trouble. Looks clear. He's walking and --

               INT. BANK RECEPTION AREA -- DAY

               Ornate, formidable and tech at the same time.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         Can I help you?

               THE MAN standing before her. Looking very out of place.

                                     THE MAN
                         I'm here about a numbered account.

               THE RECEPTIONIST nods. Pulls a pen and bank card.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                              (instant English)
                         If you'll just enter your account 
                         number here I'll direct you to the 
                         appropriate officer.

               THE MAN takes the pen, as we --

               INT. BANK SECURITY CHECKPOINT -- DAY

               A BIO-METRIC SCANNER. A piece of ultra-tech amidst the 
               Baroque. TWO SERIOUS BANK GUARDS manning the equipment.

               THE MAN standing there, staring down at this machine. 
               Something ominously decisive about this. What if it's him? 
               What if it's not?

                                     BANK GUARD #1
                         They've been waiting your hand, sir...

               THE MAN focuses. Here we go -- BANK GUARD #2 guiding his 
               open palm onto the mirrored scanning surface.

               THE MAN catching his reflection for a moment before a wave 
               of white light passes beneath his hand and now --

               INT. BANK HALLWAY -- DAY

               THE MAN being led by A THIRD GUARD to a special elevator.

               INT. DEEPER INSIDE THE BANK -- DAY

               Elevator doors open. THE MAN steps out. MR. APFEL -- anal 
               Zurich banker -- waiting there.

                                     APFEL
                         Good morning, sir. I assume you're 
                         here about your box.

                                     THE MAN
                         ...yes...
                              (what now?)
                         The box.

               APFEL nods. Gestures down the corridor --

               INT. BANK SAFETY DEPOSIT VIEWING ROOM -- DAY

               Sterile and kind of odd. But total privacy. THE MAN sitting 
               there, as A DEPOSIT GUARD places a large SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX 
               before him. THE GUARD leaves the room. Closing the door behind 
               him.

               THE MAN is alone. And there it is, right in front of him. 
               This is it. Here are the answers. He lifts the lid.

               THE BOX. There's a shallow tray on top. In this tray: a beat-
               up passport in the name of Jason Bourne. A French driver's 
               license with a Parisian address. Credit cards for Jason 
               Bourne.

               THE MAN. Holding these objects close -- as if by holding 
               them he might absorb their essence. Forcing himself to 
               believe. This is him. His picture. There it is. He's Jason 
               Bourne.

                                     BOURNE
                         My name is Jason Bourne.
                              (sounds good)
                         Hi, I'm Jason. Jason Bourne. Jason 
                         Bourne, nice to meet you.

               BACK TO -- THE BOX -- the shallow tray on top. There's 
               Kleenex. Several sets of contact lenses. A knife. A comb. 
               Three sticks of gum. A ring. A pair of sunglasses. A Rolex.

               BOURNE setting these things aside.  Lifting the top tray.  
               Staring into THE DEEP BOTTOM TRAY and --

               First of all...

               MONEY. Lots of it. Ten thousand dollar stacks of hundreds. 
               Lots of them. Close to a million dollars. There's A GUN. A 
               very good gun. Several clips of ammo. And...

               FIVE MORE PASSPORTS. All clean. Crisp. Brand new. All with 
               his photo inside. Five different names. Three different 
               Countries. Each one of these pristine passports clipped to a 
               piece of card stock that says:

               NAME: 
               NATIONALITY: 
               PLACE OF ISSUE: 
               SIGNATURE SAMPLE:

               And a bar code. 
               Two Dutch passports. A French. A South African. A Belgian.

               And...

               There's one piece of card stock still with the paper clip in 
               place. And no passport. This card reads:

               NAME: John Michael Kane 
               NATIONALITY: U.S.A. 
               PLACE OF ISSUE: Paris, France 
               There's a signature sample. 
               And a bar code. But no passport. This one is missing.

               BOURNE sitting there. Trying to push his confusion away.

                                     BOURNE
                         Bourne. My name is Jason Bourne. I 
                         live at 121, Rue de la Jardin, Paris.

               But there's something hollow about this. He came looking for 
               one identity and now he's faced with six. The money... The 
               gun...

               Suddenly, it's all fucked up.

               BOURNE into gear. Looking around the room -- there -- there's 
               a pile of red canvas burn bags in the corner. BOURNE grabbing 
               one -- stuffing everything into it -- everything except...

               The gun. He doesn't want the gun. No guns.

               INT. BANK SAFETY DEPOSIT OUTER AREA -- DAY

               BOURNE is done. Handing the box back to THE DEPOSIT GUARD --

                                     BOURNE
                         I'm trying to think how long it's 
                         been since I was here.

                                     DEPOSIT GUARD
                         I'm not sure. Must be three weeks.

               EXT. STREETS OF ZURICH -- DAY -- VARIOUS SHOTS

               BOURNE exits the bank. The red bag full to its limit. He's 
               walking briskly now. Looking for a taxi. Nothing in sight.

               BOURNE crossing the street. Shit, there's A COP on the corner -- 
               turn -- change pace -- make it look natural --

               BOURNE around a corner. And it's looking good for a moment -- 
               but only a moment -- TWO MORE COPS walking a beat -- walking 
               this way -- turn -- cut -- cross the street --

               BOURNE heading down a boulevard. Trying to look small. Pulse 
               starting to race. Fighting the paranoia. Where the hell is a 
               cab? Turning back fast as A SIREN starts bleeding in from 
               behind him --

               It's just an ambulance.

               BOURNE turning back. Forcing himself to focus. And fuck -- 
               there's A METER MAID, and she's stopped writing up a ticket -- 
               she's staring at him and --

               BOURNE trying not to panic -- don't run -- smile -- stay 
               small -- get to the corner -- scan the options -- but --

               THE METER MAID -- she's watching him go and she's pulling 
               her radio and --

               BOURNE hitting this next corner -- banging a right -- forcing 
               himself not to run -- glancing back and --

               THERE'S ANOTHER COP -- but this one is jogging -- searching -- 
               he's got his radio out and --

               FINALLY TO --

               BOURNE bailing on the street -- disappearing into --

               EXT. U.S. EMBASSY COMPOUND -- DAY

               Big gates. Speed barricades. SEVERAL U.S. MARINES standing 
               guard near a gate house. An American flag. Lots of people 
               coming and going. BOURNE playing it as normal as possible as 
               he heads for the entrance.

               INT. U.S. CONSULATE ZURICH -- VISA ROOM -- DAY

               The passport and visa office. Big room. No windows. Unpleasant 
               on purpose. Two lines: A short one for U.S.  Citizens, a 
               marathon for everyone else. CONSULATE CLERKS stationed in 
               open cubicles along the back wall. And it's a zoo. American 
               tourists who've lost their passports. Foreigners looking for 
               visas. Asylum seekers. Everyone here has a problem.

               BOURNE on the U.S. line. Standing there trying to think. 
               What's he gonna say? What can he say? With the cops outside, 
               and the incident in the park, then the bank...

                                     MARIE (O.S.)
                         -- no, this is not my current address. 
                         It was my current address two days 
                         ago when I started standing in line 
                         outside --

               A NEARBY CUBICLE. Meet MARIE KREUTZ. German. Big energy. 
               Real beauty hidden beneath the armor. And armor it is, because 
               this is a warrior in full, crisis battlemode.

                                     MARIE
                         -- and so now I lost my apartment, I 
                         have no address, and I have no visa, 
                         and you keep telling me how much 
                         help you cannot give me!

               A CONSULATE CLERK caught in her headlights.

                                     CLERK
                         Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna 
                         have to ask you to keep your voice 
                         down.

                                     MARIE
                         All the papers -- all the papers 
                         they asked for -- I brought all the 
                         papers --

                                     CLERK
                         Miss Kreutz, excuse me, but you 
                         entered into a fraudulent marriage 
                         in an effort to circumvent the 
                         immigration laws of the United States --

                                     MARIE
                         You only know that because I told 
                         you!
                              (she's incredulous)
                         Ask the case officer -- find his 
                         name -- it's on the papers -- I told 
                         him all this myself! --
                              (tearing through the 
                              papers now --)

                                     CLERK
                         -- it's not the source of the 
                         information that's important here --

                                     MARIE
                         -- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid 
                         him four thousand dollars -- my last 
                         four thousand dollars to marry me, 
                         okay? -- I told this to the case 
                         officer last week...
                              (she's found it --)
                         ...here -- Mr. Thomas. I told Mr.  
                         Thomas I didn't know this guy was 
                         already married -- I admitted this!

                                     CLERK
                         -- Miss Kreutz, please --

                                     MARIE
                         -- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- 
                         not you -- not the United States 
                         government -- me -- I'm the one being 
                         ripped off!

                                     CLERK
                         So now you're asking for a student 
                         visa?

               That shuts her up. Yes. Today she's a student.

               INT. CIA OFFICE COMPLEX -- NIGHT (BUT SAME TIME)

               Motion -- CONKLIN racing down a staircase -- ZORN chasing 
               after --

                                     CONKLIN
                         -- and they're sure it's him? --

                                     ZORN
                         -- he accessed the account --

                         -- yes, sir, it's confirmed --

               INT. U.S. CONSULATE -- VISA ROOM -- DAY

               BOURNE on line. Fear meter rising by the minute.

               BOURNE'S POV

               Scanning the room -- the perimeter -- the people -- A TURKISH 
               MAN almost in tears as he tries to explain his case to a 
               DESK CLERK -- TWO AMERICAN BACKPACKERS that have lost their 
               passports -- MARIE still in the midst of her madness -- A 
               SECURITY CAMERA high on the wall capturing everything -- 
               lots of data -- too much going on and --

                                     MAN ON LINE (O.S.)
                              (from behind him)
                         You're up.

               BOURNE comes to. Shit. It's his turn.

               A WOMAN CLERK waving him forward. BOURNE trying to think -- 
               what the fuck is he doing? -- what's he gonna say? -- now 
               he's at the window, and if he was looking for a friendly 
               face, he came to the wrong place --

                                     WOMAN CLERK
                              (cold shit)
                         You're a U.S. Citizen?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes.
                              (pause)
                         I mean, I think so. Yes. Yes...

                                     WOMAN CLERK
                         Well, either you are, or you aren't.

                                     BOURNE
                         Right.

                                     WOMAN CLERK
                         You have your passport?

                                     BOURNE
                         I have a passport. I've got...
                              (the bag there, but...)
                         Actually, it's a little complicated.

                                     WOMAN CLERK
                         Do you have your passport, sir?

                                     BOURNE
                         Look, maybe I should just...

                                     WOMAN CLERK
                         Sir, you waited on line.

                                     BOURNE
                         Yeah, I know...

               But he's already bailing, walking away from the woman, the 
               window, the room -- he's out of here --

               INT. U.S. CONSULATE LOBBY -- DAY

               BOURNE on the move -- hustling back toward the lobby -- trying 
               to snag a view out to the street -- there's a window just

               BOURNE'S WINDOW POV -- ZURICH COPS -- outside -- on the street -- 
               half-a-dozen of them lingering around the entry gate and --

               BOURNE stalled for a moment -- options dwindling -- he can't 
               go back to the passport office -- he can't go out the front 
               and --

               The lobby looks tough -- there are two other points of entry 
               into the main building, but they're both guarded by MARINES 
               and METAL DETECTORS --

               As he gets closer -- it gets worse --

               A ZURICH POLICE INSPECTOR near the door, in deep conversation 
               with TWO MARINES and THE EMBASSY SECURITY OFFICER and --

               BOURNE trying to burrow through the human traffic -- trying 
               to get to THE LARGER OF THE TWO ENTRY GATES -- this one the 
               farthest from the front door and the passport office corridor, 
               and it's the most crowded -- A COUPLE PEOPLE lined up here -- 
               waiting for one of THE THREE MARINES STAFFING THIS POST to 
               check their bags and pass them through a metal detector and --

                                     SECURITY CHIEF (O.S.)
                         -- stop! -- stop right there! --

               BOURNE turns back -- as does everyone else in the lobby --

                                     SECURITY CHIEF
                              (from across the lobby)

                         stop right there! -- hands up! --

               BOURNE glancing back -- ONE OF THE GATE MARINES BEHIND HIM --

                         down -- let's go! --

               BOURNE nodding -- total compliance -- starting to drop -- 
               but only starting, because now --

               He's swinging the backpack and --

               THE GUN MARINE -- nailed -- blind-sided -- no chance and --

               BOURNE -- all motion -- all forward -- all perfect -- vaulting 
               the metal detector even as he pulls ONE OF THE PEOPLE ON 
               LINE around to shield his back and --

               ANOTHER GATE MARINE -- right there -- trying to grab him -- 
               making his move -- BOURNE -- almost an afterthought -- his 
               boot -- like a knife -- out of nowhere -- SNAP! -- the guy's 
               arm just shattered and --

               THE SECURITY CHIEF -- freaking out -- TWO MARINES WITH HIM -- 
               they're raising their weapons and there's people in the lobby 
               and --

                         -- no -- no -- hold your fire! --

               BOURNE -- landing hard on THE GUN MARINE -- rolling away 
               from the gate -- into the building now -- coming up with the 
               backpack and --

                                     SOMEONE SCREAMING
                         -- he's got a gun! -- he's got a 
                         gun! --

               And he does -- BOURNE with the M-16! -- coming up with it -- 
               coming up on the move -- swinging it around as he searches 
               for an escape route and THE GUN -- it's like a magic wand of 
               hysteria --

               PEOPLE IN THE LOBBY -- SCREAMING -- diving away -- everyone 
               dropping for cover and --

               Utter confusion -- SECURITY CHIEF -- FIVE -- SIX -- SEVEN 
               ARMED MARINES all piling in -- ready to rock but there's no 
               one to shoot -- no target --

                         go!

               TWO MARINES -- scanning the windows -- looking down and --

               MARINE POV -- all clear -- no way he went down there and --

               EXT. U.S. CONSULATE BUILDING WALL -- DAY

               BOURNE still hanging there -- looking down -- up -- there's 
               no choice -- he has to go down --

               BOURNE finding a toehold below him -- reaching -- touching 
               down -- it gives way -- crumbling and --

               BOURNE hesitates. Does he know how to do this or not? Stalled 
               for a moment, then...

               BOURNE starts climbing down. And this is all one shot. No 
               cutaway. No cheating.

               We are watching a master at work...

               Handhold to a drain pipe. Swinging to a better ledge.

               Dropping to an air-conditioner. Grabbing a window frame just 
               before the air-conditioner gives way. Teetering there. Now 
               he's on the fourth floor.

               Below, there's an open window on the third floor. Struggling 
               to keep his balance, he reaches behind him to shift the weight 
               of the bag, and as he does --

               THE RED BAG falls. Thump. Into the courtyard. Forget the 
               open window. Now he's got to go all the way.

               Timing his next move and --

               He's pushing off -- reaching -- there's another drainpipe 
               and he's snagged it -- he's got a dragline now -- starting 
               to fall -- straining to hold the pipe -- slowing his descent -- 
               the drainpipe pulling away from it's housing and --

               BOURNE letting go -- just before he falls backward -- one 
               last grab -- catching a gutter -- holding it just long enough 
               to slow his fall and --

               Letting go for the last fifteen feet and --

               A LITTLE RED CAR. A beat-to-shit Euro car. A shitty little 
               red car angled in beside a dumpster with a big red Zurich 
               parking ticket on the windshield.

               MARIE grabbing the ticket -- tearing it up -- tearing the 
               shit out of it -- blind with misfortune -- throwing the pieces

                         to drive me to Paris.

                         screaming my head off.

                                     BOURNE
                         You don't want the police any more 
                         than I do.

               BOURNE tosses cash -- a stack of hundreds -- across the car 
               into her hands -- she catches it. Looks at it.

                                     MARIE
                         Jesus...

                                     BOURNE
                         Get me out of here. Please.

               MARIE looking at him. At the money. Back at him, and --

                                     ZORN
                         Zurich police are looking for an 
                         American with a red bag. Apparently 
                         he put two cops in the hospital last 
                         night.

               Silence. Like the floor just fell away. So heavy.

                         What the fuck is he doing?

                         Maybe it's a game. Maybe he's trying 
                         to send us a message.

               The little red car parked. MARIE pacing around. BOURNE poring 
               over a map spread out over the hood.

                                     MARIE
                         So what's in Paris?

                                     BOURNE
                         I want to go home.

                                     MARIE
                         For twenty thousand dollars.

               BOURNE looks back from the map.

                                     BOURNE
                         I said ten thousand.

                                     MARIE
                         You have blood on your pants.

                                     BOURNE
                         Okay.
                              (beat)
                         Twenty thousand. Ten now. Ten there.

                                     MARIE
                         No. No, that was too easy --
                              (pacing away --)

                                     BOURNE
                         Wait up --
                              (after her now --)
                         -- just wait up --

                                     MARIE
                         -- get the fuck out of here -- all 
                         this money, this crazy offer, I mean 
                         give me a fucking break with this, 
                         this is --
                              (stopping because--)

               BOURNE just grabbed her. Both of them shocked that he's done 
               this. He immediately pulls back.

                                     BOURNE
                         Look, I want a ride to Paris.
                              (wide open now)
                         That's all I want. I swear.

                                     MARIE
                         You swear?
                              (cold here)
                         That's great. I feel so much better 
                         now.

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't want anything but a ride. 
                         All I want to do is go home.

               Silence now. She looks back. Measuring him.

                                     MARIE
                         You could buy a car for twenty grand. 
                         You could buy this car.

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't want to go alone. I want you 
                         to drive me to Paris. Like we're a 
                         couple. Like we're a couple and we're 
                         travelling together. That's all we're 
                         doing.

                                     MARIE
                         And I don't get hurt. I get twenty 
                         thousand dollars and I don't get 
                         hurt.

                                     BOURNE
                         I won't hurt you.

                                     MARIE
                         What if I say no?

                                     BOURNE
                         Then I'll find another ride.

               CASTEL through the streets on a motorcycle. Whipping to a

               Darkness -- a key turning -- door opening -- light goes on 
               to reveal CASTEL standing there and we're in --

               CASTEL'S STORAGE UNIT. What's in here? Like nothing. Like a 
               stack of old newspapers in the corner. Some mildewed books 
               piled along one wall. Some shitty plastic chairs.

               QUICK TIME CUTS

               CASTEL working fast. Closing the door. Moving to the pile of 
               books. Taking the top book off. Opening it.

               INSIDE THE BOX -- a timer. A small bomb. A booby-trap. An 
               LED light stops flashing as CASTEL'S HANDS code in his 
               password and --

               CASTEL moving to the newspapers stacked in the corner.  
               Pulling away the top pile and --

               A METAL LOCK BOX. Hidden here. CASTLE pulling it out. Opening 
               it. An empty tray on top and --

               CASTEL taking off his watch. Taking off his rings. Taking 
               out his wallet. His Spanish passport. Emptying his pockets. 
               All of this goes into the empty tray and --

               CASTEL lifting away this top tray -- setting it aside and --

               THE METAL LOCK BOX -- there's more -- a much larger bottom 
               compartment -- and it's deja-vu all over again -- we're 
               looking at the identical contents we saw Bourne find in the 
               Zurich safe-deposit box.

               First of all...

               MONEY. Lots of it. Ten thousand dollar stacks of hundreds. 
               Lots of them. A GUN. A very good gun. A dozen clips of ammo. 
               And FIVE MORE PASSPORTS. All clean. Brand new. All with his 
               photo. Five different names. Four different countries. Each 
               one of these pristine clipped to a piece of card stock that 
               says:

               INT. THE RED CAR -- DUSK

               BOURNE staring out the window. MARIE driving. Long silence 
               until --

                                     MARIE
                         Just so you know, if you're gonna 
                         burn me on the money, you might as 
                         well kill me.
                              (Bourne looks over)
                         I was supposed to have this car back 
                         three days ago. It's not my car.

                                     BOURNE
                         I know that.

               MARIE staring at him -- glancing back to the road -- just in 
               time -- almost rear-ending a slow moving truck --

                                     MARIE
                         Shit --
                              (trying to settle)
                         Can I tell you how much you're 
                         freaking me out? Okay? Because you 
                         are -- you're completely freaking me 
                         out.

                                     BOURNE
                         I'm sorry. Really. What do you want 
                         me to do?

                                     MARIE
                         I don't know. Smile. Sneeze. 
                         Something. You've got a bag full of 
                         money and a ride to Paris. Fuck it, 
                         I don't know...
                              (the radio)
                         What kind of music do you like?

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know.

                                     MARIE
                         What does that mean?

                                     BOURNE
                         Listen to what you want.

                                     MARIE
                              (out of nowhere)
                         Who pays twenty thousand dollars for 
                         a ride to Paris?

               There it is. And she wants an answer --

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know. I don't know who I am.

                                     MARIE
                         Yeah, well, welcome to the club.

                                     BOURNE
                         No. No, I mean, I really don't know 
                         who I am. I can't remember anything 
                         earlier than two weeks ago.
                              (it's not flying)
                         I'm serious.

                                     MARIE
                         What? Like amnesia?

                                     BOURNE
                         Look, go ahead... put the radio on...

                                     MARIE
                         Amnesia?
                              (total incredulity)
                         You're saying you don't remember 
                         anything that happened before two 
                         weeks ago?

                                     BOURNE
                         That's what I'm saying.

                                     MARIE
                              (German)
                         Give me a fucking break.

               BOURNE staring at her. She's furious. She's downshifting -- 
               she's accelerating -- pulling out to pass the truck on a 
               blind turn, as we --

               EXT. ZURICH BANK -- DAY/DUSK

               APFEL emerges from the bank. Leaving work. Turns the corner 
               into a quiet side street and --

               Up ahead, here comes another guy in a suit. It's MANHEIM 
               walking toward us, deep into a cell phone conversation. Barely 
               noticing Apfel as they get closer and --

               As they pass -- MANHEIM -- it's completely out of the blue -- 
               he's jabbing the cellphone down into Apfel's shoulder and --

               APFEL -- no clue -- already clutching at the coronary 
               exploding in his chest -- dead before his body hits the street 
               and --

               MANHEIM -- still walking -- he's never broken stride -- and 
               as he goes he's fiddling with the cellphone and --

               INSERT -- THE CELLPHONE -- MANHEIM'S HANDS working to retract 
               a syringe into the device and --

               MANHEIM striding away. Disappearing into Zurich...

               INT. PARIS MORGUE -- NIGHT

               Not the best morgue in town. Cold tile. A wall of freezers. 
               Death lighting. Now add some color. Meet NYKWANA WOMBOSI in 
               the flesh.

               Meet HIS ENTOURAGE -- eight or ten of his thirty children -- 
               two of his wives -- three of his bodyguards -- the whole 
               crew spread out in this horrible basement room. THE WIVES 
               are chatting. THE KIDS are playing, fighting and eating candy.

               THE BODYGUARDS -- three of them here -- are white. These 
               guys are French/Corsican mercs. Not quite the A-Team. The 
               guy in charge of this ugly little unit is named DEAUVAGE. 
               Into it. Too into it.

               TWO MORGUE ATTENDANTS hanging back. THE MORGUE BOSS -- who's 
               clearly suffering this for a bribe -- moves to one of the 
               freezer lockers...

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                              (French)
                         Okay, Monsieur Kane... number 121...

               And he pulls open FREEZER #121. And thank God we can't see 
               it, because whatever's inside there is clearly horrible. THE 
               MORGUE BOSS barely takes a glance, standing back as quickly 
               as possible.

               DEAUVAGE -- lead bodyguard -- moves to clear a zone for his 
               boss --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         Get the fuck out of my way --
                              (pushing Deauvage 
                              aside --)

               WOMBOSI moves to the freezer box. Stares down. As if it were 
               nothing. He's seen -- he's made -- much, much worse. And now 
               he reaches down into the box -- hands on -- literally feeling 
               around this dead, awful corpse with his bare hands -- feeling 
               around for something -- feeling and feeling and not finding --

                                     WOMBOSI
                              (turning to Deauvage --)
                         It's not him.

               DEAUVAGE looking pale as WOMBOSI slams shut the freezer.

                                     WOMBOSI
                              (quiet hard fury)
                         So who's crazy now?

               EXT. PARIS STREET -- NIGHT

               A MINI-MOTORCADE driving towards Neuilly. Two security cars. 
               A van full of kids and mothers. And one big Mercedes stretch.

               INT. THE MERCEDES STRETCH LIMO -- NIGHT

               WOMBOSI alone in the back. Looking haunted.

               INT. TRUCKSTOP CAFE -- NIGHT

               It's a weird spot. Open all night. But Euro-style. Quiet 
               tonight. A few Alpen-truckers chowing down. A local or two 
               at the bar and --

               BOURNE AND MARIE at a back table. Drinking coffee. He's got 
               the red bag open. All the passports -- the personal junk -- 
               the money -- all the shit from the Zurich bank box -- he's 
               been showing it to her --

               And he's got her attention now.

                                     MARIE
                         And you have no idea -- not a clue -- 
                         what came before that?

                                     BOURNE
                         No.

                                     MARIE
                         When you think of it, before the 
                         ship -- before you wake up on the 
                         ship, what do you see?

                                     BOURNE
                         Nothing. It's just not there.

                                     MARIE
                         Well, this is great.
                              (she sits back)
                         I'm sick of myself and you have no 
                         idea who you are.

                                     BOURNE
                         I kept trying things, I thought if I 
                         could find all the things I could 
                         do, I could --

                                     MARIE
                         -- you could put it together --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- which was okay for a while, I was 
                         okay with it...
                              (hesitating now)
                         But then -- there's all these other 
                         things -- all these other things I 
                         know how to do -- and this -- this 
                         stuff from the bank and...
                              (suddenly flat out --)
                         I think something bad happened.

                                     MARIE
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know.

                                     MARIE
                         Sounds like you were in an accident 
                         or something.

                                     BOURNE
                         I was shot twice in the back.

                                     MARIE
                         Okay, so you're a victim.

                                     BOURNE
                         There was a gun. Who has a safe 
                         deposit box with a gun and all this 
                         money and all these passports?

                                     MARIE
                         Lots of people have guns. You're 
                         American. Americans love guns.

                                     BOURNE
                         I fought my way out of an embassy.  
                         I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- 
                         I went out the window and I was doing 
                         it -- I just did it. I knew how to 
                         do it.

                                     MARIE
                         People do amazing things when they're 
                         scared.

                                     BOURNE
                         Why do I? -- I come in here -- 
                         instinctively -- first thing I do -- 
                         I'm looking for the exit -- I'm 
                         catching the sightlines -- I know I 
                         can't sit with my back to the door --

                                     MARIE
                         You're paranoid. You were shot. It's 
                         natural.

               She's not listening. He leans in. Flat out now.

                                     BOURNE
                         I can tell you the license plate 
                         numbers of all three cars out front. 
                         I can tell you that the waitress is 
                         left-handed and the guy at the counter 
                         weighs two-hundred and fifteen pounds 
                         and knows how to handle himself. I 
                         know that the best, first place to 
                         look for a gun is the cab of that 
                         grey truck outside. I know that at 
                         this altitude I can run flat out for 
                         half a mile before I lose my edge. I 
                         knew that you were my first, best 
                         option out of Zurich? How do I know 
                         all that? How can I know all that 
                         and not know who I am? How is that 
                         possible?

               Long dead pause.

                                     MARIE
                         God, you're not kidding, are you?

               INT. TREADSTONE RESEARCH DESK -- DAY

               BOURNE'S FACE -- a video image frozen on A COMPUTER SCREEN -- 
               it's Bourne looking at the camera -- Bourne looking up at 
               the camera in the consulate passport office and --

                         What do they have on the streets? 
                         The area. They must have something.

                         Abbott. He knows about the embassy. 
                         He's coming down for a show and tell.

               EXT. ZURICH AIRPORT HOTEL -- NIGHT

               A drone barn. Practically on the runway.

               INT. ZURICH AIRPORT HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

               One of those rooms. Just a plain functional box. MANHEIM 
               laying on the bed. Fully dressed. Suit and tie. Just laying 
               there, staring at the ceiling. Who knows how long he's been 
               like this.

               Just waiting.

               ON THE NIGHTSTAND -- A gun. A knife. His e-phone pager. His 
               fresh credentials. And a photo of Jason Bourne.

               INT. WOMBOSI'S PARIS COMPOUND -- NIGHT

               Quick orientation: Picture a heavily-walled palace just off 
               the Bois Du Boulogne. But once inside you could be back in 
               Brazzaville. It's just a buffet of oddness. Home to fifty 
               children and nine wives. The decor blends money and nouveau 
               riche materialism with a hard, back-home tribal esthetic. 
               It's a visual treat. Not condescending or stupid, but flat-
               out strange and menacing.

               It's late. And the palace is dark and sleepy now, but carry 
               all that through this next series of quick shots --

               WOMBOSI HOUSE SECURITY STATION

               Just inside the door. BODYGUARD #1 slouched before a bank of 
               SECURITY MONITORS.

               WOMBOSI MAIN HALLWAY

               Littered with toys. Children's crap everywhere. BODYGUARD 
               #3. Snoozing on a Louis Quatorze chair draped with African 
               cloth.

               WOMBOSI THRONE ROOM DOORS

               DEAUVAGE -- head bodyguard -- posted outside this imposing 
               set of doors. He's trying to stay awake. Reading a spy 
               thriller.

               FINALLY TO

               WOMBOSI'S THRONE ROOM

               And there he is -- the emperor himself -- WOMBOSI on his 
               throne. Except the room is dark and empty. And he's sitting 
               there by himself. A king without a country.

               Sitting there. With a gun in his lap. Drinking hard from a 
               bottle of Jack Daniels.

               Stewing.

               EXT. FRENCH ROADSIDE -- DAWN

               Beautiful morning. The red car parked along the road. BOURNE 
               alone in the passenger seat. Deep asleep. Nestled there.

               And then, he wakes suddenly. Starts. Freaked for a moment. 
               Instantly feeling for the red bag. There it is in his lap. 
               He looks around and --

               MARIE sitting away from the car. She's got a loaf of bread. 
               A soda. Smoking a butt. Same clothes, but her make-up's been 
               washed away. Clean. Simple. Gorgeous.

               BOURNE steps out. Morning legs.

                                     MARIE
                         I needed a break.

                                     BOURNE
                         Where are we?

                                     MARIE
                         We're about an hour away.

                                     BOURNE
                         I can't believe I slept.

                                     MARIE
                         You were tired. Here...
                              (bread and soda --)
                         For twenty-thousand I like to throw 
                         in breakfast.
                              (he takes it)
                         So what do you dream about?

                                     BOURNE
                         I dream I'm asleep. I dream that I'm 
                         asleep and I can't wake up.
                              (he takes a hit from 
                              her smoke and coughs --)
                         I don't think I smoke.

               Another silence. She's watching him.

                                     MARIE
                         You ever think maybe you have a 
                         family?

                                     BOURNE
                         I thought about it. I don't know.

               She looks away. Was she hoping for another answer?

                                     MARIE
                         I guess it's like Christmas every 
                         day for you, huh?

               INT. TREADSTONE CONKLIN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               MARIE'S FACE -- A PASSPORT PHOTO -- she's eighteen -- she's 
               smiling -- really alive and fresh and --

               CONKLIN behind his desk. ABBOTT staring grimly at the picture --

                                     ABBOTT
                         Who is she?

                                     ZORN
                         Marie Helene Kreutz. She's twenty- 
                         six. Born outside Munich. Father was 
                         a welder. He died in '91. We don't 
                         have the mother. There might be a 
                         step-sister, we're trying to track 
                         that down.
                              (apologetic)
                         It's tough. She's a wanderer. She 
                         pops up on the grid here and there 
                         but... I mean, the last time she 
                         paid an electric bill in Europe was 
                         '94. No taxes. No steady employer. 
                         She's got three arrests. Two 
                         shoplifting cases, one in Spain, one 
                         in Germany. And she actually did 
                         three months in an Italian detention 
                         center for credit card fraud.

                                     ABBOTT
                         No political affiliations?

                                     CONKLIN
                         She's a gypsy. If it's a cover, it's 
                         a great one.

                                     ABBOTT
                         I'm assuming we're exploring that 
                         possibility.

                                     CONKLIN
                         We're exploring every possibility.
                              (tighter by the moment)
                         We are in pursuit. How much more do 
                         you want me to tell you?

                                     ABBOTT
                         Pursuit would indicate that you know 
                         exactly where he is.

                                     CONKLIN
                         No. Pursuit ends when we know exactly 
                         where he is.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Yes, well, I think we need some fresh 
                         eyes on this problem. I'm bringing 
                         in some people from upstairs.

               CONKLIN hesitates. Inside he's screaming.

                                     CONKLIN
                         We've been down here for two weeks 
                         banging our heads against the wall. 
                         We've been sleeping down here. We 
                         just got our first lead fourteen 
                         hours ago, and now? -- now that we 
                         finally have something to work with -- 
                         you want to bring planning personnel 
                         down here?
                              (real steam)
                         I'd rethink that.

                                     ABBOTT
                         I want a second opinion.

                                     CONKLIN
                         This is an operations desk.

                                     ABBOTT
                         I'm not asking.

               EXT. PARIS STREET NEAR BOURNE'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               THE LITTLE RED CAR cruising through town.

               INT. THE LITTLE RED CAR -- DAY

               MARIE driving. BOURNE checking building numbers as they pass --

                                     BOURNE
                         Slow down. No, don't stop. Just...

                                     MARIE
                              (looking over)
                         That's it? Is that it?

               AN APARTMENT BUILDING. Big building. Elegant but cold.

                                     BOURNE
                         Four-fifty. That's the address...

                                     MARIE
                         Looks familiar?

                                     BOURNE
                         No.
                              (staring back as they 
                              pass --)
                         No. Go around. Keep going...

               MARIE pulling up -- turning a corner -- watching him as she 
               does. But he's pre-occupied -- eyes scanning -- taking it 
               all in --

                                     MARIE
                         Where?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yeah. Pull in here. Park it.

               MARIE angles into an alleyway. Cuts the engine.

                                     MARIE
                         So this is it, right?

                                     BOURNE
                         I guess.

               Dead pause. She's waiting. He's still scanning the street.

                                     MARIE
                         I should go.

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't remember any of this.

                                     MARIE
                         Jason...

               He turns back. She's staring at him.

                                     BOURNE
                         Sorry. The money, right?

               Before she can say anything, he's digging in the backpack. 
               He pulls out another stack of hundreds. Hands it over. She 
               takes it. It's not what she wanted, but she's used to being 
               disappointed. Fighting it.

                                     MARIE
                         Okay, so...

                                     BOURNE
                         Thanks for the ride.

                                     MARIE
                         Anytime.

               Silence. That moment. He focuses. Getting it.

                                     BOURNE
                         Look, I don't know what's up there.

                                     MARIE
                         You got me pretty fucking curious.

                                     BOURNE
                         Look, you could come up. Or you could 
                         wait if you want. I could go check 
                         it out. You could wait.

                                     MARIE
                         Nah...
                              (hide the pain)
                         With you, I mean, you'd probably 
                         just forget about me, right?

                                     BOURNE
                         How could I forget about you?
                              (he smiles)
                         You're the only person I know.

               MARIE smiles. We've never seen it before. Worth waiting for.

               INT. PARIS APARTMENT BUILDING FOYER -- NIGHT

               BOURNE and MARIE standing at the directory. Five apartments. 
               One per floor. Five names. A buzzer. An intercom. There it 
               is.

               J. Bourne.

               BOURNE presses the buzzer. After a moment, he presses again. 
               Nothing.

                                     MARIE
                         I guess you're not home.

               BOURNE checking the door. How to pop it open? Just about to 
               get into it, when --

                                     CONCIERGE (O.S.)
                              (from the shadows 
                              inside --)
                         Monsieur Bourne...I'm coming...

               THE CONCIERGE is sixty. Plump and proper.

                                     CONCIERGE
                              (opening the door --)
                         Mr. Bourne, there you are -- I was 
                         wondering -- I haven't seen you --

                                     BOURNE
                         Here I am.

               THE CONCIERGE looking at BOURNE like maybe she's never seen 
               him look like this before. And she's looking at MARIE like 
               here's the reason her tenant looks like such shit.

                                     BOURNE
                              (he tries a smile)
                          I seem to have lost my key.

               THE CONCIERGE nods. Instant chilly disapproval.

                                     CONCIERGE
                         I've been ringing your bell. It's 
                         good you were away. We had some 
                         trouble with the hot water. It's 
                         been repaired.

                                     BOURNE
                         Great. We could use a shower.
                              (they look like shit --)
                         It was a long drive.

               THE CONCIERGE steps aside and --

               INT. PARIS APARTMENT FIFTH FLOOR LANDING -- DAY

               BOURNE and MARIE at the apartment threshold. He has a key 
               now.

               Turning it. And the door opens...

               Nothing...

               No bombs. No wife and kids. No one.

               INT. PARIS APARTMENT -- DAY

               A huge, rambling flat. Large entry hallway. Large rooms beyond 
               that. It's obviously expensive. But cold. Completely 
               impersonal. No photographs. No mementoes. No human history.

               WE'RE MOVING NOW

               THE LIVING ROOM

               BOURNE and MARIE exploring.

                                     MARIE
                         It's big.

               BOURNE silent. Struggling to get a feel for the place.

                                     MARIE
                         This is like a real apartment.
                              (she likes it)
                         This is really yours?

                                     BOURNE
                         I guess so.

               MARIE taking it in fast. BOURNE seems paralyzed. Trying to 
               soak it all in. Willing himself home. Touching things as he 
               passes. As if a texture, a smell -- something will become 
               familiar. He's deep into this as we go to --

               THE BEDROOM

               MARIE in the doorway. Checking it out. It's so clean and 
               simple. But it's not the decor she's most interested in...

               MARIE opening an armoire...

               Nothing but men's clothes. No competition. She's feeling 
               better by the moment as we go to --

               THE KITCHEN

               Like a stage set. Lots of props and no sign of food. BOURNE 
               picking up a frying pan.

                                     BOURNE
                         This is my frying pan.
                              (and then --)
                         This is my spoon.
                              (trying harder)
                         I'm Jason Bourne and this is my 
                         kitchen.

               THE MASTER BATHROOM

               MARIE still on the prowl. Mirror city. Big tub. One 
               toothbrush.

               AN OFFICE STUDY

               There's a desk. Chair. Phone. Basic. BOURNE with a folder in 
               his hand. Staring at the bookshelves. Binders, reference 
               materials and hardbound volumes -- all of it about maritime 
               law. Ship schedules. Registry catalogs. All about boats.

                                     MARIE
                         This is your office?
                              (from the doorway)
                         God, you live like a monk...

                                     BOURNE
                         All this stuff -- it's all about 
                         boats.
                              (looking up)
                         I think I'm in the shipping business.

                                     MARIE
                         See. It's starting to come back, 
                         yeah?
                              (he sort of nods)
                         You mind if I take a bath?

                                     BOURNE
                         Go ahead.

               MARIE backs out. BOURNE alone again. Standing there for a 
               moment. Dealing with it.

               And then he sits down in a chair.

               BOURNE sitting there. Staring. The room, the desk -- it's 
               all so devoid of personality. And then, something catches 
               his eye and --

               INSERT -- THE DESK TOP -- a faint silhouette through the 
               dust and grime. Outlines of where a computer used to sit.

               BOURNE reaching suddenly under the desk. Bingo. Pulling out 
               a retractable computer keyboard tray. But it's empty. No 
               keyboard. Now he's really confused and --

               INSERT -- A PHONE/ANSWERING MACHINE -- BOURNE pressing the 
               playback button and --

                                     PHONE MACHINE
                         "You have no messages."

               BOURNE leaving that for a moment -- about to anyway -- and 
               then he turns back -- new idea -- pressing for the speaker 
               phone -- and then hitting redial and --

               THE PHONE stars dialing...

               RINGING and...

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         Bonjour, Hotel Marboeuf...

               BOURNE quick grabbing the receiver. Taking it off speakerphone 
               and --

                                     BOURNE
                         ...yes -- oui -- uh...

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         Yes, sir. Hotel Marboeuf, Paris.  
                         How can I direct your call?

                                     BOURNE
                         Paris?

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         Yes, sir...
                              (switching to English, 
                              thinking that's his 
                              problem --)
                         How can I help you?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason 
                         Bourne.

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         One moment, please...
                              (a long pause, and 
                              then --)
                         I'm afraid, I have no one by that 
                         name registered, sir.

                                     BOURNE
                         D'accord... Merci.
                              (about to hang up--)
                         Un moment -- un moment --

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         -- sir? --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- hang on -- I need you to check 
                         another name for me -- hang on -- un 
                         moment, s'il vous plait --

               BOURNE grabbing the backpack -- tearing through it -- where 
               is it? -- where is it? -- shit and money falling out and --

               There it is -- from the safe-deposit box -- that piece of 
               card stock -- the one with no passport attached to it --

                                     BOURNE
                              (reading it)
                         Kane. Do you have Mr. John Michael 
                         Kane?

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         One moment, sir.

               BOURNE waiting. And then there's muzak -- holding music and --

               THE MASTER BATHROOM

               Water running in the tub. MARIE pulling off her boots. 
               Checking the temperature.

               THE OFFICE STUDY

               Bourne still on hold. And then --

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                              (a new voice suddenly)
                         Bonjour? Monsieur? Allo...

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes, I'm here...

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         You call about Monsieur Kane? John 
                         Michael Kane?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes. Is he there?

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         You are a friend of his?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes.

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         I have some very bad news for you, 
                         sir. I'm terrible sorry to have to 
                         tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has 
                         passed away almost two weeks ago...

               Silence. BOURNE is rocked. But the Manager, it's natural, he 
               interprets the silence as grief...

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         There was an accident. On the 
                         motorway. Apparently, he was killed 
                         instantly. Really, I'm terrible sorry 
                         to be the one to tell you this...

                                     BOURNE
                         ...I understand...

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         ...we actually, we were unaware for 
                         several days that this had happened. 
                         When they came for his things, it 
                         was made known for us, you see?

                                     BOURNE
                         Who? Who came?

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         His brother. You know his brother?

                                     BOURNE
                         Right. Yes. Of course.

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         It's very bad this. Terrible sad. 
                         Such a young man.

                                     BOURNE
                         Do you -- his brother -- do you have 
                         a phone number?

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         I think not...
                              (quick French to 
                              someone in the office 
                              there --)
                         No, I'm sorry. It was very sudden. 
                         He was here very briefly.

               BOURNE just hands up the phone. Just like that. Not even 
               goodbye. Standing there frozen. Stunned. John Michael Kane 
               is dead. And he had the passport.

               Suddenly, everything's changed. They shouldn't be here. This 
               is bad. Danger.

               THE MASTER BATHROOM

               MARIE playing with her hair in the mirror. Checking the water --

                                     MARIE
                              (calling out to him --)
                         She wasn't kidding about the water. 
                         It's freezing.

               THE OFFICE

               BOURNE frozen there. On alert. He forces a smile. Decoy mood.

                                     BOURNE
                         Hang on. I'll check the kitchen...
                              (moving out of the 
                              office --)
                         Maybe it takes a while to get all 
                         the way upstairs.

               THE KITCHEN

               BOURNE moving to the sink. He's smiling. Upbeat. But it's an 
               act. His eyes are everywhere. Turning on the water. But 
               ignoring it. What he's really doing is searching out a weapon. 
               Pulling A KNIFE very quietly from behind the stove. Holding 
               it. Feels pretty comfortable. Hiding it down by his side. On 
               the move again, now --

                                     BOURNE
                         Yeah, it's cold in here, too...
                              (calling to her as he 
                              goes --)
                         Let's give it another minute.

               BOURNE like we've ever seen him. Like an animal. Every sound -- 
               every breeze -- everything carries information.

               Standing still. Taking it all in.

               Real quick layout -- there's big windows along one wall that 
               face out to the street below. The hallway to the bedroom and 
               bath feeds into the living room from one side. There is a 
               large frosted airshaft window along that hallway wall. Simple 
               furniture.

                                     MARIE
                              (suddenly --)
                         -- omigod! --
                              (she's behind him --)
                         -- what're you? -- no -- no --

               MARIE backing away -- completely freaked -- BOURNE standing 
               there with the knife in his hand and --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- no -- Marie -- no! -- it's not 
                         like that --

                                     MARIE
                         -- please -- Jason -- omigod --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- quiet -- quiet --

               MARIE -- frightened -- confused -- paralyzed for a moment --

               BOURNE glancing back -- a curtain fluttering behind him -- 
               motioning for MARIE to get down -- do it -- now -- down!

               MARIE hesitating and --

               BOURNE -- what's he doing? -- he's unscrewing a lightbulb 
               from a lamp beside him and --

               MARIE about to say something -- he shakes her off --

               BOURNE -- knife in one hand -- lightbulb in the other -- 
               putting his foot on a chair in front of him and --

                                     MARIE
                         ...what are you doing?...

               BOURNE waving her to shut up -- crawl -- now -- back up -- 
               get under the window -- go! --

               MARIE -- he seems so sure -- it's weird, but she's doing it -- 
               she's under that frosted window -- down below the sill -- 
               looking back -- what the fuck is he doing now? --

               BOURNE -- the lightbulb -- he's tossing it across the room -- 
               over her head -- into that frosted window and --

               As she ducks down --

               As it SHATTERS --

               EVERYTHING STARTS HAPPENING AT ONCE

               PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT! -- silenced automatic 
               weapons fire -- raking into the apartment and --

               THE FROSTED WINDOW peppered with holes and --

               MARIE on the floor as THE WINDOW SHATTERS above her and --

               CASTEL -- he's in the airshaft! -- hanging from an abseil 
               rope -- but off guard -- FIRING BLIND -- strafing the 
               apartment and --

               BOURNE kicking that chair across the room and --

               CASTEL reacting -- instinct -- moving target --

               THE CHAIR just strafed to shit and --

               BOURNE rolling away and --

               CASTEL -- he's coming in -- last pieces of window frame 
               CRASHING AWAY as he swings into the apartment and --

               MARIE -- right below him -- shit raining down as he flies in 
               and --

               BOURNE throwing the knife and --

               CASTEL -- turning -- too late -- the knife catching him in 
               the neck and --

               BOURNE -- in motion -- attacking and --

               CASTEL -- knife impaled in his neck -- clawing for it with 
               one hand -- trying to get off a shot and --

               APARTMENT WALL -- PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT! -- gunfire 
               tearing wildly around the room and --

               BOURNE -- full-stop -- kicking the gun -- kicking it up -- 
               ROUNDS TEARING ACROSS THE CEILING and --

               MARIE -- SCREAMING NOW -- trying to crawl away and --

               CASTEL -- no chance -- off balance -- BOURNE -- his open 
               palm driving up into CASTEL'S JAW -- the body wants to fall 
               backward, but BOURNE has the guy's arm in his free hand -- 
               jerking it like rope -- tearing it from it's socket and --

               THE GUN CLATTERING FREE across the floor and --

               BOURNE -- his knee -- like a piston -- hard into CASTEL'S 
               GUT -- and then down -- his foot -- down into CASTEL'S KNEE, 
               shattering it and --

               CASTEL is on the floor -- stunned -- wiped -- knife pouring 
               blood from his neck -- arm hanging like a rag doll -- bone 
               torn through his pant leg above the knee and --

                                     MARIE
                         omigod -- omigod -- what're you doing? -- 
                         what're you doing? --
                              (incoherent fear and 
                              confusion, German 
                              and English and--)
                         -- what is he? -- what've you? -- 
                         omigod -- what is this? --

               BOURNE ignoring her -- grabbing the guy's backpack --

                                     MARIE
                         -- what're you doing? -- Jason, 
                         please, tell me what's happening!

                                     BOURNE
                         Open it --
                              (tossing Castel's 
                              backpack behind him --)
                         -- do it -- what's he got in there?

               CASTEL -- eyes wild -- tries to make his feet --

                                     BOURNE
                         Who are you?
                              (kicking him down--)
                         -- who are you?

               CASTEL -- crablike against a wall -- bloody hands leaving a 
               mess as he struggles to get to his feet --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- who are you? -- tell me who you 
                         are -- who sent you? --
                              (bearing down)
                         -- what is this about? -- YOU'VE GOT 
                         TO TELL ME WHAT THIS IS ABOUT! --

               CASTEL -- staring back -- eyes wild -- mouth shut -- his 
               expression -- is it terror or pure steel? --

                                     BOURNE
                         WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?

                                     MARIE
                              (suddenly from behind)
                         ...omigod, no...

               MARIE -- the guy's backpack -- something in her hand -- and 
               as freaked out as she was a moment ago -- this is worse --

                                     BOURNE
                         What? -- what? --
                              (attention split --)
                         -- what is it?

                                     MARIE
                         ...this is my picture... he's got my 
                         picture --
                              (holding it up, in 
                              horror --)
                         -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- 
                         this... this... this is yesterday --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- just --

                                     MARIE
                         -- where does this come from? --
                              (to Castel)
                         How do you have my picture?

                                     BOURNE
                         Marie, just --
                              (waving her back --)
                         -- just stay there! -- just --

                                     MARIE
                         -- he's got my picture! -- this is 
                         yesterday! -- this is me! --
                              (out of control now --)
                         -- where did you get my picture? --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- let me do this, okay? --

                                     MARIE
                         -- do what? -- what are you doing? -- 
                         he's got my picture --
                              (just apoplectic --)
                         -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- 
                         he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- 
                         look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- 
                         omigod --

               Now there's KNOCKING AT THE DOOR and --

                                     THE CONCIERGE
                              (muffled but urgent)
                         Mister Bourne! Mister Bourne! What's 
                         going on? Is everything all right in 
                         there?
                              (-- and she keeps 
                              banging and --)

               MARIE is past the point of rationality and CASTEL is bleeding 
               and shaking and BOURNE is trying to think and it's just 
               impossible and --

               Suddenly -- CASTEL is moving! -- and fast -- it's superhuman -- 
               unbelievable -- just enough spring in his good leg and --

               BOURNE bracing himself but --

               CASTEL isn't attacking! -- he's running away -- he's crossing 
               the living room -- but there's nowhere to go -- absolutely 
               nowhere -- except --

               THE WINDOW

               CASTEL hurling himself into the glass and --

               EXT. THE PARIS APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY

               WINDOW SHATTERING! -- CASTEL -- in a cloud of broken glass -- 
               sixty feet above the street --

               Falling and falling and...

               IMPACT! -- landing on the roof of a parked car and --

               INT. THE PARIS APARTMENT -- DAY

               THE APARTMENT -- BOURNE in motion -- five things at once -- 
               checking the window -- kicking the gun away -- grabbing the 
               red bag -- grabbing what he can -- no time to spare and --

                                     THE CONCIERGE
                              (still outside the 
                              door--)
                         --I'm calling the police, Mr.  Bourne -- 
                         you give me no choice -- I'm calling 
                         them right away! --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- your shoes -- Marie! -- where? -- 
                         where are your shoes? -- Marie --

               MARIE standing there in utter shock -- paralyzed -- the 
               picture in her hand -- the broken glass -- all of what just 
               happened --

                                     MARIE
                         He's dead isn't he?

                                     BOURNE
                         Marie -- look at me -- there's no 
                         time for this --

                                     MARIE
                         He went out the window -- why? -- 
                         why would someone do that?

                                     BOURNE
                         -- we can't stay here -- I can't 
                         stay here -- it's not safe here --

                                     MARIE
                         He came to kill us.

                                     BOURNE
                         -- we can go -- I can get us out of 
                         here -- but we have to go now --

                                     MARIE
                         You knew he was coming.

                                     BOURNE
                         No.

                                     MARIE
                         I trusted you.

                                     BOURNE
                         You're wrong. I didn't know.

                                     MARIE
                         I don't trust anybody and I trusted 
                         you!

                                     BOURNE
                         I didn't know this would happen.

                                     MARIE
                         He had my picture! He knew I was 
                         here! He came here to kill us!

                                     BOURNE
                         And where is he now?
                              (that gets her quiet)
                         You believe what you want, but I'm 
                         telling you the truth -- I never 
                         would have brought you here if I 
                         thought it was dangerous.

                                     MARIE
                              (totally overwhelmed)
                         Oh, Jesus...

                                     BOURNE
                         You stay -- if you want, you stay -- 
                         it's okay -- it's better -- maybe 
                         it's better -- I don't know --
                              (starting to back 
                              away --)
                         But I can't stay here. I can't.

                                     MARIE
                         But the police --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- there's no time --

                                     MARIE
                         -- we'll explain it --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- how? --

                                     MARIE
                         -- there's two of us -- we'll tell 
                         them -- we'll just --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- forget it --

                                     MARIE
                         -- we'll tell them what happened --

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know what happened!
                              (huge here)
                         I don't know who he is! I don't know 
                         what he wants! I don't even know who 
                         I am! The only thing I know is that 
                         if I stay here, I'm never gonna find 
                         out!

               BOURNE -- that's it -- grabbing the backpack -- pulling it 
               on -- just about to make his move --

               She's standing there. Just utterly swamped. Lost.

                                     BOURNE
                         Come with me.
                              (she turns back, he's 
                              waiting --)
                         I can get us out of here. I know it. 
                         Then we can think. Then we can work 
                         it out. We'll explain it then.  Once 
                         we're safe.
                              (rock solid)
                         I can protect you.

               EXT. THE PARIS APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY

               A CROWD is gathered around CASTEL'S BODY. Rubberneckers and 
               people pointing up to the broken window -- THE CONCIERGE 
               running out to the street and getting the news and THE SOUND 
               OF SIRENS bleeding in from the distance and --

               THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO FIND

               THE LITTLE RED CAR pulling out of the alley. Turning away 
               from the scene. Disappearing into the streets of Paris --

               INT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND MAIN HALLWAY -- DAY

               THRONE ROOM DOORS flying open -- WOMBOSI exploding out into 
               the hallway --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         -- No! -- I say, no! -- they go this 
                         far -- out a body in the grave -- 
                         another body! -- no! -- this isn't 
                         over -- these people are not finished -- 
                         nothing will make them finish until 
                         they have Wombosi! -- the real Wombosi -- 
                         until I'm the one in the box! --

               SIX KIDS -- TWO WIVES -- THREE BODYGUARDS -- all startled by 
               this steamrolling mass of energy and paranoia --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         -- what are you doing? --
                              (bearing down on 
                              Bodyguard #2 --)
                         -- sleeping? --
                              (to Deauvage --)
                         -- he's sleeping! -- this man is 
                         sleeping at his post! --
                              (kicking the chair 
                              out from under him --)
                         -- I've had men killed for this! --
                              (but he's still moving --)
                         -- you think these people? -- these 
                         people who come for me -- you think 
                         they sleep? -- they never sleep! -- 
                         they spend all the day -- all the 
                         night -- all time thinking about how 
                         to put Wombosi in that box! --
                              (he's just gonna keep 
                              going, and we're 
                              into--)

               A MASSIVE ONE-TAKE TRACKING SHOT

               DEAUVAGE on his feet -- racing to follow -- KIDS scattering 
               out of the way -- THE WIVES completely unfazed and --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         -- there is no box for Wombosi! -- 
                         they don't have a box that can hold 
                         me! -- I know these people -- I know 
                         they never sleep! -- I know they 
                         never stop! -- they never stop until 
                         the knife is at their throat! --
                              (suddenly distracted --)
                         -- what is the window? -- this window 
                         is open! -- who leaves this open! --
                              (before Deauvage can 
                              possibly respond --)
                         -- this is a war, you fool! -- you 
                         think these people are like you? -- 
                         you think this is stupid people? -- 
                         careless people? -- these people see 
                         an open window, they reach in with a 
                         big hand and grab your heart until 
                         you die! --
                              (still rolling as--)

               WE'RE HEADING DOWN TO THE POOL

                                     WOMBOSI
                         -- and it won't just be me! -- they 
                         don't just want Wombosi now! -- they 
                         want my babies -- they want my 
                         children! -- and I say no! --
                              (grabbing Deauvage --)
                         -- you leave that window open again, 
                         you better pray they kill me --
                              (something's caught 
                              his ear in the 
                              distance and now 
                              he's trying to get 
                              there --)
                         -- everything changes here now! -- 
                         everyone is a soldier here now! -- 
                         this is a fortress now! Are we clear 
                         with this?

                                     DEAUVAGE
                         Yes, sir. All clear.

               WOMBOSI stops to look at DEAUVAGE. In the background, we can 
               hear A CHILD CRYING by the pool --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         This man is out there. Kane is out 
                         there. And they pretend he's dead. 
                         That means he's coming back.

               WOMBOSI moving quickly now and WE'RE STILL TRACKING -- taking 
               him into --

               THE POOL AREA

               FORTY KIDS going nuts in the water. ONE KID crying. WOMBOSI 
               like a shot -- picking the kid up -- drying his tears -- 
               making a funny face -- getting a smile as --

               AN ELECTRONICS CONSOLE. Super-tech. Meters -- LEDs -- wave-
               form analyzers -- audio spectrum filters -- all of this gear 
               dancing and responding to every nuance of --

               BOURNE'S VOICE -- OVER SPEAKERS -- we're listening to a 
               recording of the call he made from the apartment to the Hotel 
               Marbeouf Paris --

                                     BOURNE/TAPE
                         "Okay. Merci."
                              (pause)
                         "Un moment -- un moment --"

                                     OPERATOR/TAPE

                         "-- hang on -- I need you to check 
                         another name for me -- hang on -- un 
                         moment, s'il vous plait --"

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               A secret studio buried deep in the Langley facility. Equipment 
               up the ass. Five people in this darkened room: AN ENGINEER 
               working the board. CONKLIN looking sour. ZORN in the shadows. 
               ABBOTT sitting there waiting for analysis from --

               MRS. DOYLE. She's late sixties. A long-time spy shrink. An 
               eminence. A diamond-hard, seen-it-all intelligence.

                                     BOURNE/TAPE
                         "Kane. John Michael Kane."

                                     OPERATOR/TAPE
                         "One moment, sir."

               MRS. DOYLE nods to THE ENGINEER. She's heard enough.

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         He's not lying. He's very highly 
                         stressed, but he's not lying. He's 
                         confused. He's aggressively searching 
                         for a way out of the chaos. This 
                         conversation, the video from the 
                         consulate -- the body language, vocal 
                         pattern -- it's my sense he's really 
                         lost here.
                              (beat)
                         I think he snapped.

                                     CONKLIN
                         Is that a medical term?

               She turns. Battle lines drawn.

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         You want clinical terminology? It's 
                         called, "conversation hysteria."
                              (to Abbott now --)
                         I don't know exactly how you train 
                         these people. I'm not sure I want to 
                         know. I'll take a guess there's some 
                         extremely rigorous behavior 
                         modification going on here.

               Silence. The idea dangling for a moment.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Let's assume that's true.

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         You can only wind people so tight. 
                         Even machines break down.

                                     CONKLIN
                         This unit has an unblemished record 
                         of success.

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         Then I guess I'm in the wrong meeting.

               EXT. BELLVILLE CAR PARK -- DUSK

               BOURNE and MARIE stashing the red car.

               INT. CIA HALLWAY UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DAY

               ABBOTT and CONKLIN walk and talk. They want to get loud, but 
               they can't. Too many people passing by --

                                     CONKLIN
                         That was two hours -- two hours to 
                         get a second opinion -- and nothing 
                         changes. He's loose. He's out of 
                         control. It's very clear what needs 
                         to happen.
                              (point blank)
                         I have work to do.

                                     ABBOTT
                         What if he is working for someone 
                         else? What if he turned?

                                     CONKLIN
                         Turn? To who? Where does he turn? 
                         What does he have to offer? He's got 
                         nothing. He's a killer. He's a piece 
                         of equipment for crissake. Where's 
                         he gonna turn?

               EXT. HOTEL DE LA PRIX -- NIGHT

               Funky. Out of the way. Cash and carry. No-questions-asked 
               kind of flop. Our establishing shot somehow includes THE 
               PROPRIETOR and HIS DOG.

               INT. THE HOTEL ROOM BATHROOM -- NIGHT

               HAIR DYE washing down a rusted drain. It's MARIE alone in 
               this crappy little bathroom. Jeans and bra. All of it soaking 
               wet.

               A new hair color.

               A MIRROR. There she is. Her turn to stare at herself and 
               wonder.

               And then she smells something. Smoke...

               INT. THE HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

               It's a shitty little room. BOURNE sitting on the bed. And 
               the smoke is coming from...

               HIS PASSPORT -- the Jason Bourne passport -- on fire. BOURNE 
               holding it as it burns away. Bourne's face -- melting -- 
               bubbling -- finally disappearing, -- BOURNE letting go just 
               before it burns his fingers and --

               BOURNE sits back. And there's MARIE standing there. And she's 
               holding out her passport --

               He looks at her. Big moment.

                                     BOURNE
                         No.
                              (he won't do it)
                         You know who you are. You know what 
                         that's worth? That's everything.
                              (pause)
                         I can't live like this. I can't do 
                         anything until I know who I am. 
                         Believe me, you don't want what I 
                         have.

               He looks away. Silence. And then, she touches him. His 
               shoulder.

               BOURNE almost recoils. Almost. He doesn't know what to do. 
               Doesn't know how to react.

               MARIE in front of him now -- she's taking his hand -- and he 
               hesitates -- looking at her -- is this happening? -- she's 
               taking his hand -- moving it down her body -- staring at him -- 
               both of them silent -- his hand -- her skin -- his mind racing -- 
               he wants this -- wants it in every way -- but it's 
               overwhelming -- when was the last time something like this 
               happened? -- he can't remember -- he doesn't care -- he's 
               pulling her toward him -- and they're kissing -- and you 
               know the rest...

               INT. CDG AIRPORT -- NIGHT

               THE PROFESSOR arriving in Paris.  Coming through the terminal 
               as his pager goes off -- never even stopping as he reads and --

                   ...................................................

               HOTEL SEQUENCE -- SKETCHED ONLY

               HOTEL MARBOEUF PARIS. This is the place that answered the 
               phone when Bourne hit redial in his apartment. This is the 
               place that John Michael Kane was staying when he "died."

               And so begins, the investigation...

               Now, since the presence of danger -- ie Wombosi's guys and/or 
               Treadstone -- is still up in the air, and since this scene 
               could either play very quickly or very long, and since we're 
               not exactly sure where we stand with page count -- this scene 
               is not finished.

               The rules of the scene, however, seem to be thus: Bourne 
               would have to be very nervous about being recognized. If he 
               was Kane and Kane stayed here, he's not the guy to do whatever 
               "social engineering" needs doing.

               Long version? Bourne sets the table and Marie gets the goods. 
               Somehow there's a threat from Treadstone or Wombosi.

               Fast version? It's all results -- we see them execute a plan 
               rather than work it up. MARIE is already in the hotel. In a 
               hotel uniform? Posing as a guest? In any case, she looks 
               very much different than we've ever seen her before.

               She gets close to the office. Hides. Waits. BOURNE calls the 
               desk from a pay phone. Asks for something. We see that some 
               sort of improvised booby-trap has been set inside the hotel 
               to start a fire. In the confusion -- MARIE -- very bravely -- 
               gets into the office. We do a quick cut outside to Bourne 
               waiting and --

               EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE HOTEL MARBOEUF -- DAY

               Walk and talk. BOURNE and MARIE leaving the hotel fast. He's 
               on alert -- always on alert now -- making sure they're not 
               being watched. And she's excited and pumped -- she did it! -- 
               she's got the hotel record in hand --

                                     MARIE
                         You stayed there five times in the 
                         past six months. But I didn't have 
                         time -- I could only get the bill 
                         from the last stay -- you were there 
                         for two days. Some room service -- 
                         there's half a dozen phone calls 
                         here so that's someth--

                                     BOURNE
                              (cutting her off)
                         Who paid the bill?

                                     MARIE
                         It's a company... MPG Capital.

               INT. AN EMPTY OFFICE SUITE -- DAY

               Vacancy wasteland. Dead phone lines hanging. Carpet pulled 
               up. Completely stripped out. BOURNE and MARIE standing there 
               staring.

                                     MARIE
                         This can't be it.

               She turns around -- and what's he doing? -- BOURNE with a 
               piece of paper and pencil -- or something/anything resourceful 
               and handy -- maybe it's carpet lint -- maybe it's breaking 
               the glass on the door and holding it up to the light -- or a 
               rubbing -- anyway, he's doing something ingenious with the 
               glass door --

               And as he's doing this, we're hearing --

                         Richard? Is he there.

               We're watching the MPG LOGO emerge and seeing BOURNE and 
               MARIE react, as we hear --

                         I'm afraid there's no Richard here.

               INT./EXT. SHITBAG PARISIAN PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

               BOURNE on the pay phone. MARIE behind him at the bar. He's 
               got a pad and paper. This is all business.

                                     BOURNE
                         Well, where are you? Where am I 
                         calling?

                         -- this is a tire dealership, right?

               Dial tone. BOURNE making a note. And as he does --

                                     BOURNE

               CONKLIN left hanging. ABBOTT clear on this one.

               INT. PETER RAWLINS' OFFICE -- DAY

               Meet RAWLINS. He's a young, jolly Brit -- pink and overfed -- 
               and quite shocked to see...

                                     RAWLINS
                         Mr. Kane...
                              (hastily tidying up)
                         Come right in... please... have a 
                         seat.

                                     BOURNE
                         Thanks.

               BOURNE just trying to feel his way through this...

                                     RAWLINS
                         Well...
                              (really thrown)
                         I must admit, when my assistant told 
                         me you were here I was, really -- I 
                         was quite -- I was surprised.

                                     BOURNE
                         Really.

                                     RAWLINS
                         We thought you were gone for good.

                                     BOURNE
                         Did you?

                                     RAWLINS
                         Well, I mean it's a tough business, 
                         isn't it? Cutthroat.

               A long awkward beat. Neither of them sure where to go.

                                     RAWLINS
                              (finally)
                         Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- 
                         but definitely at the high end of 
                         competitive -- when we didn't hear 
                         back from you, we did some re-analysis 
                         of the numbers, and honestly, we'd 
                         really like a chance to do a bit 
                         better.
                              (pitching now)
                         I'm assuming you're still in the 
                         market. It's the same vessel?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes.

                                     RAWLINS
                         We just picked up a job quite like 
                         the one we were bidding for you. 
                         Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- 
                         five-foot pleasure cruiser. I think 
                         we learned a few things that might 
                         allow us to make our proposal for 
                         your job, as I said, a bit more 
                         competitive.

                                     BOURNE
                         Okay.

               Another beat. Rawlins holding back until now...

                                     RAWLINS
                         Was it the break-in?

                                     BOURNE
                         Excuse me?

                                     RAWLINS
                         We also thought we hadn't heard from 
                         you -- we've had a bit of a publicity 
                         nightmare, people have been talking.
                              (the meat)
                         Our offices were broken into -- 
                         vandalism mostly -- shortly after we 
                         last spoke.

                                     BOURNE
                         I hadn't heard.

               RAWLINS smiles. Reset. Sales mode.

                                     RAWLINS
                         Let me get you a new copy of the 
                         proposal.

                                     BOURNE
                         That'd be great.

               INT. A CAFÉ NEAR LA DEFENSE -- DAY

               BOURNE entering. And there's MARIE in the back working a 
               payphone -- waving for him to sit -- she's onto something.

               BOURNE sits. Pulls out the Alliance Security Brochures and 
               literature. Flipping through it. Boats. Water. He's getting 
               closer. Pictures of yachts and various security blurbs and a 
               list of references for huge yachts -- jobs they've done in 
               the past...

                                     MARIE
                         I found it.
                              (standing there)
                         It took six calls.
                              (she's creeped out)
                         I found Kane. I found the body.

                                     BOURNE
                         Let's go --
                              (already standing --)
                         We got to get away from this phone.

               THE TWO MORGUE ATTENDANTS watching BOURNE put down a hundred 
               dollar bill. MARIE standing a little off -- she will not be 
               comfortable in the morgue.

                                     ATTENDANT #1

                         What was the name again?

                                     BOURNE
                         Kane. John Michael Kane.

                         It's number 121.

                                     BOURNE
                         I want to see the body.

                                     ATTENDANT #1
                         Our boss could come back. We're not 
                         supposed to.

               BOURNE pulling out another hundred and --

               MORGUE FREEZER ROOM

               It's showtime. MARIE back by the door. BOURNE right on it. 
               ATTENDANT #1 pulling open the freezer and...

               BOURNE sags. ATTENDANT #1 looking baffled.

                                     MARIE
                         What?

               INSERT -- FREEZER #121 -- it's empty.

                                     MORGUE BOSS (O.S.)
                              (from behind them --)
                         What the hell's going on here?

               Here comes the boss back from his break -- a little drunk?

                                     ATTENDANT #1
                         This guy, he came to see the American, 
                         but the body, it's missing.

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         They came last night.  His brother.

                                     ATTENDANT #2
                         It's not in the book.

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         Who are these people?
                              (now English to Bourne)
                         Who are you? What's going on here?

                                     BOURNE
                         Where did this body go?

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         I said, someone came last night --
                              (big attitude now)
                         Look, this isn't a carnival -- people 
                         call and they make an appointment 
                         and they follow the rules -- everyone 
                         signs in and out -- this is a serious 
                         place -- serious work -- it's not 
                         just to come in whenever you like --

                                     BOURNE
                              (like a shot)
                         Shit, we didn't sign in.

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         So get the hell out of here.

                                     BOURNE
                         Fine. But I'd like to sign in. In 
                         fact, I insist on it. Where's the 
                         book? I gotta sign in --
                              (off and running now --)

               Everybody following -- all of them confused -- and into --

               FRONT DESK AREA

               BOURNE there first -- all forward motion here -- balls out --

                                     BOURNE
                         Is this it? --
                              (the book)
                         -- this is it, right? --

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         -- slow down -- you can't just take 
                         the book like that --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- don't sweat it, I have a pen -- 
                         no problem -- just let me find the 
                         page --
                              (then quick to Marie)
                         -- honey, why don't you wait for me 
                         outside, okay? --

               MARIE trying to take the hint, but she's curious what he's 
               doing --

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         -- we have rules here, this is a 
                         very serious place -- I'm the one 
                         who decides who gets in here, okay? --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- what do I? -- I put the name of 
                         the person I came to see? --

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         -- this is serious business down 
                         here and we cannot have people coming 
                         and going --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- here we go -- I found it --

               But he's not writing -- he's ripping -- tearing the page out 
               of the book --

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         -- what are you? -- what are you 
                         doing? -- you crazy fuck -- you ripped 
                         the book! -- you stupid fucki--
                              (no chance to finish 
                              this, because --)

               BOURNE just slammed him against the wall. Hard. Like a tractor 
               hit him. And fast.

               And that shuts up the room.

               THE TWO ATTENDANTS rushing to help their boss --

               BOURNE grabbing MARIE and pulling her out the door --

               EXT. PARIS STREET -- NIGHT

               Moments after the morgue. BOURNE striding away. MARIE 
               struggling to keep up. And BOURNE is different now -- zoning 
               in -- he's close -- he's hardening --

                                     MARIE
                         What are you doing? --
                              (he's scaring her)
                         -- Jason -- stop -- talk to me...

               BOURNE ignoring her -- ripping through the Alliance Security 
               brochures -- scanning them as he walks --

                                     MARIE
                         -- I don't know what you're doing 
                         and you're scaring me -- what are 
                         you looking for? -- what just happened 
                         in there? --

                                     BOURNE
                         Nykwana Wombosi.
                              (he stops, holding up 
                              the brochure --)

                                     MARIE
                         What is that?

                                     BOURNE
                         It's a name. Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty 
                         million dollar yacht. He's the proud 
                         owner of an Alliance Security package.
                              (handing her the 
                              brochure --)
                         He also paid a visit to the morgue 
                         to see John Michael Kane.
                              (the ripped-out page --)

                                     MARIE
                         What does that mean?
                              (but he's walking 
                              again --)
                         Jason, what does that mean?
                              (she's trying to catch 
                              up, but he's walking 
                              really fast --)
                         Jason, please... who is he?

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know.
                              (he's not turning 
                              back again --)

                                     MARIE
                         So what are we doing?

                                     BOURNE
                         Go back to the hotel.

               MARIE just stops. Reeling.

               BOURNE walking away. Into Paris night and --

               INT. CONKLIN'S TREADSTONE OFFICE -- DAY/NIGHT?

               ABBOTT alone here. On the phone. Looking up to see --

                                     ZORN
                         They found him. They found Bourne.

               ABBOTT jumps off the call. Eyes never leaving ZORN.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Where?

                                     ZORN
                         You better come in.

               EXT. L'ETOILE -- NIGHT

               THE PROFESSOR -- A MOTORCYCLE -- screaming through traffic 
               and --

               INT. WOMBOSI'S SECURITY ROOM -- NIGHT

               VIDEO MONITOR -- there's BOURNE -- staring up and --

               VIDEO MONITOR -- different angle -- more clandestine -- but 
               same deal -- there's BOURNE just standing there and --

                                     ABBOTT
                         Omigod.

               EXT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND -- NIGHT

               BOURNE live. On the street. Bathed in a streetlight. Staring 
               up at a security camera.

               Total hero moment.

               I'm here. I'm waiting. I know you're watching.

               EXT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND -- NIGHT

               Confusion to say the least -- WOMBOSI -- pistol in hand -- 
               moving as fast as he can through the clutter -- KIDS 
               scattering as he follows DEAUVAGE -- racing for THE SECURITY

               BOURNE standing there as the FRONT GATE opens. The moment. 
               The big deep breath. He's walking in --

               INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS DESK -- NIGHT

               Uglier by the second -- desperation madness --

                                     ABBOTT
                         -- he went inside! --

                              (to Abbott)
                         -- if we can get a clean shot --

                         -- that's what they're trained for -- 
                         just a surgical strike.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Forget it.

                         We don't know what we're into!

                         We're in the shitter, man! Pick your 
                         poison. Maybe he's in there to finish 
                         the job. Maybe he's working for 
                         Wombosi. Maybe they want to go on TV 
                         together. Every possibility sucks -- 
                         we've got to move!

               INT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND MAIN HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               DEAUVAGE and BODYGUARD #1 giving BOURNE a serious pat down.

                                     BOURNE
                         Is he here?

               DEAUVAGE doesn't answer -- spinning BOURNE around -- they're 
               really going over him --

               INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS ROOM -- NIGHT

               CONKLIN on his feet -- ABBOTT beet red -- this is getting 
               loud --

                                     CONKLIN
                         You don't have the stones for this. 
                         You people come down here and wink 
                         and whisper and we send these guys 
                         out and get it done. And you're clear. 
                         And the guys upstairs get what they 
                         want. And the whole bunch of you are 
                         so stuffed on deniability it's coming 
                         out of your ears.

                         now. What do you want to do?

               ABBOTT just shaking his head no.

               And CONKLIN snaps -- suddenly he's over the console -- there's 
               the button -- and he's pressing it and --

               BOURNE being marched toward the throne room doors -- DEAUVAGE 
               and BODYGUARD #1 flanking him -- KIDS and WIVES staring as 
               he passes -- the way you'd look at a prisoner on the way to 
               the gallows --

               THE BIG DOORS thrown open wide and --

               WOMBOSI on the throne.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         Come in.
                              (an imperial gesture)
                         Please...

               BOURNE steps up to the plate.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         Did you bring investment advice for 
                         me tonight? It was tax shelters, 
                         wasn't it? Swiss debenture-swaps.

                                     BOURNE
                         MPG Capital.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         I think investment advice from a 
                         dead man, it's a bad idea.
                              (beat)
                         How does it feel to be dead?

                                     BOURNE
                         It's a lot more stressful than I 
                         thought.

               KIDS have started sneaking into the room -- DEAUVAGE is trying 
               to scoot them out but --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         -- no -- no, let them in! -- let 
                         them in.
                              (to the kids)
                         Come in -- on y va -- come in...
                              (to Bourne)
                         I think everyone wants to see the 
                         dead man.

               BOURNE watching the kids -- they are all staring --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         What do you do?
                              (on his feet now --)
                         You get an appointment with me? You 
                         make sure it's on the boat? You come 
                         visit me -- you pitch me this bullshit 
                         investment package. You drink my 
                         water -- eat my bread -- play with 
                         my children -- and what? -- two nights 
                         later you come back and you put this 
                         death --
                              (slamming something 
                              down onto the throne --)
                         -- you put this in my engine room!

               There is A BOMB on the throne now.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         So this is a different kind of 
                         meeting.
                              (steam building)
                         Maybe now we talk some truth, okay? 
                         One dead man to another.

               BOURNE -- caught off guard as -- WOMBOSI suddenly rips away 
               his jacket -- so hard that he tears straight through to the 
               shirt --

               BOURNE'S BACK -- bare -- two bullet scars -- still raw --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         You see this?
                              (calling to Deauvage --)
                         I told you my shot was better!

                                     DEAUVAGE
                         He went in the water -- how did he 
                         live?

                                     WOMBOSI
                         No, no no...
                              (and he means this --)
                         This is a strong killer. This is a 
                         crazy strong killer. Oh, yeah...
                              (circling)
                         To make a killer that looks like 
                         you? This young? This face?
                              (he means this)
                         It's bloody fucking amazing.

               BOURNE imploding -- this news -- the kids staring at him -- 
               the bomb -- it's all getting loud around him --

                                     BOURNE
                         Who do you think sent me?

                                     WOMBOSI
                         I know who sent you. I don't know 
                         why.
                              (this could get 
                              physical at any moment 
                              now --)
                         I learned many, many things from the 
                         CIA. Many things. I learned the way 
                         they think.
                              (beat)
                         Was the bomb on my boat supposed to 
                         go off or not?

               BOURNE distracted by the kids -- these faces -- it's...

                                     WOMBOSI
                         You didn't set the bomb. Why?

               BOURNE not sure -- about any of it --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         Was this a game or a fuck up?

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         Get the kids out!

               He doesn't have to say it twice -- they know the drill -- 
               they're gone.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         And the door.

               DEAUVAGE closing the doors and as he does --

               THE PROFESSOR ATTACKS...

                   ...................................................

               THIS SCENE HAS NOT BEEN WRITTEN

               It's a shootout.

               The Professor is infinitely more talented at this than the 
               bodyguards.

               Bourne needs to get out of there -- without looking wimpy --

               No children are harmed.

               As the Professor rallies -- he will shoot Wombosi -- he will 
               find Bourne's jacket left on the floor (in which later he 
               will find a clue leading him to Belleville) and last but 
               hardly least, he will take a parting shot at the bomb still 
               sitting there on the throne.

               There will be a huge, trailer-worthy explosion.

               This might not want to be very long. There is an extensive 
               action sequence just around the corner.

               So Bourne escapes. Physically he's just weary. Emotionally 
               he's fucked.

               All of that happens and we cut to --

                   ...................................................

               INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS DESK -- NIGHT

               CONKLIN flipping out -- THE PROFESSOR is not responding --

               burn to the ground around him.

                         What are you doing?

               CONKLIN grabbing shit -- like a madman --

                                     CONKLIN
                         I'm going to Paris.

                                     ABBOTT
                         No you're not. You're not going 
                         anywhere. I'm shutting this down.

                                     CONKLIN
                         You're not doing shit. You're so 
                         scared you can't even think.

                                     ABBOTT
                         You just blew up a house in Paris! 
                         This program is over. Call it off.

                                     CONKLIN
                         I can't call it off. He's not 
                         responding. Get out of my way.

               CONKLIN splits and --

               INT. THE HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

               It's really late. BOURNE enters the room. MARIE in the corner. 
               Smoked out. Cried out. Lifed out.

               Silence. Not a word.

               His shirt is torn to shit. He scraped-up -- blood here and 
               there. He moves past her into --

               THE BATHROOM

               His hands shaking as he tries to wash them. He bags it.

               THE ROOM

               BOURNE comes out. And there's a long silence until --

                                     MARIE
                         It doesn't matter who you were before. 
                         It's who you want to be. That's all 
                         that matters.
                              (is he listening?)
                         We have this money. We have what we 
                         have. I had nothing before and now, 
                         I don't know, maybe I have more, 
                         maybe it's nothing, but...
                              (he looks over)
                         I say we leave here. We leave this 
                         place. We go until we can't go 
                         anymore.

                                     BOURNE
                         You could do that?

                                     MARIE
                         Yes. That's who I want to be.

               BOURNE nods. Turns off the light. Takes her hand. And they 
               lay in bed. Just laying there.

               INT. PARIS SOMEWHERE -- NIGHT

               THE PROFESSOR cooping somewhere. Tending to his wounds. 
               Ignoring his pager. He's slipped off the grid.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM -- DAWN

               BOURNE and MARIE packing up to hit the road. Together.

                   ...................................................

               DOUG'S ROUGH DRAFT OF THE BIG ACTION SEQUENCE

               INT. HOTEL DE LA PAIX -- LOBBY -- DAY

               MARIE dropping off the key. Hope hangs in the air --

                                     CLERK
                         xxxxxx...

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

               BOURNE enters. He's got the black duffel. Car keys.

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx.

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

               And now they're headed for the door. Something doesn't feel 
               right for BOURNE -- and then he notices --

                                     BOURNE
                         Stop where you are.

                                     MARIE
                         What?

               Bourne turns back to the CLERK.

                                     BOURNE
                         Where's the dog?

                                     CLERK
                         My husband's out looking for him.

                                     BOURNE
                         He run away often?

                                     CLERK
                         That old beast? Miss his breakfast? 
                         Not a chance.
                              (returning to cleaning)
                         It's always something, right?

               Suddenly -- just like that -- everything's different --

                                     BOURNE
                         Get in the basement.

                                     CLERK
                         What?

                                     BOURNE
                              (to Marie)
                         Get everyone down in the basement.

               Now MARIE doesn't need a second warning --

                                     CLERK
                         What the hell're you talking about?

                                     BOURNE
                         You're in danger. All of you. I have 
                         no time to explain.

                                     CLERK
                         Wait a minute --

                                     BOURNE
                         I'm sorry.

               -- those words -- the way he said it -- she's grabbing her 
               purse, clearing out of the room. Slamming the door behind 
               her -- click -- it's locked.

                                     MARIE
                         Jason...

               No answer -- too busy -- reaching under the check-in desk, 
               coming up with -- A SHOT GUN, an old one, but nonetheless a 
               gun --

                                     MARIE
                         Who is it? Who's out there?

               And now BOURNE is moving, pulling open a drawer.  A box of 
               shells. Filling his pockets.

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

                                     BOURNE
                         I won't let that happen.

               And he is moving down the small hallway.  Away from the front 
               door -- towards the back door under the stairs.

               EXT. HOTEL DE LA PAIX -- COURTYARD -- DAY

               THE HOTEL BACK DOOR -- kicked open -- BOURNE coming out of 
               the house -- coming hard -- and --

               The small courtyard is empty -- but now the ALARM is going 
               off -- and BOURNE turns back to MARIE -- races to grab her 
               as --

               RATATATAT -- The FRONT DOOR -- WINDOWS -- ARE SHREDDED and -- 
               here comes the PROFESSOR.

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

               And now they are running, across this little courtyard. To a 
               wall -- BOURNE is up, on it -- reaching down for MARIE -- 
               grabbing her -- swinging her over the wall as --

               ABM!!! The PROFESSOR SHOOTS.

                                     BOURNE
                         Go!

               MARIE takes off running. BOURNE leans over the wall, FIRES 
               BACK TWICE -- RATATAT -- The WALL IS SHREDDED. BOURNE takes 
               off running -- reloading on the fly.

               Rounds a bend, is chambering two rounds when he sees -- a 
               WOMAN is in her kitchen -- staring at him -- no time to 
               explain -- he turns back --

               The PROFESSOR is just vaulting over the wall. BOURNE FIRES 
               TWICE -- BAM! BAM! But the spray is too wide from this 
               distance. Windows are shattered to both sides of him but -- 
               the PROFESSOR stumbles but keeps going -- blood on his face 
               now -- RATATAT --

               BOURNE has to move. Reloading his almost useless gun. Reaching 
               MARIE -- facing a choice and they climb a wall -- FLOWER 
               POTS EXPLODE around them but they make it -- now --

               RUNNING IN A LABYRINTH -- right -- then left -- through a 
               small staircase. LEAPING a wall -- landing on a STEEP ROOF -- 
               sliding, falling, crashing to the ground in --

               A SMALL COURTYARD -- steep walls on all sides. But there's a 
               large window -- and it's open. And they step through and 
               find themselves --

               INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT -- BATHROOM -- DAY

               They close the window behind them -- catch their breath --

                                     MARIE
                         Did we lose them?

               BOURNE shakes his head. Tucks the gun under his coat.

                                     MARIE
                         Who is it?

                                     BOURNE
                         We have to keep moving.

               And now he is opening the door -- they step into --

               INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT -- DAY

               STARTLED KITCHEN WORKERS stare as BOURNE and MARIE calmly 
               walk out of the bathroom and head towards the front door of 
               the empty restaurant. Quiet.

               And then they open the door to the street and --

               EXT. BELLEVILLE -- COMMERCIAL STREET -- DAY

               The first thing we notice is noise. The street is burgeoning 
               with life. The second thing we notice are SIRENS. POLICE 
               CARS approaching. BOURNE and MARIE head down the street, 
               blending in.

               Up ahead -- TWO POLICE CARS snaking through traffic. BOURNE 
               steers them off this crowded street.

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

               EXT. BELLEVILLE -- QUIET STREET -- DAY

               And BOURNE and MARIE are hurrying down this street when -- 
               BAM -- The PROFESSOR comes out of a building -- across and 
               down the street. No time to hide -- he's seen them -- he's 
               FIRING.

               BOURNE tackles MARIE to the ground behind a car. RATATAT -- 
               The PROFESSOR is literally shredding it. And now BOURNE is 
               moving --

                                     MARIE
                         What are you doing?

               And BOURNE is on the offensive. BAM! BAM! Moving towards the 
               PROFESSOR who is ducking behind cars on the other side.

               They are shredding the street -- FIRING ruthlessly at each 
               other and -- NOW THE POLICE ARE HERE -- BLOCKING both ends 
               of the street. GUNS are drawn -- BOURNE's vulnerable on two 
               flanks. The COPS are YELLING. And now --

               THE PROFESSOR BLASTS the COPS -- And now things have changed.

               THREE WAY FIREFIGHT and BOURNE grabs MARIE and they dive 
               into --

               INT. SMALL EPICERIE -- DAY

               And the PROFESSOR shreds the store as BOURNE attemps to fire 
               back. SHIT flying everywhere in here -- hard to see and -- 
               The PROFESSOR is advancing on them -- cops are no match for 
               his fire power. They move to the back -- kick open a door --

               INT. HIGHWALLED COURTYARD -- DAY

               BOURNE and MARIE cross this small courtyard, the PROFESSOR 
               is right on their heels. CRASH through a door -- and now 
               they are in --

               INT. SMALL SWEATSHOP -- DAY

               COUPLE of ASIAN WOMEN sewing in here. One MAN in charge -- 
               and BOURNE and MARIE charging through -- the MAN about to 
               say something -- but now the PROFESSOR is on their tail and --

               INT. SMALL AFRICAN SHOP -- DAY

               Making god knows what in here -- vats of something. Small 
               grouping of workers -- BOURNE shutting the door behind him -- 
               it's shredded with BULLET HOLES. BOURNE and MARIE racing to 
               the next door as -- BAM -- the PROFESSOR kicks the door open -- 
               BOURNE about to fire -- but there is a WOMAN right behind 
               the PROFESSOR! Can't do it -- turns to run as -- RATATATAT --

               The PROFESSOR FIRES as BOURNE and MARIE dive into --

               INT. LIVE POULTRY SHOP -- DAY

               And now CHICKEN feathers are flying everywhere -- the glass 
               at the front of the door is shattering. BOURNE and MARIE 
               make it through the gauntlet.

               EXT. BELLEVILLE -- STREET -- DAY

               And BOURNE and MARIE are running. And he is reaching into 
               his pocket -- fishing around -- and just as he pulls out the 
               car keys -- we recognize this as the street they parked their 
               car on and --

               BY MARIE'S CAR

               BOURNE unlocks the door -- pops MARIE's open. And --

               THERE'S A COP -- yelling at them and -- BOURNE hits the gas -- 
               they fly out of their parking space -- BAM!! The COP fires, 
               shattering their windshield and there -- up ahead -- THE 
               PROFESSOR coming out -- about to FIRE -- BOURNE aims for him -- 
               forces him to dive out of the way and -- ONE QUICK MOVE around 
               a TRUCK and they are free.

               INT. THE LITTLE RED CAR

               BOURNE and MARIE looking back nervously -- so far all over --

               ON THE STREET

               The PROFESSOR looking around. PEOPLE staring at him -- covered 
               in blood -- the COP racing up -- yelling -- not yelling for 
               long because the PROFESSOR is firing at him and --

               Now the PROFESSOR is moving -- not running -- just a swift 
               walk and now he's past the truck -- and --

               A MOTORCYCLIST comes flying down the street -- oblivious -- 
               going way too fast for these streets and -- the PROFESSOR 
               swings his gun stock like a bat -- takes him out -- clean 
               and smooth -- bike crashing to the ground and --

               The PROFESSOR grabs the bike and takes off -- SHOOTING at 
               TWO POLICE CARS just racing to the scene and we are into --

               EXT. BELLEVILLE BLVD -- DAY

               HIGH SPEED CAR CHASE. And BOURNE better do some fancy driving 
               because here comes the PROFESSOR -- and he's a lot faster -- 
               much better armed.

               INT. MARIE'S CAR

               BOURNE driving. MARIE looking back -- seeing the PROFESSOR 
               gain on them --

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

               And -- THE PROFESSOR FIRES -- SHREDS the back off their car --

                                     MARIE
                         Give me the gun --

               And now she's got his shotgun, leaning out the window.

                                     BOURNE
                         Wait 'till he's close.

               BOURNE swerves, up on the sidewalk back onto the street -- 
               slaloms through the traffic -- racing towards an intersection 
               and --

               IN THE INTERSECTION

               CARS coming the other way, BOURNE just makes it through -- 
               the PROFESSOR tries to squeeze through -- skidding and --

               CRACK! The PROFESSOR hits the front of a car sideways on his 
               bike -- he is THROWN clear through the intersection, right 
               into the windshield of an oncoming car and --

               He gets up, grabs his gun and works his way towards his bike 
               and now we see --

               EXT. VARIOUS SHOTS AROUND PARIS -- DAY

               COPS are mobilizing -- swarming into this area and --

               BACK TO THE CAR CHASE --

               BOURNE and MARIE pick up a few cops on their tail -- shed 
               all of them -- the last car goes into an EXPLOSIVE FLIP -- 
               the PROFESSOR is now right behind them. And now we are into --

               CRAZY CAR CHASE WITH COPS RIGHT ON THEIR TAIL

               BOURNE, MARIE and the PROFESSOR leave a trail of totaled 
               cars that the cops have to try and navigate through -- finally 
               saying fuck it and hitting a few cars themselves and now we 
               are into --

               CAR CHASE THROUGH NARROW STREETS

               MARIE'S CAR and the MOTORCYCLE can pass where the police 
               cars cannot. BOURNE may be able to shed the cops, but not 
               the PROFESSOR. And now one quick move and they are --

               EXT. QUAI -- DAY

               Racing against traffic up the Seine. Past the Louvre. COPS 
               pursuing on the other side of the river. BOURNE and the 
               PROFESSOR leaving behind a trail of carnage. And now --

               The PROFESSOR is pulling up along side them -- one lane over.  
               Both swerving to avoid oncoming cars and --

               MARIE FIRES -- TWICE -- TAKES out a few windshields. The 
               PROFESSOR fires at the same time -- MARIE'S CAR DOOR -- GONE -- 
               she's totally exposed but --

               THE PROFESSOR -- his BIKE is SPOUTING GAS -- one of the 
               pellets nailed his tank.

               BOURNE AND MARIE --

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

               THE PROFESSOR --

               No problem -- he's unwrapping a piece of duct tape from the 
               barrel of his gun -- two seconds and the hole is patched and -- 
               BOURNE AND MARIE -- the side of the car is completely gone -- 
               the PROFESSOR is gaining -- across the river dozens of police 
               cars are racing alongside. Many more can be seen on their 
               side -- a road block ahead -- running out of options and --
               BOURNE turns hard -- crashes over the sidewalk and flies 
               down a side street. A POLICE CAR pulls out behind them -- 
               the PROFESSOR can't stop -- skidding hard, turning the bike 
               sideways, skidding out -- sliding across the ground and 
               BAMMM!!! SMASHING into a GLASS PHONE BOOTH which shatters.

               And he's up -- lifting up his bike and --

               BOURNE AND MARIE

               SIX POLICE CARS on their tail -- more joining. Every street 
               they look down has POLICE CARS racing in parallel. Running 
               out of options and in the background --

               THE PROFESSOR is back in the game -- passing the police cars 
               and up ahead --

               THE ROAD IS BLOCKED. POLICE ROAD BLOCK -- cops with guns. 
               Gotta act quick and -- BOURNE turns hard left -- there's a 
               metro staircase -- only way out and --

               THEY BOUNCE down the stairs. CRASH through the doors down 
               below.

               THE FIRST POLICE CAR -- no way he's following. SLAMMING on 
               his brakes. SKIDDING to a halt -- SKIDDING sideways -- gonna 
               stop in time -- just at the edge of the steps and then --

               THE SECOND POLICE CAR isn't braking -- T-BONES the first car -- 
               BAM!!! -- sends it rolling sideways down the steps until it 
               crashes to a halt at the bottom -- upside down.

               THE PROFESSOR -- he's turning -- heading for a different set 
               of stairs. BOURNE AND MARIE -- crashing through the turnstiles -- 
               people diving out of their way and --

               AT THE STAIRCASE -- THE WINDOW of the POLICE CAR is kicked 
               out and -- TWO VERY ANGRY COPS emerge -- pull their guns out -- 
               head into the station. BOURNE and MARIE's world just got a 
               lot more dangerous and --

               THE PROFESSOR is racing down the other staircase -- an up 
               escalator -- people diving out of the way as --

               BOURNE and MARIE slalom through the station -- suddenly -- 
               there's the PROFESSOR -- parallel corridor -- metal barricades 
               keep them separated. PROFESSOR FIRING.

               UP AHEAD -- a horizon line -- BOURNE guns it -- a steep 
               staircase and -- THEY FLY down the steps -- landing on --

               THE METRO PLATFORM

               The PROFESSOR lands on the other side -- both racing down 
               the platform -- PROFESSOR tearing up the wall behind them 
               and -- HERE COMES A TRAIN -- on BOURNE and MARIE's side -- 
               travelling the opposite way -- temporary refuge. Not for 
               long -- there's no way out on this end of the platform. They 
               skid to a halt -- just as --THE TRAIN DOORS OPEN -- STARTLED 
               STRAPHANGERS stare at BOURNE and MARIE as they stop onto the 
               platform -- take off running.

               THE PROFESSOR has to turn his bike around. He's quick -- but 
               it gives BOURNE and MARIE a two second head start.

               BOURNE AND MARIE almost at the other end of the platform -- 
               gunfire ripping up the windows behind them. Gonna go for the 
               steps -- but here come --

               THE ANGRY COPS -- remember them? -- the ones who took the 
               ride down the steps -- they're firing now and --

               BOURNE AND MARIE turn back -- the PROFESSOR is firing and 
               there is only one option --

               INT. METRO CAR -- DAY

               BOURNE and MARIE into the conductor booth. People diving off 
               the train as BOURNE hits the YELLOW BUTTON and -- the TRAIN 
               STARTS ROLLING -- doors still open -- they disappear into 
               the protection of the tunnel walls -- then BOURNE hits the 
               button to close the doors and -- THE PROFESSOR -- watching 
               the trains accelerate out of the station -- and now he's 
               racing his bike down the platform -- opposite the motion of 
               the train and -- here comes the end of the train and --THE 
               PROFESSOR throws his bike into a skidding 180 and skids off 
               the platform all in one move -- landing hard on the tracks 
               but facing the right direction and now he's accelerating 
               towards the train -- just as an oncoming train is racing 
               into the station and -- HE LEAPS onto the back of the train 
               in the nick of time. His GUN CLATTERS to the tracks.

               IN THE LAST METRO CAR

               The window is shattered and the PROFESSOR lets himself in -- 
               wind whipping through his hair from the shattered windows.  
               And --

               IN THE FIRST METRO CAR

               BOURNE and MARIE finally getting a breather. BOURNE keeps 
               looking back -- nothing -- the train is deserted. Finally --

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

               And ahead -- daylight -- the train tracks go above ground 
               and as the train hits daylight -- we see the PROFESSOR 
               directly behind BOURNE on the other side of the glass and --

               CRASH! The PROFESSOR grabs BOURNE through the glass, ramming 
               his head into the metal as --

               BOURNE grabs the knob, swings the door open and CRUSHES the 
               PROFESSOR -- CRUSHES him again and now he is free and --

               BOURNE turns, pulls up the shotgun and -- the PROFESSOR kicks 
               it out of his hands -- it clatters to the ground and now we 
               have a beat -- THE TRAIN CAR races across the Bir Hakeim 
               bridge -- all of Paris laid out behind them. BOURNE and the 
               PROFESSOR squaring off -- both looking at the gun -- realizing 
               there's no chance for either one of them to get it and --

               A BRUTAL RUTHLESS FIGHT breaks out. BOURNE's motivated -- 
               the PROFESSOR's crazy -- makes it a pretty even match. Looks 
               like it could go on for a little while when suddenly --

               BAM!!! The PROFESSOR drops to the ground -- behind him -- 
               MARIE wields the shot gun.

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

               And BOURNE takes the gun from her -- standing there -- 
               reloading -- both barrels -- raising the gun -- aiming it --

                   ...................................................

               INT. MOVING METRO CAR -- DAY

               THE PROFESSOR sitting there. Like a dummy. Like a puppet 
               that's been propped up. He's fucked -- his whole side ravaged 
               with shot -- his arm shredded -- hand barely there -- blood 
               flowing fast --

                                     BOURNE
                         Who else is coming?

               THE PROFESSOR staring up at the gun. Stunned. Doomed. Mouth 
               dry. Eyes struggling to make sense of the chaos.

                                     BOURNE
                         I won't ask again.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         I work alone. Like you...
                              (confused beat)
                         ...we always work alone.

                                     BOURNE
                         What do you mean?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         Who are you? Rome? Paris?
                              (Bourne is just staring --)
                         Treadstone... both of us... I was 
                         warned but...

                                     BOURNE
                         Treadstone?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...which one are you?...

               BOURNE lowering the weapon -- head swimming --

                                     BOURNE
                         Paris. I live in Paris...

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...headaches... you have that... I 
                         get such bad headaches...

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...it's a problem...

               He's losing blood fast -- things inside him seizing up --

                                     BOURNE
                         Treadstone.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...or in a car... when it's dark... 
                         something with the headlights...
                              (circuits exploding)
                         ...pills, right? Treadstone had those 
                         pills...

                                     BOURNE
                         What is Treadstone?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...what did you do?... you must've 
                         really fucked up...

                                     BOURNE
                         I think so.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...someone said caffeine -- for a 
                         headache... doesn't seem...

                                     BOURNE
                         What do they want me to do?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...they won't let you go...

                                     BOURNE
                         Why?

               THE PROFESSOR -- coughing -- a spasm -- helpless --

                                     PROFESSOR
                         Look at this...
                              (all the blood --)
                         ...least you have a woman....

               And he's gone. Like that. Sitting there. And BOURNE looks 
               paralyzed too. Kneeling there. Stalled out.

                                     MARIE
                         Jason...

               BOURNE doesn't answer -- can't, because there's this sound -- 
               this pulsing hum -- BOURNE reaching into THE PROFESSOR'S 
               POCKET and --

               INSERT -- THE E-PHONE PAGER -- covered in blood -- hum -- 
               hum -- hum -- BOURNE'S HAND wiping at the blood that covers 
               the display --

               BOURNE staring at it. Very familiar to him.

                                     MARIE
                         We've got to go.

               INT. METRO CAR -- DAY

               BOURNE and MARIE racing back through the cars -- away from 
               the scene of the crime and --

               EXT. ABOVE-GROUND METRO PLATFORM -- DAY

               THE SHATTERED TRAIN pulling into the station -- doors opening -- 
               SCREAMS ECHOING through the station from up the platform and --

               BOURNE and MARIE getting off the last car and --

               EXT. STREET/ALLEY NEAR THE PLATFORM -- DAY

               Two minutes later. BOURNE and MARIE -- exhausted -- beat -- 
               Everything all at once --

                                     BOURNE
                         Take this.

               She turns. He's holding the locker key.

                                     BOURNE
                         Take it.

               But she doesn't move.

                                     MARIE
                         And that's it?

                                     BOURNE
                         If you're lucky.
                              (it's hanging there)
                         Take it.
                              (beat)
                         There's enough in there to make a 
                         life. Any life. Just get out now. 
                         Get low. Stay low.
                              (beat)
                         Take it.

               She takes it. Staring at him. Simply refusing to cry.

                                     MARIE
                         What was I thinking, right?

                                     BOURNE
                         I can't protect you anymore.

                                     MARIE
                         What about you?

                                     BOURNE
                         I'm gonna find the end of this.
                              (beat)
                         I can't protect you.

               MARIE takes one last look. And she's running --

               BOURNE hangs there a moment -- listening to her go -- and 
               then he pulls out THE E-PHONE PAGER. And it's pulsing like 
               crazy.

               BOURNE flips open the shell. There's a keypad in there.

               Holding it. Like a missing organ.

               INT. THE ZURICH AIRPORT MOTEL ROOM -- DAY

               Remember MANHEIM? He's still there waiting. And his pager 
               goes off, and --

               INT. TREADSTONE PARIS -- NIGHT

               A safehouse -- CONKLIN filling a burn bag -- racing -- 
               everything's going --

               EXT. TREADSTONE PARIS -- NIGHT

               CONKLIN done with the dirty work -- out into the street --

               As he's about to leave -- he hears a sound -- a familiar 
               sound -- hum -- hum -- hum --

               He cross the street -- looks down to the Quai below --

               Holy shit -- there's one of his E-PHONE PAGERS --

               He goes down -- picks it up --

               And now --

                                     BOURNE
                         What did you do to me?

               CONKLIN wheels around. There he is. Right behind him.

                                     CONKLIN
                         What did I do? What've you done? Do 
                         you have any idea? Any conception? 
                         What you've destroyed? Do you have 
                         any idea how much time and work -- 
                         how many people have their lives 
                         wrapped up in this?

               So now you know.

                                     BOURNE
                         Are you Treadstone?

                                     CONKLIN
                         Am I Treadstone? Me?
                              (peering at him closely 
                              now --)
                         What the hell're you talking about?

               BOURNE showing nothing -- or is he trying too hard not to?

                                     BOURNE
                         What did you do to me?

                                     CONKLIN
                         What did I do? I spent thirty million 
                         dollars on you. I spent three years 
                         finding you -- four years training 
                         you --
                              (incredulous)
                         What did I do?
                              (staring now)
                         What in the name of God have you 
                         been doing, Jason?

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know.

                                     CONKLIN
                         They're right about you, aren't they? 
                         You're fried.
                              (on it now)
                         You really don't know what's going 
                         on, do you?

                                     BOURNE
                         I know you've been trying to kill 
                         me.

                                     CONKLIN
                         Of course. We had to try. We didn't 
                         know what was wrong.
                              (warming to this --)
                         We didn't know you were in trouble.

                                     BOURNE
                         So now you know.

                                     CONKLIN
                         So it's time to go home.

                                     BOURNE
                         That's all I get?

                                     CONKLIN
                         We'll make you better. We can put 
                         the pieces back. We can do that.

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't think so.

                                     CONKLIN
                         We have to go home, Jason.

                                     BOURNE
                         Jason Bourne is dead.

                                     CONKLIN
                         There never was a Jason Bourne.
                              (that gets him)
                         You have to come with me. It's the 
                         only way. We can give it back to 
                         you...

                                     BOURNE
                         Keep it.
                              (and he's walking --)

                                     CONKLIN
                         Jason...
                              (trying to follow --)
                         They can't let you go...

                                     BOURNE
                         That'll be their second worst mistake.

               And with that, BOURNE scrambles up a wall -- like it's nothing -- 
               CONKLIN just left there -- on the Quai -- in the dark --

               EXT. BANKS OF THE SEINE -- NIGHT

               BOURNE walking away -- faster and faster --

               EXT. BANKS OF THE SEINE NEARBY -- NIGHT

               MANHEIM -- A CAR PARKED IN THE DARKNESS -- sitting alone 
               with his briefcase. Opening it. There's his gun.

               BOURNE -- walking -- deeper into the darkness and --

               MANHEIM -- in the dark car -- loading the weapon -- calm -- 
               steady -- methodical and --

               BOURNE -- walking and --

               MANHEIM -- stepping out of the car -- closing the door quietly -- 
               deep in the shadows and --

               BOURNE -- still coming -- the darkest part of the path just 
               ahead and --

               MANHEIM -- raising the gun and --

               THE CAMERA SPINS TO HIS TARGET AND --

               IT'S CONKLIN! -- just climbing back up from the Quai --

               MANHEIM -- the gun -- phftt -- phftt -- phftt --

               CONKLIN -- three holes -- head -- heart -- gut -- his body 
               dropping like a stone beside his car.

               MANHEIM walks over. Looks down. Point blank -- phftt -- that 
               makes it four and --

               INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS DESK -- NIGHT

               ABBOTT and ZORN alone in the dark. As a red light begins 
               pulsing on the console.

               That red light means Conklin's dead.

               After a moment, ZORN moves to the console and shuts the light 
               off.

               EXT. BANKS OF THE SEINE -- NIGHT

               BOURNE still walking. And he's just gonna keep on going, as 
               we --

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. CIA OPERATIONS CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

               MARSHALL at the head of the table. A cadre of INTEL HONCHOS.

                                     ABBOTT (O.S.)
                         The Treadstone project has actually 
                         already been terminated. It was 
                         designed primarily as a sort of 
                         advanced game program...

               ABBOTT in the hot seat. ZORN right there beside him.

                                     ABBOTT
                         ...We'd hoped it might build into a 
                         good training platform, but quite 
                         honestly, for a strictly theoretical 
                         exercise, we thought it was far too 
                         expensive. The cost-benefit ratio 
                         was just too high. It's been all but 
                         decommissioned at this point.

                                     MARSHALL
                         All right, what's next?

               ZORN handing ABBOTT the next hundred pages.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Okay, this is Blackbriar. Blackbriar 
                         is a joint, DOD, communications 
                         program that we really feel has good 
                         traction to it.

               ABBOTT is just gonna go on and on and on.

               EXT. MARTHA'S VINEYARD -- DAY

               Gorgeous Summer day. A SCOOTER RENTAL SHACK near the beach.

               SIX MONTHS LATER

               MARIE coming out of the shack with two helmets. Handing them 
               to A HAPPY COUPLE waiting there on their scooters.

               THE HAPPY COUPLE rides off.

               MARIE turns back and --

               There's BOURNE. A new look. A smile.

                                     MARIE
                         Can I help you?

                                     BOURNE
                         This your store?

                                     MARIE
                         Yes.

                                     BOURNE
                         Think I could rent a scooter?

                                     MARIE
                         You have ID?

                                     BOURNE
                         Not really.

               Beat. He smiles.

                                     MARIE
                         It's not a problem.

               Her turn to smile. And we...

                                                                  FADE OUT:

1   EXT.   NIGHT.   HOUSING PROJECTS -- MOSCOW                    1

    SMASH CUT

    MOTION -- flat out -- it's us -- we're running -- stumbling
    -- breathing rushed -- blood in the snow...

    We are JASON BOURNE and we're running down an alley...

    Supered below:   MOSCOW

    BLUE LIGHTS -- from the distance -- strobing through the
    night -- rushing toward us -- POLICE CARS -- three of them -
    - SIRENS HOWLING as they bear down -- closer -- faster --
    until they whip past the alley...

    Up against the wall -- BOURNE is hidden in the shadows.

    BOURNE is badly wounded -- shot through the shoulder --
    bruises and broken bones from the final car chase in
    SUPREMACY...

    With a GROAN, he lifts himself up, staggers across a park
    toward a PHARMACY...


4   INT. NIGHT. PHARMACY -- MOSCOW                                4

    ROWS of MEDICINE and FIRST AID supplies, and in the
    background, a DOOR being jimmied...It's BOURNE...The ALARM
    goes off...

    MACRO ON -- MEDICINE BOTTLE

    VICODIN, as BOURNE grabs it...Then PENICILLIN...

    Then SURGICAL SUPPLIES:

    Scalpel...Forceps...Sutures...Cotton gauze...Betadine...

    BOURNE finds a large sink...Rests his gun there...Lays out
    SURGICAL SUPPLIES...Checks out his back in the
    mirror...Opens the capsules of penicillin and pours the
    powder directly into the wound...Begins treating himself...


5   EXT. NIGHT. PHARMACY -- MOSCOW                                5

    A POLICE CAR pulls up to the curb, lights flashing. One
    POLICEMAN goes to the jimmied DOOR. SECOND POLICEMAN sees
    blood and footprints. He motions to his partner to
    follow...


6   INT. NIGHT. PHARMACY BATHROOM -- MOSCOW                       6

    BOURNE finishing up -- splashes water on his face -- he
    seems a man on a mission. He looks up --

                                                                 2


       A MIRROR.

       His face...

                             DISEMBODIED VOICE (HIRSCH)
                   Welcome to the program...

       POV Bourne walks down a corridor (corridor #1).


6AA    INT. NIGHT PHARMACY -- MOSCOW                                  6AA

       The cops approaching.

       Daniels leading Bourne down the corridor.

                             DISEMBODIED VOICE (V.O.)
                   You'll be saving American lives.

       A black sack is thrown over Bourne's head, then:

       (STOCK) A torrent of quick shots of Bourne's kills: the
       Professor, Jarda, the blonde guy in Paris, Mr. And Mrs.
       Neski...

       And finally. BANG -- Marie hit in the head.      The car off
       the bridge. She sinks away dead...


6A     INT.   NIGHT   PHARMACY -- MOSCOW                              6A

       The POLICE enter the back room, guns drawn.

                             POLICEMAN #1
                   Put your hands on your head and
                   turn around slowly!

       BOURNE snaps out of it, doesn't move. POLICEMAN #1 (older)
       approaches him. When BOURNE doesn't respond to his
       questions, the POLICEMAN starts forward. BOURNE turns and
       in one motion grabs his gun from the sink and disables the
       POLICEMAN.

       BOURNE freezes POLICEMAN #2 with his gun and a look.

                             BOURNE
                        (in Russian)
                   Give me your gun and radio.

       POLICEMAN #2's gun and radio skittle across the floor.

                                                              3


                           BOURNE
                     (in Russian)
                 My argument is not with you.

     BOURNE smashes the radio and takes the gun.

     BOURNE exits...

8C   INT. CIA -- DAY                                              8C

     A workman installs a nameplate that reads:    Ezra Kramer,
     Director, CIA.


8C   INT. KRAMER'S OFFICE -- DAY                                  8C

     Kramer listens to a recording with Landy and Cronin. There
     are unhung pictures and a few other items that indicate he
     has just moved into this job.

                                                          4


Two other senior CIA officials sit in on the meeting.
Kramer looks at a file on Bourne and Abbott.

                    BOURNE (V.O.)
          So we got in the way?   Is that
          why Neski died? Is that why you
          killed Marie?

Kramer glances at a photo of Marie in the file.

                    ABBOTT (V.O.)
          You killed Marie the minute you
          climbed into her car.   The
          minute you entered her life she
          was dead!

Kramer looks at Abbott's official photo.

                    BOURNE (V.O.)
          I told you people to leave me
          alone! I fell off the grid. I
          was half way around the world.

                    ABBOTT (V.O.)
          There's no place it won't catch
          up to you. It's how every story
          ends. It's what you are, Jason.
          A killer! You always will be.

THUMP!

                    CRONIN
          We think that's Bourne hitting
          him on the head and then--

He makes a gun with his hand, i.e. Bourne putting his gun
to Abbott's head.

                       ABBOTT (V.O.)
          Go ahead!     Go on! Do it!

                    BOURNE (V.O.)
          She wouldn't want me to. That's
          the only reason your alive.

The tape clicks off.

                    KRAMER
          Who's "she?"

CRONIN puts a picture of MARIE in front of KRAMER.

                    LANDY
          His girlfriend, Marie. She was
          killed in India three weeks ago.

Kramer looks down at another image.     Abbott dead after his
suicide.

                                                        5


                    KRAMER
          A dirty section chief in league
          with a corrupt Russian
          Billionaire commits suicide when
          confronted by Jason Bourne. You
          couldn't make this stuff up.
              (holds up the photo of
               Abbot dead)
          You watched this happen?

Landy nods.   Kramer shakes his head in disgust at the whole
situation.

                    KRAMER
          Bourne's last confirmed location
          is Moscow, three days ago?

                       LANDY
          Right.

                    KRAMER
          So what does he do now?

                    LANDY
          I think he's looking for
          something he hasn't found.

                       KRAMER
          Like what?     What's he after?

                     LANDY
          I'm not sure. Maybe he hasn't
          gotten his memory back yet.  Not
          all of it.

A look from Kramer...

                    KRAMER
          Pam, what I need to know is, what
          kind of a threat is he to us?

                    LANDY
          If he just wanted to hurt us he
          could have sent this tape to CNN.

                    KRAMER
          Maybe he still will. Maybe he
          gave it to you because he wants
          to throw you in the opposite
          direction of his real plan. I
          don't know. I just know my
          number one rule is "the only way
          to stay safe is to assume the
          worst."   As far as I'm concerned
          Bourne is a serious threat until
          proven otherwise.

                     had half of Interpol after him --
                     disappeared...Turned up in Naples
                     -- Berlin -- Moscow --
                     disappeared again...
                         (Daniels says nothing)
                     The girl he was on he run with --
                     Marie Kreutz -- she turned up
                     dead halfway around the world,
                     from a sniper's bullet...
                         (beat)
                     What connects the dots? Is it
                     Treadstone?

24     INT. DAY. MARTIN'S APARTMENT -- PARIS                       24

       The charm of old Paris captured in the workings of an
       elevator operating in a wrought-iron shaft...

                                                          7


A WORK TABLE, covered with sheet music, music paper,
pencils. And, sitting on the upright piano against the
wall, a framed PHOTO of MARIE...

A KNOCK on a door beautifully, heavily lacquered with
centuries of paint...

MARTIN KREUTZ, late 20s, opens the door and finds BOURNE. A
long look between them -- like two lost brothers who
recognize each other -- each has been waiting for this
moment for a long time.


INT. CONTINUOUS. MARTIN'S APARTMENT

Martin looks out the window.

                    MARTIN
          Where is my sister?

                    BOURNE
          She's dead. She was killed.

                    MARTIN
          I knew it was going to end this
          way. It was always going to end
          this way...

                    BOURNE
          I didn't believe that.

                    MARTIN
          Why did she die?

                    BOURNE
          She was shot. A man came for me.

                    MARTIN
          And then you killed him.

Bourne nods.

                      MARTIN
          Now what?

                    BOURNE
          Someone started all this...and
          I'm going to find them.

Bourne looks at him for a beat and leaves.


EXT. SUBWAY -- DAY

Bourne climbs the stairs.

Bourne rounds a corner and stops, sees a bodyguard at a
door up the street hail a car then go back inside.

                                                            8


     Bourne walks up to the door, the bodyguard comes out again.
     Bourne knocks him aside. Grabs the man behind him,
     ELLATRACHE.

                          BOURNE
                    (in French)
                Who started Treadstone?

     The bodyguard comes back, gun out--

                           ELLATRACHE
                    (in French, to
                      bodyguard)
                It's OK!
                    (in French, to Bourne)
                They're still looking for you.
                You are taking a big risk coming
                here.

     Bourne shoves him against the wall, hard.

                          BOURNE
                    (in French)
                Just tell me what I want to know!

                          ELLATRACHE
                    (in French)
                I just provided them weapons.    I
                don't know who started--

                          BOURNE
                    (in French)
                You know something.   Tell me
                where to start looking.

                          ELLATRACHE
                    (in French)
                There's a journalist in London.
                Simon Ross. He seems to know a
                lot about you.   He has a source
                inside the program. Someone
                there from the beginning. What
                should I tell them if they
                contact me?

                          BOURNE
                    (in English)
                They give me the name I want, or
                I burn their entire house down to
                get it.


16   EXT.   DAY. HEATHROW AIRPORT -- LONDON                     16

     ROSS hurries to catch a TAXI as he talks on his cell phone.

                                                             9


                               ROSS
                    ...This is big -- a skein of lies
                    -- you pull at it and it just
                    keeps coming -- I'll fill you in
                    when I get home. And it's not
                    finished, either.
                        (beat)
                    They're calling it `Blackbriar'.

                    Sir, we intercepted a call from
                    London, keyword "Blackbriar."

                              SUPERVISOR

25E   INT.   DAY. CRI OFFICES -- NEW YORK CITY                    25E

      As VOSEN steps out of the elevator and into his office, he
      is met by his #2, WILLS.

                               WILLS
                    We tracked the phone. Registered
                    to a London reporter named Simon
                    Ross. He works at the Guardian
                    newspaper.

                                                            10


      They enter a hallway through double doors towards the HUB.

                          VOSEN
                You tracking him?

      As they pass through, colleague hands WILLS a file.

                          WILLS
                Yeah, thanks Mike. We have a
                survey team covering him at
                work...and a sneak and peek's on
                their way to his apartment.

                          VOSEN
                Well, who talked to him? How did
                he find out about Blackbriar?

                          WILLS
                We don't know, we pulled his
                background and ran a cross check
                on any known anomalies, but we've
                come up with nothing. But, I
                think if we follow Ross, we are
                going to be able...

                         VOSEN
                Right. Ross is easy. I want the
                source.

      They enter the HUB.

      VOSEN and WILLIS listen to the phone call.

                          ROSS (VOICEOVER)
                Have you heard of an Operation
                Blackbriar? I'm going to try and
                get my head around this, see you
                first thing.

      VOSEN turns.

                          VOSEN
                Is that all?

                            WILLS
                Yeah.

                                                            11


                            VOSEN
                  I want rendition protocols and I
                  want the asset put on standby,
                  just in case.


26B   INT.   DAY -- CRI HUB                                      26B

                  People, listen up, this is a full
                  priority situation

                  Jimmy, give me Ross's profile on
                  one.
                       (points at the big
                        screen on the wall)

      ROSS'S information come up on the center screen.

                            VOSEN
                  Our target is a British national,
                  Simon Ross, a reporter. I want
                  all his phones, his blackberry,
                  his apartment, his car, bank
                  accounts, credit cards, travel
                  patterns...I want to know what
                  he's going to think before he
                  does. Every dirty little secret
                  he has. And most of all, we want
                  the name and real time location
                  of his source.


                  This is NSA priority level 4, any
                  questions?

      No response from the HUB.

                            VOSEN (CONT'D)
                  All right, let's get to it.

      BOURNE reads The Guardian. He sees an article written by
      Simon Ross.   Title: "RENEGADE ASSASSIN LOSE IN EUROPE".
      It mentions BOURNE. There is a photo of Marie--

FB2   FLASHBACK                                                  FB2

      Marie smiles at him. Marie shot. Marie fades into the
      depths, dead. Bourne burns Marie's stuff


26D   INT. DAY. EUROSTAR                                           26D

      BOURNE comes out of the flashback.    He is still carrying
      the pain of her loss

      Bourne finds Ross's name on the masthead, then goes to the
      name just below it in the news department.


29    EXT.   DAY   GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER -- LONDON                    29

      Ross crosses a busy London street -- heads to Guardian

      Off VOSEN.


R34   INT. DAY. GUARDIAN EDITOR OFFICE -- LONDON                   R34

                   So how do we know he's not
                   spinning for someone?

                             ROSS
                   There's more. He was scared.

                                                     13


                           EDITOR
                 Scared of what?

                           ROSS
                 Blackbriar.

      A REPORTER sticks her head in.

                           REPORTER
                 Sorry, a call for you.

                              ROSS
                 Who is it?

                           REPORTER
                 Won't give hie name.

      ROSS leaves to pick up the call.


35Y   INT. CONTINUOUS. GUARDIAN -- NEWSROOM               35Y

      ROSS crosses the busy newsroom...

                           REPORTER
                 He's on my line...

      ROSS picks up the phone.

                 Simon Ross.


35H   INT. DAY. CRI HUB -- NEW YORK CITY                  35H

      VOSEN watches as ROSS takes phone call.

                           VOSEN
                 Why aren't we hearing this?

                           WILLS
                 That's a hard line, Jimmy, why
                 don't we have it?

                            JIMMY
                 We have his line, sir, but he's
                 not on it.

      WILLS looks confused.

                    You want to talk to me. Come

      ROSS moves to the entrance.

      Behind him, inside the tube station portico, BOURNE
      arrives.

      Sees ROSS. Sees the two survey teams. MOBILE ONE up the
      stair well and MOBILE TWO at street level.

      Commuters coming up the escalators. BOURNE joins them -
      moving towards Ross.

      Closer.

      Right on him.   ROSS oblivious.   Looking out onto the
      street.

      BOURNE brushes past him and PUTS THE PHONE IN HIS POCKET..

      ROSS feels the contact. Checking himself -- he's okay.
      But now a phone is ringing -- looks around, must be someone
      else.

      But the vibration's coming from his jacket pocket.

      ROSS takes out the phone -- not his -- puzzled.

      ROSS hits "answer."

                                                            17

                          BOURNE
                The article. You talked to
                someone from Treadstone. Someone
                there at the beginning.  What's
                his name?

                I can't tell you that.... Who's
                following me?

                          ROSS
                I don't know. I heard the name
                this morning for the first time.
                Whatever it is, my source said it
                started with you.

                                                              23


      One AGENT, then another approaching.

      He dials.

                             BOURNE (O.C.)
                  Three o'clock. Female. Blonde
                  black top.

                            ROSS
                  Has she seen me?

                            BOURNE
                  Not yet. Dip left past the photo
                  kiosk.

      ROSS spinning round. Dipping left.   BLACK TOP passing in
      the background missing him.

      BOURNE crossing close behind - marshalling the pieces at
      breakneck speed.

                            BOURNE (CONT'D)
                  Straight ahead. News kiosk.

      ROSS turning.   Weaving through the commuters.

      BOURNE seeing cameras turn.    ROSS heading into their path.

                            BOURNE (CONT'D)
                  Change of plan. Stop. Tie your
                  shoelace.

      BOURNE seeing ROSS dip out of view as a group of TOURISTS
      block the CCTV's line of sight.


64H   INT. DAY. CRI HUB                                            64H

      That same scene -- scores of TOURISTS -- from VOSEN's point
      of view. The TECHS try to get another angle...


94    EXT. DAY. CONCOURSE -- WATERLOO                                94

      ROSS looking through the sea of legs as he finishes tying
      his laces. Cameras sweeping past.

                            ROSS
                  Are we clear?

                            BOURNE
                  Clear. News kiosk. Straight
                  ahead.

      ROSS on the move. Sweating. Paranoid.

      Seeing a BIN MAN coming toward him -- reaching into his
      trolley.

                                                              24


                          ROSS
                Straight toward me.     Bin man?

                            BOURNE
                Negative.

                          ROSS
                He's got a gun.

                            BOURNE
                Negative.    Keep straight ahead.

      But ROSS swerves out of his path as the BIN MAN pulls out --
      a bunch of keys.

      CCTV CAMERAS turn -- ZOOMING IN ON ROSS.


64H   INT. DAY. CRI HUB -- NEW YORK                                64H

      Ross' face on all screens.

                We got a hit. Middle of the
                concourse.

      VOSEN pacing.

                          VOSEN
                We're losing him! We cannot
                afford to lose him!

      Frenzied teching as they capture and transmit an image of
      Ross to...


96    EXT. DAY. TAXI RANK -- WATERLOO                              96

      PAZ flipping open his phone. A voice crackling in his
      earpiece.

                          VOICE
                Waterloo concourse. Subject
                heading east.

      Paz jamming the wheel hard right. Doing a high speed U-
      turn.

      Heading towards the east side of the station.


94    EXT. DAY. CONCOURSE                                          94

      BOURNE realizes ROSS has been seen. Sees the AGENTS
      starting to form the box...

                          BOURNE
                Get into cover. Now!

                                                               25


      ROSS moving faster.

                          VOSEN
64H             What's the status of the asset?                     64H

                          WILLS
                In place in one minute.

                          VOSEN
                Alright, I want to take him now.
                Get him out of there and have the
                asset cover it.

      WILLS gives orders...


96    INT. CAR TRAVELLING-- MEPHAM STREET -- DAY.                   96

      PAZ pulling into a side street. Out towards a series of
      arches that lead underneath the terminal. In his ear...

                          VOICE
                Target moving towards the stores.

                          ANOTHER VOICE
                Asset in play. ETA thirty
                seconds. All exits covered.

      PAZ through the archway. Grabbing a station plan. Studying
      it.

98    Through a subterranean maze of corridors. Up steps.           98
      Through doors.

      On his way to the kill zone.


99    EXT. CONCOURSE-- CONTINUOUS -- DAY                            99

      ROSS moving through crowds around the departures board.

      BOURNE hearing that last exchange in his earpiece too.
      Asset in play?

                          BOURNE
                Keep moving...

      BOURNE's POV: AGENTS closing the box. The departures board.
      Platform 7. A train waiting.

                             BOURNE (CONT'D)
                Faster....

      Commuters waiting for the platform

                          BOURNE (CONT'D)
                The front...

                                                               26


       Suddenly -- CLICK -- PLATFORM 7 displays.

       A wave of commuters flooding away -- sweeping the AGENTS
       back with them towards platform 7.

                           BOURNE (CONT'D)
                 GET IN THE STORE.

       BOURNE'S bought them thirty seconds.


100    INT. TUNNELS ABOVE THE CONCOURSE -- DAY                      100

       PAZ on the move. Earpiece crackling. Through a door. Taking
       a left down another tunnel.

       Opens another security door and moves up some steps.
       Towards a ladder.


100A   EXT. CONCOURSE WATERLOO -- SIMULTANEOUSLY -- DAY           100A

       The AGENTS regrouping. Speaking into their radios.

                           Voice
                 He's in the store -- still moving
                 east.

       ROSS out into the open again. In front of him another STORE
       COMPLEX.

                           BOURNE
                 INSIDE!

       BOURNE searching the concourse. Something bothering him.
       The threat level clicking another notch.


102A/B INT. MAINTENANCE AREA-- SIMULTANEOUSLY -- DAY           102A/B

       PAZ heads up some stairs to a service platform.

       Climbs a ladder.


101    EXT. CONCOURSE -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY                          101

       ROSS into the store complex. To one side is a service
       doorway.

       BOURNE sees the AGENTS approaching. Looks the other way --
       up at the hoardings above.

       Something's not right. Treadstone instinct.

                           BOURNE
                 Service doorway -- Now!

                                                                27


64H    INT. NEW YORK HUB -- SIMULTANEOUS -- DAY                      64H

       An image of Ross as he enters the store complex appears on
       the screen.

                            TECHY 2
                 Store.   Three means of egress.

                           VOSEN
                 Close him down...


105    INT. STORE COMPLEX -- SIMULTANEOUSLY -- DAY                   105

       ROSS through narrow store corridors. Sheer panic now.
       Two of the AGENTS move in after him.

       BOURNE behind them.

       BANG - takes the first out silently.

                           BOURNE
                 Keep moving.

       ROSS moving out to the light as another AGENT follows.

                           BOURNE (CONT'D)
                 Through the store room.

       ROSS travelling through.   The second AGENT right behind as-

       BOURNE steps out from behind the store room door. The dull
       snap of bones as second AGENT falls to the floor.


64H    INT. DAY -- CRI HUB                                           64H

       On a screen VOSEN watches, transfixed, as BOURNE takes out
       all his agents and then grabs ROBB...

                           VOSEN
                 Jesus Christ, that's Jason
                 Bourne.

                           WILLS
                 Maybe he's the source?

                           VOSEN
                 It doesn't matter, the asset now
                 has 2 targets. Take them both
                 out.

       WILLS taps in the order...


102B   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA-- DAY                               102B

       PAZ moves cross a narrow walkway.

                                                                28


       Now he's behind a mechanical 'tri-panel' hoarding. The kind
       that displays a different advert every 15 seconds. He waits
       for the change and then---

       -- A huge field of vision across the concourse stretching
       out down below him- a sniper's heaven.

       PAZ pulling open the motor-casing from the side panel, goes
       to work on it.

       Slowing the rotation. Rearranging the large triangular
       prisms to give him just the right time-gap to pull the
       trigger- and just enough cover to disappear.

       He takes out rifle parts from his rucksack. Starts to
       assemble them.


102C   INT. BEHIND THRESHERS (BEHIND THE SILVER METAL DOOR)        102C

                              BOURNE
                    I'm going to get you to safety
                    but you have to stay calm do
                    exactly what I say.

                              ROSS
                        (fear-induced autopilot)
                    Sure, okay.

                              BOURNE
                    No, listen to me: Exactly what I
                    say this time. Understand?

       Ross snaps to focus.     Looks Bourne in the eye.

                              ROSS
                    Yes.

                              BOURNE
                    Stay here while I look for an
                    escape.

       Ross nods.


102B   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA                                       102B

       PAZ puts together the rifle.


103    INT. WATERLOO STATION                                         103

       BOURNE exits from the silver door behind Threshers.    He
       stays on the phone with Ross.

       Hidden from the view of the CCTV cameras by the thick
       crowd, Bourne sees the approaching agents abruptly pulling
       back.

                                                                     29


                            ROSS (PHONE V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  I can see the entrance from here
                  I can make it out--

                            BOURNE
                  No, stay behind that door.


64H   INT. HUB                                                            64H

      CCTV view of the silver door behind Threshers that ROSS is
      behind (not Bourne). Wills is on phone.

                            WILLS
                  There. That silver door.
                  Bourne's behind that door?

                               TECH
                  Confirmed.

                            WILLS
                  Okay, pull the agents back and
                  give Bourne's location to the
                  asset.


107   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA                                               107

      On his cell phone Paz receives a text indicating Bourne's
      location. Paz finds the silver door and aims his rifle at
      it.

      SCOPE POV

      A shape barely visible moving behind the window.           (It's
      Ross but Paz and the Hub think it's Bourne.


111   INT. BEHIND THRESHERS /         WATERLOO CONCOURSE-- DAY            111

      INTERCUTTING BETWEEN ROSS AND BOURNE:

      Bourne spots the agents pulling back per Wills' orders.

                            ROSS (INTO PHONE)
                  If I run now I can make it--

                             BOURNE (INTO PHONE
                  No.   Something's not right.


107   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA                                               107

      Paz awaiting his shot--

                                                               30


       SCOPE POV

       The door comes open slightly, but from this angle Paz
       doesn't have a clean shot at his target (who he thinks is
       Bourne).


111    INT. CONCOURSE -- WATERLOO                                   111

       Bourne searches the rafters, looking for any threats from
       above.

                             ROSS (TEL. V.O.)
                   I'm going to go for it, okay?

                             BOURNE
                   Don't move until I tell you.

       Bourne is distracted by the last of the agents
       disappearing. Something is definitely wrong--

                             ROSS
                   I'm going to go for it.

                             BOURNE
                   No, No not now.

       Ross suddenly sprints out from behind the door--


110A   SCOPE POV                                                110A

       Paz sees the shape emerge--


110A   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA -- DAY                             110A

       PAZ fires--


111    INT. WATERLOO -- SERIES OF ANGLES                            111

       But it's Ross, not Bourne. Ross is hit by Paz's shot.    He
       falls, inches from the silver door, dead. Blood has
       splattered on the door.


110A   INT. PAZ'S NEST                                          110A

       Paz snaps his head back to the scope, realizing he's shot
       the wrong person. Then he catches a glimpse of Bourne--

       Bourne ducks behind the gathering crowd, out of Paz's line
       of sight, and goes to the body.

                                                              31

       Vosen and Wills stare at the screen. At the image of Ross,
       dead on the concourse.   The room -- normally full of
       chatter has gone dead silent...

       Vosen puts his head in his hands. This is a monumental
       screw up and everyone here knows it.  He just had the
       wrong man killed....

                            VOSEN
                  Oh...shit...

       Then suddenly Vosen snaps back to focus:

                            VOSEN (CONT'D)
                  Get the asset out of there ...

                            WILLS
                  What about Bourne?

       On the HUB MONITORS we see Police moving in... Vosen
       doesn't need to see anymore.

                            VOSEN
                  Get him out of there - NOW!


111    INT. WATERLOO -- DAY                                        111

       Bourne feels Ross' body for something.

110A   PAZ'S   NEST                                             110A

       Paz is frustrated by the order. He's itching to get another
       shot off at Bourne, but after a beat, packs up quickly, as
       ordered.


111    INT. WATERLOO -- DAY                                        111

       Back in Waterloo, Cops run in from all sides.


111A   INT. DAY. WATERLOO STATION                               111A

       On the screens and in real life, the aftermath of the hit.
       PARAMEDICS try helplessly to deal with ROSS -- killed
       instantly by the head shot meant for BOURNE...POLICE arrive
       and seal off the crime scene...

                                                                32


113    EXT. CONCOURSE WATERLOO -- SIMULTANEOUSLY -- DAY              113

       BOURNE on the move. Fast --

       Past platforms. On his way up to the Tri Panel.

       Up stairs. On to a walkway.   To his right he sees a figure
       disappearing...

       PAZ.

       BOURNE hammers down the walk - way in pursuit.


114    EXT. PLATFORM AREA -- DAY                                     114

       BOURNE tailing PAZ down on to a parallel platform. PAZ
       dipping down into the underground entrance.


115/116 INT. TUBE STATION -- WATERLOO -- DAY                 115/116

       PAZ moving deliberately through the evening rush hour--
       blending in...

       BOURNE in pursuit. Chasing on instinct.

       There...A glimpse of PAZ at the bottom of an escalator.

       BOURNE fights past people.

       PAZ disappears into the crowd.

       BOURNE rushes to catch him. Rounding a corner...

       A long walkway -- at the end, two staircases lead to
       different tube lines. BOURNE hesitates-- measures the
       choice.

       The sound of a train fills the station--

       BOURNE -- Fast downstairs.

       Watches-- just as PAZ gets onto the car at another door.

       BOURNE lunges to get on the train...But the doors close...

       BOURNE'S POV

       Watching PAZ from the platform as he SAGS down onto a seat,
       nauseated, his skin clammy, his head pounding...He takes
       out the PILLS and dry-swallows them...Looks up...

       CLOSE ON -- BOURNE

       Watching PAZ...As if he's looking in the MIRROR at his old
       self...The self before THE BOURNE IDENTITY...

                                                                33


       CLOSE ON -- PAZ

       He looks straight ahead, just another commuter...

       BACK ON -- BOURNE

       Watching PAZ, as the train pulls away...Then BOURNE is
       immediately in motion...


119    INT. DAY. DIRECTOR'S OFFICE -- CIA -- LANGLEY, VA             119

                            KRAMER
                   Hello.

                             VOSEN
                   It's Vosen. We have a situation.


119B   EXT. NIGHT.   DANIELS OFFICE -- MADRID                    119B

       Establishing Sewell and Marbury.


120    INT. NIGHT. DANIELS OFFICE                                    120

       DANIELS watches news of ROSS murder on TV. DANIELS panics,
       opens his safe, packs up papers, takes Blackbriar FILE.
       Sets alarm. Leaves.


120C   EXT. NIGHT. INTERNET CAFE -- LONDON.                      120C

       BOURNE sits at a computer, the ROSS notebook open in front
       of him. He pages through it, finding names, places, "HOW
       DID THIS ALL START?" -- and Blackbriar.   He Googles
       "Sewell and Marbury"-- finds Paris, Berlin, Madrid. BOURNE
       continues to search and finds receipt from Madrid.

       BOURNE leaves.

123    EXT. DAY.   POSH HOTEL -- NEW YORK CITY                       123

       LANDY steps out of a TAXI...


123A   INT. DAY.   POSH HOTEL -- NEW YORK CITY                   123A

       Vosen's sitting.

                             VOSEN
                       (to waiter)
                   Sparkling. And a "Heart-Healthy"
                   omelet with goat cheese and
                   peppers.

       Landy arrives.

                                                     34


                    VOSEN
          You're late. Traffic?

                    WAITER
              (handing her the menu)
          Ma'am?

                    LANDY
          Nothing for me.

Vosen looks at her, surprised.

                    VOSEN
          I'm buying.

She shakes her head, no. She sits, without taking her coat
off. She's not staying long.

                    VOSEN
          When the Director called, it was
          suggested we bring you on--

                     LANDY
          Suggested?
              (beat)
          Are you sure it was just a
          suggestion?

                    VOSEN
          Funny how different things look
          depending on where you sit. I
          look at this as doing a favor for
          you. Giving you an opportunity
          to complete some unfinished
          business.

                     LANDY
          Meaning?

                    VOSEN
          Jason Bourne.

                    LANDY
          Bourne's finished.

                     VOSEN
          Really?

                    LANDY
          It was finished the moment I
          realized I was chasing him for
          something he didn't do.   The
          case is closed.

                                              35


                     VOSEN
          So what do you make of this?
              (handing her
               surveillance photos of
               Bourne in Paris)
          French intel picked up Bourne
          meeting Pierre Elattrache on
          Tuesday. He threatened to burn
          our house down if you didn't tell
          him who started Treadstone.
          That's a big problem, wouldn't
          you agree?

                    LANDY
          This doesn't feel like Bourne to
          me.

                    VOSEN
          Why's it so hard for you to
          believe?

                     LANDY
          Probably because it's coming from
          you, Noah.

                    VOSEN
          Lets try and be adults okay? We
          all thought he was done, off the
          grid. But Bourne's back. Maybe
          he's a threat. We both want the
          same thing here.

                    LANDY
          So what happened at Waterloo?

                    VOSEN
          We have a leak. Bourne showed up
          in our surveillance. We had very
          little time to react.

                    LANDY
          And the reporter ended up dead?

                    VOSEN
          Bourne saw us coming.

Landy looks at him, suspicious.

                    LANDY
          So what was he doing?

                    VOSEN?
          We don't know. But just the fact
          that he was there means he's up
          to something, don't you think?
          Maybe he's the source?

                                                                  36


                               LANDY
                     The real question is how you
                     managed to get in a fire fight in
                     the middle of a public train
                     station.

                               VOSEN
                     Don't second guess an operation
                     from an armchair, Pam. It's not
                     fair.

                               LANDY
                     I'm going to the office now.
                     I'll make my own introductions.

       Off VOSEN...


125    EXT.   DAY.    ATOCHA TRAIN STATION -- MADRID                    125

       AN AVE train pulling into the vast station. BOURNE stepping
       out, walking up the platform.

       Moving out through the station...


125A   INT. DAY -- CRI HUB                                          125A

       TWO NEW TECHS plus the three we met before.       All watching
       VOSEN lead LANDY and CRONIN into the room.

                               WILLS
                     This is Pamela Landy. She's
                     gonna be quarterbacking our
                     search effort. I think what we
                     oughta do, just to get started,
                     let's go around the room, say who
                     you are and what your spec is.

       LANDY stepping in before this gets going --

                               LANDY
                     Let's do names later.
                     (she's got the floor)
                     What's Bourne's last fixed
                     position?
                     (impatient)
                     Anybody.

                                TECH#3

                     Status?   Wounded?   Armed?

                                 TECH#2
                     Alive.    Mobile. Unknown.

                                                              37


                             LANDY
                   Where are your grids coming from?

                             TECH#1
                   NSA Tactical.

                             LANDY
                   You have an Echelon package?

                                TECH#1
                   Yes.

                             LANDY
                   Why isn't it on?

                             TECH#1
                   We were waiting.

                              LANDY
                   For what?
                       (no takers)
                   You're nine hours behind the
                   toughest target you've ever
                   tracked. I want everyone to sit
                   down, strap in, and turn on all
                   you've got.
                       (beat)
                   That would mean now.

       That lights it.    They're moving.

                                LANDY (CONT'D)
                   Thank you.

       VOSEN watches...

                             LANDY (CONT'D)
                   I want everything you've got on
                   Ross on screen one.

       LANDY watches as the screen lights up with ROSS
       information...


125B   EXT. DAY.   SEWELL AND MARBURY -- MADRID                125B

       Bourne arrives, begins to recon the area.

       He goes to the front door finds "Sewell and Marbury" and
       rings the bell. No answer. Two cops come around a corner.

       Bourne sees them, notes the side of the building and
       leaves.

                                                       38


125E   INT. DAY.   CRI HUB -- NEW YORK CITY             125E

                              TECH#1
                   Sir, we just hacked Ross's email
                   account at the Guardian and found
                   a round trip ticket to Turin,
                   yesterday. 0800 arrival, 12:05
                   departure.

                             LANDY
                   I think we can be pretty certain
                   that Bourne's not your source
                   then?

                             VOSEN
                   How?

                             LANDY
                   Ross's call to his editor, where
                   he said he just met the source on
                   Blackbriar, took place just after
                   his flight landed. His met his
                   source in Turin.

                             VOSEN
                   So?

                             LANDY
                   So, what, Bourne met Ross for
                   breakfast and then, at noon the
                   same day Bourne calls Ross to
                   demand a meet at Waterloo?

                             CRONIN
                       (Needling Wills)
                   Maybe they were even on the same
                   flight?

                             VOSEN
                   Cross check the secure cell phone
                   usage of everyone with Blackbriar
                   SCI clearance against all calls
                   in and out of Turin during the
                   morning Ross was there

       TECHNICIANS start pounding keyboards.

                             LANDY
                   The guy you're after is a CIA
                   operative with clearance above
                   Top Secret.   He was committing
                   treason by talking to Ross.   Do
                   you really think, while doing
                   that, he used a cell phone he
                   knows we can track?

                             TECH 3 (JIMMY)
                   Zero results on the cross check.

                                                       39


VOSEN stares daggers at her.

                    WILLS
          Do you have a better idea?

                    LANDY
          Yeah, I'd look at all the people
          whose cell phones were switched
          off the entire period Ross was in
          Turin.

                    WILLS
          Do it Jimmy.

TECHNICIANS start tapping.

                    LANDY
              (looks at Cronin)
          I mean if your people use their
          cell phones as much as mine do,
          the list should be pretty small

                    TECHNICIAN 3 JIMMY
          Three names: Tom Brewster, Jack
          Boulin, Neal Daniels.

The names display on the screen:   Tom Brewster, Jack Boulin
Neal Daniels.

The HUB employees can't help but be impressed by LANDY.
WILLS and VOSEN notice their response.

                    LANDY
          Now check everything in Ross's
          apartment against those names.
          Look for common patterns, look
          for -

                    CRONIN
          Initials .....Bring that up on
          main.

LANDY turns.   CRONIN is leaning down in front of a
computer screen.   Point to something for the tech --- who
puts it on the big screen, blown up.

In a set of handwritten notes by ROSS it says "per
N.D."next to several scrawls.

                    LANDY
          Neal Daniels.   He's Station
          Chief in Madrid now, isn't he?

                  Call the RSO at the Embassy and
                  have them take Daniels into
                  custody if he's there.   If he's
                  not, get a grab team to the
                  Calle Norte safe house. Send
                  them in heavy and tell them we'll
                  assist with entry.

                            LANDY
                  "Heavy?" Daniels isn't--

                            VOSEN
                  I'm worried about Bourne. If he's
                  not Ross's source, then he must
                  be after Ross's source -- just
                  like us.

       Off LANDY...


125F   EXT.   MADRID STREETS -- NIGHT                             125F

       BOURNE in a TAXI turning a corner into a narrow street.
       The rain has slowed, but the streets are still quiet.

       BOURNE gets out and walks past the SEWELL and MARBURY front
       door, picks the lock and gains entry.


126B   INT.   SEWELL AND MARBURY. -- NIGHT                        126B

       BOURNE up the stairs.   Finds the office.    Jimmies the door.
       Disables the alarm.

       All the signs of a hurried exit. A half filled cup of
       coffee -- cigarette burned down in an ashtray but not
       snubbed out -- a light left on -- files and documents, some
       shredded, some not.


127H   INT. HUB                                                   127H

       Vosen paces back and forth. The hub is MUCH quieter than
       it was in the Waterloo scenes.

                            TECH 1. (LUCY)
                  Parque Vasquez is clean. No sign
                  of subject.

127A   EXT.   MADRID STREETS -- NIGHT                           127A

       A BLACK CAR moving briskly through traffic and --


127A   INT.   MOVING BLACK CAR -- NIGHT                         127A

       HAMMOND at the wheel.   KILEY with the map. Shutting off his
       phone.


127B   INT.   SEWELL AND MARBURY -- NIGHT                       127B

       BOURNE checks the office.   Soon he finds a photo of
       Daniels with Albert Hirsch.


FB3    EXT. HOSPITAL ANNEX -- OVERCAST DAY -- FLASHBACK            FB3

       Bourne arrives at a nondescript steel door with two CCTV
       cameras covering it. He sees 415 written above the door.


127B   INT. SEWELL AND MARBURY -- NIGHT                         127B

       The flashback overwhelms Bourne.


FB3A   INT. SRD CORRIDOR -- DAY -- FLASHBACK                    FB3A

       POV shots of Bourne walking down the long corridor with
       Daniels. Other shots revealing that Bourne is in Army dress
       greens (without hat). Daniels knocks and leads Bourne into-
       -


127B   INT. SEWELL AND MARBURY -- NIGHT                         127B

       Bourne is driven to his knees.

FB3C   INT. TANK ROOM -- FLASHBACK                              FB3C

       Bourne is dragged into a room with a large water tank. His
       hands have been bound behind his back, the sack's
       drawstring pulled tight, and he has been weighted down.
       Bourne is shoved into the water.


FB3D   UNDERWATER SHOT -- FLASHBACK                             FB3D

       Bourne falls into the water. SPLASH. He starts to sink.
       The wet sack allows us to see the outlines of his face.
       Also POVs as Bourne sinks.

                                                                  42


FB3E   SERIES OF SHOTS FROM ABOVE AND BELOW WATER --FLASHBACK      FB3E

       Bourne struggles wildly at first. Tries to get out of his
       restraints. But to no avail. SRD men watch him from the
       edge of the tank. Perhaps also on monitors.
       Expressionless.


FB3F   UNDERWATER SHOT - FLASHBACK                                 FB3F

       Bourne fights every human instinct to draw a breath.    Also
       shot from Bourne's POV:

                           HIRSCH (FILTERED, EERIE)
                 You're going to drown. There is
                 nothing you can do to prevent
                 this. Stop struggling and accept
                 it.


       Finally Bourne can't hold his breath for an instant longer.
       His mouth opens. Water rushes in. He convulses, begins to
       drown...


FB3G   INT. TANK ROOM -- FLASHBACK                                 FB3G

       Bourne's body goes limp.   SRD men watch.   No reaction.


FB3H   UNDERWATER SHOT -- FLASHBACK                                FB3H

       BOURNE comes out of the FLASHBACK. As he staggers across
       the room, he notices a car arriving on the monitor...


127C   EXT. STREET                                                 127C

       A car approaches.


127B   INT. SEWELL AND MARBURY                                     127B

       Bourne snaps out of it and sees the car on a security
       monitor.


127C   EXT. STREET.                                                127C

                                 HAMMOND
                     We're in.

       BOURNE listens from his hiding spot.


127H   INT.   DAY.    CRI HUB                                  127H

       HAMMOND and KILEY -- move cautiously from room to room --
       they've done it before...

                                                                  44

       KILEY gestures to a light moving under a door.

       Kiley crouching...leaning in...hand on the knob, and --

       Pulls the closet DOOR OPEN --

       Nothing. Sink, dishes. a small kitchen.         And... on the
       stove...a tea kettle and a spoon...

       Which is the last thing they'll remember, because...

       BOURNE -- coming around the corner fast -- full stop and --

       BOURNE lays out HAMMOND... KILEY turns to find BOURNE --
       who takes him out too.

       Then it stops.

       BOURNE yanks the headsets.       Closes the PHONE.

       The hub scrambles to answer that...       Landy paces in the
       background. Suspicious of Vosen...

                                                             45

136    INT. NIGHT.    MADRID SAFEHOUSE                             136

       ON A SECURITY MONITOR -- BOURNE sees another figure moving
       up the stairs...Checking his watch, reloading his gun.
       Twisting into the path to shoot as the door opens,
       hesitating because-

       It's NICKY.

       A beat -- long unbroken.

                              BOURNE
                    What are you doing here?

                              NICKY
                    I was posted here after Berlin.

                              BOURNE
                    Where's Daniels?

       The office PHONE goes. Bourne waving her to it.   She picks
       it up. He hits the speaker phone.


127H   INT. HUB                                                127H

                              NICKY (V.O.)
                    Hello.

                              VOSEN
                    Who is this?

                              NICKY (V.O.)
                    This is Nicky Parsons. Who's
                    this?

       Landy reacts to her voice...

       Both Vosen and Landy strongly suspect Bourne is there and
       listening...

       Vosen reads her "Duress Challenge" identity check off the
       screen. It reads:

       Challenge:    "Sparrow"

       Response if Under Duress:       "Ruby"

       Response if Normal:    "Everest"

                                                      46


                     VOSEN
          Nicky, I need to do an ID
          challenge first. Code in:
          "Sparrow."

Vosen looks at the screen to check her response...

                    NICKY
          Response: "Everest".

                    VOSEN
          Nicky, this is Noah Vosen. How
          long have you been on site?

                    NICKY (V.O.)
          I just walked in.

                    VOSEN
          We have two officers on site.
          Are you in contact with them?

                    NICKY (V.O.)
          They're down. Unconscious, but
          alive.

                    VOSEN
          Is there any sign of Daniels?

                    NICKY (V.O.)
          No.

                    LANDY
          Nicky, this is Pam Landy. We
          have reason to believe there is a
          connection between Neal Daniels
          and Jason Bourne.

                    NICKY (V.O.)
          Bourne, are you still looking for
          Bourne? I thought the case was
          closed.

                    LANDY
          No, some people are convinced
          he's still a threat. I disagree
          but to find out I need to talk to
          him.

VOSEN seething because LANDY has interrupted him...

                    VOSEN
          Hold on Nicky.

Vosen hits the mute button.

                    VOSEN
          What are you doing? You know
          Bourne's probably listening.

                                                              47


        Landy doesn't answer.    Vosen to Wills:

                             VOSEN
                   How long till back up arrives.

        Wills holds up three fingers.      Vosen unmutes.

                             VOSEN (CONT'D)
                       (into microphone again)
                   Listen, Nicky. I want you to
                   stay put and secure the premises.
                   It could be an hour until another
                   team arrives.

        LANDY piercing VOSEN with a look...

        BOURNE continues to hold the gun in her face -- NICKY is
        very calm considering the predicament she is in.

                               NICKY
                   Okay.

        DIAL TONE as the line gets closed at the other end.

                             NICKY
                   They know you're here.

                             BOURNE
                   How long do I have?

                             NICKY
                   Three minutes...

                   Daniels is.

        BOURNE lowers his gun, grabs the phone and dials "1-1-2"

                  they're Americans --

       BOURNE pushes the phone off the desk -- fires four shots
       into the ceiling -- calmly moves Nicky towards the back
       door...


127H   INT. HUB                                                   127H

                            VOSEN
                  You "disagree" he's a threat? He
                  just took out two more of my men.
                  Not to mention his ultimatum to
                  Ellatrache?

                            LANDY
                  The only way this has a happy
                  ending, Noah, is if we find a way
                  to bring Bourne in voluntarily.

                            VOSEN
                  He wants revenge, Pam. The only
                  realistic way to deal with this
                  is to eliminate the threat.


139    INT. NIGHT.   BACKSTAIRS                                   139

       BOURNE and NICKY rapidly descend.

                            BOURNE
                  Okay, where is Daniels headed?

                            NICKY
                  8 o'clock this morning, he wired
                  $100,000. to a numbered bank
                  account in Tangier.

                            BOURNE
                  Okay, Tangier is about 300 miles
                  away, we can make the morning
                  ferry.

                            NICKY
                  And then what?

                                                                   49

        Bourne and Nicky exit on to the street.     Suddenly they hear
        tires squealing nearby.

                             NICKY
                   They're coming.

        They continue to walk down the street towards Nicky's car.


127H    INT. HUB                                                    127H

        Vosen and Landy are watching this live.


        As they cross the street two MADRID POLICE CARS come around
        the corner the wrong way and screech to a stop.

        Vosen reacts...


139A    EXT. MADRID -- NIGHT                                        139A

        Four cops jump out and take aim at the AGENTS.

                             SPANISH POLICE
                   Manos Arriba! Manos Arriba!

        More sirens closing in.      A third police car appears.
        Then a fourth...

139A    EXT. MADRID -- NIGHT                                        139A

        The agents drop their guns and surrender.

        BOURNE and NICKY continue around a corner -- they get in
        her VW GOLF and drive away...

        Vosen stares at Landy.    A beat, then she walks out.

                             VOSEN
                   Issue a standing kill order on

139B-C INT. NIGHT -- VOSEN'S OFFICE -- CRI                     139B-C

       VOSEN on the phone.

                           VOSEN
                 We lost Bourne.

                           KRAMER
                 You still think he's after
                 Daniels?

                           VOSEN
                 Yeah. Nicky's just the means.
                 But if we find Daniels, we'll
                 find Bourne.

                           KRAMER
                 Daniels knows way too much.
                 Daniels knows everything. We
                 can't let them meet.

                           VOSEN
                 I'll take care of it.

                            KRAMER
                 Good.
                     (beat)
                 And fill Hirsch in.     Just in
                 case.


R145   INT. NIGHT. TRUCK STOP -- SPAIN                            R145

       BOURNE and NICKY sit over coffee.    A long silence...then:

                           NICKY
                 What are you after, Jason?   Why
                 are you looking for Daniels?

                           BOURNE
                 Do you know who this is?

       Bourne puts the photo of Daniels and Hirsch on the table
       between them.    She looks at the photo, points.

                           NICKY
                 That's Daniels.
                     (points at Hirsch)
                 I don't know who that is.

                           BOURNE
                 I have to get back to the
                 beginning...or I'll never be free
                 of this.

                              NICKY
                 Who is he?

                                                                 51


                              BOURNE
                   I think he started Treadstone.    I
                   remember meeting him.   I
                   remember the first day...
                       (beat)
                   Daniels brought me to him.

       Nicky looks back at him....not sure what to say.

                             NICKY
                   What happened?

                             BOURNE
                   An initiation...I guess...


FB3B   FLASHBACK                                                     FB3B

       QUICK FLASH: Bourne, head in sack, is held underwater,
       struggling desperately for breath--


R145   INT. NIGHT. TRUCK STOP -- SPAIN                               R145

       Bourne comes out of the flashback.      Nicky is looking at
       him....

                             NICKY
                   Jason...that wasn't some one-off
                   initiation. Daniels said they
                   did that to you over and over
                   again.   That's how they...

       She doesn't finish.    And Bourne doesn't ask her to.     Just
       a long pause.

                             BOURNE
                   Why are you helping me?

                             NICKY
                   It was difficult for me...with
                   you.

       BOURNE looks up.    Another long pause...

                             NICKY (CONT'D)
                   You really don't remember
                   anything?

                             BOURNE
                   No.

       NICKY'S face.

       Two SPANISH COPS enter the cafe.

                             BOURNE (CONT'D)
                   We should move.

                                                            52


       They get up and leave...

                    Noah Vosen.

       Then he puts his thumb into a print reader. The safe door
       pops open. He pulls out a file marked "Top Secret."

       CRONIN makes his way down the hallway.

       LANDY works at her desk.       CRONIN enters...

                              CRONIN
                    They tracked Daniels' passport to
                    a hotel in Tangier. They're
                    holding up a bank transfer he
                    made to keep him in place while
                    they move an asset in from
                    Casablanca.

       Off LANDY.    This just keeps getting worse...


145C   INT. VOSEN'S OFFICE                                    145C

       Landy enters without knocking.

                              LANDY
                    Since when do you have
                    authorization for lethal action
                    against Daniels?

                              VOSEN
                    Since he cleaned out a Blackbriar
                    safe and fled to Morocco!

                              LANDY
                    So grab him--

                              VOSEN
                    I don't have the people on the
                    ground to do that and I'm not
                    going to risk that file falling
                    into the wrong hands.

                              LANDY
                    What's going on?    What's Daniels
                    got?

                                                            53


                          VOSEN
                What's he got? He ran all of
                Blackbriar's operations in
                Southern Europe and North Africa.

                          LANDY
                I think the world's well aware we
                have a rendition and lethal
                action capability at this point,
                Noah.

                          VOSEN
                For Christ's sake, Pam, he's got
                our entire playbook. Names,
                dates, ghost sites, how we train
                our assets.....

                          LANDY
                You still don't have the
                authority to kill him.

                          VOSEN
                Oh, yes I do, Pam.

      Vosen holds up the file we saw him pull out of his safe.
      It is labeled "Blackbriar: Lethal Action Protocol."

                           VOSEN
                That's what makes us special. No
                red tape. No more getting
                badguys in our sights and then
                watching them escape while we
                wait for some bureaucrat to issue
                the order.

      Landy opens up the file. Sees the words "instantaneous
      lethal action is authorized when..."

                          LANDY
                You just decide? No oversight.
                No checks and balances.

                           VOSEN
                Come on, Pam, you've seen the raw
                intel. You know how real the
                threat is.    We can't afford to
                have our hands tied like that
                anymore.

Dismantling the phone instinctively - scattering it's        *
components.                                                  *

She starts to make her way out of the square.                *


EXT.   STREETS -- CONTINUOUS                                 *

DESH through the streets-getting closer - heading towards    *
the PETIT SOCCO.                                             *

                                                         63


EXT.   MOPED TRAVELLING                                       *

BOURNE picking up the pace. Three more police cars out of a   *
side road just missing him.                                   *

BOURNE choosing his exit.                                     *

Up ahead- a narrow alleyway - taking it.                      *

The squad cars crunching to a halt, behind him.               *


EXT.   PETIT SOCCO -- CONTINUOUS                              *

DESH crossing the SQUARE weaving through a sea of push        *
bikes.                                                        *

Parking his Vespa at the corner of RUE DES CHRETIENS.         *

Travelling on foot.                                           *


EXT.   RUE DE CHRETIENS -- CONTINUOUS                         *

NICKY - trying to keep calm. Checking each alley. Moving      *
on.                                                           *


EXT.   PETIT SOCCO -- CONTINUOUS                              *

BOURNE arriving - seeing NICKY has left. Seeing DESH'S        *
Vespa parked up.                                              *

More police - on foot now.                                    *

BOURNE parking up. Seeing the crowded streets. Looking up     *
to the rooftops. He needs to get higher.                      *

Starts running up steps.                                      *


INT./EXT.   RIAD/ROOFTOPS -- CONTINUOUS                       *

BOURNE into a riad. Through a courtyard - up more stairs -    *
up a ladder. Out onto the rooftops. Scanning the skyline.     *
A beat. Has he misjudged?                                     *

No, there in the distance at the top of a narrow street-      *
NICKY walking slowly and behind DESH. Moving quickly.         *



BOURNE tailing him - trying to close the gap. Dipping down    *
through another riad - through an alley. Up more stairs.      *
Back up onto another roof. He's gained a few metres on        *
DESH.                                                         *

                                                           64


Desh goes up to the rooftops now. Bourne has him in sight -      *
DESH is prepping his gun with a silencer.                        *

DESH speeding up. BOURNE sees NICKY down below amongst the       *
crowds. In Desh's sights.                                        *

BOURNE knows he has to gain more ground.                         *

CABLE CAM shot - Two trained assassins leaping across the        *
narrow streets - silently effortlessly -- the cops down          *
below searching the alleyways, oblivious to the chase            *
unfolding above them.                                            *

BOURNE nearly on terms with him - then --                        *

DESH dipping down again into the street below.       Avoiding    *
the police -- he melts into the crowds.                          *

STEADYCAM SHOT - following BOURNE as he heads downstairs.        *
More stairs. Through a corridor then a courtyard -               *
bursting out of a door into the street -                         *

A police checkpoint. Right in his path.     Bourne forced to     *
dog leg and take another route.                                  *

BOURNE'S lost him- for the moment.                               *


EXT.   RUE DE CHRETIENS -- CONTINUOUS                            *

NICKY - walking fast up the Rue des Chretiens.       Wondering   *
why there are so many police around.                             *

Suddenly stopping - seeing DESH - knows instantly that he        *
is coming for her.                                               *

Now we see NICKY'S skills.    Has to think on her fee t-         *
TREADSTONE MINDSET --                                            *

Checking the alleyways.     Slipping out of sight.               *

NICKY looking to the rooftops -- taking the advantage.      Up   *
some steps -- into a riad.                                       *

Desh tracking her.                                               *


EXT.   RUE DE CHRETIENS -- CONTINUOUS                            *

BOURNE seeing Desh again - further up the street.      Heading   *
in that direction.                                               *


INT.   RIAD -- CONTINUOUS                                        *

NICKY through one hallway - then another.    Moving up all       *
the time.                                                        *

                                                         65


EXT.   RIAD -- CONTINUOUS                                        *

DESH arriving at the steps. Looks up to where Nicky is           *
going. Takes the entrance to the next building.                  *
Anticipates her next move. Aiming to cut her off.                *


EXT.   RIAD ROOFTOP                                              *

NICKY up steps.    Out onto the rooftops.   Looking for a path   *
across them.                                                     *

Scrabbling across the roof of this crumbling riad.    Knows      *
she can't go back down.                                          *

She makes it across to the next building.                        *

Where Desh is...                                                 *


EXT.   ANOTHER ROOFTOP -- CONTINUOUS                             *

BOURNE up high.    Seeing NICKY on that other roof.              *

He can't get across to her.    Moving fast now.                  *

Down steps.   Into the riad courtyard.                           *


INT. RIAD                                                        *

BOURNE entering the hallway.                                     *

Moving up the stairs.   Towards Nicky.                           *

And towards Desh.                                                *

Meanwhile NICKY moving down. Looking out into the                *
courtyard below. The sound of POLICE getting nearer.             *

BOURNE hearing the POLICE too as he moves up onto a              *
landing.                                                         *

                                                                 *

BOURNE into a main room - something stirring on a couch - a      *
girl and her little sister having a siesta.                      *

In another room two small boys fast asleep.    TV playing.       *
One wakes.                                                       *

A noise on the stairs above. Quickly arranging a mirror -        *
getting line of sight - Bourne dipping into a corner.            *

It's NICKY.                                                      *

She gives him a look -- DESH is in here somewhere.               *

                                                         66


The door goes below them.   The noise of Police entering the   *
Riad.                                                          *

NICKY signalling to BOURNE - this way.                         *

They climb narrow stairs to the next floor.                    *

Down below Police begin searching rooms. Waking the            *
sleeping family. Shouting, crying. Commotion.                  *


INT./EXT. -- NARROW STAIRWELL                                  *

BOURNE and NICKY creeping up the steps.                        *

Then - suddenly NICKY spinning round as two silenced           *
bullets speed past her - And DESH bursting out of a landing    *
toilet.                                                        *

On to Bourne.                                                  *

Full on Treadstone fighting in the narrow stairwell.           *

Crashing into a tiny disused lift cage- silent constrained-    *
vicious.                                                       *

Downstairs a young POLICEMAN hears the noise- heading for      *
the lift.                                                      *

NICKY seeing the handle turn. Thinking quickly.   She sends    *
the lift up to the next floor.                                 *

The POLICEMAN stepping back from the door -- directing the     *
other cops out to the courtyard.                               *

People are spilling out into the atrium.   It's pandemonium.   *


EXT.   ROOFTOP -- CONTINUOUS                                   *

Bourne and Desh spill out of the elevator and onto the         *
roof.                                                          *

BOURNE kicking the gun - spinning across the floor - he and    *
DESH facing each other.                                        *

DESH with BOURNE - straight over the edge.                     *

DESH still on top - just.                                      *

A brutal exchange. Matching each other's moves like            *
shadows.                                                       *

Relentless. Rolling - falling onto another roof level.         *

And another.                                                   *

                                                                 67


       The two men tiring now. DESH grabbing for the bag.     The            *
       pills. BOURNE kicking them away.                                      *

       BOURNE has the upper hand now.      DESH'S reaction's slowing.        *
       No longer the match he was.                                           *

       BOURNE drags him to the ground.     He's finished.   Bourne's         *
       won.                                                                  *

       DESH- shivering -- convulsing.                                        *

       In the struggle, BOURNE strangles Desh.

194    BOURNE and NICKY hide DESH's body.                              194

                             BOURNE
                   Alright, we need to be dead.    You
                   need to code that in.

       NICKY CODES into DESH'S PDA -- BOTH OBJECTIVES
       ACHIEVED...In the CRI HUB the message comes up...VOSEN and
       LANDY believe NICKY and BOURNE are both DEAD...


196A   INT. DAY. HUB -- CRI -- NEW YORK                             196A

       The code from DESH remains on screen -- BOTH OBJECTIVES
       ACHIEVED -- like an EPITAPH for BOURNE and NICKY...VOSEN
       packs his briefcase. Turns to WILLS.

                             VOSEN
                   I want to be sure. Have the
                   station chief in Rabat confirm
                   the deaths and do a sub-rosa
                   check...And keep and eye on
                   Landy.

       Off WILLS...


197A   INT. DAY.   LANDY'S OFFICE -- DAY                            197A

       Cronin enters.

                             CRONIN
                   The hub just got word Bourne and
                   Nicky are dead.

       Landy looks at him.

                                LANDY
                   Confirmed?

                                CRONIN
                   Not yet.

       Landy looks away...thinking.      Wheels turning.

                                                                  68


                             LANDY
                   Get me a copy of Bourne's
                   personnel file.


195A    EXT. DUSK. PENSIONE                                        195A

198A    INT. DUSK PENSIONE -- WASHROOM -- TANGIER                  198A

        BOURNE scrubs the blood from his hands.    REVEAL Nicky
        watching him from the bedroom.


197     INT. DUSK. LANDY'S OFFICE (LONELY LANDY)                       197

        Landy sits at her desk reviewing files on Treadstone. Open
        on her desk we see the file she will be looking at in the
        Supremacy phone call.

        The way she examines the papers we get the sense she thinks
        something is missing, some piece, some file.


198A    INT. DUSK. PENSIONE -- WASHROOM                            198A

        Bourne scrubbing the blood from his hands. Nicky comes in,
        touches his shoulder. There's a tenderness to it, a re-
        assurance. For a moment it looks like Bourne might
        react...but the moment passes....


197     INT. DUSK. LANDY'S OFFICE (LONELY LANDY)                       197

        Landy opens a new file.   Bourne's operations.


198A    INT. DUSK. PENSIONE -- WASHROOM                            198A

        Bourne is toweling off.

                             BOURNE
                   I can see all their faces. But I
                   can't remember any names....


197     INT. DUSK. LANDY'S OFFICE (LONELY LANDY)                       197

        Landy looks at Bourne's kills. The faces Bourne remembers.
        But there names are here, and who they were, why they were
        killed.


198AC   INT.   NIGHT.   PENSIONE -- BEDROOM/SITTING ROOM          198AC

        Bourne and Nicky sitting together.

                                                                  69


                            BOURNE
                  I was starting to remember who
                  they were...in India...with
                  Marie.

       A beat.

                             NICKY
                  It's just going to lead to more
                  killing, Jason. Are you sure you
                  want that?

       Bourne takes her words in.    But who he is is eating him
       alive from the inside...

                            BOURNE
                  I've killed people and I've tried
                  to apologize for what I've done,
                  for what I am. None of it makes
                  it better...

       Another moment passes between them...then:

                            BOURNE
                  They're going to come for you
                  again. You are going to have to
                  run now.

       She gets up.

       Nicky dies her hair BLACK.    Starts cutting it shorter.


199    EXT.   NIGHT.   TANGIER BUS STATION                             199

       Bourne walks with a now dark-haired Nicky. They exchange
       looks for a long beat. She turns towards the bus.

                            BOURNE
                  It gets easier.


197    INT. LANDY'S OFFICE. NIGHT                                      197

       Landy finds a denotation in Bourne's file that he was
       "recruited to Treadstone by Neal Daniels."   Further down
       the   page it says "Bourne was inducted into Treadstone at
       the Special Research Department facility at 415 E 71st,
       New York, NY."    Then "Facility closed by order of
       Director, June 2002."

198C   INT. TANGIER MORGUE                                         198C

       Bourne looks at the tattered remains of Daniels' body and
       belongings.

                                                              70


        He goes through his briefcase and finds a nearly destroyed
        piece of paper with "Noah Vosen - Director of Operations -
        CRI" written on it. Bourne slips the morgue attendant a
        bribe.


198DA   INT. VOSEN'S OFFICE -- DAY                                198DA

        Vosen is shaving.

                            WILLS
                  Station chief in Rabat just
                  called, they found a body.
                  Bourne?

                               VOSEN

198DB   INT. AIRPLANE -- DAY                                      198DB

        On final approach to JFK. Bourne looks out the window to
        see the Verizano Narrows bridge.   And beyond it,
        Manhattan.   Bourne is coming home.


A202    EXT. NEW YORK                                             A202

                            CRONIN
                  Pam, You need to see this.

        Landy follows CRONIN into--


201     INT. CRONIN'S OFFICE -- DAY                                201

        BOURNE'S PASSPORT is displayed on the computer monitor.

                            CRONIN (CONT'D)
                  This passport just cleared
                  Immigration at JFK ten minutes
                  ago. It's an early Treadstone
                  identity registered to Jason
                  Bourne but he never used it and
                  it never went to the grid.
                  Bourne's alive.

                            LANDY
                  They don't know.

                            CRONIN
                  No, if they knew Vosen wouldn't
                  be in his office right now.

                                                             71


202    INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL                                      202

       Bourne moves through the airport.

                           LANDY (O.S.)
                 It's a hell of a risk.

                           CRONIN (O.S.)
                 Yeah. Maybe Bourne wants us to
                 know, just like Naples, maybe
                 he's communicating.


201    INT. CRONIN'S OFFICE                                       201

                           CRONIN
                 Maybe he's trying to communicate
                 with you.

                           LANDY
                 Maybe we should communicate back.
                 Because I think I know what
                 Bourne's looking for.


202    SERIES OF SHOTS                                            202

       Bourne over the 59th Street Bridge -- arrives at CRI --
       goes into the adjacent building --


202A   INT. OFFICE BUILDING ACROSS FROM CRI -- DAY               202A

       Bourne uses his monocular to zoom in on a file Vosen is
       looking at -- he sees the word "Blackbriar." Vosen puts
       the file back in the safe.


203    INT. DAY. LANDY'S OFFICE -- CRI -- NEW YORK                203

       LANDY'S cell phone rings.   She answers it.

                 me.

       LANDY puts down her pencil.   CRONIN watches.

                                                            72

      His phone rings.    He picks it up.

                          WILLS (TEL. V.O.)
                Get in here! Bourne called
                Landy!

      Vosen jumps up, sprints toward the hub--


203   INT. LANDY'S OFFICE -- DAY                                 203

                          LANDY
                I guess I owe you an apology.


207   INT. HUB -- BACK ROOM                                      207

      Vosen rushes in--

                          BOURNE (V.O.)
                Is that official?

                          VOSEN (OVERLAPPING)
                Are we triangulating?!

                           LANDY (V.O.)
                No. Off the record. You know
                how it is.

                             BACK ROOM TECH (OVERLAPPING)
                Trying--

      She opens a file on her desk.

                name.

                 Why the hell did she give him
                 that?

                           LANDY (V.O.)
                 You were born 4/15/71 in Nixa,

       Wills walks over to Vosen. The look in his eye indicates
       that he thinks there's something odd about this:

                            WILLS
                  Landy just left the building.

       Vosen looks at Wills.... A beat, Vosen's suspicion
       building, though he can't quite put his finger on what he
       suspects...

                            VOSEN

                  Nothing?   No calls since Bourne--

                  Wait a minute. Wait. She just
                  got a text.

       LANDY walks east toward Tudor City.   She looks around her
       for any signs of surveillance but finds nothing out of the
       ordinary.

       LANDY is on the east side now, walking toward Tudor City.
       An agents trails her on foot.   Another parallels her from
       across the street.


227    EXT. TUTOR CITY OUTSKIRTS                                   227

       SERIES OF SHOTS: CRI cars arrive, careful to stay several
       blocks from the meet site. They jump out and try to set up
       surreptitious surveillance posts.

                           AGENT 3 (V.O.)
                 Okay folks here we go, box at two
                 hundred meters. Let's lock it
                 down.

                 As soon as you have eyes on
                 Landy, I want to know.


226    EXT. TUTOR CITY                                             226

       She becomes clear to AGENT 3.

                           AGENT 3
                 Okay, here we go.


226A   INT. STAIRWAY                                            226A

                 Copy that, I see her.

       Landy stands on a corner waiting for Bourne.

                                                             78

       TIGHT SHOT on Bourne's face. FAST TILT to TIGHT ON his
       hands, pulling up what seems like a piece of clear tape.
       We can't tell where we are or what he's doing.


230    EXT. TUDOR CITY                                             230

       TIGHT ON Bourne's hands placing the clear tape on a piece
       of clear plastic. Again we can't tell what's going on.

                           VOSEN
                 Noah Vosen.

                           BOURNE (V.O.)
                 This is Jason Bourne.

       VOSEN reels for a beat. Then quickly scans the streets,
       trying to see if he can spot BOURNE.

                           VOSEN
                 How did you get this number?

                           BOURNE (V.O.)
                 You didn't actually think I was
                 coming to Tudor City, did you?

                           VOSEN
                 No, I guess not. But if it's me
                 you want to talk to maybe we can
                 arrange a meet.

                           BOURNE (V.O.)
                 Where are you right now?

                           VOSEN
                 In my office.

                                                                   79


                               BOURNE (V.O.)
                     I doubt that. If you were in
                     your office--


233    INT. VOSEN'S OFFICE -- DAY                                       233

       REVEAL that BOURNE is inside VOSEN'S office.

                               BOURNE
                     We'd be having this conversation
                     face-to-face.

       BOURNE hangs up. Puts a portable dictaphone up to VOSEN'S
       SAFE and his play:

                               VOSEN (TAPE V.O.)
                     Noah Vosen.

       As he places the plastic slide we saw in the ECUs into the
       fingerprint reader. The safe pops open--


234    INT.   DAY.    VOSEN SUV                                         234

       VOSEN stunned....     Is it possible?   Is it a trick?


233    INT. DAY.     VOSEN'S OFFICE                                     233

       From the safe, BOURNE scoops out the "TREADSTONE:
       Blackbriar" folder Bourne saw Vosen putting into his safe."

       He flips it open. He scans down the page.         His eye
       stopping at the words "US Citizen."

       He flips to another page -- another photo, and again "US
       Citizen."

       BOURNE shoves the folders in his backpack and leaves.

       CAMERA BEGINS TO CRANE UP...

       BOURNE walks around a corner near CRI. He hears a siren
       turn on a few blocks away. Then another.   He starts to
       run.


240    INT. CRONIN'S CAR -- DAY                                   240

       A SEDAN pulls to a stop as a door comes open. CRONIN'S
       inside.   REVEAL Landy on the sidewalk. She jumps in.

                           LANDY
                 What just happened?

                           CRONIN

240B    INT. CRI CAR -- DAY                                          240B

        The passenger side agent sees BOURNE, points--

        BOURNE cuts to the south side of the road so the passenger-
        side agent doesn't have a shot, while controlling the car
        makes it almost impossible for the driver to fire
        accurately.


240C    EXT. 41 STREET -- DAY                                        240C

        The westbound car cuts sharply and drives up on the
        sidewalk. But Bourne is too fast. He's already past them.
        The passenger side agent jumps out. But he's still got to
        get around the door and then move a few steps to get a bead
        over the hood of his car on Bourne.

        The other CRI car races the wrong way on the street but
        gets immobilized and trapped by the onrushing tunnel
        traffic.

242C    EXT. MIDTOWN WEST -- DAY                                     242C

        Bourne races through the tunnel traffic and onto 40th
        street.   He rushes east toward the spaghetti of concrete
        ramps leading into and out of Port Authority.

                                                             82


       He runs across 10th Avenue as a third CRI car screams up
       the street at him.


243    INT. VOSEN'S SUV -- DAY                                     243

                 He's heading for Port Authority!
                 Subject up the ramp, eastbound
                 into Port Authority.

       The driver pilots his car up the ramp behind Bourne. He
       jams the accelerator down.   He'll be on top of Bourne --
       running him over -- in seconds--


260    EXT. PORT AUTHORITY -- DAY                                  260

       A New Jersey-bound bus exits the complex and heads around
       the corner of the ramp -- it skids to a stop when it sees
       Bourne and the CRI car giving chase heading right at the
       bus.


260A   INT. CRI CAR -- DAY                                        260A

       Bourne slides between the side of the bus and concrete
       guard rail.   The driver calls it in--


261    SERIES OF SHOTS                                             261

       Cops and CRI cars close in on Port Authority.   One agent
       jumps out of his car on 8th Avenue and rushes for the
       stairs.

                                                               83

262   EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY                    262

      Bourne races up a set of stairs the rooftop parking lot.
      He surveys every aspect of his environment on the fly
      (which includes his taking a quick peak over the concrete
      railing at the east end of the roof.

      Next Bourne rushes toward the parked cars. Smashes the
      window of one to set off its alarm.   Then a second and a
      third, setting off their alarms.

      The fourth window Bourne smashes in doesn't set off an
      alarm. Bourne pulls the door open and climbs in.

      Inside the car Bourne reaches under the dash and yanks
      handful of wires off the steering column and starts to
      expertly hotwire the car.

264   SERIES OF SHOTS                                               264

      Agents race up stairwells.   Two CRI cars careen up the
      ramp to the passenger parking (a separate ramp to the bus
      ramp we saw Bourne on earlier.) A third CRI car races
      through the parking level just below the roof and up the
      circular ramp to the roof.

                He's on the roof.   He's trapped.


      EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY

      Bourne works to hotwire the car.

      A CRI car gets to the roof.   Two agents come from the
      elevator lobby.   The three car alarms distract them. They
      search for Bourne, but can't find him at first...

      Bourne gets the car engine on - but, given the wonders of
      modern anti-theft technology his steering wheel is still
      locked.

                                                                84


      A second CRI car arrives.

      Bourne slams the car into low gear and backs up at high
      speed.

      He smashes into the car across the aisle from him. With a
      sharp metallic snap the wheel in Bourne's car is suddenly
      free, he jams the car into drive pulls out into lane and
      stops.

      Three CRI cars here now. Two head straight for him.   A
      third blocks the exit ramp.

      Bourne checks the rearview and sees two more agents pour
      from the elevator lobby, one carrying the serious firepower
      of an M-4 (an M-16 variant whose bullets can penetrate
      metal and concrete). They move into position to get a bead
      on him.

      Bourne assesses. But he doesn't move. The agents swarm
      toward him. What the hell is he doing? Why is he waiting?

268   EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY                     268

      The agents clear their obstructions and drop their barrels
      toward Bourne--

      But before they can get a bead--

      Bourne slams the car into reverse again.   Petal to the
      metal in reverse--

      The agents open fire.

      Bourne ducks the lead slugs ripping through the windshield.
      But there's no dodging the shower of broken glass.

      As Bourne disappears below the dashboard, the CRI agent
      adjusts his fire into the car's grill.

      Virtually blind, Bourne races the hard-pressed vehicle
      backwards as the agent's fire decimates the car's
      driveline.

      Bourne slips the car into neutral and takes a quick peek
      behind him.

                                                            85


      Steers still speeding but quickly dying car towards a small
      gap between two parked cars at the edge of the parking
      structure.

      Bourne's car splits the gap between the parked cars, hits
      the base of a low angled wall that slams the back of his
      car up and over the wall.

      Bourne is pounded as his car jounces onto the wall, a
      second later the front end seesaws over the top, the sudden
      angle change exposes for an instant the bottom of Bourne's
      car, to the shooters.

      Several rounds rip through the floorboard and tear past
      Bourne's head just before his car drops upside down for 25
      feet and slams onto a row of parked cars.

      The impact rips Bourne from the seat and slams him hard
      against the roof.

      Bourne struggles out of the car, knowing he has only a
      moment before the armed agents will fire down into his over-
      turned car.

                           CRI AGENT
                 Ho-ly shit!

270   EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY                  270

      The CRI agents race to the spot where Bourne's car
      disappeared over the railing and reflexively fire into
      Bourne's car but they're too late! Bourne's already out.
      He disappears from sight under the covered parking
      structure.

        Clearly there is no one down there. Bourne's car jump from
        the roof has completely flat-footed them.

274A    INT/EXT. CIRCULAR RAMP                                    274A

        Two CRI cars race down from the roof to try to get to the
        level Bourne's on.


275     INT./EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- TWO LEVELS BELOW ROOFTOP        275

        Bourne cuts off a guy cruising for a parking space and
        pulls him from his car and races away as the agent from the
        roof lands hard behind him.

        Bourne's race to the exit is cut off as a 3rd CRI sedan
        slides into view and it's occupants open fire on Bourne in
        a head on charge.

        The just stolen vehicle takes heavy fire as Bourne reacts
        instantaneously; thumbing on the cruise control,
        shouldering his door open, and slamming the gas pedal to
        the floor as he dives out of the car.

        The agents react as Bourne's sedan torpedoes them head on.
        Hit hard they're taken out of the fight as metal collapses,
        glass shatters, and airbags explode.

        Bourne tumbles to a stop at the rear of a parked car as his
        car implodes against the oncoming agents.

                                                       87


Instantly Bourne is on his feet, moving between the parked
cars to engage another CRI sedan traveling parallel to the
course of the wrecked one.

The agents in this sedan are distracted by the still
echoing crash and are caught off-guard as Bourne steps out
and points his gun at the driver.

The driver ducks and floors his gas pedal in a desperate
effort to save his own life. As the sedan suddenly
accelerates, Bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the
sedan's front tire and fires.

The tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and slams
into a parked car, pitching the driver violently against
the unyielding interior of the sedan.

An instant later Bourne rips the radio off the dazed
drivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it.

With the wreck still echoing through the garage Bourne has
to deal with the arrival of the first NYPD sedan.

Bourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the on
edge cop climbs out of his car but Bourne's performance is
cut short as the agent running from his drop from the roof,
arrives and opens fire.

The police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as
Bourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single
shot.

The increasing volume of squealing tires alerts Bourne to a
new threat, he pulls the officer into some cover and grabs
the officer's radio.

                   BOURNE
          10-13. Shots fired. Officer
          down. Port Authority parking
          lot. Level four.

Bourne rips a piece of his sweater off and ties a makeshift
tourniquet for the officer.   Then he hands the cop his
radio back.

                    BOURNE (CONT'D)
          Stay out of sight until one of
          your own arrive.

Bourne disappears.

We pick him up as he jumps into the cops car and guns the
engine and heads for the exits.

CRI agents are confused for a second -- until they pick up
the NYPD car exiting Port Authority on one of the ramps.
But that's all the time Bourne needs--

                                                               88

277    EXT. CROSSTOWN STREET -- DAY                                 277

       Bourne turns on his lights and siren and speeds east,
       followed closely by a CRI sedan.

       As cars yield to Bourne's siren a taxi tries to jump into
       Bourne's wake but a CRI sedan punches the taxi back to the
       right. It ricochets off several parked cars before
       regaining control.

       Bourne struggles to keep his over-matched vehicle ahead of
       the more powerful CRI Sedan which tries to spin Bourne out
       by hitting his bumper.

       Bourne tacks right quickly and barely avoids a stopped car.
       The CRI sedan flanking Bourne's slams into the rear of that
       car, spinning it 180 degrees into the path of the trailing
       CRI sedan which destroys itself in the resulting collision
       and blocks the path of the other CRI sedan.


282    INT. BOURNE'S CAR -- DAY                                     282

       Bourne is home free. He looks around and spots a sign that
       indicates a right turn and says "To Holland Tunnel / US
       95." Bourne turns right--

       Suddenly the window next to his head explodes as two more
       shots rip through his door to tear a jagged wound into the
       top of Bourne's leg.

       REVEAL Paz, his SUV racing along the curb lane. As
       Bourne's car crosses in front of a small car stopped at the
       intersection Paz swerves his car into that car and punches
       it into the side of Bourne's car.

       Bourne's car is knocked spinning, Paz keeps charging
       forward and slams into the back of Bourne's car. With his
       front tires spinning wildly Bourne fights to straighten his
       car as another CRI sedan appears and tries to box Bourne's
       car by sliding into his path.

284    EXT. MANHATTAN STREET -- DAY                                  284

       Bourne just manages to punch his car into the right rear of
       the CRI Sedan and race down the Avenue with Paz and the
       slightly damaged sedan in pursuit.

       Paz gains on him and Bourne is forced to swerve violently
       to deny Paz the kill shot he is all too capable of.

       Just ahead of Bourne, two government SUVs slide into the
       intersection completely blocking his path.

       Bourne instantly spins his car 180 degrees and continues
       on, barreling into the roadblock backwards.

       As Bourne's car plows through the SUV's he whips the wheel
       and his car spins through a reverse 180 as Paz and the
       other sedan race through the wreckage in Bourne's wake.

       Paz and the CRI sedan are all over Bourne as he slides a
       right hand turn onto South St. as Paz and the CRI sedan
       overwhelm Bourne's battered vehicle.


284A   OMITTED                                                    284A


287    INT. BOURNE'S CAR -- DAY                                      287

       On his police radio, Bourne singles out an NYPD officer
       (call sign Alpha-2503) racing toward the intersection just
       ahead.

       Bourne slows, then speeds up quickly to time it right:

       The CRI car almost hits his bumper, then has to accelerate
       through the upcoming intersection. As he does, the cop car
       Bourne was listening to on the radio slams broadside into
       the CRI sedan drafting the bumper of the mangled cop car.

       Swerving wildly Paz avoids the pileup and slams his heavy
       SUV into the back of Bourne's car, pushing him into the
       oncoming traffic.

       Several cars swerve left and right as Paz pushes Bourne
       sideways onto the ramped end of a K-Rail dividing the
       street ahead.

       The nearly upended car grinds down the K-Rail until the
       rear of Bourne's car strikes an obstruction which punches
       it back into the lane as it slams against the front of
       Paz's SUV, knocking the SUV sideways, into a row of parked
       cars.

       Bourne's car hits parked cars on the other side of the
       road.

       with. He's a 45 year CIA veteran. One of the great brains
       in the Agency's history, but also a man who knows how to
       wield power silently, invisibly, and to tremendous effect.
       His phone buzzes.

                                                               93


                               DR. HIRSCH (INTO PHONE)
                   Hello.


306A   INT.   VOSEN'S SUV -- LATE AFTERNOON                     306A

       VOSEN at the other end of the line --

                             VOSEN (INTO PHONE)
                   Bourne knows everything. I think
                   he's heading for you right now.

       Dead pause.


306    INT. HIRSCH'S OFFICE (NEW BUILDING OF HOSPITAL)-- DAY        306

                             HIRSCH (INTO PHONE)
                   He's coming home, Noah.

       There's a wistfulness in the way he says it. But also the
       sense that this was absolutely inevitable. And he's calm
       about it, doesn't show any fear, doesn't reach for a gun.

                             HIRSCH (INTO PHONE)
                   How long do I have?

                               VOSEN
                   Not long.    Get out of there.

                              HIRSCH
                   No.   I'm going to stay.

                             VOSEN
                   Are you crazy, he'll--

                             HIRSCH
                   He'll come to the training wing.
                   That's what he knows. I'll keep
                   him in play until you arrive.


309R   EXT.   NEW YORK -- HOSPITAL -- LATE AFTERNOON            309R

       Bourne arrives at the "Johnston Medical Center."   He looks
       up to see "415".

FB5    FLASHBACK                                                    FB5

       The image of "415" that has been haunting his dreams.


309    EXT.   NEW YORK -- HOSPITAL -- LATE AFTERNOON                309

       This is the place... When he looks down Landy steps out of
       the lobby to meet him on the sidewalk.

                                                                94


                             BOURNE
                   They'll kill you for giving me
                   this place.

                             LANDY
                   4/15/71 isn't much of a code. My
                   guess is Vosen's already on his
                   way.

                             BOURNE
                   Why'd you do it?

                             LANDY
                   This isn't us, David. What they
                   turned you into, what they're
                   doing with Blackbriar... This
                   has to stop.

                             BOURNE
                   Then stop it. Everything you
                   need is in there.

       Bourne hands her the black bag and enters the hospital.

                             LANDY
                   David... Come in with me. It's
                   better if we do this together.

                             BOURNE
                       (shakes head)
                   This is where it started for me,
                   this is where it ends.

       She watches the doors close behind him....     Landy lets him
       go.


323    EXT. NYC STREETS -- LATE AFTERNOON                            323

       QUICK SHOTS of six different CRI sedans and SUVs rushing
       toward the hospital.


309R   EXT. HOSPITAL -- LATE AFTERNOON                            309R

       Landy looks in the backpack.

       JUMPCUTS:

       --She unzips the backpack and looks in at the the
       Blackbriar Operations File.

       --A cover page inside: "utmost secrecy"... "potentially
       explosive public reaction would jeopardize the program"...

       --Another page: "Terminated" stamped across the photos of
       victims. Next to the victim from the inciting incident,
       the words: "US citizen"...

                                                                95


                           LANDY
                 Oh, my God...

       --A third page, more photos, no "terminated" on these.
       Future victims. "US citizen" stamped next to each one...


310    INT. HOSPITAL -- LATE AFERNOON                                310

       Bourne uses the card reader he took from Vosen's safe to
       enter a "restricted access elevator."   A guard comes.
       Bourne aims his pistol at him as the elevator door closes.


309R   EXT. FIRST AVENUE -- OUTSIDE HOSPITAL --    LATE AFTERNOON 309R

       Landy walks down the street. She looks up to spot two
       black sedans speeding east on 71st, turns south -- two SUVs
       coming up York.   Shit--


323    INT. VOSEN'S SUV -- LATE AFTERNOON                            323

       A block south of the hospital, stuck in traffic, Vosen
       points.

                           VOSEN
                 Landy! Right there!    She's got
                 Bourne's backpack!


310R   INT. 8TH FLOOR ELEVATOR LOBBY -- LATE AFTERNOON            310R

       Bourne flips up the elevator stop button and uses the
       access card to enter a secure corridor--


323    INT. LOBBY -- LATE AFTERNOON                                  323

       Landy runs across the lobby.


323    EXT. FIRST AVENUE -- LATE AFTERNOON                           323

       Vosen's SUV careens to a stop behind a bunch of traffic.
       Still a half block from the entry door but it's close
       enough--


322    INT. CORRRIDOR                                                322

       Bourne rushes down a nondescript corridor--


325    INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY -- LATE AFTERNOON                         325

       Vosen and CRI agents rush into the lobby.

                                                                   96


                             VOSEN
                       (to a group of six
                        agents)
                   I'll find Landy. You get to the
                   training wing and get Bourne!

       A security guard comes over.

                             VOSEN
                   Do you know who I am?
                       (the guard nods)
                   Where's your security room?


324    INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR                                           324

       Landy looks around. Finds an open office. She pushes open
       the door and runs to the fax machine. She starts faxing
       the Blackbriar documents Bourne took from Vosen's safe.


324A   INT. SECURITY ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON                         324A

       Vosen enters.

                             VOSEN
                   I want to see all your footage
                   for the last three minutes.


322    INT. SRD TRAINING WING (OLD BUILDING OF HOSPITAL) -- LATE 322
       AFTERNOON

       Bourne stares down the corridor from his dreams, the
       corridor Daniels lead him down in his flashback.

       We see Bourne go into--


FBA3   FLASHBACK                                                    FBA3

       That first day, Bourne's POV being led down this corridor
       by Daniels.


322    BACK TO SCENE                                                    322

       Bourne moves down the corridor.


322    INT. SRD TRAINING WING (OLD BUILDING OF HOSPITAL) -- LATE 322
       AFTERNOON

       Bourne reaches the end of the hall.       He looks around
       "flashback style" --

                                                                97


FBB3   FLASHBACK                                                 FBB3

       Bourne was standing at this door....


331    INT. OFFICE -- LATE AFTERNOON                                 331

       Vosen enters the room.    The last pages have been faxed...

                             LANDY
                   You better get a good lawyer.

       She exits...


322    BACK TO SCENE                                                 322

       Then spins, gun up--

       Hirsch is there, halfway down the corridor behind him.

                             HIRSCH
                   Put the gun down. I wouldn't be
                   here if I didn't want to talk.

                              BOURNE
                   I've spent three years running.
                   Three years trying to find out
                   who I was.

       Hirsch moves toward Bourne, completely unfazed by the gun.

                             HIRSCH
                   You still don't have it all back,
                   do you? You haven't filled in
                   all the pieces?

                             BOURNE
                   Let's start with the moment you
                   found out I wouldn't execute
                   Wombosi. The amnesia wasn't the
                   issue, it was the fact that I
                   didn't pull the trigger....

                             HIRSCH
                   One lapse meant your conditioning
                   had failed.

       Bourne grabs Hirsch and slams him against the wall

                             BOURNE
                   It was always you, behind
                   Conklin, behind Abbott.... They
                   were just following orders.

       Bourne grabs Hirsch and pushes him to the wall.   Searches
       him for weapons.

                                                             98


                             HIRSCH
                       (completely calm)
                   I'm unarmed, Jason.

                             BOURNE
                       (shoving Hirsch hard
                        against the wall)
                   "David." I'm David Webb.

       CLOSE ON Bourne's face--

                             HIRSCH
                   You were David Webb, but not
                   anymore.


322    INT. SRD TRAINING WING CORRIDOR -- LATE AFERNOON           322

       Bourne stands with Hirsch.

                              BOURNE
                   Why me?   Why did you pick me?

       A beat...

                               HIRSCH
                   You really don't remember, do
                   you?
                        (beat)
                   You picked us, Jason.

                             BOURNE
                   What does that mean?

                             HIRSCH
                   You volunteered.

       Hirsch uses his free hand to hit the keypad on the wall.
       The "room in use" sign lights up.

       Bourne looks up "flashback style"--


FBA1   FLASHBACK                                                  FBA1

       Bourne remembers that keypad, that "room in use" sign from
       the first day...


322    INT. ROOM WHERE BOURNE FIRST MET HIRSCH                    322

       Bourne and Hirsch enter...

                             HIRSCH
                   You volunteered right here....
                   You didn't even blink, Jason.
                   You just handed me these...

                                                             99


       Hirsch removes a pair of dog tags from his jacket pocket.
       Holds them out to Bourne.

       Bourne takes the dog tags.        Stares at them.

       INSERT of the dog tags:

       Webb, David

       Bourne hands over his dog tags....


                              HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                    Has everything been explained to
                    you.

                                BOURNE
                    Yes, sir.

322    PRESENT DAY                                                 322

                              HIRSCH
                    You were a soldier ready to serve
                    his country. Just like thousands
                    of others, except you were a
                    prodigy with languages...and a
                    perfect shot.

                    Your missions will save American

322    PRESENT DAY                                                 322

                              BOURNE
                    You said I'd be saving American
                    lives. Instead you just turned me
                    into a killer.

       Bourne raises the gun to Hirsch.

                              HIRSCH
                    You could have left at any time.
                    And you knew exactly what it
                    meant for you if you chose to
                    stay.

                                                               100

                    When we're finished with you,
                    you'll no longer be David Webb.

                              BOURNE
                    I'll be whoever you need me to
                    be, sir.


322    PRESENT DAY                                                   322

                              HIRSCH
                    Stop running from the truth,
                    Jason. You chose to come here!
                    You chose to stay! And no matter
                    how much you want to forget
                    it...eventually you're going to
                    have to face how you chose, right
                    there, to become Jason Bourne!

       Bourne sitting in a chair, looking terrible.     Hirsch looks
       at him from behind the desk...

                              HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                    You haven't slept for a long time
                    have you David? Have you made a
                    decision? This can't go on, you
                    know. You have to decide.

                                 BOURNE
                    Who is he?

                              HIRSCH
                    We've been through that.

                              BOURNE
                    What did he do?

                               HIRSCH
                    It doesn't matter.
                        (beat)
                    You came to us. You volunteered.
                    You said you'd do anything it
                    takes to save American lives.
                    You're not a liar are you? Or too
                    weak to see this through? This is
                    it. Let go of David Webb. Will
                    you give yourself to this
                    program?

                                                             101


      Bourne looks down, a gun in his hand. He gets to his feet
      swiftly and fires the pistol several times into a hooded
      figure. The man slumps over.

      Bourne stares at what he's done.

                          HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                You're no longer David Webb.
                From now on you'll be known as
                Jason Bourne. Welcome to the
                program.

      Daniels pulls the hood off the figure to show that he is
      dead.

      Just then Kramer walks through the door.

                          KRAMER
                He's ready. Send him to
                Operations.


322   PRESENT                                                      322

      And now, in real time, Bourne comes out of the flashback.
      He stares back at Hirsch....

                          HIRSCH
                Do you remember now?

      Bourne lowers the gun.

                          BOURNE
                I remember. I remember
                everything.

                          HIRSCH
                You can't outrun what you did,
                Jason. You made yourself into
                who you are.

                          BOURNE
                I'm done running.  That's why
                I'm here. To end you, to shut
                this down. I'm no longer Jason
                Bourne.

                          HIRSCH
                So now you're going to kill me?

                          BOURNE
                No. You don't deserve the star
                they give you on the wall at
                Langley.

      Just then Bourne spins -- agents arrive at the door.    It's
      locked.

                                                            102


322   INT. HALLWAY                                                322

      The agents fire at the door handle to get it open.


322   INT. ROOM WHERE BOURNE FIRST MET HIRSCH                     322

      Bourne looks out a window.   Sees the layout of a roof
      several stories below. Then he turns and shoots out the
      room's mirrored observation window. Bourne dives through
      it just as agents rush in and open fire at him.


      SERIES OF SHOTS

      Bourne races through corridors, loosing the CRI agents.


352   EXT. ROOF -- NIGHT                                          352

      Bourne runs out onto the roof. Rushes across it to look
      over the edge.   It's a straight drop to the FDR -- 12
      stories down.

      He races to another ledge -- the East River below him. But
      he has to clear a 10 foot supporting wall at the base of
      the building to hit the water.   He backs up to get a
      running leap.

      As he does, he turns and sees Paz, who is holding a gun on
      him.

                             PAZ
                   Why didn't you take the shot?

      Bourne looks at him.

                             BOURNE
                   Do you even know why you're
                   trying to kill me? Look at what
                   they make you give.

      Bourne turns and runs off the roof.

      Paz fires into the air...

      FOLLOW Bourne as he drops fourteen stories into the
      freezing river--

      MULTIPLE ANGLES -- Bourne goes into the river...

356   INT. BAR -- URUGUAY -- SUNSET                               356

      Nicky goes to the bar of at a low end tourist bar with
      several other customers.   She stands there, eyes fixed on
      a TV behind the bar:

                             ANCHOR 5 (V.O., CONT'D)
                   Webb, who was known inside the
                   intelligence community, as "Jason
                   Bourne" jumped from the
                   fourteenth floor of the CIA
                   facility where he was trained in
                   New York into the East River
                   below.   While experts say it
                   would be nearly impossible to
                   survive the fall, despite two
                   weeks of efforts, his body has
                   still not been recovered.

               FADE IN:

               EXT. THE SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               Epic beauty: cobalt mountains beneath a glowering purple sky 
               fringed with pink, as if the clouds were a lid too small for 
               the earth; a cascading landscape of boulders shrouded in 
               deep green grass; and the blue lochs, reflecting the sky. We 
               hear a voice, husky, Scottish...

                                     VOICE OVER
                         I will tell you of William Wallace.

               EXT. MACANDREWS FARM - DAY

               A farmhouse and a large barn lie nestled in a Scottish valley. 
               Riding down the roads that lead in from opposite sides are 
               Scottish noblemen in full regalia: eye-popping tartans, 
               sparkling chestplates. Even the horses are draped in scarlet. 
               Behind each nobleman rides a single page boy.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         Historians from England will say I 
                         am a liar. But history is written by 
                         those who have hung heroes.

               Another noble rides in from the opposite side. Two more appear 
               down the road, converging on the barn.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         The King of Scotland had died without 
                         a son, and the king of England, a 
                         cruel pagan known as Edward the 
                         Longshanks, claimed the throne for 
                         himself. Scotlands nobles fought 
                         him, and fought each other, over the 
                         crown. So Longshanks invited them to 
                         talks of truce. No weapons, one page 
                         only.

               The nobles eye each other cautiously, but the truce holds.

               They enter the barn, with their pages...

               EXT. SCOTTISH FARM - DAY

               Nestled in emerald hills are the thatched roof house and 
               barn and outbuildings of a well-run farm. The farmer, MALCOLM 
               WALLACE, and his nineteen-year-old son JOHN, both strong, 
               tough men, are riding away from the farm. They hear hooves 
               behind them and turn to see a boy riding after them.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         Among the farmers of that shire was 
                         Malcolm Wallace, a commoner, with 
                         his own lands and two sons: John...

               We FAVOR JOHN WALLACE, the nineteen-year-old sitting easily 
               on his horse, beside his father...

                                     VOICE OVER
                         ...and William.

               WILLIAM, a skinny eight-year-old riding bareback, catches up 
               to his father and older brother.

                                     FATHER
                         Told ya to stay.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I finished my chores. Where we goin'?

                                     FATHER
                         MacAndrews'. He was supposed to visit 
                         when the truce was over.

               They ride on, over the lush hills.

               EXT. THE MACANDREWS FARM - DAY

               The horses are all gone; the place looks deserted. UP ON THE 
               HILL we see the three Wallaces, looking down.

                                     FATHER
                         Stay here.

               He means William. He and his elder son spur their horses.

               AT THE BARN - DAY

               The Wallaces ride up, looking around.

                                     FATHER
                         MacAndrews!... MacAndrews!?

               Malcolm finds a pitchfork, John the woodpile axe...

               INT. THE BARN

               POV from within as the door opens and a widening block of 
               sunlight illuminates the dusty shadows. Malcolm and John 
               Wallace step in, and are shocked to see...

               POV THE WALLACES

               Hanging from the rafters of the barn are thirty Scottish 
               noblemen and thirty pages, their faces purple and contorted 
               by the strangulation hanging, their tongues protruding.

               Malcolm stabs the pitchfork into the ground in useless anger; 
               John still grips the axe as he follows his father through 
               the hanging bodies of the noblemen to the back row, to see 
               the one man in commoner's dress, like theirs...

                                     FATHER
                         MacAndrews.

               A SHUFFLE; John spins; William has entered the back door.

                                     JOHN
                         William! Get out of here!

                                     WILLIAM
                         Why would MacAndrews make so many 
                         scarecrows?

               Before his father and brother can think of anything to say, 
               William, with a boy's curiosity, touches the spurred foot of 
               the hanged noblemen we first saw riding in. It's too solid; 
               he takes a real look at the face, and suddenly --

                                     WILLIAM
                         R -- real!!!... Ahhhhhgggg!...

               He turns to run, but knocks back into the feet of the hanged 
               man behind him! In blind panic he darts in another direction, 
               and runs into another corpse, and another; the hanged men 
               begin to swing, making it harder for William's father and 
               older brother to fight their way to him.

                                     FATHER
                         William! William!

               Then, worst of all, William sees the pages, boys like himself, 
               hanged in a row behind their masters!

               Finally his father and brother reach William and hug him 
               tight. There in the barn, among the swinging bodies of the 
               hanged nobles, Malcolm Wallace grips his sons.

                                     FATHER
                         Murderin' English bastards.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WALLACE FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

               The cottage looks peaceful, the windows glowing yellow into 
               the night. From outside the house we see John rise and close 
               the shutters of the kitchen, where men are gathered. We PAN 
               UP to the upper bedroom window...

               INSIDE THAT BEDROOM

               Young William is in nightmarish sleep. He mumbles in smothered 
               terror; he twitches. We see

               HIS NIGHTMARE

               In the blue-grays of his dream, William stands at the door 
               of the barn, gazing at the hanged knights. We WHIP PAN to 
               their faces, garish, horrible... Then one of the heads moves 
               and its eyes open! William wants to run, but he can't get 
               his body to respond... and the hanging nobleman, his bloated 
               tongue still bursting through his lips, moans...

                                     GHOUL
                         Will--iam...!

               WILLIAM tears himself from sleep; looking around, swallowing 
               back his tears and panic.

               IN THE KITCHEN

               A dozen strong, tough farmers have huddled. Red-headed 
               CAMPBELL, scarred and missing fingers, is stirred up, while 
               his friend MacCLANNOUGH is reluctant.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Wallace is right! We fight 'em!

                                     MACCLANNOUGH
                         Every nobleman who had any will to 
                         fight was at that meeting.

                                     MALCOLM WALLACE
                         So it's up to us! We show them we 
                         won't lie down to be their slaves!

                                     MACCLANNOUGH
                         We can't beat an army, not with the 
                         fifty farmers we can raise!

                                     MALCOLM WALLACE
                         We don't have to beat 'em, just fight 
                         'em. To show 'em we're not dogs, but 
                         men.

               Young Wallace has snuck down and is eavesdropping from the 
               stairs. He sees his father drip his finger into a jug of 
               whiskey and use the wet finger to draw on the tabletop.

                                     MALCOLM WALLACE
                         They have a camp here. We attack 
                         them at sunset tomorrow. Give us all 
                         night to run home.

               EXT. WALLACE FARM - DAY

               Malcolm and John have saddled horses; they are checking the 
               short swords they've tucked into grain sacks when William 
               comes out of the barn with his own horse.

                                     MALCOLM
                         William, you're staying here.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I can fight.

               These words from his youngest son make Malcolm pause, and 
               kneel, to look into William's eyes.

                                     MALCOLM
                         Aye. But it's our wits that make us 
                         men. I love ya, boy. You stay.

               Malcolm and John mount their horses and ride away, leaving 
               William looking forlorn. They wave; he waves back.

               EXT SCOTTISH HILLS, NEAR THE WALLACE FARM - DAY

               It's strangely quiet, until William and his friend HAMISH 
               CAMPBELL, a red-headed like his father, race up the hillside 
               and duck in among a grove of trees. Breathless, gasping, 
               they press their backs to the tree bark. William peers around 
               a tree, then shrinks back and whispers...

                                     WILLIAM
                         They're coming!

                                     HAMISH
                         How many?

                                     WILLIAM
                         Three, maybe more!

                                     HAMISH
                         Armed?

                                     WILLIAM
                         They're English soldiers, ain't they?

                                     HAMISH
                         With your father and brother gone, 
                         they'll kill us and burn the farm!

                                     WILLIAM
                         It's up to us, Hamish!

               Hamish leans forward for a look, but William pulls him back.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Not yet! Here he comes, be ready!

               They wait; heavy FOOTSTEPS. Then from around the edge of the 
               grove three enormous, ugly hogs appear. The boys hurling 
               rotten eggs. The eggs slap the snouts of the pigs, who scatter 
               as the boys charge, howling. We PULL BACK... as the sun goes 
               down on their play.

               EXT. THE WALLACE HOUSE - SUNDOWN

               The boys walk toward the house, beneath a lavender sky.

                                     HAMISH
                         Wanna stay with me tonight?

                                     WILLIAM
                         I wanna have supper waitin'.

                                     HAMISH
                         We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Aye, we'll get 'em.

               EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               William's face appears at the window, looking toward

               THE DISTANT HILLS

               of trees and heather, where there is no sign of life.

               INT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

               William has cooked stew in a pot, and now spoons up two 
               steaming bowls full and sets them out on the table. But he 
               is only hoping. He looks out the window again; he is still 
               all alone. So he leaves a candle burning on the table beside 
               the stew, and moves up the stairs.

               EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN

               The house is silent, fog rolling around it in the dawn.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN

               William has been awake all night, afraid to sleep. He rises, 
               and in QUICK CUTS: he dresses; he moves down the hall, stops 
               at the door of his father's bedroom and sees the undisturbed 
               bed. He moves on, passing the door of his brother's room, 
               also unrumpled.

               IN THE KITCHEN

               He finds the two cold bowls of stew, beside the exhausted 
               candle. He spoons up his own cold porridge, and eats alone.

               EXT. HOUSE - DAY

               William is in the barn loft, shoveling corn down to feed the 
               hogs, while he glimpses something coming.

               THE BOY'S POV

               An ox cart is coming down the curving lane. Its driver is 
               Campbell, with MacClannough walking behind it. The farmers 
               glance up at William, their faces grim...

               From his perch in the loft, William sees that the neighbors 
               have brought: the bodies of his father and brother. The cart 
               stops; Campbell, with a bandage around his left hand where 
               more of his fingers are now missing, studies the back of the 
               ox, as if it could tell him how to break such news. The butt 
               of the ox seems to tell him to be matter-of-fact.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         William... Come down here, lad.

               William looks away, he takes quick breaths, he looks back... 
               but the bodies are still there.

               EXT. HOUSE - DAY

               It's now surrounded by horses, wagons, and neighbors. The 
               undertaker arrives in his hearse.

               INT. THE SHED - DAY

               On a table the undertaker has laid out the bodies and is 
               preparing them. Cloths around the lower jaw and top of the 
               head bind their mouths shut; pennies cover their eyes.

               Softly, William enters the shed, drawn to his father and 
               brother. Campbell follows him in, wanting to stop him -- but 
               what can he say now? The undertaker goes on with his work.

               William approaches the table; the bodies don't look real to 
               him. He sees the wounds. The dried blood.

               The undertake pours water from a bowl and scrubs off the 
               blood. But the wounds remain.

               EXT. GRAVESIDE - DAY

               CLOSE on a grave, with a headstone marked ANNE WALLACE. We 
               INCLUDE the two new graves freshly dug beside it, and see 
               the mourners gathered before them. The sight of the boy, 
               standing alone in front of the graves of his dead mother, as 
               the bodies of his father and brother are lowered with ropes 
               into the ground beside her, has all of the neighbors shaken.

               The local parish PRIEST drones mechanically in Latin.

               The farmers who were secretly gathered in Malcolm Wallace's 
               kitchen the previous night are now glancing at William; but 
               no one is anxious to adopt a grieving, a rebellious boy.

               Behind MacClannough are his wife and two daughters; his 
               youngest is barely four, not half William's age; she's a 
               beautiful girl with long auburn hair, and she clings to her 
               own mother's hand, as if the open graves are the mouths of 
               death and might suck her parents in too.

                                     PRIEST
                         ...Restare in pacem eternis, Amen.

               With the final Amen, the neighbors drift from the graveside, 
               pulling their Children along, to give William a last moment 
               of private grief before the grave diggers cover the bodies.

               The boy stands alone over the open graves, his heart so 
               shattered that he can scarcely cry; a single tear makes its 
               way down his face. And the tiny girl feels for William in a 
               way that the adults cannot. From the ground she pulls a 
               Scottish thistle, moves to the softly weeping William and 
               places the beautiful wild blossom in his hand.

               William looks up and their young eyes meet; her sad blue 
               eyes hold William's as the grave diggers cover the bodies.

               Then a lone, mounted figure appears at the crest of the hill 
               above them. Tall, thin and angular, in black clerical garb, 
               he looks like the grim reaper.

               The girl hurries back to her mother's side; everyone watches 
               in silence as the figure rides down to them. He is ARGYLE 
               WALLACE. He looks like a human buzzard, his face craggy, 
               permanently furious.

                                     PRIEST
                         You must be the relative of the 
                         deceased... William, this is your 
                         Uncle Argyle.

               Argyle glowers at the man, dismounts, and glares at William.

               William stares up at this frightening figure. They are 
               interrupted by the ominous sound of approaching horses; a 
               dozen mounted English soldiers, armed with lances, are 
               approaching. Argyle rattles to the priest...

                                     ARGYLE
                         You were wise to hurry.

               The soldiers ride right in among the mourners and stare down 
               from their saddles, haughty, menacing, their LEADER brusque.

                                     LEADER
                         Someone dead from this household?

                                     ARGYLE
                         We just had a funeral, isn't that 
                         what it means in England as well?

                                     LEADER
                         What it means in England -- and in 
                         Scotland too -- is that rebels have 
                         forfeited their lands. We were 
                         ambushed last night. But the Scots 
                         dragged their dead away.

                                     ARGYLE
                         My brother and nephew perished two 
                         days ago, when their hay cart turned 
                         over.

                                     LEADER
                         Then we'll just have a peek at the 
                         wounds.
                              (to his men)
                         Dig 'em up!

                                     ARGYLE
                         They've been sanctified and buried 
                         in the holy rites of God's church, 
                         and any hand that disturbs them now 
                         takes on eternal damnation. So please -- 
                         do it.

               Outmaneuvered, the leader reins his horse away. Several of 
               the farmers spit on the ground. Argyle glares at them.

                                     ARGYLE
                         Funeral's over. Go home.

               INT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT

               William and Argyle are sitting at the table, eating. Argyle 
               has laid out a proper meal, with exact place settings.

                                     ARGYLE
                         Not that spoon, that one's for soup. 
                         Dip away from you. And don't slurp.

               Argyle sits down and begins to dine with the boy.

                                     ARGYLE
                         We'll sleep here tonight. You'll 
                         come home with me. We'll let the 
                         house, and the lands too; plenty of 
                         willing neighbors.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I don't want to leave.

                                     ARGYLE
                         Didn't want your father to die either, 
                         did ya? But it happened.

               Argyle pushes his food away; he has no appetite now.

                                     ARGYLE
                         Did the priest say anything about 
                         the Resurrection? Or was it all about 
                         Judgment?

                                     WILLIAM
                         It was in Latin, sir.

                                     ARGYLE
                         Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak 
                         Latin? We have to fix that, won't 
                         we?
                              (beat)
                         Did he give the poetic benediction? 
                         The Lord bless thee and keep thee? 
                         Patris Benefactum et --
                              (beat)
                         ...It was Malcolm's favorite.

               INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Argyle knows nothing about tucking a boy in bed; he stands 
               awkwardly idle as William scrubs his face at the washstand 
               and crawls into bed.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Good night, Uncle.

               Argyle grunts and starts out. Then he stops, turns back, 
               leans down over William... and with great tenderness the 
               grizzled old uncle kisses his nephew on his hair.

               INT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Argyle sits by the hearth, staring at the embers. He holds 
               the huge broadsword that belonged to his brother. He looks 
               at the handle, like a cross. He whispers...

                                     ARGYLE
                         "The Lord bless thee and keep thee..."

               Tears of grief spill down the old man's cheeks.

               INT. THE HANGING BARN - IN WILLIAM'S DREAM

               Once again the boy stands in the doorway of the barn, looking 
               at the garish, hanged faces in his nightmare. Then a mangled 
               hand comes from behind him and grasps his shoulder, William 
               gasps, but the hand holds him gently. He turns to see his 
               father, and his brother! They are wounded, bloody, but they 
               smile at him; they're alive! Weeping in joy, William reaches 
               to hug them, but his father stretches forth a forbidding 
               hand.

               William keeps reaching out helplessly. His father and brother 
               move past him to the hanged knights. Two empty nooses are 
               there. Before the boy's weeping eyes they put their heads 
               into the nooses, and hoist themselves up.

               William's grief explodes; his tears erupt and

               HE WAKES IN HIS BEDROOM

               tears flooding down his face. A dream! Still upset, still 
               grieving, he gets up and goes looking for his uncle.

               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               William moves down to the room where his uncle would be 
               sleeping. He opens the door. The bed has been slept in -- 
               but his uncle is not there. He moves downstairs to

               THE KITCHEN

               But his uncle is not there either. Then William hears a 
               strange, haunting sound-distant, carried by the wind. He 
               moves to the window and sees only moonlight. He opens the 
               window and hears it more clearly: bagpipes. William lights a 
               candle and throws open the door. Wind rushes in, blowing out 
               his candle. But he hears the pipes, louder in the wind.

               EXT. WALLACE HOUSE - NIGHT

               William is barefoot and in only his nightshirt; but the sound 
               of the pipes is growing louder. He moves through the 
               moonlight, drawn toward -- the graveyard! He stops as he 
               realizes this, then forces himself on.

               EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

               William moves to the top of the hill where his ancestors are 
               buried, and discovers a haunting scene: two dozen men, the 
               farmer/warriors of his neighborhood, are gathered in kilts -- 
               and among them, a core of bagpipers. The pipes wail an ancient 
               Scottish dirge, a tune of grief and redemption, a melody 
               known to us as "Amazing Grace." Uncle Argyle has heard them 
               and walked out too; he stands at the fringes of the 
               torchlight, still holding the massive broadsword. He glances 
               down, noticing William as the boy moves up beside him. William 
               whispers...

                                     WILLIAM
                         What are they doing?

                                     ARGYLE
                         Saying goodbye in their own way -- 
                         in outlawed tartans, with outlawed 
                         pipes, playing outlawed tunes.

               The farmers file by the graveside, crossing themselves, each 
               whispering his own private prayer. Argyle whispers, half to 
               William, and half to himself...

                                     ARGYLE
                         Your Daddy and I, we saw our own 
                         father buried like this, dead from 
                         fighting the English.

               William takes the sword from his uncle, and tries to lift 
               it.

               Slowly, Argyle takes the sword back.

                                     ARGYLE
                         First learn to use this.

               He taps William on the temple with the tip of his finger.

                                     ARGYLE
                         Then I will teach you to use this.

               With an expert's easy fluidity, he lifts the huge sword. It 
               glistens in the torchlight. The music plays, the notes hanging 
               in the air, swirling in the Scottish breeze as if rising 
               towards the stars...

               EXT. WALLACE FARM - DAY

               William and his uncle ride off in a farm wagon. William has 
               a bundle of clothes in his lap, and glances at his uncle as 
               if afraid of his disapproval if he looks back. But he does 
               glance back just once, to see the deserted farmhouse.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - ROYAL WEDDING - DAY

               Amid the scarlet and ermine robes of officiating lords, with 
               gemstones sparkling everywhere, we hear...

                                     VOICE OVER
                         Twelve years later, Longshanks 
                         supervised the wedding of his eldest 
                         son, also named Edward, who would 
                         succeed him to the throne.

               LONGSHANKS, King of England, stands in the jeweled light of 
               the ancient Abbey. Known as Longshanks because of the spindly 
               legs that make him almost seven feet tall, he has a hawk's 
               nose and a snake's eyes, punctuating a face of distinct 
               cruelty. Historians of his day considered him and the line 
               of Plantagenets from which he came to be devil worshipers.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         As bride for his son, Longshanks had 
                         chosen a relative of his rival, the 
                         king of France.

               GENEVIEVE, a nineteen-year-old virgin of stupendous beauty 
               moves down the aisle, the light in her face outshining her 
               blindingly white wedding gown. As she reaches the altar her 
               hands tremble, but she maintains her poise and control.

               She looks toward EDWARD, Prince of Wales. Pampered young men 
               surround him as his retinue. He takes her hand coldly and 
               goes through the ceremony under his father's stare.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         It was widely whispered that for the 
                         Princess to conceive, Longshanks 
                         would have to do the honors himself. 
                         That may have been what he had in 
                         mind all along.

               The ceremony concluding, attendants lift back the bride's 
               veil. Her wedding day, the ultimate moment -- and Prince 
               Edward ignores her, to turn back to his friends. But prompted 
               by one of the sour lords, he leans over and pecks his new 
               Princess on the cheek. For an instant, we see in her eyes 
               that her heart is dying. But she keeps her poise.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         Having seen to his obligations to 
                         provide for a successor, Longshanks 
                         set about his fondest business -- to 
                         crush Scotland, and turn his power 
                         against France...

               CLOSE - A MAP OF THE BRITISH ISLES

               Longshanks' narrow finger jabs Scotland.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Scotland! Scot-land!

               We are in the --

               INT. ROYAL ENGLISH PALACE - DAY

               Longshanks is being listened to by his advisors, all in the 
               outrageous splendor of royal military dress, and all deathly 
               afraid of him.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         The French will grovel to anyone 
                         with strength! But how will they 
                         credit our strength when we cannot 
                         rule the whole of our own island?!

               He punches the map, then sees the Princess enter softly.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Where is my son?

                                     PRINCESS
                         Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to 
                         come in his stead.

               Longshanks' eyes expand in fury; it is frightening to see.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         I sent for him -- and the little 
                         coward send you?!

                                     PRINCESS
                         Shall I leave, M'lord?

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         If he wants his queen to rule, then 
                         you stay and learn how! I will deal 
                         with him.

               He spins back toward his generals. Ignored, the princess 
               settles silently onto the cushions of the window seat.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Nobles are the key to the Scottish 
                         door. Grant their nobles land here 
                         in England. Give our own nobles 
                         estates in the north. Make them too 
                         greedy to oppose us.

               One OLD ADVISOR speaks up hesitantly.

                                     OLD ADVISOR
                         Sire... Our nobles will be reluctant 
                         to relocate. New lands mean new taxes, 
                         and they are taxed already for our 
                         war in France.

               Longshanks glares at him, but takes the point. The wheels 
               grind in his brain; his dark eyes falling on the Princess, 
               he is inspired.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Perhaps it's time to reinstitute an 
                         old custom. Grant them prima noctes, 
                         "First night." When any common girl 
                         inhabiting their lands is married, 
                         our lords shall have sexual rights 
                         to her on the night of her wedding. 
                         That should fetch just the kind of 
                         lords we want in Scotland.

               INT. PRINCE EDWARD'S ROYAL APARTMENTS - DAY

               The prince and a muscular young friend, PHILLIP, are stripped 
               to the waist and fencing. They pay no attention to the

               KNOCK, or to the Princess as she enters. She watches them -- 
               they are dancing more than fencing. Edward loses his sword; 
               it clatters to the polished floor. He looks up at his wife, 
               as if angry at her for having seen his clumsiness.

                                     EDWARD
                         What is it?!

                                     PRINCESS
                         You directed me to report to you the 
                         moment the king's conference was 
                         ended.

                                     EDWARD
                         So I did! And what was so important 
                         about it?

                                     PRINCESS
                         Scotland. He intends --

               But Edward and his friend are fencing again, the clanging of 
               their blunted swords so loud that she can't hear herself.

                                     PRINCESS
                         He intends to grant --

               Edward loses his weapon again, and whirls on her.

                                     EDWARD
                         Shut up, would you! How can I 
                         concentrate?!

                                     PRINCESS
                         ...His majesty was quite keen that 
                         you should understand --

                                     EDWARD
                         All so very boring! He wants me to 
                         learn to fight too, so let me do it!

               For an instant, anger flares into her eyes. She glances at 
               Edward, and at the young man with him, then lowers her eyes 
               and starts to back out. But Edward has noticed.

                                     EDWARD
                         Stop there.

               She stops, but does not raise her eyes.

                                     EDWARD
                         Do you disapprove of Phillip?

               He lifts his hand and draws his friend Phillip to his side.

               Still the Princess does not lift her eyes.

                                     PRINCESS
                              (barely audible)
                         No, M'lord.

                                     EDWARD
                         Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!

               She lifts her eyes. But she could not brace herself enough 
               for what she sees: Edward nuzzling Phillip, the prince's 
               bare chest to his muscular friend's bare back, both men 
               glistening with sweat and sexual excitement.

               The Princess's eyes quiver... but she does not look away.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now, my flower, do you understand?

                                     PRINCESS
                         Yes. I had thought that... I was 
                         loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I 
                         may be excused, M'lord.

                                     EDWARD
                         You may.

               She starts to leave, as quietly as she came. But her husband 
               calls after her.

                                     EDWARD
                         Don't worry, m'Lady, it is my royal 
                         responsibility to breed. And I assure 
                         you, when the time comes, I shall... 
                         manage.

               She closes the door softly, on her husband and his lover.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         Now in Edinburgh were gathered the 
                         council of Scottish nobles...

               ESTABLISHING COUNCIL - DAY

               The picturesque heart of Scotland, with its CASTLE on a fairy 
               tale plateau above the Firth of Forth.

               INT. EDINBURGH CASTLE - DAY

               The nobles are gathered around a huge table. They rise at 
               the entrance of young ROBERT THE BRUCE, a handsome young 
               man, full of intelligence and power.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         Among these was Robert, the 17th 
                         Earl of Bruce, a leading contender 
                         for the crown of Scotland.

               Robert strides to his seat in the center of the table, and 
               the others settle in respectfully. MORNAY, another young 
               warrior, gives him a bow, as does CRAIG, a grizzled noble.

                                     CRAIG
                         Young Robert, we are honored --

                                     ROBERT
                         My father hears that Longshanks has 
                         granted prima noctes.

                                     CRAIG
                         Clearly meant to draw more of his 
                         supporters here.

                                     MORNAY
                         The Balliol clan has endorsed the 
                         right, licking Longshanks' boots so 
                         he will support their claim to the 
                         throne. If we make a show of 
                         opposition, the commoners will favor 
                         us.

                                     ROBERT
                         It is too soon to step out alone. My 
                         father believes we must lull 
                         Longshanks into confidence, by neither 
                         supporting his decree nor opposing 
                         it.

                                     CRAIG
                         A wise plan. And how is your father? 
                         We have missed him at the council.

                                     ROBERT
                         He strained his leg so that it pains 
                         him to ride. But he sends his 
                         greetings -- and says that I speak 
                         for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.

               EXT. SCOTTISH VILLAGE, AT THE EDGE OF TOWN - DAY

               Flutes and dancing; laughter and garlands; village families 
               have gathered for a wedding celebration -- we see the happy 
               bride and groom. Farmers cart in fresh bread and hoops of 
               cheese; villagers arrive with casks of beer or strings of 
               smoked fish.

               And watching the people are ubiquitous English soldiers, 
               battlescarred veterans with missing eyes and ears.

               Riding along the road comes William Wallace. Grown now, a 
               man. He sits his horse as if born there, his back straight, 
               his hands relaxed on the reins. He has a look of lean, rippled 
               power. He looks dangerous.

               And the soldiers notice him, nudging each other as he passes.

               He carries a dead wild goose hanging across his saddle; he 
               stops his horse at the edge of the clearing and surveys the 
               scene. Farmers are roasting a pig; women are comparing 
               handiwork; young men are tossing huge stones in the 
               traditional Highland games -- and everyone is noticing 
               William's arrival, especially the farm women with daughters 
               of marriageable age.

               Among those watching William arrive is Campbell, grown older 
               now; and with his old rebel friend, MacClannough. William 
               dismounts and ties his horse to a willow. One of the English 
               SOLDIERS shoves William from behind.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Hey boy! You hunt this bird?

               William's eyes fix themselves on the soldier.

                                     SOLDIER
                         It's against the law for Scots to 
                         own bows. You shot this bird?

               His buddies, enjoying their role as intimidators, grab the 
               bird and begin to search it for evidence.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I hit it in the head. With a rock.

               They don't believe that -- but they can't find any puncture 
               wound on the bird. William reaches his hand out for the return 
               of the bird. The soldiers drop it onto the ground.

               Slowly, William picks it up, and heads into the clearing.

               The farmers watch him come.

               Among those noticing William's arrival, but pretending not 
               to, is MARION MacCLANNOUGH, grown now into a stunning young 
               woman; her long auburn hair reminds us of those years long 
               ago; she wears it the same way, straight and full down her 
               back. Her dress is plain, like the grass that surrounds a 
               wildflower. She's the most beautiful girl in the village, 
               maybe in all of Scotland, and the soldiers who hassled William 
               notice her too.

               William reaches the food table and contributes his goose to 
               the feast. FARM WOMEN eye him; he nodes to one.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Miz MacDougal. You look well.

                                     FARM WOMAN
                         ...William? It's William Wallace, 
                         back home! -- Have you met my 
                         daughter?

               The daughter mentioned is missing teeth. William nods to 
               her. It's impossible for him to giver her a smile as bright 
               as her hopes, and she lowers her head in disappointment. But 
               then raises her face in surprise as William takes her hand 
               and gives her a respectful bow.

               He moves away from the table, passing through the crowd like 
               a stranger. Then he glances toward the knot of girls. He 
               sees Marion. She sees him, then looks away. Do they remember 
               each other? He moves toward her; she is shy, her eyes 
               downcast, but then she raises them and looks at him.

               They move closer and closer together. Just as they are about 
               to reach each other, a huge round stone THUMPS to the earth 
               at Williams' feet.

               He looks up to see one of Marion's suitors -- the broad, 
               muscled young man who has just tossed the stone in William's 
               way. Now everybody's looking to see how William will handle 
               the challenge. He tries to move around, but the guy cuts him 
               off. Then William thinks he recognizes the big red-head.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Hamish?

               It is his old friend, but Hamish won't admit it, or be put 
               off from the challenge. He points to the huge stone.

                                     HAMISH
                         Test of manhood.

                                     WILLIAM
                         You win.

                                     HAMISH
                              (blocks him)
                         Call it a test of soldiery, then. 
                         The English won't let us train with 
                         weapons, so we train with stones.

                                     WILLIAM
                         The test of a soldier is not in his 
                         arm. It's here.

               He taps his temple. Hamish stretches out his hand, as if to 
               show William something in his palm.

                                     HAMISH
                         No. It's here.

               With a sudden movement, he slams his fist into William's 
               jaw, dropping him. A few men move to interfere, but Campbell, 
               MacClannough, and the other farmers who are the true leaders 
               here, stop their neighbors from interrupting. Hamish stands 
               over William, waiting for him to get up.

                                     WILLIAM
                         A contest, then.

               William stands and hoists the huge stone, eighteen inches in 
               diameter. Straining with the effort, he lugs the stone to 
               the line scratched in the rocky field. Beyond the line are 
               the muddy dents from previous tosses. William takes a run 
               and heaves the stone. It flies past the other marks in the 
               field; people are impressed. William looks at Hamish.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I still say this is no test. A 
                         catapult can throw a stone farther 
                         than a man can.

                                     HAMISH
                         That depends on the man.

               Hamish walks out, lifts the stone, and lugs it back to the 
               line. He takes a run and heaves with a great groan! The stone 
               flies, passing William's mark by a couple of feet.

               People laugh and whistle. William nods, impressed.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Can you do it when it matters? As it 
                         matters in battle? Could you crush a 
                         man with that throw?

                                     HAMISH
                         I could crush you like a roach.

               William walks to the dent made by Hamish's throw.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Then do it. Come, do it.

               Hamish scowls at William, at everybody watching. He lifts 
               the stone and carries it back to the line. William stands 
               calmly. Hamish backs up for his run. William yawns.

                                     HAMISH
                         You'll move

                                     WILLIAM
                         I will not.

               Hamish backs up a few more feet, for a longer run.

                                     FARMER STEWART
                         That's not fair!

                                     CAMPBELL
                         He's tired, he should get a longer 
                         run.

               William seems completely unafraid. He leans down, picks up a 
               small smooth stone and tosses it up in the air casually.

               Stung by this show of calm, Hamish takes furious run, and 
               heaves! The stone flies through the air, just misses William's 
               head, and buries itself halfway into the earth behind him. 
               William never flinches. The people cheer.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Brave show!

               Hamish is miffed; it's like William won.

                                     HAMISH
                         I threw longer than last time!

                                     CAMPBELL
                         An ox is strong, but not clever.

                                     HAMISH
                         An ox is stupid enough to just stand 
                         in one place.

                                     WILLIAM
                         That's not the point.

               William turns, walks double the distance Hamish threw, and 
               turns and hurls the rock he holds! It whistles through the 
               air, hits Hamish in the forehead, and drops him like a shot.

                                     WILLIAM
                         That is.

               Everybody cheers and laughs! They surround William.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         A fine display, young Wallace!

               William takes a tankard of ale from a farmer, walks over and 
               tosses the cold liquid into Hamish's face; he wakes, and, 
               his eyes uncrossing, accepts William's hand, pulling him up.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Good to see you again.

                                     HAMISH
                         I should'a remembered the eggs.

               Grinning, they embrace. MUSIC plays, the dancing begins.

               William walks to the knot of young ladies... but passes 
               Marion, and moves to the girl with the missing teeth.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Would you honor me with a dance?

               She's thrilled to accept; they begin to dance.

                                     GIRL
                         You've taken over your father's farm?
                              (beat)
                         They say he died long ago. Fighting 
                         the English.

                                     WILLIAM
                         He died in an accident, with my 
                         brother. Their cart turned over.

               The musicians interrupt their playing; a group of heavily 
               armed horsemen, with banners and flying colors, ride up, 
               reining their horses into the middle of the celebration. In 
               the middle of the group is an English NOBLEMAN; he is gray, 
               in his fifties, and stops in front of the BRIDE and groom.

                                     NOBLEMAN
                         I have come to claim the right of 
                         prima noctes. As the lord of these 
                         lands, I will bless this marriage by 
                         taking the bride into my bed on the 
                         first night of her union.

               Stewart, father of the BRIDE, lunges forward.

                                     STEWART
                         No, by God!

               The horsemen point their lances at the unarmed Scots -- who 
               see that the English soldiers from the village have moved to 
               the edge of the gathering, as if to dare any resistance.

                                     NOBLEMAN
                         It is my noble right.

               Even unarmed, Stewart is about to attack -- but the bride 
               intervenes. She grabs her father and whispers to him. She 
               moves to her husband and does the same. Holding back tears, 
               she allows herself to be pulled up behind one of the horsemen. 
               Marion MacClannough is looking on, sobered by her friend's 
               courage and sickened by her fate -- and Marion is even more 
               unsettled as she notices that one of the soldiers, a 
               particularly nasty looking brute with a scarred face, is 
               leering at her. William Wallace sees this too.

               The noble and his escorts ride away, and as they do it begins 
               to rain. The celebration destroyed, the Scots gather the 
               food and disperse to their homes. But Wallace remains, 
               standing in the downpour, keeping his thoughts to himself.

               EXT. THE WALLACE FARMHOUSE - MAGIC HOUR

               The farmhouse looks lonely and forlorn. William stands at 
               the open door, and gazes out at the rain; it leaks on him, 
               through his roof; he doesn't seem to notice.

               EXT. THE MACCLANNOUGH HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR

               A thatched cottage, lit with a cozy fire, beneath the rain.

               A hand KNOCKS on the door, and MacClannough opens it to find 
               William, on a horse! MacClannough frowns.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Good evening, sir. May I speak with 
                         your daughter?

               Mrs. MacClannough shoulders up beside her husband, and Marion 
               appears behind her scowling parents.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Marion... Would you like to go for a 
                         ride on this fine evening?

                                     MOTHER
                         The boy's insane!

                                     WILLIAM
                         It's good Scottish weather, Madam, 
                         the rain is fallin' straight down.

                                     MOTHER
                         She absolutely may not, she'll -- 
                         Marion!

               Marion has grabbed a cloak off the back of the door; she 
               runs out to hop up behind William, and they gallop away.

               THE RIDE - MAGIC HOUR

               William and Marion race along the heather, up and down hills, 
               through swollen streams. The rain stops, as the sun sets; 
               the Scottish mists lift, revealing stunning natural beauty.

               William stops the horse and they look out over it all 
               together. He speaks, without turning to face her.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Your father doesn't like me, does 
                         he?

                                     MARION
                         It's not you. He dislikes that you're 
                         a Wallace. He just says... the 
                         Wallaces don't seem to live for very 
                         long.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Thank you for accepting.

                                     MARION
                         Thank you for inviting.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I'll invite you again, but your mother 
                         thinks I'm crazy.

                                     MARION
                         You are. And I'll come again.

               He lingers; he wants to say something, or maybe he just 
               doesn't want the moment to end. Finally he spurs the horse.

               EXT. THE MACCLANNOUGH HOUSE - NIGHT

               They reach the door. William hops off the horse and reaches 
               up to help her down the moment she touches the ground, they 
               look into each other's eyes... but the door is snatched open 
               so quickly by her mother that there is not time for a kiss.

                                     MOTHER
                         Marion, come in!

               He walks her closer to the door. They turn and look at each 
               other again. She waits for him to kiss her...

                                     MOTHER
                         Marion, come in!

               She still hesitates; he isn't going to kiss her. She starts 
               in, but he grabs her hand. And into it he puts something he 
               has taken from his pocket; it is wrapped in flannel. He hops 
               on his horse, glances at her, and gallops away.

               She stands in the open doorway; she looks down at what he 
               left her. She unwraps the flannel; it is a dried thistle, 
               the one she gave him years before.

               EXT. WALLACE FARM - DAY

               William is re-thatching the roof of his barn, when he hears 
               riders approaching, and looks down to see that it is 
               MacClannough, backed by Campbell and Hamish. Uh-oh.

                                     MACCLANNOUGH
                         Young Wallace --

                                     WILLIAM
                         Sir, I know it was strange of me to 
                         invite Marion to ride last night. I 
                         assure you, I --

                                     CAMPBELL
                         MacClannough's daughter is another 
                         matter. We come to fetch you to a 
                         meeting.

                                     WILLIAM
                         What kind of meeting?

                                     CAMPBELL
                         The secret kind.

               William goes back to repairing his roof.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Your father was a fighter. And a 
                         patriot.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I know who my father was. I came 
                         back home to raise crops. And, God 
                         willing, a family. If I can live in 
                         peace, I will.

               Campbell shakes his head and reins his horse away, with 
               Hamish. MacClannough lingers.

                                     MACCLANNOUGH
                         If you can keep your intention to 
                         stay out of the troubles, you may 
                         court my daughter. If you break your 
                         intention, I'll kill you.

               MacClannough rides away. William sits down on the roof, and 
               looks out at the graves of his father and brother.

               EXT. MACCLANNOUGH HOUSE - NIGHT

               Outside the half-timbered house, William stands in the shadows 
               of moonlight and tosses a pebble against the wooden upper 
               window. Marion opens the shutters and slips out onto the 
               vines, dropping into William's arms.

               Giggling, suppressing laughter, they run to the trees...

               SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - NIGHT

               Hand in hand through the heather they run, silhouettes along 
               a ridge, their breath blowing silver clouds in the moonlight, 
               the Scottish wind whipping through their hair.

               They stop at a grove at the edge of a precipice, overlooking 
               a loch gleaming in the moonlight. So beautiful it's sacred.

                                     MARION
                         You've been here before?

                                     WILLIAM
                         Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly 
                         dreams I don't want. I started riding 
                         at night to fill up my mind so that 
                         when I did sleep I'd dream only of 
                         the ride and the adventure.

                                     MARION
                         Did it work?

                                     WILLIAM
                         No. You don't choose your dreams. 
                         Your dreams choose you.

               He looks at her. They kiss suddenly, so long and hard that 
               they tumble into the heather, rolling, devouring each other.

               Through their passion...

                                     WILLIAM
                         I want... to marry you!

                                     MARION
                         I... accept your proposal!

                                     WILLIAM
                         I'm not just saying it!

                                     MARION
                         Nor I!

                                     WILLIAM
                         But I won't give you up to any 
                         nobleman.

                                     MARION
                              (stopping)
                         You scare me.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I don't want to scare you. I want to 
                         be yours, and you mine. Every night 
                         like this one.

                                     MARION
                         This night is too beautiful to have 
                         again.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I will be with you, like this. 
                         Forever.

               They kiss again...

               EXT. LANARK VILLAGE - DAY

               Marion moves through the market. English soldiers admire her 
               as she walks. She stops, looking at white lace and cloth.

               William casually passes, poking a note in her basket. Subtly 
               she withdraws his note, and reads:

               INSERT - HIS NOTE

               Tonight. By the trees.

               EXT. MARION'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Marion slips out of the house and runs to the trees, where 
               William waits with horses. She fetches a bundle she's stashed 
               in the crook of a tree, and they mount and ride off.

               EXT. RUINS OF AN ANCIENT CHURCH - NIGHT

               The church is at the base of the precipice, beside the loch.

               INT. THE CHURCH - NIGHT

               This ancient Gaelic place of worship has been destroyed by 
               the occupying army, and yet it looks devoutly holy this way, 
               lit only by candles and moonlight through the open roof. The 
               village PRIEST whom we saw at the wedding celebration is 
               waiting at the altar. Marion steps into the confessional, as 
               William moves to the altar and kneels in prayer.

               Marion emerges; she's changed into the wedding dress she 
               made from the cloth she bought. William stands and watches 
               her float down the aisle; his whole life was worth this 
               moment.

               Together, the two lovers turn to the priest.

                                     PRIEST
                         You have come to pledge, each to the 
                         other, before Almighty God.

               From within his shirt, William withdraws a strip of cloth 
               woven in his family tartan. He and Marion each lift a hand 
               to the priest, and he binds their wrists with the cloth.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I will love you my whole life. You 
                         and no other.

               From her dress she takes a handmade handkerchief, embroidered 
               with a thistle to look like the one she first gave him those 
               years ago.

                                     MARION
                         And I you. You and no other. Forever.

               The Priest waits for them to go on, but neither can; they're 
               too taken with emotion, looking at each other. The Priest 
               intones holy phrases...

                                     PRIEST
                         Agus bhayd lauch... The Lord bless 
                         and keep thy love, now and forever.

               The lovers kiss. As they break their embrace, a figure 
               carrying something dark and spiky appears at the broken door 
               of the church, and William spins as if to attack, but the 
               Priest catches his arm; they see the man carries bagpipes.

                                     PRIEST
                         I trust him -- or I'd'a killed him 
                         me'self. A weddin' needs pipes.

               The piper begins to play, and the tune from his primitive 
               chanter is wispy, ethereal, beautiful. The lovers look into 
               each other's eyes, as the single melody of the pipes merges 
               into a swell of music, UNDERSCORING MONTAGE

               William and Marion ride the path to the top of the precipice, 
               where, in the shelter of the grove, they spend their 
               honeymoon. The MUSIC CONTINUES as, still sweaty from their 
               love-making, he returns her to her house just before dawn.

               She waves from her window, as William rides away, as we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. VILLAGE OF LANARK - DAY

               It's Market Day in the village, busy with Highlanders, 
               merchants of all kinds, and a few special attractions like 
               jugglers and fortune tellers. Marion moves along a table 
               full of flowers and fruit... William, concealed behind hanging 
               baskets, watches her unseen, savoring the beauty of his 
               beloved, bathing his soul in the sight of her. Then she looks 
               up and spots him, her smile sudden and luminous, before she 
               remembers to conceal it. He moves up beside her.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I've missed you.

                                     MARION
                         Shush. It's only been a day.
                              (beat)
                         And it's seemed like forever.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Tonight then.

                                     MARION
                         My parents are growing suspicious! I 
                         can't keep meeting you every night!

               Playfully he pokes his finger under the collar of her dress, 
               pulling up the strip of checked cloth he gave her at their 
               wedding, which she now wears hidden around her neck.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Then when?

                                     MARION
                         ...Tonight!

               Tucking in the cloth strip, she hurries away, smiling.

               ANGLE - DRUNKEN ENGLISH SOLDIERS - BY AN ALE CASK - DAY

               They spot Marion moving through the fair, glowing, beautiful.

               The soldiers smirk at each other; as Marion passes, one of 
               them grabs her wrist. It's the soldier with the scar, the 
               one who's been staring at her.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Where are you going... lass?

                                     MARION
                         Let go.

               A second drunken SOLDIER pipes up.

                                     SOLDIER #2
                         Why don't you marry my friend here? 
                         Then I'll take the first night!

               The scarred soldier pulls Marion into his big arms; she shoves 
               him away with surprising strength, and he staggers back, to 
               the laughter of his friends. Then he snatches her again and 
               kisses her hard on the lips.

               She breaks free and SLAPS him fiercely, hard enough to draw 
               blood from his mouth. Tasting the trickle, he slings her 
               down against sacks of grain, and the soldiers are all over 
               her, pinning her down, ripping her clothes, a full scale 
               public gang rape. As the townspeople try to move in the three 
               soldiers waiting their turn at Marion pull their knives, 
               keep them townspeople back.

                                     SOLDIER #1
                         Bitch, who do you think you are?

               He slams his mouth down against hers for a long, awful time, 
               comes up clawing at her dress to rip it from her body... and 
               is hit in the face by a rock thrown at great speed!

               It takes a moment for the other soldiers to realize what 
               just happened, and in that instant William is on them. He 
               wrenches one soldier's arm in a direction it was never meant 
               to go, breaking the elbow, separating the shoulder, and 
               slinging the howling soldier into his comrades.

               Two of the soldiers leap at William, swinging their short 
               swords; William ducks, knocking their ale cask into their 
               knees; William lifts the whole table where they were sitting 
               and slams it into the faces of two more attackers.

                                     MARION
                         William!

               She shouts to warn him that the scarred soldier, now 
               bloodyfaced, has recovered from the rock and is behind William 
               with a knife. William sidesteps the first thrust, snatches a 
               leg from the shattered table and crushes the man's skull.

                                     MARKET WOMEN
                         Wallace Wallace! William Wallace!

               But there's no time for celebration. There's blood and ale 
               everywhere, and the fallen soldiers are yelling...

                                     FALLEN SOLDIER
                         Rebels! Help!

               MORE SOLDIERS hear the call and come running, reinforcements 
               converging from all over the village.

                                     VILLAGE FOLKS
                         Run, William! Run!

               Will sees the horse that pulled the flower cart and throws 
               Marion up onto its back. He slaps the horse's rump and it 
               plunges with Marion into the twisting village lanes. William 
               darts off through the crowd, as the MAGISTRATE and more of 
               his soldiers arrive -- dozens of them!

               William pauses out in the central street of the village, 
               just long enough to be sure they've spotted him, and darts 
               into a side lane in the opposite direction Marion went; 
               William weaves through the narrow streets of the medieval 
               town, knocking over baskets, jumping carts.

               As the soldiers stumble after him, the Magistrate looks down 
               at his mangled soldiers. The one with the ruptured arm is 
               lying in agony.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         What happened?

                                     SOLDIER
                         ...girl.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         What girl?!

                                     SOLDIER
                         ...on horse.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         The girl on the horse! Stop her!

               The shout rings through the village; Marion hears it, and 
               when she sees more soldiers at the far end of the lane she's 
               trying to take out of town, she urges the horse into an even 
               narrower back alley. She sees a clear route to freedom...

               But the flock of pigeons pecking on the scraps thrown there 
               behind the shops rise into the horse's face with a sudden 
               thrashing of wings, and the horse shies against a wall.

               Marion controls him, but a flap of her ripped dress has caught 
               on a crude nail, and as the frightened horse lunges forward 
               again, she is pulled off its bare back, her dress catching 
               and ripping at the same time, dropping her hard.

               WILLIAM

               reaches the edge of the town and slips into the trees by the 
               river; the soldiers are running every which way, but they've 
               lost him. Thinking Marion's made it too, William heads deeper 
               into the trees.

               IN THE TOWN, MARION

               recovers; her dress has torn free! She starts to get up; but 
               the soldiers' pikes appear over her, and the magistrate leers.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         So this is the little whore he was 
                         fighting for.

               EXT. THE GROVE AT THE PRECIPICE - DAY

               William moves into the shelters of the trees, expecting to 
               see Marion. He doesn't. He listens; only the rustling of the 
               wind through the treetops.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Marion!

               Nothing, except the wind.

               INT. ROYAL MAGISTRATE'S HEADQUARTERS - DAY

               Marion is thrown into a chair and her arms are bound with an 
               oak staff behind her elbows. She and two dozen soldiers are 
               in the tavern the English have commandeered.

               The Magistrate is a battlescarred veteran, a brutal pragmatist 
               angry with his CORPORAL.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         One Scot buggers six of us? Hell to 
                         pay when that gets round.

                                     CORPORAL
                         Burn the village.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         But he is free. You never catch 'em 
                         in the Highlands.

               He studies Marion, her mouth now stuffed with burlap. He 
               notices the strip of cloth around her neck, and touches the 
               weave curiously.

                                     CORPORAL
                         Clans weave that cloth in their own 
                         patterns.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         So why is this strip concealed?
                              (beat)
                         He fought for you, eh?

               EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

               The Magistrate and his men bring Marion into the village 
               center, and tie her to a post of the well. The townspeople 
               don't want to be near the soldiers, but they hang on the 
               fringes of the square, too curious to pull away.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         An assault on the king's soldiers is 
                         the same as assaulting the king!

               He looks down at Marion, her mouth bound, her eyes defiant.

               He jerks out his dagger and slices Marion's throat!

               Her eyes spring open like a doe's; then she sags, dead. The 
               townspeople are speechless; even some of the soldiers are 
               shocked. The Magistrate turns calmly to his men.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Now. Let this scrapper come to me.

               LONG SHOT - EXT. THE GROVE AT THE PRECIPICE - DAY

               From a distance, we see Hamish approaching the grove, the 
               same one where he and William played as boys. Hamish moves 
               reluctantly, forcing himself forward; as he reaches the grove, 
               William appears, hurrying out to him.

               We STAY IN THE LONG SHOT, seeing William asking anxiously 
               for any news, and seeing Hamish's great shoulders as he tells 
               him something that makes William step backwards...

               EXT. LANARK VILLAGE - DAY

               At a barrier across the main road into the center of the 
               village are twenty professional soldiers, entrenched, fully 
               armed -- bows, pikes, swords. They hear A HORSE'S SNORT...

               THE ENGLISH SOLDIERS' POV - WALLACE, ON HIS HORSE

               He has stopped, rock still. The soldiers hush; there is 
               something unsettling about this man alone, staring at the 
               twenty of them, as if to steel himself for the butchery.

               Wallace raises his sword, screams... and charges!

               EXT. VARIOUS ANGLES - LANARK VILLAGE - DAY - THE FIGHT

               We FAVOR WALLACE'S SUBJECTIVE POV: the barrier as his horse 
               pounds toward it, the faces of the enemy soldiers with their 
               eyes white with fear... They stand to shoot at him with their 
               bows; the arrows WHISH toward the lens, fly past...

               The arrows tear through Wallace's clothes, but don't catch 
               his flesh. He charges on; his horse LEAPS the barrier as 
               Wallace simultaneously swings the broadsword -- and he's 
               more than an expert: the tip, at the end of a huge arc, nearly 
               breaks the sound barrier and the blade bites through the 
               corporal's helmet, taking off the upper half of his head!

               The soldiers try to rally, to shoot him in the back as his 
               horse leaps over them. One of them has sighted William's 
               back... But Hamish and his father crash into them! It's a 
               wild fight; old Campbell takes an arrow through the shoulder 
               but keeps hacking with his sword; Hamish batters down two 
               men -- and more Scots arrive! They overwhelm the soldiers.

               WALLACE RACES THROUGH THE VILLAGE - FAVORING HIS POV

               He dodges obstacles in the narrow streets -- chickens, carts, 
               barrels. Soldiers pop up; the first he gallops straight over; 
               the next he whacks forehand, like a polo player; the next 
               chops down on his left side; every time he swings the 
               broadsword, a man dies.

               Wallace gallops on; his farmer neighbors, and people from 
               the village, follow in his wake.

               EXT. IN THE VILLAGE - DAY

               The Magistrate hears the APPROACHING SHOUTS. He and thirty 
               more of his men are barricaded around the village square.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Don't look surprised! We knew he'd 
                         bring friends!

               The see Wallace gallop into sight; but he stops, then heads 
               down a side street.

               The Magistrate and his men don't like this; where did he go?

               Which way will he come from? And then they hear the horses, 
               and see the other Scots, at the head of the main street. The 
               soldiers unleash a volley of arrows at them.

               They are loading to fire again when Wallace runs in -- on 
               foot! -- and cuts down two soldiers! The other Scots charge!

               The startled soldiers break and run in every direction.

               The Magistrate, abandoned, runs too. Wallace pursues.

               Not far along a twisting lane, the bulky Magistrate falters.

               He turns to fight, and Wallace slashes away his sword.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         No! I beg you... mercy!

               IN THE TOWN SQUARE

               As the Scots see Wallace, they break off pursuing the English 
               soldiers and stop to watch; dragging the Magistrate by his 
               hair, Wallace hauls him back into the village square, slams 
               him against the well, and stands over him with heaving lungs 
               and wild eyes, staring at Marion's murderer.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Please. Mercy!

               Wallace's eyes shift, falling on

               THE STAIN OF BLOOD

               Marion's blood, in a dark dry splash by the wall of the well, 
               the stain dripping down onto the dirt of the street. Wallace 
               spins, jerks back the Magistrate's head, and cuts his throat 
               with the sword.

               ON THE OTHER SCOTS

               Silenced by what they've just seen and done. On old Campbell's 
               face is a look of reverence, and awe.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Say Grace to God, lads. We've just 
                         seen the coming of the Messiah.

               William staggers a few steps, and collapses to his knees.

               And then not just the Scottish farmers but the townspeople 
               too begin a strange, Hi-Lo chant.

                                     CROWD
                         AHHHHHHH-UHHHHHH! AHHHHHH-UHHHHHH!

               William's wild eyes slowly regain their focus. And there in 
               the dirt beside the well, he sees the severed cloth strip he 
               gave to Marion, now stained with her blood. He lifts it, 
               crushes it in his hand, as the Highlanders chant for war.

               EXT. LANARK VILLAGE - NIGHT

               The villagers are still excited by what just happened; at 
               the blacksmith's forge, men tend to Campbell's wound...

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Pour it straight into the wound. I 
                         know it seems a waste of good whiskey, 
                         but indulge me.

               They obey, then take a glowing poker from the fire and run 
               it through Campbell's shoulder, where the arrow went. There 
               is a terrible SIZZLE, and Campbell reacts to the pain.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Ah. Now that'll clear your sinuses, 
                         lads.

               Campbell looks down at his left hand. His thumb is missing!

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Well bloody Hell, look at this! Now 
                         it's nothing but a fly swatter.

               Wallace is sitting alone nearby, staring at nothing. Hamish 
               moves over and puts a hand on his shoulder. Wallace looks at 
               his friend, and looks away; killing the Magistrate did not 
               bring Marion back.

               SHOUTS of alarm: ARMED MEN are coming! The farmers scramble 
               for their weapons, ready to fight; even Campbell jumps up; 
               but what they see coming out of the darkness are twenty more 
               farmers, with hayhooks, knives, axes, anything they could 
               find for weapons. Their leader is MacGREGOR.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         MacGregor -- from the next valley!

               MacGregor leads his men into the circle of rebels.

                                     MACGREGOR
                         We heard about what was happenin'. 
                         And we don't want ya thinkin' ya can 
                         have your fun without us.

                                     WALLACE
                         Go home. Some of us are in this, I 
                         can't help that now. But you can 
                         help yourselves. Go home.

                                     MACGREGOR
                         We'll have no homes left when the 
                         English garrison at the castle comes 
                         through to burn us out.

               They all look at Wallace.

               EXT. ENGLISH MILITARY STRONGHOLD - NIGHT

               Furious preparations: armorers pound breastplates, hone 
               spears, grind swords in a shower of sparks. The garrison is 
               led by BOTTOMS, the English lord who claimed the right of 
               prima noctes. Now he shouts to his scurrying soldiers.

                                     LORD BOTTOMS
                         Gather the horses! Align the infantry!
                              (grabs a man)
                         Ride to the Lord Governor in Stirling.

               Tell him that I will hang five rebels for every good 
               Englishman killed! FORM FOR MARCH!

               The troops begin to scramble into the courtyard. At the same 
               time, the messenger gallops to the gate and nods for the 
               keepers to open it. They pull up the chains and the heavy 
               gate rises. The messenger spurs his horse to gallop through -- 
               and is hit in the chest with an axe!

               The Scots, hidden just outside the gate, come pouring through, 
               led by Wallace! Arrows pick soldiers from their perches, 
               Scots drop over the wall; the surprise is so complete that 
               it's over almost without a fight. Lord Bottoms looks around 
               in confusion...

                                     LORD BOTTOMS
                         Stop them... Don't let... Align...

               Scots drag Lord Bottoms off his horse; an arrow in a flexed 
               bow jabs right up to his eye, the archer ready to drive the 
               shaft through Bottom's eye socket and into his brain; but 
               Wallace's hand closes on the archer's fingers -- and Bottoms 
               sees that the archer at the other end of the arrow shaft is 
               none other than the Highland farmgirl he forced into his bed 
               on her wedding night. Beside her is her husband, holding a 
               scythe, red with English blood.

                                     WALLACE
                         On your way somewhere, M'lord?

                                     LORD BOTTOMS
                         Murdering bloody bandit!

               The point of Wallace's sword jumps beneath the Lord's chin.

                                     WALLACE
                         My name is William Wallace. I am no 
                         bandit who hides his face... Find 
                         this man a horse.

               The green eyes of the defiled highland bride flash fire.

               William takes his hand from her bow and looks at her, grief 
               for Marion in his eyes; for the sake of that she does not 
               release the string.

                                     WALLACE
                         Give him a horse.

               Hamish extends the reins of the Lord's thoroughbred.

                                     WALLACE
                         Not this horse. That one.

               He nods to a bony nag hitched next to a glue pot.

                                     WALLACE
                         Today we will spare you, and every 
                         man who has yielded. Go back to 
                         England. Tell them Scotland's 
                         daughters and her sons are yours no 
                         more. Tell them Scotland is free.

               As the Scots cheer, Wallace throws Lord Bottoms onto the 
               nag's back and slaps the horse's rear. IT shambles away, 
               followed by the English survivors, as the Scots chant...

                                     SCOTS
                         Wal-lace, Wal-lace, Wal-lace!...

               CLOSE - A GRAVESTONE - EXT. HIGHLANDS - DAY

               The marker is carved with the name MARION MacCLANNOUGH, and 
               beneath her name A THISTLE is chiseled into the stone.

               Bagpipes wail like banshees and the Priest who married Marion 
               and William now mutters ancient prayers as her body, wrapped 
               in burial canvas, is lowered into the earth, under the sad 
               eyes of those who just fought in the battle.

               Opposite William stands old MacClannough; he stares across 
               the open hole that accepts the body of his daughter, his 
               eyes full of pain, and then staggers away.

               Wallace kneels at the graveside in unspeakable grief. From 
               within his shirt he withdraws the embroidered handkerchief 
               she gave him, and the bloodstained strip of cloth he gave 
               her. He places the strip over her heart, and as the 
               gravediggers fill the hole her returns the handkerchief to 
               its spot over his own heart.

               EXT. LONDON PALACE - DAY

               Prince Edward is in his garden, playing the medieval version 
               of croquet with his friend. The Princess, ignored, sits 
               watching. Longshanks marches through the game, furious.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Scottish rebels have routed Lord 
                         Bottoms!

                                     EDWARD
                         I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, 
                         nothing more.

               Longshanks slaps his son, knocking him down among the colored 
               balls and wickets. Everyone gasps, stunned.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         You weak little coward! Stand up!

               Longshanks jerks him to his feet.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         I go to France to press our rights 
                         there! I leave you to handle this 
                         little rebellion, do you understand? 
                         DO YOU?!

               Longshanks grabs his son by the throat.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         And turn yourself into a man.

               The king leaves. The friends of the humiliated Prince hurry 
               to him and lift him; as the Princess moves to him too...

                                     EDWARD
                         Get away from me!

               He slaps her! Her personal guards, Frenchmen in distinctive 
               uniforms, jump from their seats at the edge of the garden, 
               but the Princess raises a hand to show she needs no 
               assistance, and curtseys to Edward, who shouts --

                                     EDWARD
                         Convene my military council!

               As Edward marches off with his entourage, NICOLETTE, a 
               beautiful raven-haired Handmaiden, rushes to the Princess, 
               who is wobbly, hurt more than she let show. Nicolette whispers 
               to her in French, with subtitles...

                                     NICOLETTE
                         They say this Wallace killed thirty 
                         men to avenge the death of his woman. 
                         I hope your husband goes to Scotland. 
                         Then you'll be a widow.

               INT. BRUCE'S CASTLE - BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

               Robert the Bruce is in bed with a young Nordic beauty with 
               vacant blue eyes. She drowses; but the lovemaking has not 
               defused the restlessness of Robert's spirit. He lies on his 
               stomach, turned away from her on the bed. Stirring, she kisses 
               his neck; but he doesn't respond.

                                     WOMAN
                         I wanted to please you.

                                     ROBERT
                         You did.

               But he is numb as she nuzzles him again. She sags back, and 
               he still stares away, lost in thought. Realizing her hurt, 
               he explains...

                                     ROBERT
                         In Lanark village, the king's soldiers 
                         killed a girl. Her lover fought his 
                         way through the soldiers and killed 
                         the magistrate.

               She looks at him blankly.

                                     ROBERT
                         He rebelled. He rebelled. He acted. 
                         He fought! Was it rage? Pride? Love? 
                         Whatever it was, he has more of it 
                         than I.

                                     WOMAN
                              (hurt)
                         You might have lied.

                                     ROBERT
                         I'm too arrogant to lie.

               CLOSE - ROBERT THE BRUCE

               On his FACE as he moves grimly up a dark castle staircase.

               He follows a servant who carries a candle against the gloom.

               They reach a door, which the servant unlocks. Young Robert 
               takes the candle, and enters --

               A DARKENED ROOM

               Robert wills himself forward, and places the candle on a 
               table in the center of the room. A SHUFFLE in the dark; then 
               moving into the light is a LEPER whose once-noble features 
               are decaying with the disease. Isolated in his disfiguration, 
               he looks at his visitor -- his son -- with the eyes of the 
               condemned. Young Robert forces himself not to look away.

                                     ROBERT THE BRUCE
                         Father. A rebellion has begun.

                                     THE LEPER
                         Under whom?

                                     ROBERT
                         A commoner named William Wallace.

                                     THE LEPER
                         A commoner? So no one leads Scotland?

               The old man thinks, and points a half finger at his son.

                                     THE LEPER
                         You will embrace this rebellion. 
                         Support it, from our lands in the 
                         north. I will gain English favor by 
                         condemning it and ordering it opposed 
                         from our lands in the south. Whichever 
                         way the tide runs, we will rise.

                                     ROBERT
                         This Wallace. He doesn't even have a 
                         knighthood. But he fights with 
                         passion, and he is clever. He inspires 
                         men.

                                     THE LEPER
                         You admire him. Uncompromising men 
                         are easy to admire. He has courage. 
                         So does a dog. But you must understand 
                         this: Edward Longshanks is the most 
                         ruthless king ever to sit on the 
                         throne of England, and none of us, 
                         and nothing of Scotland, will survive 
                         unless we are as ruthless, more 
                         ruthless, than he.

               Young Bruce rises heavily, and moves to the door.

                                     THE LEPER
                         Press your case to the nobles. They 
                         will choose who rules Scotland.

               With a last long look at his father, Robert leaves.

               EXT. SCOTLAND - MONTAGE - DAY

               -- Troops ride through the countryside, intimidating and 
               questioning civilians; all refuse to talk.

               -- Wallace's house burns, as soldiers dig up the graves of 
               his father and brother, and scatter their bones to dogs.

               -- The English search through the woods, finding nothing.

               EXT. WALLACE LANDS - NIGHT

               William and Hamish ride, to see the damage. They find the 
               smoking ruins, and the defiled family graves.

                                     HAMISH
                         Ah, William... I am so sorry.

               William is struck by an awful, urgent thought...

               EXT. UNDERBRUSH NEAR MARION'S GRAVE - DUSK

               We open on Marion's grave, with the thistle-carved marker, 
               looking peaceful; but up the hill in the underbrush, English 
               soldiers wait in ambush. Edgy, they perk up at the sound of 
               muffled hoofbeats -- then their eyes bug as a cloaked figure -- 
               Wallace -- suddenly looms up behind them, galloping and 
               swirling fire! He hurls burning torches into the clustered 
               soldiers, setting some of them on fire!

               MEANWHILE, HAMISH has crawled to Marion's grave and is digging 
               frantically. The new dirt parts easily and he pulls the 
               shrouded body out, cringing with the effort.

               MORE SOLDIERS rush from behind the rocks at the far side of 
               the graveyard. Wallace charges them, driving them back. He 
               grabs the reins of Hamish's horse, hidden among trees, and 
               gallops to him.

               Hamish hands the shrouded body up to William and bounds into 
               the saddle of his own horse. They spur the horses and ride 
               away, William clutching Marion's shrouded body to his chest.

               EXT. SECRET GROVE ON THE PRECIPICE - NIGHT

               William dismounts, stretching the body gently on the ground.

               Hamish dismounts too, with the spade he used to dig up the 
               old grave. He sees the emotion on William's face.

                                     HAMISH
                         I'll wait... back there.

                                     WALLACE
                         Hamish, I... thank...

               Hamish puts a hand on his friend's shoulder, then quietly 
               leads the horses away. William starts to dig...

               LATER IN THE GROVE

               William sits looking at the new grave, covered with leaves -- 
               completely hidden. He touches his hand to the earth.

               EXT. WOODS - BY THE STREAM - NIGHT

               Hamish is waiting as William comes out of the grove. There 
               is nothing to say. They mount their horses and ride away, as 
               the MUSIC of William and Marion's love haunts us...

               EXT. WOODS - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

               Wallace and his inner circle hare huddled around a small 
               fire. Other highlanders guard the perimeters. Old Campbell 
               is lovingly honing the broadswords to razor edges and sharing 
               a whiskey jug with Hamish, who stares at the fire. Wallace 
               is using a stick to draw diagrams in the dirt.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         What're ya doin'?

                                     WALLACE
                         Thinking.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Does it hurt?

                                     WALLACE
                         What do we do when Longshanks sends 
                         his whole northern army against us? 
                         They have heavy cavalry. Armored 
                         horses, that shake the very ground. 
                         They'll ride right over us.

               At a loss, Wallace looks up at the sky. HE SEES: the trees 
               stretching into the night like spikes to skewer the stars.

                                     WALLACE
                         We make spears. A hundred spears. 
                         Fourteen feet long.

                                     HAMISH
                         Fourteen? --

                                     SENTRY (O.S.)
                         Volunteers coming in!

               They look to see a half dozen new volunteers being led in, 
               blindfolded. When the guides remove the blindfolds, the new 
               recruits see Wallace and rush to him, bowing.

                                     RECRUIT (FAUDRON)
                         William Wallace? We have come to 
                         fight and die for you!

                                     WALLACE
                         Stand up, man, I'm not the Pope.

                                     FAUDRON
                         I am Faudron! My sword is yours! And 
                         I brought you this tarta --

               As he reaches into his cloak, both Hamish and Campbell 
               instantly draw their swords and put the points to his neck.

                                     SENTRY
                         We checked them for arms.

               Carefully, Faudron pulls out a beautiful tartan scarf, and 
               replaces Wallace's tattered old one.

                                     FAUDRON
                         It's your family tartan! My wife 
                         wove it with her own hands.

                                     WALLACE
                         Thank her for me.

               A loud voice interrupts...

                                     VOICE
                         Him? That can't be William Wallace! 
                         I'm prettier than this man!

               They all look at a slender, handsome young man, STEPHEN, who 
               is talking to himself -- or more accurately, seems to listen 
               to some unheard voice, then answer it...

                                     STEPHEN
                         All right, Father, I'll ask him!
                              (to William)
                         If I risk my neck for you, will I 
                         get a chance to kill Englishmen?

                                     HAMISH
                         Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you 
                         converse with God Almighty?

                                     STEPHEN
                         In order to find his equal, and 
                         Irishman is forced to talk to God.
                              (quickly)
                         Yes, Father!...
                              (to Wallace)
                         The Almighty says don't change the 
                         subject, just answer the fookin' 
                         question.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Insane Irish --

               Stephen whips a dagger from his sleeve and puts it at 
               Campbell's throat.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Smart enough to get a dagger past 
                         your guards, old man.

               Wallace jerks his sword to the Irishman's throat, and grins.

                                     WALLACE
                         That's my friend, Irishman. And the 
                         answer's yes. You fight for me, you 
                         kill the English.

               Stephen grins, and happily tucks away the dagger.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm 
                         the most wanted man on the Emerald 
                         Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald 
                         Isle of course, more's the pity.

                                     HAMISH
                         A common thief.

                                     STEPHEN
                         A patriot!

               Wallace shakes his head and moves back to the fire, as the 
               sentries take the newcomers to find their own spaces.

               EXT. SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               A column of English light cavalry -- a hundred riders -- 
               moves through the picturesque beauty of the Highlands.

               English LORD DOLECROFT is in command, wearing a hat with a 
               pompous white plume. UP AHEAD, the English SCOUT sees five 
               Scots, including Hamish, walking out of the forest. The Scots 
               run; the Scout rides back to Dolecroft.

                                     SCOUT
                         Scotsmen, Sire! Headed west!

                                     DOLECROFT
                         They've blundered at last! After 
                         them!

               The English force charges off. Hamish and his men changed 
               direction but the English spot them crossing a hilltop and 
               ride after them. The Scots run for their lives; the English 
               horses gallop. The Scots run down one slope, up another; the 
               English follow, find their horses stumbling, and see...

                                     SCOUT
                         We're in a bog!

                                     DOLECROFT
                         Here, it's firm this way --

               But as they move toward the firm ground, fifty Scots appear 
               on the crest of the hill. Hamish leads them, smiling.

               Dolecroft wheels and looks to his rear; Wallace appears there, 
               with fifty more, and more Scots appear to the left and right 
               of the English, who are surrounded in the bog. Too late, 
               Dolecroft realizes his blunder. Wallace lifts his broadsword, 
               screams, and leads the charge...

               EXT. SCOTTISH WOODS - DAY

               The Scots are moving through deep woods; they are laden with 
               the booty they took from the English cavalry: extra weapons, 
               clothing, food -- and one man even wears the late Dolecroft's 
               plumed hat. Wallace is leading them, traveling with his heavy 
               sheathed broadsword across his shoulders.

                                     WALLACE
                         Stop here and rest.

               They collapse to the leaves and loam, greedily squeezing 
               water from sheep belly canteens.

               INT. STIRLING CASTLE - DAY

               LORD PICKERING, English commander, is handed news of the 
               disaster. He reads the message, and pales.

                                     PICKERING
                         Another ambush! My God! ...What about 
                         our infiltrator?

                                     ASSISTANT
                         He has already joined them, M'lord.

               EXT. SCOTTISH WOODS - NIGHT

               The moon is high above the Scots, encamped for the night.

               Most everyone is sleeping, but William sits leaning against 
               a tree, lost in lonely thoughts. Suddenly William freezes; a 
               shaft of moonlight illuminates a cloaked woman standing twenty 
               feet ahead of him. Something about her is familiar -- and 
               then she pulls off the hood, revealing her auburn hair, 
               cascading in the moonlight... It is Marion!

                                     WALLACE
                         Marion! Is... is it you?

               Joy explodes on his face, and he runs to her, but stops before 
               he touches her, as if she might evaporate.

                                     WALLACE
                         I'm dreaming.

                                     MARION
                         Yes, you are. And you must wake.

                                     WALLACE
                         I don't want to wake. I want to stay 
                         with you.

                                     MARION
                         And I with you. But you must wake.

                                     WALLACE
                         I need you so much! I love you!

                                     MARION
                         Wake up, William. Wake up!

                                     HAMISH'S VOICE
                         Wake up, William!...

                                     MARION/HAMISH
                         Wake up!...

               William clutches at Marion, but his arms can't enclose her.

               HE WAKES

               lying on his new tartan, in camp, with Hamish shaking him, 
               William's arms clutched empty to his chest.

                                     HAMISH
                         William! Hounds!

               Wallace jumps up, hearing the DISTANT BARKING that alarmed 
               Hamish. Stephen, the new Irish recruit, races up.

                                     STEPHEN
                         We must run in different directions!

                                     HAMISH
                         We don't split up!

                                     STEPHEN
                         They used hounds on us in Ireland, 
                         it's the only way!

                                     WALLACE
                         He's right, Hamish! Campbell! Divide 
                         them and run!

               Shoving groups of men in different directions, Wallace then 
               takes off. His group is about a dozen; they race through the 
               woods, dodging trees, running aimlessly. They stop and listen. 
               The BARKS are getting closer.

                                     WALLACE
                         Split again!

               Again they divide, and race in different directions.

               But no matter how they run and dodge, the BARKS grow nearer.

               We INTERCUT with the approaching of the dogs -- a large PACK 
               OF HOUNDS, with keepers like on a fox hunt, and behind the 
               dogs, Lord Pickering, with his soldiers, prepared for a long 
               chase, cloaked against the wet darkness, carrying torches.

               Wallace and others pause, hear the dogs, and run again, in a 
               new direction. The hounds are relentless. Wallace's group is 
               down to Hamish, Stephen, and Faudron.

                                     WALLACE
                         No matter how we go, they follow. 
                         They have our scent. My scent.

                                     FAUDRON
                         Run! You must not be caught!

               Faster now, faster. The barks are getting very close.

               Wallace and his friends are starting to panic. The blood 
               beats in their ears, their breath scalds their lungs. And we 
               MOVE IN on Wallace's eyes. He stops, gasping.

                                     STEPHEN
                         We can't stop!

                                     WALLACE
                         They've tricked us.

                                     STEPHEN
                         What's the crazy man saying, Lord?

                                     WALLACE
                         The dogs have a scent. My scent. 
                         Someone must have given it to them.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Who would do such a thing?

                                     WALLACE
                         Exactly.

               Wallace pulls out his dagger...

               THE DOGS

               bark frantically now; they smell a kill; they tug so hard at 
               their leashes that the handlers are almost dragged along.

                                     HANDLER
                         Be ready! We have them!

               The soldiers grip their weapons, ready to take their 
               prisoners. They burst into the little clearing; the dogs 
               find a body, stabbed, his throat cut; the dogs plunge their 
               snouts into the gore, yipping wildly. The handlers must fight 
               furiously to tear the dogs from the body.

               Lord Pickering approaches the body and looks down. It is 
               Faudron, mangled now but clearly identifiable -- with the 
               scarf he gave William, in place of William's own, tucked 
               into his shirt.

                                     LORD PICKERING
                         Damnation! Damnation!

               As Pickering rants, his men look at the darkness all around.

                                     LORD PICKERING
                         After him! Get them going again!

                                     HANDLER
                         Their noses are drowned in new blood, 
                         they'll follow nothing now!

               And just as the realization hits Pickering that he can't 
               pursue Wallace any further, a cloaked figure mixed in among 
               his men leans in from behind him to whisper...

                                     STEPHEN OF IRELAND
                         The Almighty says for you to give 
                         His regards to the Devil.

               Pickering's eyes go wide, then roll back as Stephen's dagger 
               slides expertly through his back ribs and into his heart. As 
               Pickering falls and his men realize what has happened, Stephen 
               has already run back into the trees.

               Pickering's men freeze at this sudden turn of events. Even 
               the dogs whimper, picking up the rising fear of the men around 
               them. Then from the darkness all around them comes a chorus 
               of demonic, bloodcurdling yells --

                                     WALLACE/HAMISH/STEPHEN
                         ARRRRRGGGGGGGHHHH!

               Three wild men tear out of the darkness from different 
               directions, their swords slashing. Pickering's men panic and 
               run, their dogs yelping, and the other soldiers, evident by 
               their torches, fell with them in all directions.

               Wallace, Hamish and Stephen are left alone in the heart of 
               the woods, howling, barking like dogs, snarling like wolves -- 
               and then laughing like hyenas!

                                     STEPHEN
                         I thought I was dead when ya pulled 
                         that dagger!

                                     WALLACE
                         No English lord would trust an 
                         Irishman!

                                     HAMISH
                         Let's kill him anyway.

               They laugh again; then Wallace's laughter leaks away, and he 
               stares into the trees, where he saw Marion in his dream.

               VARIOUS SHOTS - THE STORY SPREADS THROUGH SCOTLAND...

               Two men are talking in A VILLAGE...

                                     VILLAGER
                         ...and William Wallace killed fifty 
                         men! Fifty, if it was one!

               The same tale is exchanged by two farmers AT A CROSSROADS...

                                     FARMER
                         A hundred men! With his own sword! 
                         He cut a through the English like --

               The tale is repeated IN A TAVERN...

                                     DRINKER
                         -- Moses through the Red Sea! Hacked 
                         off two hundred heads!

                                     DRINKER #2
                         Two hundred?!

                                     DRINKER
                         Saw it with my own eyes.

               And the rumors are discussed even INSIDE THE PALACE GROUNDS 
               IN LONDON, where the Prince and his friends are trying on 
               elaborate attire presented them by fawning tailors, and the 
               Princess, ignored by her husband, strolls and chats with her 
               Handmaiden, Nicolette (in subtitled French).

                                     NICOLETTE
                         When the king returns he will bury 
                         them in those new clothes. Scotland 
                         is in chaos. Your husband is secretly 
                         sending an army north.

                                     PRINCESS
                         How do you know this?

                                     NICOLETTE
                         Last night I slept with a member of 
                         the War Council.

                                     PRINCESS
                         He shouldn't be telling secrets in 
                         bed.

                                     NICOLETTE
                         Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what 
                         a tongue is for.

               The Princess blushes, whacks her with her fan, and smiles.

                                     PRINCESS
                         This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He 
                         fights to avenge a woman?

                                     NICOLETTE
                         A magistrate wished to capture him, 
                         and found he had a secret lover, so 
                         he cut the girl's throat to tempt 
                         Wallace to fight -- and fight he 
                         did.

               The Princess is pained at such cruelty; Nicolette warms to 
               share the juicy gossip...

                                     NICOLETTE
                         Knowing his passion for his lost 
                         love, they next plotted to take him 
                         by desecrating the graves of his 
                         father and brother and setting an 
                         ambush at the grave of his wife. He 
                         fought his way through the trap and 
                         carried her body to a secret place! 
                         Now that is romance, Oui?

                                     PRINCESS
                         ...I wouldn't know.

               EXT. SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - DAY

               A Highlander, a RUNNER, slips like a shadow up the hillside, 
               to a circle of ancient monoliths. There, hidden among the 
               stone pillars, he finds Wallace and his band resting.

                                     RUNNER
                         The English are advancing an army 
                         toward Stirling!

                                     WALLACE
                         Do the nobles rally?

                                     RUNNER
                         Robert the Bruce and most of the 
                         others will not commit to war! But 
                         word has spread and Highlanders are 
                         coming down on their own, by the 
                         hundreds -- by the thousands!

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               Wallace rides down the road, followed by his band. As they 
               pass people on the road, the women, the children, all cheer.

                                     PEOPLE
                         Wallace! It's William Wallace! God 
                         bless Wallace and Scotland!

               At a crossroads, more of Wallace's men join them, in clusters. 
               One group carries something long, encased in wool covers. 
               Farmers in the field, blacksmiths at their forges, leave 
               their work and uncover their inevitable weapons and run after 
               the riders. They put on their forbidden tartans, kiss their 
               wives and head off to fight.

               EXT. STIRLING FIELD - DAY

               Stirling Castle perches on a hill high above a grassy field, 
               cut in half by a river, spanned by an old wooden bridge.

               SCOTTISH NOBLES have gathered on a smaller hill overlooking 
               the field; they wear gleaming armor, with plumes, sashes and 
               banners, and are attended by squires and grooms.

               The mists of morning shroud most of the field. But from the 
               opposite side of the bridge they hear the CLATTERING of a 
               huge army moving forward. LOCHLAN, a noble, gallops to Mornay.

                                     LOCHLAN
                         It sounds like twenty thousand!

                                     MORNAY
                         The scouts say it is ten.

                                     LOCHLAN
                         And we have but two!

               THE COMMON SCOTTISH SOLDIERS

               are wearing padded leather shirts, and carry pikes and 
               daggers. As through the mists they see the numbers arrayed 
               against them, a YOUNG SOLDIER tugs at a grizzled VETERAN.

                                     YOUNG SOLDIER
                         So many!

                                     SCOTTISH VETERAN
                         The nobles will negotiate. If they 
                         deal, they send us home. If not, we 
                         charge. When we are all dead and 
                         they can call themselves brave, they 
                         withdraw.

                                     YOUNG SOLDIER
                         I didn't come to fight so they could 
                         own more lands that I could work for 
                         them!

                                     VETERAN
                         Nor did I. Not against these odds!

               He lowers his pike and starts to desert. At first one-by-one 
               and then in clumps, more highlanders follow.

               THE NOBLES see the desertion.

                                     LOCHLAN
                         Stop! Men! Do not flee! Not now! 
                         Wait until we have negotiated!

                                     MORNAY
                         They won't stop -- and who could 
                         blame them?

               Then, riding into the mob of men, comes Wallace, followed by 
               his friends. He's striking, charismatic, his powerful arms 
               bare, his chest covered not in armor but a commoner's leather 
               shirt, and unlike the heavy knights on their armored horses, 
               Wallace rides a swift horse, like he was born on it.

               The entire Scottish army watches in fascination as Wallace 
               and his men ride through them, toward the command hill. The 
               soldiers whisper among themselves...

                                     YOUNG SOLDIER
                         William Wallace?

                                     VETERAN
                         Couldn't be.

               The common soldiers, already having broken ranks, cluster up 
               the hill to see the confrontation. As Wallace and his captains 
               reach the nobles, Stephen laughs.

                                     STEPHEN
                         The Almighty says this must be a 
                         fashionable fight, it's drawn the 
                         finest people.

                                     LOCHLAN
                         Where is thy salute?

                                     WALLACE
                         For presenting yourselves on this 
                         battlefield, I give you thanks.

                                     LOCHLAN
                         This is our army. To join it, you 
                         give homage.

                                     WALLACE
                         I give homage to Scotland. And if 
                         this is your army, why does it go?

               Wallace reins his horse around to face the mob of sullen 
               men, now frightened, ready to desert. We play this picture, 
               Wallace sitting his horse, looking down in awe at this thing 
               that has grown beyond anyone's imagination.

               He glances at his friends: Campbell, Hamish, Stephen.

               They've got no suggestions, they're just as awed as he is.

                                     SCOTTISH VETERAN
                         We didn't come to fight for them!

                                     SHOUTS FROM MOB
                         Home! The English are too many!

               Wallace raises his hand, and the army falls silent.

                                     WALLACE
                         Sons of Scotland!... I am William 
                         Wallace!

                                     SOLDIER
                         William Wallace is seven feet tall!

                                     WALLACE
                         Yes, I have heard! He kills men by 
                         the hundreds! And if he were here, 
                         he would consume the English with 
                         fireballs from his eyes, and bolts 
                         of lightning from his ass!

               Many laugh -- all get the point.

                                     WALLACE
                         I am William Wallace. And my enemies 
                         do not go away. I saw our good nobles 
                         hanged. My wife... I am William 
                         Wallace. And I see a whole army of 
                         my countrymen, here in defiance of 
                         tyranny. You have come to fight as 
                         free men. And free men you are! What 
                         will you do with freedom? Will you 
                         fight?

                                     VETERAN
                         Two thousand, against ten? We will 
                         run -- and live!

                                     WALLACE
                         Yes. Fight and you may die. Run and 
                         you will live, at least awhile. And 
                         dying in your bed many years from 
                         now, would you be willing to trade 
                         all the days from this day to that, 
                         for one chance to come back here as 
                         young men, and tell our enemies that 
                         they make take our lives, but they 
                         will never take our freedom?

               Down on the plain, English emissaries in all their regal 
               finery gallop over the bridge, under a banner of truce.

                                     VETERAN
                         Look! The English comes to barter 
                         with our nobles for castles and 
                         titles. And our nobles will not be 
                         in the front of the battle!

                                     WALLACE
                         No! They will not!

               He dismounts, and draws his sword.

                                     WALLACE
                         And I will.

               Slowly, the chant begins, and builds...

                                     SCOTS
                         Wal-lace! Wal-lace! WAL-LACE!

               BAGPIPERS play, pulling the mob back into companies. But 
               through the lifting mists they see the overwhelming enemy 
               army. Hamish, Campbell and Stephen move up beside William.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Fine speech. Now what do we do?

                                     WALLACE
                         Bring out our spearmen and set them 
                         in the field.

               Campbell, Hamish and Stephen ride off. Mornay reins his horse 
               over, lifts the reins of Wallace's horse, and extends them 
               to him: an invitation to join the pre-battle talks.

               Wallace mounts up and rides out with the Scottish nobles to 
               meet the English contingent.

               OUT ON THE FIELD, THE TWO GROUPS OF RIDERS

               meet like the captains of football teams before the kickoff. 
               CHELTHAM, head of the English contingent, glares at Wallace.

                                     CHELTHAM
                         Mornay. Lochlan. Inverness.

                                     MORNAY
                         Cheltham. This is William Wallace

                                     CHELTHAM
                         Here are the King's terms. Lead this 
                         army off the field, and he will give 
                         you each estates in Yorkshire, 
                         including hereditary title, from 
                         which you will pay him an annual --

                                     WALLACE
                         I have an offer for you.

                                     CHELTHAM
                         ...From which you will pay the King 
                         an annual duty...

               Wallace pulls his broadsword and snaps it at Cheltham, whose 
               eyes flash in disbelief at the bad manners.

                                     LOCHLAN
                         You disrespect a banner of truce?!

                                     WALLACE
                         From his king? Absolutely. Here are 
                         Scotland's terms. Lower your flags 
                         and march straight to England, 
                         stopping at every Scottish home you 
                         pass to beg forgiveness for a hundred 
                         years of theft, rape, and murder. Do 
                         that, and your men shall live. Do it 
                         not, and every one of you will die 
                         today.

               Cheltham barks at the Scottish nobles...

                                     CHELTHAM
                         You are outmatched! You haven't even 
                         any cavalry! In two centuries no 
                         army has won without it!

                                     WALLACE
                         I'm not finished. Before we let you 
                         leave, your commander must cross 
                         that bridge, stand before this army, 
                         put his head between his legs, and 
                         kiss his own ass.

               The outraged Englishman gallops back to his lines.

                                     MORNAY
                         I'd say that was rather less cordial 
                         that he was used to.

                                     WALLACE
                         Be ready, and do exactly as I say.

               They return to the Scottish lines. Wallace dismounts where 
               his men are breaking out new 14-foot spears. Hamish, eyebrows 
               raised, looks expectantly at Wallace; Wallace nods.

                                     HAMISH
                         Wish I could see the noble lord's 
                         face when he tells him.

               LORD TALMADGE, AT HIS COMMAND POST

               The husky English commander's blood boils from Cheltham's 
               report. Before he can respond, they see WALLACE'S SPEARMEN 
               taking up a position on the far side of the bridge. Suddenly 
               the Scots turn and lift their kilts and moon the English!

                                     TALMADGE
                         Insolent bastard! Full attack! Give 
                         no quarter! And I want this Wallace's 
                         heart brought to me on a plate!

               Cheltham spurs his horse to form up the attack...

               EXT. THE FIELD BELOW STIRLING CASTLE - DAY

               The English army moves forward toward the bridge. It's so 
               narrow that only a single file of riders can move across it 
               at any one time. The English heavy cavalry, two hundred 
               knights, cross uncontested, and form up on the other side.

               WITH WALLACE AND THE SCOTS

               Things look terrible. Stephen turns to William.

                                     STEPHEN
                         The Lord tell me He can get me out 
                         of this mess. But He's pretty sure 
                         you're fooked.

               ON THE ENGLISH SIDE

               Talmadge sees the Scots doing nothing.

                                     TALMADGE
                         Amateurs! They do not even contest 
                         us! Send across the infantry.

                                     GENERAL
                         M'lord, the bridge is so narrow --

                                     TALMADGE
                         The Scots just stand in their 
                         formations!

               Our cavalry will ride them down like grass. Get the infantry 
               across so they can finish the slaughter!

               The English leaders shout orders and keep their men moving 
               across the bridge. Talmadge gestures for the attack flag.

               THE CAVALRY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE

               The English knights see the signal banners, telling them to 
               attack. They take the lances from their squires, and lower 
               the visors of their helmets. Proud, plumed, glimmering; they 
               look invincible. Their huge horses, themselves draped in 
               scarlet and purple, look like tanks. The knights charge!

               Their hooves THUNDER; the horses are so heavy the ground 
               literally shakes with the charge.

               The Scots stand and watch them come on. It's difficult to 
               imagine the courage this takes; from the POV OF THE SCOTTISH 
               LINES we see the massive horses boring in... we feel the 
               RISING THUNDER of the charge, closer, closer...

               Wallace moves to the front of the lead group of Scots.

                                     WALLACE
                         Steady! Hold... hold... NOW!

               The Scots snap their 14-foot spears straight up in unison.

                                     WALLACE
                         FORM!

               Now the spearmen snap the spears forward in ranks, the first 
               line of men bracing their spears at an angle three feet above 
               the ground, the men behind them bracing theirs at a five 
               foot level, the men behind that bracing at seven feet.

               The English knights have never seen such a formation. Their 
               lances are useless and it's too late to stop! The momentum 
               that was to carry the horses smashing through the men on 
               foot now becomes suicidal force; knights and horses impale 
               themselves on the long spears like beef on skewers.

               TALMADGE

               can see it; but worse is the SOUND, the SCREAMS OF DYING MEN 
               AND HORSES, carried to him across the battlefield.

               WALLACE AND HIS MEN

               are protected, behind a literal wall of fallen chargers and 
               knights. Wallace draws his broadsword and leads his swordsmen 
               out onto the field, attacking the knights that are still 
               alive. Most are off their horses; a few have managed to pull 
               up their mounts. Wallace and his men are so much more mobile 
               than the knights; the field runs with blood.

               Wallace faces Talmadge in the distance.

                                     WALLACE
                         Here I am, English coward! Come get 
                         me!!

               TALMADGE is even more enraged -- and his judgment is gone.

                                     TALMADGE
                         Press the men across!

                                     CHELTHAM
                         But M'lord!

               Talmadge himself gallops forward.

                                     TALMADGE
                         PRESS THEM!

               WALLACE smiles. He grabs Hamish.

                                     WALLACE
                         Tell Mornay to ride to the flank and 
                         cross upstream. Wait! Tell him to be 
                         sure the English see him ride away!

               Hamish hurries off with the message.

               The English infantry keeps moving across the little bridge.

               The Scottish nobles watch from their positions on horseback.

               They have a few dozen mounted riders, none heavily armored.

                                     LOCHLAN
                         If he waits much longer --

               Hamish hurries up.

                                     HAMISH
                         Ride around and ford behind them!

                                     MORNAY
                         We should not divide our forces!

                                     HAMISH
                         Wallace says do it! And he says for 
                         you to let the English see you!

                                     MORNAY
                              (understanding)
                         They shall think we run away.

               Mornay leads his riders away.

               LORD TALMADGE

               sees the Scottish nobles ride off, and shouts to Cheltham...

                                     TALMADGE
                         See! Every Scot with a horse is 
                         fleeing! Hurry! Hurry!

               He drives half his army across the river.

               WALLACE

               lifts his sword.

                                     WALLACE
                         For Scotland!

               He charges down the hill...

               THE FIGHT AT STIRLING BRIDGE - VARIOUS SHOTS

               The Scots follow Wallace on foot, charging into the English.

               The English leaders are stunned by the ferocious attack.

                                     TALMADGE
                         Press reinforcements across!

               The English leaders try to herd more of their footsoldiers 
               onto the bridge, which only hams them up. Meanwhile, on the 
               other side of the bridge, Wallace and his charging men slam 
               into the English infantry with wild fury. The English fall 
               back on each other, further blocking the bridge.

               UP ON THE HILLTOP

               The nobles look back with grudging admiration.

                                     MORNAY
                         He's taking the bloody bridge! The 
                         English can't get across! He's evened 
                         the odds at one stroke!

               With rising desire to join the bandwagon, the nobles spur...

               DOWN ON THE PLAIN, Wallace and the attacking men drive the 
               English back, killing as they go. The Scots reach the bridge 
               itself. The waters below it run red with blood.

               Talmadge has begun to panic.

                                     TALMADGE
                         Use the archers!

                                     GENERAL
                         They're too close, we'll shoot out 
                         own men!

               ON THE BRIDGE

               the Scots are carving their way through the English soldiers; 
               nothing can stop them. Wallace is relentless; each time he 
               swings, a head flies, or an arm. Hamish and Stephen fight 
               beside him, swinging the broadsword with both hands. Old 
               Campbell loses his shield in the grappling; an English 
               swordsman whacks at him and takes off his left hand, but 
               Campbell batters him to the ground with his right, and stabs 
               him. Reaching the English side of the bridge, the Scots begin 
               to build a barrier with the dead bodies.

               The English are not without courage. Cheltham leads a 
               desperate counterattack. The Scots make an impenetrable 
               barrier of slashing blades. Still Cheltham keeps coming; 
               Wallace hits him with a vertical slash that parts his helmet, 
               his hair, and his brain.

               TALMADGE has seen enough; he gallops away. The remaining 
               English General tries to save the army.

                                     GENERAL
                         We are still five thousand! Rally!

               The English try to form up; but the Scottish horsemen, fording 
               the river high upstream, come crashing into the English flank 
               and ride over the surprised English infantry.

               AT THE BRIDGE, WALLACE

               sees the Scottish nobles attacking. The English soldiers are 
               in utter panic, running and being cut down on all sides.

               And the Scottish soldiers taste something Scots have not 
               tasted for a hundred years: victory. Even while finishing 
               off the last of the English soldiers, they begin their highlow 
               chant... Even the noblemen take up the chant!

               Wallace looks around at the aftermath of the battle: bodies 
               on the field; soldiers lying impaled; stacks of bodies on 
               the bridge; the bridge slick with blood.

               Before it can all sink in, William is lifted on the shoulders 
               of his men.

                                     SCOTTISH SOLDIERS
                         Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace!

               INT. CASTLE - GREAT HALL - DAY

               William kneels before one of Scotland's ancient elders, who 
               lifts a silver sword and dubs William's shoulders.

                                     ELDER
                         I knight thee Sir William Wallace.

               William rises and faces the Great Hall, crowded with hundreds 
               of new admirers, as well as his old friends in their new 
               clothes and armor. The crowd chants --

                                     CROWD
                         Wal-lace, Wal-lace!!

               Wallace lifts his eyes, taking it all in. At the rear of the 
               hall is a balcony, backed by a magnificent sunlit stained 
               glass window, and in the center of its rainbow corona he 
               sees a familiar form: Marion, so real to him in this moment 
               of triumph that he can see her, glowing like an angel, in a 
               gown worthy of the occasion. But the illusion won't last; in 
               the blink of an eye she is gone, and Wallace hears the chant, 
               and fingers the cloth she gave him.

               INT. SCOTTISH COUNCIL - DAY

               The nobles of Scotland are gathered in the huge chamber; a 
               massive table runs across the far end of the room, and aligned 
               on either side are the two rival factions of nobles, glaring 
               at each other. Old Craig is in the center, with young Robert 
               the Bruce on his right. There is a general MURMUR along the 
               nobles, and Robert whispers to Craig...

                                     ROBERT
                         Does anyone know his politics?

                                     CRAIG
                         No. But his weight with the commoners 
                         could unbalance everything. The 
                         Balliols will kiss his ass, so we 
                         must.

               A court STEWARDS steps in and formally announces...

                                     STEWARD
                         Lords of Scotland: Sir William 
                         Wallace!

               The nobles on each side of the table try to outdo each other 
               in their acclamation as Wallace strides in, flanked by Hamish, 
               Campbell, and Stephen, splendid in their tartans.

               Old Craig rises.

                                     CRAIG
                         Sir William. In the name of God, we 
                         declare and appoint thee High 
                         Protector of Scotland! And thy 
                         captains as aides decamp!

               The nobles rise; court attendants hurry to Wallace and drape 
               a golden chain of office around his neck. Wallace takes the 
               three smaller chains they bring and drapes them around the 
               necks of his friends, as once again the nobles applaud.

               Almost before the applause dies, a member of the BALLIOL 
               clan, who has kept an open seat beside him, speaks up...

                                     BALLIOL
                         Sir William!! Inasmuch as you and 
                         your captains hail from a region 
                         long known to support the Balliol 
                         clan, may we invite you to join us?

               But Wallace's gaze has locked onto Robert the Bruce, who 
               stares back, the two young lions instantly recognizing the 
               leadership power of each other.

                                     WALLACE
                         You are Robert the Bruce.

                                     ROBERT THE BRUCE
                         I am.

                                     WALLACE
                         My father fought in support of yours.

               The Balliols shrivel. The nobles on the Bruce side can barely 
               keep from grinning. Suddenly the men on the other end of the 
               table change their attack.

                                     BALLIOL
                         With this new success, the result of 
                         all of Scotland's efforts, now is 
                         the time to declare a king!

                                     MORNAY
                         Then you are prepared to recognize 
                         our legitimate succession!

                                     BALLIOL
                         You're the ones who won't support 
                         the true claim! I demand consideration 
                         of these documents!

               Wallace glances again at the Bruce, who suddenly feels ashamed 
               of the bickering.

                                     MORNAY
                         Those were lies when they were 
                         written! Our documents prove 
                         absolutely that --

               Suddenly Wallace turns his back and walks toward the door.

                                     CRAIG
                         Sir William! Where are you going?

                                     WILLIAM
                         We have beaten the English! But 
                         they'll come back, because you won't 
                         stand together. There is one clan in 
                         this country -- Scotsmen. One class -- 
                         free. One price -- courage.

               He turns again and strides toward the door.

                                     CRAIG
                         But... what will you do?

                                     WALLACE
                         I will invade England. And defeat 
                         the English on their own ground.

                                     CRAIG
                         Invade?! That's impossible, it --

               Wallace slings out his broadsword and moves down the length 
               of the table, bashing the succession documents into the laps 
               of the nobles.

                                     WALLACE
                         LISTEN TO ME! Longshanks understands 
                         this! This!

               He brandishes the broadsword.

                                     WALLACE
                         There is a difference between us. 
                         You think the people of this country 
                         exist to provide you with position. 
                         I think your position exists to 
                         provide the people with freedom. And 
                         I go to make sure they have it.

               Wallace bangs through the door. Suppressing smiles, his 
               friends file out behind him.

               INT. EDINBURGH CORRIDOR - DAY

               Wallace and his men are marching away, as Robert the Bruce 
               runs out after them.

                                     ROBERT
                         Wait! ...I respect what you said. 
                         But remember, these men have lands, 
                         castles. Much to risk.

                                     WALLACE
                         And the common man who bleeds on the 
                         battlefield, does he risk less?

                                     ROBERT
                         No. But from top to bottom this 
                         country has no sense of itself. Its 
                         nobles share allegiance with England 
                         and its clans war with each other. 
                         If you make enemies on both sides of 
                         the border, you'll end up dead.

                                     WALLACE
                         We all end up dead. It's only a 
                         question of how. And why.

               Wallace walks; Robert catches up and speaks to him in an 
               urgent half whisper, so that no one else can hear.

                                     ROBERT
                         I'm no coward! I want what you want! 
                         But we need the nobles.

                                     WALLACE
                         Nobles? What does that mean -- to be 
                         noble? Your title gives you claim to 
                         the throne of our country. But men 
                         don't follow titles, they follow 
                         courage! Your arm speaks louder than 
                         your tongue. Our people know you. 
                         Noble and common, they respect you. 
                         If you would lead them toward freedom, 
                         they would follow you. And so would 
                         I.

               Wallace walks away, leaving Robert the Bruce alone.

               THE SCOTTISH ARMY - DAY

               Wallace rides at the head of his army, moving through the 
               countryside of northern England. It is autumn, the foliage 
               is beautiful, the wheat fields gold with harvest.

               EXT. ESTABLISHING YORK CITY - DAY

               A medieval city guarded by a fortress.

               INT. THE FORTRESS - MAP ROOM - DAY

               The ROYAL GOVERNOR is a spoiled young man, Longshanks' nephew. 
               He is studying maps and written appeals for help; his CAPTAIN 
               of defenses strides in with another note.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Message from your cousin, the Prince. 
                         He says London has no more troops to 
                         send.

                                     GOVERNOR
                         Every town in Northern England is 
                         begging for help! Where will Wallace 
                         strike first?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I should think these smaller 
                         settlements along the border...

               They hear shouts as a rider arrives and dismounts. They look 
               out to see a panicked RIDER, who shouts up...

                                     RIDER
                         He advances!

                                     GOVERNOR
                         To what town?

                                     RIDER
                         He comes here!

                                                                  SMASH TO:

               CARTS, RUMBLING IN PANIC DOWN A ROAD

               as civilians flee the walled city in the distance.

               THE SCOTTISH ARMY

               has cut a huge tree and placed it on wheels. It rumbles 
               ominously TOWARD CAMERA...

               THE CIVILIAN PANIC CONTINUES as more people join the swell 
               of those leaving York.

               THE SCOTTISH ARMY keeps coming on.

               INSIDE THE WALLS OF THE CITY - DAY

               The governor is furious and confused.

                                     GOVERNOR
                         We will not allow a bandit to panic 
                         the greatest city in Northern England! 
                         Close off the escapes! Let no one 
                         leave!

                                     CAPTAIN
                         The city has emptied already, Sire. 
                         Only the Scottish civilians remain.

               The Governor turns to his captain with a look worthy of his 
               uncle, Longshanks the King.

               ON THE BATTERING RAM

               as it picks up speed and SLAMS into the wooden gate of the 
               city. With the collision, THE BATTLE IS ON. It's a night 
               battle: torches, flaming arrows, pots of boiling oil being 
               splashed down at the attackers, who swarm the gate.

               The oil beats the first wave of Scots back, but Wallace rushes 
               forward, grabbing the ram cart with his own hands; the 
               attackers rally to him, helping him slam the gate again and 
               again. It breaks; but behind it is an awful tangle of carts, 
               broken sheds, impenetrable rubbish. Wallace grabs a torch, 
               throws it into the wooden tangle, and shouts --

                                     WALLACE
                         Back! Wait for it to burn!

               INSIDE THE CITY

               The Captain hurries into the tower room.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         They've breached the wall!

                                     GOVERNOR
                         Then do as I ordered.

               OUTSIDE THE WALLS

               The Scots wait, biding their time as the barrier burns.

               Suddenly they look up in horror; the English are throwing 
               the bodies of hanged Scots over the wall.

               They stare at this in mute shock. Wallace is frozen, his 
               eyes reflecting his boyhood reaction. His men rush forward.

                                     WALLACE
                         STOP! NOT YET! LISTEN TO ME!
                              (beat)
                         They wish to frighten us! Or goad us 
                         into attacking too soon! Don't look 
                         away! LOOK!

               The Scots look at the hanging bodies.

                                     WALLACE
                         Behold the enemy we fight! We will 
                         be more merciful than they have been. 
                         We will spare women, children, and 
                         priests. For all else, no mercy.

               Wallace draws his broadsword. The burning debris inside the 
               gate collapses, leaving a tunnel through the fire. Wallace 
               screams, and leads the charge through the burning barrier.

               INT. THE PALACE IN LONDON - DAY

               Prince Edward and Phillip, his fencing friend and lover, 
               hear a contingent of horsemen clatter into the courtyard 
               below; they look out the window and see the arrival of 
               Longshanks.

               They lean back into the room and Edward begins to pace 
               nervously.

                                     PHILLIP
                         It is not your fault! Stand up to 
                         him.

               Edward shows Phillip the dagger he has concealed in his belt 
               behind his back.

                                     EDWARD
                         I will stand up to him, and more.

               Longshanks bangs the door open and stalks in angrily. First 
               he glares at Phillip with obvious loathing, then turns his 
               piercing stare to his own son.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         What news of the north?

                                     EDWARD
                         Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent 
                         riders to speed any word.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         While I am in France fighting to 
                         expand your future kingdom I learn 
                         that Stirling castle is lost, our 
                         entire northern army wiped out! And 
                         you have done nothing?!

                                     EDWARD
                         I have ordered conscriptions...

               A messenger enters and hands the prince a message. Edward 
               reads it and nearly loses his balance.

                                     EDWARD
                         Wallace has sacked York!

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Impossible.
                              (to messenger)
                         How dare you bring a panicky lie.

               The messenger has also brought a basket. He approaches the 
               central table with great dread and places the basket on it, 
               uncovering its contents. Prince Edward is closest; he looks 
               in, then staggers back, stunned. Longshanks moves to the 
               sack coldly, looks in, and withdraws the severed head of his 
               nephew, York's (former) Governor.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Sire! Thy own nephew! What beast 
                         could do such a thing?!

               The king drops the head back into the sack, unmoved.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         If he can sack York, he can invade 
                         lower England.

                                     PHILLIP
                         We would stop him!

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Edward, who is this shitpoker who 
                         speaks to me as if I needed his 
                         advice?

                                     EDWARD
                         I have declared Phillip my High 
                         Counselor.

               Longshanks nods as if impressed. He moves to Phillip and 
               examines the gold chain of office that the young man wears.

               Then Longshanks grabs him and throws him out the window, the 
               same one Edward and Phillip were looking out, six stories 
               above the courtyard. We hear Phillip's SCREAM as he falls.

               Edward rushes toward the window in horror. He looks out at 
               the result, turns back toward his father in shock and hatred, 
               and only then remembers the dagger and goes for it.

               He stabs at Longshanks; the old king smiles at the attack, 
               parrying, letting his arms be cut.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         You fight back at last!

               Then Longshanks unleashes his own hateful fury; he grapples 
               with Edward, knocking the dagger away and hurling him to the 
               floor; then Longshanks kicks his son, again and again. He 
               exhausts his fury on him.

               Edward is a bloody mess; Longshanks coughs up a bit of blood.

               He ignores it and his son's wreckage, and goes back to the 
               discussion, as if this fight was normal business.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         We must sue for a truce, and buy him 
                         off. But who will go to him? Not I. 
                         If I came under the sword of this 
                         murderer, I would end up like my 
                         nephew. And not you, the sight of my 
                         faggot son would only encourage an 
                         enemy to take over this country. So 
                         whom do I send?

               Longshanks calculates.

               EXT. WALLACE ARMY CAMP - DAY

               A full encampment, across an English field; campfires chase 
               the dawn chill. Soldiers sharpen swords and spear points.

               Wallace is huddled with his inner circle, all except Campbell, 
               who receives a report from a scout.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         A royal entourage comes, flying 
                         banners of truce, and the standards 
                         of Longshanks himself!

               Wallace buckles on his sword.

               AN ENGLISH PAVILION TENT - YORKSHIRE - DAY

               Set up for a meeting in a sunny meadow. Wallace and his men 
               ride in, wary, ready for ambush. They surround the tent.

               There are two dozen royal soldiers there, but they make no 
               threatening moves.

               No sound from the tent. Wallace rests his hand on the handle 
               of his broadsword, ready.

                                     WALLACE
                         Longshanks! I have come.

               Servants pull back the sides of the tent door, and a tall, 
               slender, shapely female figure appears there. There in the 
               shadows, she looks just like Marion! William is not the only 
               one who notices the resemblance; he glances at Hamish and 
               Campbell and sees them haunted by it too. Is this another 
               dream? He pales, as she steps into the morning sun. She moves 
               toward him, her face lowered. It is Marion!

               She reaches him, lifts her face... and he sees the Princess!

               William is relieved -- and yet as he sees the Princess more 
               closely he is still shaken by the resemblance in the way she 
               carries herself, her shape, the fall of her hair.

               The Princess is struck with Wallace, too -- tall, powerful, 
               and commanding. Wallace dismounts, and moves to face her.

               Their eyes hang on each other. She sees something that she 
               has not seen in the face of a man in her whole life.

               She surprises him by bending at the knee, in a half-submissive 
               yet proud curtsey.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I am the Princess of Wales.

                                     WALLACE
                         Wife of Edward, the king's son?

               She nods; somehow she is already ashamed.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I come as the king's servant, and 
                         with his authority.

                                     WALLACE
                         It's battle I want, not talk.

                                     PRINCESS
                         But now that I am here, will you 
                         speak with a woman?

               She leads him under the pavilion, a purple canopy shading 
               rich carpets laid on the bare ground. Watching the gorgeous 
               walk, Stephen lies back on his saddle and twitches his leg 
               like a horny dog. Hamish backhands him; Campbell, Hamish and 
               Stephen quickly dismount and follow the procession, 
               shouldering their way in beside the Princess's French guards, 
               so they can watch Wallace's back. The rest of the Scots 
               surround the tent, ready for ambush.

               Nicolette is among the royal attendants there; seeing Wallace, 
               she shoots a glance at the Princess that says Ooo-La-La! The 
               servants have brought a throne for the Princess, a lower 
               chair for Wallace. She sits; he refuses the chair.

               She studies him, taking in his anger and his pride.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I understand that you have recently 
                         been given the rank of knight.

                                     WALLACE
                         I have been given nothing. God makes 
                         men what they are.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Did God make you the sacker of 
                         peaceful cities? The executioner of 
                         the king's nephew, my husband's own 
                         cousin?

                                     WALLACE
                         York was the staging point for every 
                         invasion of my country. And that 
                         royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, 
                         even women and children, from the 
                         city walls.

                                     PRINCESS
                         That is not possible.

               But knowing Longshanks' family, she glances at a richly 
               dressed Advisor, a CRONY of the king, who averts his eyes.

                                     WALLACE
                         Longshanks did far worse, the last 
                         time he took a Scottish city.

               The Crony mumbles to her in LATIN, WITH SUBTITLES...

                                     CRONY
                              (Latin)
                         He is a murdering bandit, he lies.

                                     WALLACE
                              (Latin!)
                         I am no bandit. And I do not lie.

               They are startled at Wallace's fluency in Latin.

                                     WALLACE
                         Or in French if you prefer that: 
                         Certainmous et ver! Ask your king to 
                         his face, and see if his eyes can 
                         convince you of the truth.

               She stares for a long moment at Wallace's eyes.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Hamilton, leave us.

                                     CRONY (HAMILTON)
                         M'lady --

                                     PRINCESS
                         Leave us now.

               He reluctantly obeys. Seeing that she wants the exchange to 
               be private, Wallace turns and nods for his men to leave.

               Stephen, who has been admiring the lady's beauty non-stop, 
               leans in and whispers to William...

                                     STEPHEN
                         Her husband's more of a queen than 
                         she is. Did you know that?

               Stephen moves off with Hamish and Campbell. Wallace and the 
               princess are left alone.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Let us talk plainly. You invade 
                         England. But you cannot complete the 
                         conquest, so far from your shelter 
                         and supply. The King proposes that 
                         you withdraw your attack. In return 
                         he grants you title, estates, and 
                         this chest with a thousand pounds of 
                         gold, which I am to pay to you 
                         personally.

                                     WALLACE
                         A Lordship. And gold. That I should 
                         become Judas.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Peace is made is such ways.

                                     WALLACE
                         SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!

               The outburst startles even those watching from a distance.

               The Princess is mesmerized by Wallace's passion.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I understand you have suffered. I 
                         know... about your woman.

                                     WALLACE
                         She was my wife. We married in secret 
                         because I would not share her with 
                         an English lord. They killed her to 
                         get to me. And she was pregnant.

               The Princess is stunned; Wallace is dead still.

                                     WALLACE
                         I've never told anyone. I don't know 
                         why I tell you -- except because you 
                         look... much like her. And someday 
                         you will be a queen, and you must 
                         open your eyes!
                              (beat)
                         Tell your king that William Wallace 
                         will not be ruled. Nor will any Scot, 
                         while I live.

               The Princess rises slowly from her chair, moves in front of 
               him, and lowers herself to her knees. The Crony and her other 
               attendants, seeing this from a distance, are shocked.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Sir. I leave this money, as a gift. 
                         Not from the king, but from myself. 
                         And not to you, but to the orphans 
                         of your country.

               She lifts her face. Their eyes hold a moment too long.

               LATER, EXT. FIELD - DAY

               Wallace and his captains sit on horseback at the head of 
               their company and watch as the Princess' procession leaves.

               Hamish studies Wallace's face; Wallace notices and gives him 
               a non-committal shrug. As the carriage rolls away, its window 
               curtains lift back slightly. All they see are the Princess' 
               fingers, but they know she looked back. Wallace reins his 
               horse away, to ride back to camp.

               INT. EDWARD'S PALACE - DAY

               The doors open; the Princess enters Longshanks' war council; 
               Prince Edward is there, among a dozen others.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled 
                         by the heathen. So he accepted our 
                         bribe.

                                     PRINCESS
                         No. He did not.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Then why does he stay? My scouts say 
                         he has not advanced.

                                     PRINCESS
                         He waits. For you. He says he will 
                         attack no more towns -- if you are 
                         man enough to come fight him.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         You spoke with this Wallace in 
                         private. What kind of man is he?

                                     PRINCESS
                         ...A mindless barbarian. Not a king 
                         like you, M'lord.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         The Scottish nobles have sent him no 
                         support. His army starves. Our stall 
                         has worked, he must withdraw. You 
                         may return to your embroidery.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Humbly, M'lord.

               She barely curtseys, and starts out.

                                     EDWARD
                         You brought back the money, of course?

               He already knows she didn't; Hamilton is standing near him.

                                     PRINCESS
                         No. I have it to ease the suffering 
                         of the children of this war.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                              (glances at son)
                         This is what happens when you must 
                         send a woman. And a fool.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Forgive me, Sire. I thought that 
                         generosity might demonstrate your 
                         greatness to those you mean to rule.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         My greatness is better demonstrated 
                         with this.

               From a box at his feet the king withdraws a crossbow and 
               throws it onto the table. Most of those there are shocked.

                                     EDWARD
                         The weapon has been outlawed by the 
                         Pope himself!

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         So the Scots will have none of them, 
                         will they? My armorers have already 
                         made a thousand.

               Longshanks smiles. No one notices that the Princess is deadly 
               pale.

               EXT. WALLACE ARMY CAMP - DAY

               The Scots are lining up to leave their encampment. Wallace 
               is about to give the signal to start the march when Hamish, 
               beside him, comes alert; a small group of riders in 
               distinctive attire are coming toward them; what can this be?

                                     HAMISH
                         William -- French guards?

               The riders stop at a distance, and out from their ranks comes 
               a single rider, sitting sidesaddle. It is Nicolette.

               Wallace and Hamish recognize her from the Princess's visit.

               She trots her horse the rest of the way, while the French 
               guards stay back. Hamish helps her from her horse. She moves 
               to Wallace, and opens the heavy folds of her heavy riding 
               cape.

               Secreted there, hung from a rope at her neck, is a crossbow.

               EXT. A FIELD IN SCOTLAND - DAY

               Wallace has gathered the nobles, among them Robert the Bruce, 
               Mornay, and old Craig, for a demonstration. Hamish and Stephen 
               have placed a spearman's chestplate against a bale of hay. 
               As William cranks the crossbow to its full cocked position 
               and places a bolt in its slot, Stephen tucks a melon behind 
               the armor.

               William aims... and fires. The bolt slashes through the air 
               and punches through the armor and the melon, leaving no doubt 
               what it would do to a man's heart. The nobles pale.

                                     CRAIG
                         That is why the Pope outlawed the 
                         weapon! It makes war too terrible.

                                     MORNAY
                         How many does Longshanks have?

                                     WALLACE
                         A thousand.
                              (beat)
                         You have made me Guardian of Scotland. 
                         So I tell you this is what we face.

                                     CRAIG
                         We must sue for peace.

                                     WALLACE
                         Peace?!

                                     CRAIG
                         We cannot defeat this --

                                     WALLACE
                         With cavalry -- not heavy, like the 
                         English, but light, fast horsemen, 
                         like you nobles employ -- we could 
                         outmaneuver their bowmen!

                                     CRAIG
                         It is suicide.

                                     ROBERT
                         Sir William --

               The Bruce sees Wallace about to explode, and tries to 
               intervene -- but Wallace's anger is too great.

                                     WALLACE
                         We won at Stirling and still you 
                         quibbled! We won at York and you 
                         would not support us! Then I said 
                         nothing! Now I say you are cowards!

               The nobles grip their weapons; Wallace, Hamish and Stephen 
               are ready to finish this quarrel right here. Robert the Bruce, 
               backed by Mornay, steps between the two sides.

                                     ROBERT
                         Please, Sir William! Speak with me 
                         alone! I beg you!

               The nobles stalk away, and Robert draws Wallace away, to the 
               target Wallace shot, so they are alone.

                                     ROBERT
                         You have achieved more than anyone 
                         dreamed. But fighting these odds 
                         looks like rage, not courage. Peace 
                         offers its rewards! Has war become a 
                         habit you cannot break?

               The question strikes deep.

                                     WALLACE
                         War finds me willing. I know it won't 
                         bring back all I have lost. But it 
                         can bring what none of us have ever 
                         had -- a country of our own. For 
                         that we need a king. We need you.

                                     ROBERT
                         I am trying.

                                     WALLACE
                         Then tell me what a king is! Is he a 
                         man who believes only what others 
                         believe? Is he one who calculates 
                         the numbers for and against him but 
                         never weighs the strength in your 
                         own heart? There is strength in you. 
                         I see it. I know it.

                                     ROBERT
                         I must... consult with my father.

                                     WALLACE
                         And I will consult with mine.

               Robert the Bruce walks off the field, heading the way the 
               other nobles went. Wallace rejoins Hamish and Stephen. They 
               look to him; what do we do now?

                                     WALLACE
                         Remember when the English turned 
                         their hounds on us? Maybe we should 
                         introduce them to our dogs.

               INT. THE DARKENED ROOM OF BRUCE THE ELDER, THE LEPER

               In the faint nimbus of the single candle, young Robert sits 
               across from his leper father. The son grips his own head, as 
               if stunned by a blow.

                                     ROBERT
                         This... cannot be the way.

                                     THE LEPER
                         You have said yourself that the nobles 
                         will not support Wallace, so how 
                         does it help us to join the side 
                         that is slaughtered?

               Heartsick, the father reaches across the table, then stays 
               his arm, unwilling to touch his son with his leprous hand.

                                     THE LEPER
                         My son. Look at me. I cannot be king. 
                         You, and you alone, can rule Scotland. 
                         What I tell you, you must do -- for 
                         yourself, and for your country.

               Young Robert holds his father with his eyes, and does not 
               look away.

               EXT. THE BATTLE OF FALKIRK - DAY

               The Scottish army moves out onto the hilly plain, covered in 
               the gray mists. They see glimpses of the enemy in the 
               distance. Wallace deploys the Scots: Campbell with the 
               schiltrons (spear formations), Stephen with the infantry, 
               the noble Mornay leading the cavalry, and with Wallace and 
               Hamish on horseback, looking over the field. Hamish sees 
               gazing up at an empty hill above the field.

                                     HAMISH
                         The Bruce is not coming, William.

                                     WALLACE
                         Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.

               He'd better, the odds look long. And it's nasty ground; one 
               side of the field is ankle deep in water, and the English 
               are covering it with a layer of burning oil, releasing thick 
               smoke to hide their movements.

                                     WALLACE
                         Stephen ready?

                                     HAMISH
                         Aye.

               The Priest from their home village is moving through the 
               Scottish ranks, dispensing absolution. He reaches the two 
               friends, who accept the Host, say their own last prayers, 
               and give each other a look of goodbye. Hamish rides off to 
               join the schiltrons.

               LONGSHANKS AND HIS GENERALS

               on the opposite side of the field, send their army forward.

               WALLACE AND THE SCOTS

               see them through the smoke; Wallace spots what he's looking 
               for: there they are, the ranks of crossbowmen!

               And as they draw nearer, Wallace hears a haunting noise. He 
               sees the bowmen more clearly, and the English infantry. Some 
               are wearing kilts and marching to bagpipes.

                                     WALLACE
                         Irish troops!

               STEPHEN OF IRELAND, WITH THE SCOTTISH INFANTRY

               He stares at the approach of his countrymen. Wallace appears 
               beside him. Stephen sees him, and is ashamed.

                                     STEPHEN
                         So that's where Longshanks got his 
                         soldiers. Irishmen, willing to kill 
                         Scottish cousins for the English.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Their families are starving, they'll 
                         feed them however they can. If you 
                         don't want to fight them --

                                     STEPHEN
                         No. I'll stand with you.

               Loyal to the end. Wallace signals to Hamish and Campbell, 
               among the schiltrons. The formations, bristling with spears, 
               move forward. Hamish looks back at Wallace; both men know 
               the spearmen are the bait here. Wallace and Stephen see the 
               English heavy cavalry advancing.

                                     STEPHEN
                         They can't be that stupid to attack 
                         the schiltrons again.

               Wallace is scanning the battlefield. He sees the English 
               cavalry charge, but before they reach the bristling spears, 
               they pull up, and crossbowmen, moving up behind the knights.

                                     WALLACE
                         It's only a faint to shield the 
                         crossbows!

               The crossbowmen fire a volley, too hurriedly. We see the 
               hailstorm of bolts slash through the air in unison -- you 
               can actually see them coming. The bows fall short of the 
               front ranks of the schiltrons.

                                     WALLACE
                         Now! Give 'em the dogs!

               Stephen signals, and up the slope behind them come handlers 
               with ten war dogs.

               Huge mastiffs, they wear steel collars, with razor sharp 
               protrusions. Their handlers hold them at the end of long 
               catch poles. The crossbowmen are distracted from their 
               reloading by the appearance of the mastiffs; now, as the 
               Scottish handlers run toward the English ranks and unleash 
               the dogs, fear races through the English line.

               The dogs tear into them. It is chaos; the bowmen can't flee, 
               and as the dogs mix among them, the bowmen fire frantically, 
               mostly hitting each other. The dogs' collars slash legs; 
               their jaws crush bones; even when their back legs are hacked 
               off, the frenzied dogs keep killing.

               Wallace signals to Mornay with the Scottish cavalry. Mornay 
               does nothing. The crossbowmen, though taking great punishment, 
               are beginning to overwhelm the dogs by sheer numbers, and 
               are regrouping.

                                     WALLACE
                         Now! Charge! Charge them!

               Mornay tugs his reins and leads his cavalry away.

               AT THE ENGLISH COMMAND

               Longshanks and his officers see Mornay and his cavalry melt 
               away. The English general looks knowingly at Longshanks.

                                     GENERAL
                         Mornay?

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         For double his lands in Scotland, 
                         and matching estates in England.

               WALLACE, WITH STEPHEN

               They see the Scottish army abandoned.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Betrayed!

               Wallace glances to the other hilltop; still no sign of Bruce.

               He looks on in agony as the crossbowmen unleash another 
               volley. The Scottish spearmen, bunched in a tight group, are 
               helpless. The bolts fall, cutting through their helmets and 
               breastplates like paper. Wallace has no cavalry -- and his 
               men are being slaughtered! He spurs his horse, and Stephen 
               and the infantrymen race behind him.

               The English heavy cavalry surge to meet them, but Wallace 
               weaves through them, dodging with his horse, slashing with 
               the broadsword, cutting down on knight, another, another...

               The Scottish infantry claws in, dragging down the horses, 
               hacking the knights as they run by.

               The English bowmen are about to fire again, but they see the 
               Scottish charge bearing down on them and adjust their aim; 
               the bolts cut into the infantrymen; one bolt tears off the 
               armor of Wallace's left shoulder. He wobbles on his horse, 
               regains his balance, and keeps up the charge.

               AT THE ENGLISH COMMAND

               Longshanks and his generals are watching the action.

                                     GENERAL
                         My God, and still they come!

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Use the reinforcements! But take 
                         Wallace alive!

               The General signals and the English reinforcements surge 
               into the battle.

               IN THE THICK OF THE BATTLE

               On horseback, Wallace fights his way into the watery edge of 
               the field, where English infantry is now overrunning the 
               schiltron. He hacks men down left and right, reaches the 
               Scottish center, and finds Hamish bending over another 
               soldier. Wallace dismounts.

                                     WALLACE
                         Hamish! Ham --

               And Wallace sees that Hamish is holding his father, fallen 
               in battle. Wallace has no time to react; he cuts down and 
               English swordsman moving in to hack Hamish's back. Wallace 
               lifts Campbell across the saddle, and shouts at Hamish...

                                     WALLACE
                         Get him away!

               Hamish obeys, jumping onto the horse and galloping back toward 
               the rear. Wallace fights with new vengeance, swinging the 
               double-edged broadsword with deadly accuracy.

               Rallied by Wallace's presence, the Scots surge back. Then 
               Wallace sees the English reinforcement cavalry coming.

                                     WALLACE
                         A charge! Form up! Form up!

               The Scots pull up spears and hastily form another schiltron.

               The spears bristle out, ready... the English horsemen thunder 
               in. But before the spears impale the horses, another flight 
               of crossbow bolts cuts down half the Scots still fighting.

               Hamish reaches the rear of the battle and lowers the limp 
               body of his father to the Scottish monks who are attending 
               to the wounded and giving absolution to the dying...

               Still Wallace fights back, meeting the English charge. The 
               Scots hold their own. An English knight tries to ride over 
               William; he knocks the lance aside, and tough the horse slams 
               into him, William also unseats the rider.

               The rider rolls to his feet. William struggles up to meet 
               him -- and comes face to face with Robert the Bruce.

               The shock and recognition stun Wallace; in that moment, 
               looking at Robert the Bruce's guilt-ridden face, he 
               understands everything: the betrayal, the hopelessness of 
               Scotland. As he stands there frozen, a bolt punches into the 
               muscle of his neck, and Wallace doesn't react to it.

               Bruce is horrified at the sight of Wallace this way. He 
               batters at Wallace's sword, as if its use would give him 
               absolution.

                                     ROBERT
                         Fight me! Fight me!

               But Wallace can only stagger back. Bruce's voice grows ragged 
               as he screams.

                                     ROBERT
                         FIGHT ME!

               All around, the battle has decayed; the Scots are being 
               slaughtered. Another bolt glances off Wallace's helmet; a 
               third rips into his thigh plate, making his legs collapse.

               Suddenly Stephen comes through the melee, on Robert's horse!

               He hits Robert from behind, knocking him down, and jumps to 
               the ground to try and lift William onto the horse!

               Robert sees a knot of crossbowmen moving up, sighting out 
               Wallace, taking careful aim! Bruce leaps up and helps Stephen 
               sling Wallace onto the back of the horse, even covers him 
               with his shield, deflecting another bolt fired at Wallace, 
               as Stephen mounts too.

               As the horse plunges away into the smoke, Robert falls to 
               the water. His own troops reach him, realize who he is, see 
               the horrible expression on his face, and race on after the 
               Scots.

               Robert is left alone, on his knees in the water, the fire 
               and noise of battle now dim to him, as if his senses have 
               died along with his heart.

               LONGSHANKS

               Looks over the battlefield, strewn with the bodies of the 
               Scottish dead. For now, he is satisfied.

               EXT. ROAD - SUNSET

               Remnants of the defeated army straggle past. Wallace and 
               Stephen are trying to help Hamish carry his father, but now 
               old Campbell says...

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Son... I want to die on the ground.

               But as they tilt old Campbell onto the ground, he grabs at 
               something that starts to fall from the wound in his stomach.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Whew. That'll clear your sinuses. 
                         Goodbye, boys.

                                     HAMISH
                         No. You're going to live.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         I don't think I can do without one 
                         of those... whatever it is...

               Hamish is too grief-stricken to speak.

                                     WALLACE
                         You... were like my father...

               Old Campbell rallies one more time for this.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         ...And glad to die, like him... So 
                         you could be the men you are. All of 
                         ya.

               The last three words to Hamish, telling him he's a hero too.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         I'm a happy man.

               Hamish is weeping. When he looks up again, his father has 
               died. We PULL BACK from them in tableaux, with the army, the 
               people of Scotland, the whole gray world in defeat.

               INT. EDINBURGH CASTLE - DAY

               Wallace, still bloody and in his battered armor, removes the 
               chain of office from beneath his breastplate, lays it onto 
               the table in front of Craig and the other nobles, and walks 
               from the room. Hamish and Stephen see the satisfaction on 
               the nobles' face, and follow William out.

               INT. CASTLE CORRIDOR - DAY

               Hamish and Stephen move out into the hallway after Wallace -- 
               but he is gone.

               EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

               Wallace is in the woods, in the grove of trees, looking at 
               Marion's hidden grave. The rain falls on his face, like tears. 
               But he has no tears of his own. The cold, the icy rain, the 
               wounds, nothing seems to touch him.

               With his fingertips he carefully draws her embroidered cloth 
               from beneath his breastplate; hanging in his trembling hands, 
               filthy with the grime and gore of battle, it looks impossibly 
               white, something from a better, purer world.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. PALACE IN LONDON - NIGHT

               Thunder, the sound of driving rain. Snug by a massive fire 
               are Longshanks, his son Edward, and other advisors. On the 
               far side of the room, away from the fire, the Princess stands 
               at the window and watches the rain against the panes.

                                     ADVISOR
                         Their nobles have sworn allegiance, 
                         M'lord. Every last one.

               Longshanks savors the victory -- and gloats to his son.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Now we kill two birds at one stroke. 
                         We recruit from Scotland for our 
                         armies in France.

                                     EDWARD
                         The Scots will fight for us?

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         What choice do they have? Now they 
                         must serve us or starve.

                                     EDWARD
                         But if we have not caught Wallace --

                                     LONGSHANKS
                              (exploding)
                         He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he 
                         has not yet bled to death or had his 
                         throat cut for him, he will not 
                         survive the winter. It is very cold -- 
                         is it not, our flower?

               From the other side of the window, we see the Princess as 
               she hears him, but doesn't turn around. She looks at the 
               window, we snow swirling among the raindrops outside. Her 
               eyes glisten, and her breath fogs the glass.

               INT. BRUCE'S DARKENED CHAMBER

               The elder Bruce, his decaying features sagging from his face, 
               stares across the table at his son.

                                     LEPER
                         I am the one who is rotting. But I 
                         think your face looks graver than 
                         mine.

                                     ROBERT
                         He was so brave. With courage alone 
                         he nearly won.

                                     LEPER
                         So more men were slaughtered 
                         uselessly!

                                     ROBERT
                         He broke because of me. I saw it. He 
                         lost all will to fight.

                                     LEPER
                         We must have alliance with England 
                         to prevail here. You achieved that! 
                         You saved your family, increased 
                         your lands! In time you will have 
                         all the power in Scotland!... Yet 
                         you grieve.

                                     ROBERT
                         In my heart I had begun to hope that 
                         he would never break.

                                     LEPER
                         All men lose heart. All betray. It 
                         is exactly why we must make the 
                         choices we make.

               INT. MORNAY'S CASTLE - NIGHT

               Mornay, in an opulent bedchamber hung with tapestries and 
               carpeted with eastern rugs, lies in bed, tossing in the 
               restless sleep of a tortured soul.

               He thinks he hears galloping. In SUBLIMINAL FLASHES he DREAMS 
               of Wallace riding toward him.

               He wakes, and listens to a strange noise. It is hoofbeats!

               Coming closer. He hears shouts too, screams from below -- 
               and those strange, approaching hoofbeats...

               WALLACE, ON HORSEBACK

               rides up the circular stairs inside Mornay's castle! His 
               horse bounds up the stone -- Mornay's guards are behind him, 
               on foot, pursuing.

               At a landing, Wallace cuts down a guard, and gallops higher.

               IN HIS BED, MORNAY

               sits up gawking as the door explodes inward and Wallace rides 
               through! Mornay is frozen. Wallace slashes him down.

               Out in the corridor, the guards gather; they have Wallace 
               trapped. He covers the horse's eyes with a cloth and spurs 
               his flanks. The blind animal runs through the window!

               EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT - SLOW MOTION

               The horse and rider plunge past the sheer walls of the 
               castle... and into the loch! Mornay's guards and the castle 
               servants cluster at the windows to see Wallace and the horse 
               surface, and swim to the shore, escaping!

               EXT. SCOTTISH VILLAGE - DAY

               The news has spread through the countryside. In the town 
               square, drunken Scotsmen chant...

                                     PEOPLE
                         Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace!

               Old Craig rides past them, heading toward the Bruce's castle 
               on the hill above the town.

               INT. BRUCE CASTLE - DAY

               Robert is in his central room; he hears the chanting from 
               far below. Old Craig enters.

                                     ROBERT
                         Is it true about Mornay?

               Craig hands him the bloody nightshirt Mornay was wearing.

                                     ROBERT
                         And he rode through the window? My 
                         God.

               He can't hide his admiration. From below, he still hears the 
               people CHANTING...

               EXT. LONDON - GARDENS - DAY

               Longshanks and Edward are in the royal gardens, resplendent 
               with spring. Longshanks pulls a new flower, and crushes it.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         His legend grows! It will be worse 
                         than before!

                                     EDWARD
                         You let Wallace escape your whole 
                         army. You cannot blame me for this.

               Longshanks glowers at his son; the Princess arrives.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Good day to you, M'Lords.

                                     EDWARD
                         You mock us with a smile?

                                     PRINCESS
                         I am cheerful with a plan to soothe 
                         your miseries. All of England shudders 
                         with the news of renewed rebellion.

                                     EDWARD
                         Wallace's followers.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Wallace himself. If you wish to 
                         pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers 
                         in every Scottish town, I leave you 
                         to your hauntings. If you wish to 
                         take him, I know a way.

               Edward snickers in derision -- but his wife is steel.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I have faced him. Have you?

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Let her speak.

                                     PRINCESS
                         He will fight you forever. But what 
                         does he fight for? Freedom first, 
                         and peace. So grant them.

                                     EDWARD
                         The little cow is insane --

                                     PRINCESS
                         Grant, as you do everything else, 
                         with treachery. Offer him a truce to 
                         discuss terms, and send me to my 
                         castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. 
                         He trusts me. Pick thirty of your 
                         finest assassins for me to take along. 
                         And I will set the meeting, and the 
                         ambush.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         You see, my delicate son? I have 
                         picked you a Queen.

               EXT. THE PRINCESS' SCOTTISH CASTLE - DAY

               Locharmbie is a small, picturesque castle on a hillside. As 
               the queen's entourage moves through the gates, they close 
               behind her. She steps out of the carriage and moves into

               INT. CASTLE - THE GREAT HALL - DAY

               Inside the great hall are thirty killers, led by their CHIEF 
               ASSASSIN, a cutthroat with a mangled eye.

                                     CHIEF ASSASSIN
                         We came in small groups, so the rebels 
                         would not suspect.

                                     PRINCESS
                         And you have reached Wallace's men?

                                     CHIEF ASSASSIN
                         We tell the villagers, and the 
                         traitors pass it on. All that's left 
                         is for you to say where.

               EXT. MARION'S GROVE - NIGHT

               Wallace is in the grove of trees where Marion is buried.

               Drinking in the silence, his own isolation. He hears a RUSTLE 
               behind him, and spins, drawing the broadsword. Then his face 
               registers... it's Hamish and Stephen.

               Hamish is unsure if he did the right thing in coming here -- 
               unsure, until Wallace moves to them, and hugs them.

               INT. CAVE - NIGHT

               They are in the old secret cave; rain is falling, but it's 
               dry inside, with a campfire smoldering at the entrance.

                                     WALLACE
                         Thanks for the food and drink. And 
                         for bringing 'em yourselves.

                                     HAMISH
                         We're here to stay. We don't care to 
                         live, if we can't fight beside ya.

               Stephen pulls a jug of whiskey from his pocket. He swigs, 
               hands it to Hamish for a chug, then to Wallace, who declines, 
               but smiles for the first time in many weeks.

                                     HAMISH
                         There is... one thing, William. 
                         Longshanks is offering a truce. He 
                         has dispatched his daughter-in-law 
                         as his emissary, and she has sent 
                         word that she wishes to meet you -- 
                         in a barn.

               Wallace frowns; a barn?

               EXT. A BARN IN THE SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               Hauntingly similar to the one in Wallace's childhood. As he 
               sits on his horse and looks at the place, surmounted by a 
               white flag of truce, it gives him a chill. But in full view 
               of the barn, he hands Hamish his sword and rides forward.

               INSIDE THE BARN

               are the assassins, killing knives ready.

                                     CHIEF ASSASSIN
                         It's William Wallace, sure! And... 
                         he's given up his sword! Be ready!

               They position themselves at every entrance.

               OUTSIDE THE BARN

               Wallace reaches the barn, dismounts, and moves toward the 
               door. But suddenly, instead of entering, he grabs the heavy 
               bar and seals the door! At this motion, Scots spring from 
               the woods in all directions. The assassins inside realize 
               the ambush is being turned on them, but it's too late; they 
               hear the entrance being sealed from the outside.

               More Scots, led by Stephen, scramble up from hiding, place 
               tinder-dry brush and pitch against the barn, and set it on 
               fire. In moments the entire barn is blazing. The Scots stand 
               back and watch the barn burn, their faces lit by the flames. 
               After awhile, there are no more screams from inside.

               EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT

               The Princess sees the burning off in the distance, like a 
               bonfire. She stands on the wall, looking out at it. And then 
               she sees, on a hillside, silhouetted against the night and 
               the fire, a rider, just sitting there on his horse, looking 
               at the castle. She runs into the castle, up the stairs, and 
               stands on the pinnacle of the castle, so that she too is 
               silhouetted, and he can see her.

               The lone rider is William Wallace.

               CLOSE - A CANDLE

               being placed in a window of the stable cottage, built into 
               the outer wall of the castle. AT A DISTANCE, the candle burns 
               like a tiny beacon. And William sees it.

               INSIDE THE STABLE COTTAGE, THE PRINCESS

               sits alone, wondering if her signal is going to work.

               OUTSIDE THE CASTLE

               Wallace climbs the castle wall, hand over hand up the mortared 
               stones, to the window twenty feet above the ground.

               He reaches the safety of the window cove and kneels on the 
               ledge. He looks through the window, and sees her inside.

               INSIDE THE ROOM, she looks up, and sees him there. The first 
               glance frightens her, and yet she expected him, prayed for 
               him to come. Now, for a long, long moment the two of them 
               look at each other through the glass, each realizing the 
               implications of this moment.

               She moves to the window and opens it. The wind rushing through 
               extinguishes the candle, and he slips inside. They face each 
               other in the darkness. Then she strikes a match and relights 
               the candle, and they look at each other.

                                     WALLACE
                         A meeting in a barn. It had to be a 
                         trap. And only you would know I would 
                         be aware of it.

                                     PRINCESS
                         It does me good to see you.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I am much diminished since we met.

               She wants to say something -- but instead she says something 
               else.

                                     PRINCESS
                         There will be a new shipment of 
                         supplies coming north next month. 
                         Food and weapons. They will trav --

                                     WILLIAM
                         No. Stop. I didn't come here for 
                         that.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Then why did you come?

                                     WALLACE
                         Why did you?

                                     PRINCESS
                         Because of the way you're looking at 
                         me now. The same way... as when we 
                         met.

               He turns his face away. Gently, she pulls it back.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I know. You looked at me... and saw 
                         her.

               He twists back toward the window.

                                     PRINCESS
                         You must forgive me what I feel. No 
                         man has ever looked at me as you 
                         did.

               Surprised, he looks at her now.

                                     WALLACE
                         You have... you have a husband.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I have taken vows. More than one. 
                         I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, 
                         and sworn to give him a son. And I 
                         cannot keep both promises.

               Slowly, it starts to dawn on him what she's asking, and an 
               unexpected smile plays at his lips. Her smile lights too.

                                     PRINCESS
                         You understand. Consider, before you 
                         laugh and say no. You will never own 
                         a throne, though you deserve one. 
                         But just as the sun will rise 
                         tomorrow, some man will rule England. 
                         And what if his veins ran not with 
                         the blood of Longshanks, but with 
                         that of a true king?

                                     WALLACE
                         I cannot love you for the sake of 
                         revenge.

                                     PRINCESS
                         No. But can you love me for the sake 
                         of all you loved and lost? Or simply 
                         love me... because I love you?

               Slowly, he reaches to the candle flame, and pinches it out.

               IN THE SHADOWS OF THE COTTAGE BED

               we see the surging, pent-up passion... and

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE LOVERS

               Their bodies limp, they lie asleep, entwined. The first rays 
               of morning spread yellow light through the room and across 
               their faces.

               Wallace wakes suddenly; sunlight! He grabs for his clothes, 
               as she wakes, covers herself in the blanket and jumps out of 
               bed, rushing to the window to look out.

                                     PRINCESS
                         No one! Hurry!

               He reaches her, throws the window open, and sees a clear 
               path down the wall to safety. He stops and looks at her, and 
               touches her face in gratitude. She has to ask...

                                     PRINCESS
                         When we... did you think of her?

               Pausing to look straight into her eyes, he kisses her -- 
               her, not Marion -- and climbs out. She watches him go.

               EXT. GROVE OF TREES - NIGHT

               Wallace stands alone in the grove where Marion lies.

               MONTAGE

               -- Wallace and fifty men gallop through a village on the way 
               to an English fortress; the villagers drop what they're doing 
               and run to follow them; we see Wallace's face, relentless, 
               as he hacks men down in the attack; with the fortress sacked 
               and smoking in the background, we see Wallace lead his men 
               away, the people cheering him...

               EXT. FOREST ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

               Once again, Wallace stares at the fire, beside his friends.

                                     HAMISH
                         Rest, William.

                                     WALLACE
                         I rest.

                                     HAMISH
                         Your rest is making me exhausted.

               Stephen offers the jug; Wallace declines.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Come, it'll help you sleep.

                                     WALLACE
                         Aye. But it won't let me dream.

               Pulling a tattered tartan around himself, he lies down.

               LONGSHANKS, INT. HIS PALACE - NIGHT

               He sits by a palace hearth, where a huge blaze burns; still 
               he's huddled beneath a blanket, and coughing blood. But he 
               ignores the ice in his lungs; his mind is plotting.

               THE PRINCESS, EXT. THE WALLS OF HER CASTLE - NIGHT

               she walks the parapets alone, lost in her own thoughts.

               ROBERT THE BRUCE, IN A STONE ROOM OF HIS CASTLE

               sits staring at... the stone coffin of his father. The coffin 
               is closed; on its top is a lifesize stone carving of his 
               father as a knight in final repose. Ranks of candles light 
               the scene, and Robert's face, cold as the stone. A SHUFFLE... 
               Robert looks up to see old Craig.

                                     CRAIG
                         May he rest in peace... You have 
                         already sealed the coffin?

                                     ROBERT
                         He was a modest man.

                                     CRAIG
                         It will not be long before Longshanks 
                         too is encased in stone, and his 
                         crowns divided for others to wear.

               Craig sits next to Robert, and keeps his voice low.

                                     CRAIG
                         Our nobles are frightened and 
                         confused... Wallace has the commoners 
                         stirred up again, from the Highland 
                         clans to the lowland villages. In 
                         another six months Christ and the 
                         Apostles could not govern this 
                         country.

               Robert only stares at his father's stone coffin.

                                     CRAIG
                         Longshanks knows his son will scarcely 
                         be able to rule England, much less 
                         half of France. He needs Scotland 
                         settled, and he trusts you, after 
                         Falkirk. If you pay him homage, he 
                         will recognize you as king of 
                         Scotland. Our nobles have agreed to 
                         this as well.

               He shows Robert a parchment bearing the noblest names in 
               Scotland. The Bruce barely glances at it.

                                     ROBERT
                         If I pay homage to another's throne, 
                         then how am I a king?

                                     CRAIG
                         Homage is nothing. It is the crown 
                         that matters!

                                     ROBERT
                         The crown is that of Scotland. And 
                         Scotland is William Wallace.

                                     CRAIG
                         That is another matter. There is a 
                         price to all this, required both by 
                         Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, 
                         and you will be our king. And we 
                         will have peace.

               Robert turns from his father's coffin, to look at Craig.

               EXT. FOREST ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

               A commotion; the nobles, their heads hooded, are led in on 
               horseback by guerrillas from the village. The nobles stop, 
               feel their hoods pulled off, and see Wallace.

                                     CRAIG
                         Sir William. We come to seek a 
                         meeting.

                                     WALLACE
                         You've all sworn to Longshanks.

                                     CRAIG
                         An oath to a liar is no oath at all. 
                         An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. 
                         Every man of us is ready to swear 
                         loyalty to you.

                                     WALLACE
                         So let the council swear publicly.

                                     CRAIG
                         We cannot. Some scarcely believe you 
                         are alive. Other think you'll pay 
                         them Mornay's wages. We bid you to 
                         Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, 
                         two days from now, at sunset. Pledge 
                         us your pardon and we will unite 
                         behind you. Scotland will be one.

               Wallace glances at Hamish and Stephen, who can barely hide 
               their contempt. Wallace looks at the nobles.

                                     WALLACE
                         I will meet you, but only one way -- 
                         if Robert the Bruce is there, and 
                         puts his hand on my Bible, and swears 
                         his loyalty to Scotland.

                                     CRAIG
                         He has already agreed to come.

               EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

               Wallace stands alone, looking at the moon and stars. Hamish 
               moves up and sits down beside him.

                                     HAMISH
                         You know it's a trap.

                                     WALLACE
                         Probably. But we can't win alone. We 
                         know that. This is the only way.

                                     HAMISH
                         I don't want to be a martyr.

                                     WALLACE
                         Nor I! I want to live! I want a home 
                         and children and peace. I've asked 
                         god for those things. But He's brought 
                         me this sword. And if He wills that 
                         I must lay it down to have what He 
                         wants for my country, then I'll do 
                         that too.

                                     HAMISH
                         That's just a dream, William!

                                     WALLACE
                         We've lived a dream together. A dream 
                         of freedom!

                                     HAMISH
                         Your dreams aren't about freedom! 
                         They're about Marion! You have to be 
                         a hero, because you think she sees 
                         you! Is that it?

                                     WALLACE
                         My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed 
                         them myself. If I knew I could live 
                         with her on the other side of death, 
                         I'd welcome it.

               EXT. ROAD INTO EDINBURGH - SUNSET

               William, Hamish, and Stephen are on their horses, looking 
               down at the road leading into the city. Wallace hands his 
               dagger to Stephen, and unbuckles his broadsword and gives it 
               to Hamish.

                                     HAMISH
                         Keep these. We're going too.

                                     WALLACE
                         No. One of us is enough.

               Wallace hugs them, first Stephen, then Hamish. Tears roll 
               down Hamish's cheeks. With one last look at his friends, 
               Wallace rides away.

               EXT. LARGE ESTATE HOUSE - SUNSET

               The house looks quiet as Wallace rides toward it.

               INT. ESTATE HOUSE - DAY

               Robert the Bruce and Craig stand at the hearth, tense.

                                     CRAIG
                         He won't come.

                                     ROBERT
                         He will. I know he will.

               They hear the approach of a single horse. The Bruce looks 
               out to see Wallace arriving.

                                     ROBERT
                         Here. And unarmed. My God, he has a 
                         brave heart.

               OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

               Wallace dismounts and enters.

               INT. THE HOUSE

               Wallace appears at the doorway into the main room, and stops.

               Bruce faces him. The eyes of BOTH MEN meet, saying everything. 
               Wallace steps into the room. He sees something flicker onto 
               Bruce's face -- shame -- just as henchmen in the rafters 
               drop a weighted net and it envelopes Wallace.

               English soldiers spring from the closets, run down the stairs, 
               and tumble over him, ripping at his clothes, searching as if 
               broadswords might spring from his boots.

               They bind Wallace hand and foot. He stares at Robert the 
               Bruce, who averts his eyes. The soldiers hurry Wallace out 
               the back, where others are bringing up horses. Robert grabs 
               the English Captain of the soldiers.

                                     ROBERT
                         He is not to be harmed. I have your 
                         king's absolute promise that he will 
                         be imprisoned only!

               The Captain looks at Bruce the way the High Priest must have 
               looked at Judas, and leaves.

                                     CRAIG
                         Now we will have peace.

               Robert the Bruce spots something on the floor that must have 
               fallen from Wallace's clothes as they grabbed him; Bruce 
               lifts the white handkerchief, and sees the familiar thistle 
               embroidered on it.

               EXT. ROAD - NORTHERN ENGLAND - DAY

               A procession of heavily armed English soldiers winds its way 
               toward London, Wallace strapped to an unsaddled horse, his 
               head bare to the sun. Country people come out to jeer...

                                     PEOPLE
                         Don't look so fearsome, does he?!

               A thrown rock careens off Wallace's check; rotten fruit slaps 
               his shirt. His lips are so parched they bleed.

               INT. ROYAL PALACE - LONGSHANKS' BEDROOM - DAY

               Edward inspects his father, who lies semiconscious in bed, 
               breath rattling ominously in his chest. Edward approves.

               INT. THE PALACE HALLWAY - DAY

               The Princess hurries up to her husband as he leaves the king's 
               bedroom, and follows him down the hall to his own.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Is it true? Wallace is captured?

                                     EDWARD
                         Simply because he eluded your trap, 
                         do you think he is more than a man? 
                         My father is dying. Perhaps you should 
                         think of our coronation.

                                     PRINCESS
                         When will his trial be?

                                     EDWARD
                         Wallace's? For treason there is no 
                         trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, 
                         then executed.

               With a faint smile, he shuts his bedroom door in her face.

               INT. ROBERT THE BRUCE'S CASTLE - DAY

               The Bruce is incredulous, yelling at Craig.

                                     ROBERT
                         Longshanks promised!

                                     CRAIG
                         You are surprised he would lie? 
                         Balliol was murdered in a church 
                         yesterday. You are Longshanks' new 
                         designate. You will be king.

               INT. TOWER DUNGEON

               Wallace stands in medieval restraints worthy of Hannibal 
               Lecter. Before him are six scarlet-robed royal magistrates.

                                     ROYAL MAGISTRATE
                         William Wallace! You stand in taint 
                         of high treason.

               We PUSH IN on the iron mask that binds his face. We can only 
               see his eyes -- but they are bright.

                                     WALLACE
                         Treason. Against whom?

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Against thy king, thou vile fool! 
                         Hast thou anything to say?

                                     WALLACE
                         Never, in my whole life, did I swear 
                         allegiance to your king --

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         It matters not, he is thy king!

                                     WALLACE
                         -- while many who serve him have 
                         taken and broken his oath many times. 
                         I cannot commit treason, if I have 
                         never been his subject!

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Confess, and you may receive a quick 
                         death. Deny, and you must be purified 
                         by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU 
                         CONFESS?!

                                     WALLACE
                         I do not confess.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive 
                         they purification... And in the end, 
                         I promise you'll beg for the axe.

               EXT. ESTABLISHING - THE TOWER

               The stone prison, and the wretched stone section known to 
               this day as the Wallace Tower.

               INT. PRISON - NIGHT

               Wallace is alone in his cell, still in the garish restraints.

               We can only see his eyes, as he prays.

                                     WALLACE
                         I am so afraid... Give me strength.

               OUTSIDE THE CELL DOOR

               The jailers jump to their feet as the Princess enters.

                                     JAILER
                         Your Highness!

                                     PRINCESS
                         I will see the prisoner.

                                     JAILER
                         We've orders from the king --

                                     PRINCESS
                         The king will be dead in a month! 
                         And his son is a weakling! Who do 
                         you think will rule this kingdom? 
                         Now OPEN THIS DOOR!

               The jailer obeys. The Princess can barely contain her shock 
               at the sight of Wallace; the jailers snatch him upright.

                                     JAILER
                         On your feet, you filth!

                                     PRINCESS
                         Stop! Leave me!
                              (they hesitate)
                         There is no way out of this hell! 
                         Leave me with him!

               Reluctantly the jailers shuffle out of the cell, but they 
               can still see her back and hear her. Looking at Wallace's 
               eyes through the mask, she can't quite hold back her tears -- 
               dangerous tears, that threaten to say too much. Wallace tries 
               to distract her.

                                     WALLACE
                         M'lady... what kindness of you to 
                         visit a stranger.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Sir, I... come to beg you to confess 
                         all, and swear allegiance to the 
                         king, that he might show you mercy.

                                     WALLACE
                         Will he show mercy to my country? 
                         Will he take back his soldiers, and 
                         let us rule ourselves?

                                     PRINCESS
                         Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps 
                         even live in the Tower. In time, who 
                         knows what can happen, if you can 
                         only live.

                                     WALLACE
                         If I swear to him, then everything I 
                         am is dead already.

               She wants to plead, she wants to scream. She can't stop the 
               tears. And the jailers are watching.

                                     WALLACE
                         Your people are lucky to have a 
                         princess so kind that she can grieve 
                         at the death of a stranger.

               She almost goes too far now, pulling closer to him -- but 
               she doesn't care. She whispers, pleading...

                                     PRINCESS
                         You will die! It will be awful!

                                     WALLACE
                         Every man dies. Not every man really 
                         lives.

               She pulls out a hidden vial, and whispers...

                                     PRINCESS
                         Drink this! It will dull your pain.

                                     WALLACE
                         It will numb my wits, and I must 
                         have them all. If I'm senseless, or 
                         if I wail, then Longshanks will have 
                         broken me.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I can't bear the thought of your 
                         torture. Take it!

               On the verge of hysteria, she presses the vial to the air 
               hole at his mouth and pours in the drug. The jailers, seeing 
               suspicious movement, shift inside the cell; she backs up, 
               her eyes wide, full of love and goodbye. From inside the 
               mask, he watches her go. When the door CLANGS shut, he spits 
               the purple drug out through the mouth hole.

               INT. LONGSHANKS' BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

               Longshanks lies helpless, his body racked with consumption.

               Edward sits against the wall, watching him die, glee in his 
               eyes. The Princess enters, and marches to the bedside.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I have come to beg for the life of 
                         William Wallace.

                                     EDWARD
                         You fancy him.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I respect him. At worst he was a 
                         worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou 
                         great king... and win the respect of 
                         your own people.

               Longshanks shakes his head.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Even now, you are incapable of mercy?

               The king can't speak. But hatred still glows in his eyes.

               The princess looks at her husband.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Nor you. To you that word is as 
                         unfamiliar as love.

                                     EDWARD
                         Before he lost his powers of speech, 
                         he told me his one comfort was that 
                         he would live to know Wallace was 
                         dead.

               She leans down and grabs the dying king by the hair. The 
               guards flanking the door start forward but the Princess's 
               eyes flare at them with more fire than even Longshanks once 
               showed -- and the guards back off. She leans down and hisses 
               to Longshanks, so softly that even Edward can't hear...

                                     PRINCESS
                         You see? Death comes to us all. And 
                         it comes to William Wallace. But 
                         before death comes to you, know this: 
                         your blood dies with you. A child 
                         who is not of your line grows in my 
                         belly. Your son will not sit long on 
                         the throne. I swear it.

               She lets go of the old king. He sags like an empty sack back 
               onto his satin pillows. Without even a look at her husband 
               she strides out of the room, with the rattling breath of the 
               dying king rasping the air like a saw.

               EXT. LONDON TOWN SQUARE - EXECUTION DAY

               The crowd is festive; hawkers sell roast chickens, and beer 
               from barrels. Royal horsemen arrive, dragging Wallace strapped 
               to a wooden litter. As they cut him loose and lead him through 
               the crowd, the people begin to jeer and throw things at him: 
               chicken bones, rocks, empty tankards.

               We see a former English soldier, one of those who fled in 
               terror at the battle of Stirling, lift a stone from the street 
               and hurl it; it cracks against Wallace's cheek.

               Wallace's eyes capture the soldier, and hold him, piercing 
               his soul. The soldier looks away in shame, even as the rest 
               of the crowd jeers more.

               Grim magistrates prod Wallace and he climbs the execution 
               platform. On the platform are a noose, a dissection table 
               with knives in plain view, and a chopping block with an 
               enormous axe. Wallace sees it all.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         We will use it all before this is 
                         over. Or fall to your knees now, 
                         declare yourself the king's loyal 
                         subject, and beg his mercy, and you 
                         shall have it.

               He emphasizes "mercy" by pointing to the axe. Wallace is 
               pale, and trebles -- but he shakes his head. The CROWD grows 
               noisier as they put the noose around Wallace's neck...

               WE INTERCUT:

               -- THE PRINCESS, in helpless agony, hearing the DISTANT NOISE 
               from her room in the palace...

               -- Hamish and Stephen, disguised as peasants among the crowd, 
               helpless too, but there, as if to shoulder some of the pain.

               -- Longshanks, rattling, coughing blood, as Edward watches.

               -- Robert the Bruce paces along the walls of his castle in 
               Scotland. His eyes are haunted; he grips the embroidered 
               handkerchief that belonged to Wallace.

               ON THE EXECUTION STAND

               a trio of burly hooded executioners cinch a rope around 
               Wallace's neck and hoist him up a pole.

                                     CROWD
                         That's it! Stretch him!

               In the SCORE, AMAZING GRACE, wailed on bagpipes, carries 
               through all that happens now... Ties hand and foot, Wallace 
               is strangling. The Magistrate watches coldly; even when the 
               executioner gives him a look that says they're about to go 
               too far, he prolongs the moment; then the Magistrate nods 
               and the executioner cuts the rope. Wallace slams to the 
               platform; the Magistrate leans to him.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Pleasant, yes? Rise to your knees, 
                         kiss the royal emblem on my cloak, 
                         and you will feel no more.

               With great effort, Wallace rises to his knees. The Magistrate 
               assumes a formal posture and offers the cloak.

               Wallace struggles all the way to his feet.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Very well then. Rack him.

               The executioners slam Wallace onto his back on the table, 
               spread his arms and legs, and tie each to a crank. Goaded by 
               the crowd, they pull the ropes taut. They crowd grows quiet 
               enough to hear the groaning of Wallace's limbs. Hamish and 
               Stephen feel it in their own bodies.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Wonderful, isn't it, that a man 
                         remains conscious through such pain. 
                         Enough?

               Wallace shakes his head. The executioners cut off his clothes, 
               take hot irons from a fire box. The crowd grows silent; we 
               see them, not Wallace, as the irons are touched to his body, 
               but we hear the burning of flesh. Then the Magistrate signals; 
               Wallace wants to say something.

                                     WALLACE
                         That... will... clear your sinuses.

               Everyone hears; Hamish smiles, even through his tears.

               Rebuffed, the Magistrate nods to the executioners, who lift 
               the terrible instruments of dissection.

               We are spared seeing the cutting: we are ON WALLACE'S FACE 
               as the disembowelment begins. The Magistrate leans in beside 
               him.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         It can all end. Right now! Bliss. 
                         Peace. Just say it. Cry out. "Mercy!" 
                         Yes?... Yes?

               The crowd can't hear the magistrate but they know the 
               procedure, and they goad Wallace, chanting...

                                     CROWD
                         Mer-cy! Mer-cy! Mer-cy!

               Wallace's eyes roll to the magistrate, who signals QUIET!

                                     MAGISTRATE
                              (booming)
                         The prisoner wishes to say a word!

               SILENCE. Hamish and Stephen weep, whisper, pray...

                                     HAMISH AND STEPHEN
                         Mercy, William... Say Mercy...

               Wallace's eyes flutter, and clear. He fights through the 
               pain, struggles for one last deep breath, and screams...

                                     WALLACE
                         FREEEEE-DOMMMMMM!

               The shout RINGS through the town. Hamish hears it. The 
               Princess hears it, at her open window, and touches her tummy, 
               just showing the first signs of her pregnancy. Longshanks 
               and his son seem to hear; the cry STILL ECHOES as if the 
               wind could carry it through the ends of Scotland; and Robert 
               the Bruce, on the walls of his castle, looks up sharply, as 
               if he has heard...

               IN THE LONDON SQUARE

               the crowd has never seen courage like this; even English 
               strangers begin to weep. The angry, defeated magistrate gives 
               a signal. They cut the ropes, drag Wallace over and put his 
               head on the block. The executioner lifts his huge axe -- and 
               Wallace looks toward the crowd.

               THE CROWD, WALLACE'S POV

               He sees Hamish, eyes brimming, face glowing...

               SLOW MOTION - THE AXE

               begins to drop.

               WALLACE'S POV

               In the last half-moment of his life, when he has already 
               stepped into the world beyond this one, he glimpses someone 
               standing at Hamish's shoulder. She is beautiful, smiling, 
               serene.

               She is Marion.

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

               ROBERT THE BRUCE

               His face has changed. He is standing AT THE OPEN GRAVE WHERE 
               MARION LAY, the headstone carved with the thistle still there. 
               He holds the handkerchief. As he tucks it into his own pocket, 
               and we MOVE IN on his eyes, we realize the VOICE OVER belongs 
               to him.

                                     ROBERT (V.O.)
                         After the beheading, William Wallace's 
                         body was torn to pieces. His head 
                         was set on London bridge, where 
                         passerby were invited to jeer at the 
                         man who had caused so much fear in 
                         England.
                              (beat)
                         His arms and legs were sent to the 
                         four corners of Britain as warning.

               EXT. SCOTTISH TOWNS - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

               We see the people, as the remains of William Wallace are 
               displayed in a box. The faces of the young men are fiery.

                                     ROBERT (V.O.)
                         It did not have the effect that 
                         Longshanks planned.

               More young men put on tartans, take up their weapons, and 
               gather into fighting units. Among them is Hamish, carrying a 
               shield emblazoned with a cocked arm holding a broadsword, 
               and the words "For Freedom."

               EXT. SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - DAY

               Robert the Bruce, flanked by the noblemen and the banners of 
               the Scottish throne, and backed by a ragtag army of Scots, 
               sits on his horse and looks down at the English generals in 
               their martial finery. The English are haughty, victorious, 
               at the head of their colorful, polished army, awaiting the 
               ceremony of submission from Scotland's new king.

                                     ROBERT (V.O.)
                         And I, Robert the Bruce, backed by a 
                         body of Scottish veterans, rode out 
                         to pay homage to the armies of the 
                         English king, and accept his 
                         endorsement of my crown.

               FROM BELOW, ON THE OPEN PLAIN - DAY

               The Scots -- the remains of William Wallace's army -- look 
               so ragged and defeated that it hardly seems worth the wait. 
               One ENGLISH COMMANDER turns and jokes with another...

                                     ENGLISH COMMANDER
                         I hope you washed your ass this mornin -- 
                         it's never been kissed by a king 
                         before.

               UP ON THE HILL, Robert the Bruce sits on his horse, and waits. 
               He looks down at the English generals, at their banners, 
               their army. He looks down the ranks at his own.

               He sees Hamish. Stephen. Old MacClannough is there, his eyes 
               watery, his weapon sharp. The Scottish bride Lord Bottoms 
               took is there, among the ragtag archers, her husband beside 
               her. Robert knows none of them -- yet he knows them all.

               Old Craig, among the other Scottish nobles mounted beside 
               the Bruce, grows impatient.

                                     CRAIG
                         Come, let's get it over with.

               But Robert holds something -- uncurling his fist, he looks 
               at the thistle handkerchief that belonged to Wallace. The 
               nobles start to rein their horses toward the English.

                                     ROBERT
                         Stop.

               Robert the Bruce tucks the handkerchief safely behind his 
               breastplate, and turns to the Highlanders who line the hilltop 
               with him. He takes a long breath, and shouts --

                                     ROBERT THE BRUCE
                         You have bled with Wallace! Now bleed 
                         with me!

               Bruce's broadsword slides from its scabbard. A cry rises 
               from Highlanders, as from a tomb, rising --

                                     SCOTS
                         Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace!

               The chant builds to a frenzy; it shakes the earth. The 
               Scottish nobles can scarcely believe it; the English are 
               shocked even more. Robert the Bruce, king of Scotland, spurs 
               his horse into full gallop toward the English, and the 
               Highlanders hurl their bodies down the hill, ready to run 
               through hell itself. In SLOW MOTION we see their faces...

               And OVER THIS, we hear the voice of William Wallace...

                                     WALLACE'S VOICE
                         In the year of our Lord 1314, patriots 
                         of Scotland, starving and outnumbered, 
                         charged the fields of Bannockburn. 
                         They fought like warrior poets. They 
                         fought like Scotsmen. And won their 
                         freedom. Forever.

               On Wallace's army behind Robert the Bruce, charging down the 
               hill to victory and glory, we slow to FREEZE FRAME and hear 
               their chant, huge, echoing...

                                     SCOTS
                         Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace!

                                                                  FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

EXTREMELY TIGHT ON ELECTRONIC GUTS

of a video camera. The screwdriver blade of a Swiss Army
knife ENTERS FRAME, methodically tightening a row of
screws.

PULL BACK to reveal:


EXT. BOMBARDED NEIGHBORHOOD (WAR-TORN COUNTRY) - DAY

On the backslope of a mound of rubble, a three-man TV
crew (field producer, reporter, and cameraman, all
wearing flak jackets) waits while the cameraman, JEFFREY
TAYLOR, works to repair his malfunctioning minicam.

Throughout this sequence, ROD, the reporter, types on a
laptop computer, oblivious to what is happening around
him.

HOWARD, the field producer, lies on his stomach, peering
cautiously over the crest of the rubble through
binoculars.

Beyond him we see an empty street. It is lined with
buildings blasted by shells: a sawtooth wall in the
f.g., a ruined high-rise at the end of the street,
billboards in an unrecognizable foreign language.

                         HOWARD
           How about it, Jeff?

Jeff finishes his repair job, snaps the minicam closed.

                           JEFF
           Done.

Jeff slips the knife back in his pocket, scrambles over
the loose bricks and stones to a position next to Howard.


EXT. SAWTOOTH WALL - DAY

A frightened woman lurks nervously in the shelter of the
wall. She is young, in her early twenties, with shining
dark hair down to her shoulders. She's carrying an
armload of books.


EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE - DAY

Jeff focuses the minicam.

                                                        2.

MINICAM POV

FRAMED in the viewfinder we see the frightened woman.

                           HOWARD (O.S.)
          Nice legs.

Jeff ignores Howard, PANS the minicam DOWN the street.
In the viewfinder we see the flash of sun on metal.


EXT. RUINED HIGH-RISE - DAY

A row of blasted windows. In one of the windows, a
sniper crouches. Sunlight glitters on his rifle barrel.


EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE

                           JEFF
                    (matter-of-fact)
          Sniper.

                           HOWARD
          Where?

                       JEFF
          High-rise. Top floor.        Window in
          the middle.

                        HOWARD
                 (looking through
                  his binoculars)
          Stay on him. Stay on him.        Now go
          back to the woman. Now!

Jeff swings the minicam and --


EXT. SAWTOOTH WALL - MINICAM POV

-- the image blurs, then holds steady on the frightened
woman. Nervously, she peeks around the corner.

                        HOWARD (O.S.)
          Back to the sniper.


EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE

                        HOWARD
          Stay tight on the sniper.
          Jesus -- look at him! He's about
          fourteen! Don't lose this!

Jeff kneels on the ridge, minicam on his shoulder.

                                                      3.

EXT. RUINED HIGH-RISE - POV THROUGH VIEWFINDER

Jeff's minicam ZOOMS IN ON the sniper. The sniper sees
the woman peeking and gets his rifle in firing position.

                          JEFF
          He sees her.


EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE

                        HOWARD
          Stay on her. If she runs, widen
          and try to get her and sniper in
          the same frame.

Jeff turns his head away from the camera and stares at
Howard.

                        JEFF
          I said he sees her.

                          HOWARD
          I heard you.    Stay on her.

Jeff looks to Rod for support but he's busy typing,
oblivious.

Jeff hesitates, then lifts the minicam to his eye again.


EXT. RUINED HIGH-RISE

The sniper, taking aim.


EXT. SAWTOOTH WALL

The frightened woman decides to make a dash for it.   She
takes off her high-heeled shoes, inhales deeply,
gathering herself to run.


EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE

Jeff watches through his viewfinder:

                        JEFF
                 (under his breath)
          No... no...


EXT. STREET

The frightened woman bolts, sprinting barefoot across the
cobblestones, skirt lifted, slender legs flashing.

                                                       4.

EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE

Jeff jumps to his feet, waves the minicam, shouting:

                         JEFF
          Sniper!   Sniper! Sni--


STREET

The woman looks up in Jeff's direction, confused,
breaking stride --

We hear a burst of automatic gunfire --


RUINED HIGH-RISE

In the window, the winking muzzle-flash of the sniper's
AK-47.


STREET

The woman's body jolts from the impact of the bullets.
The books go flying from her hand. She spins to the
pavement, her hair billowing.


JEFF

just stands there, a shattered expression. The camera
hangs at his side. He stares at the dead woman as a pool
of dark blood expands around her body.

                                           CUT TO:


EXT. LOGAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (BOSTON) - RUNWAY -
NIGHT

A 747 touches down on the tarmac.

                                           CUT TO:


EXT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL - NIGHT

A late-model Jeep Cherokee is parked at the arrival curb.
AMY TAYLOR, Jeff's wife, peers out from behind the wheel,
scanning the crowd.


HER POV

Jeff, carrying a single bag slung over his shoulder,
emerges from the terminal.

                                                           5.

BACK TO SCENE

Amy gets out of the car, grinning. Jeff sees her and
hurries over. He drops his bag and they fall into each
other's arms, kissing hungrily. These are two people
passionately in love with each other.

                        AMY
          God, I missed you.

                           JEFF
          Me too.

                        AMY
          Let's get out of here. Where's
          your equipment? Don't tell me you
          checked it?

                        JEFF
                 (holds up his bag)
          This is it.

                           AMY
          No camera?

Jeff shakes his head no.

                           AMY
          No nothing?

Again Jeff shakes his head.       Amy arches an eyebrow.

                           AMY
          Ah ha.

                                                CUT TO:


INT. JEFF AND AMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A modest apartment in the Back Bay neighborhood. Not
much furniture, but lots of books and CD's. On the
walls, blow-ups of arty photographs -- Amy in modeling
poses, plus many black-and-white scenery stills.

Jeff's bag is unopened on the floor. We see two nearly
full wine glasses on a table. The CAMERA TRACKS DOWN a
hallway TO the open bedroom door.


INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

More framed photographs.

Amy lies in bed, curled up against a pillow. The sheets
are tangled in post-coital disarray, the only sign of
disorder in this neatly arranged room.

                                                         6.

CLOSER

Amy stirs, reaching her hand out toward the other side of
the bed, which is empty. She opens her eyes, surprised
to find herself alone.

                              AMY
             Jeff?

No reply.

Something catches her attention from across the room.
She rises, pulls a loose robe around herself and pads
over to a closed door. She knocks softly.

                              AMY
             Can I come in?

                              JEFF (O.S.)
             Sure.


INT. DARKROOM - NIGHT

A walk-in closet has been converted into a small
photographic darkroom. Moist 8 X 10 prints hang from a
clothesline, bathed in a warm red glow. The images are
moody black and white landscapes.

Jeff stands over the developer, timing a print. Amy
enters through a thick black curtain behind him. He
doesn't look up.

                           AMY
             Couldn't sleep?

Jeff shakes his head. Amy looks over his shoulder at a
landscape photograph in the developing tray.

                           AMY
             I remember when you took that. We
             had fun on that trip, didn't we?

Jeff nods.    Amy looks at him.     After a beat:

                           AMY
             You want to talk about it?

                           JEFF
             There's nothing to talk about.

                            AMY
             C'mon, Jeff.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                       7.

CONTINUED:

                           JEFF
             I told you. I quit.   Walked out.
             end of story.

                            AMY
             That's   it?

Jeff nods.

                        AMY
          Whatever happened back there
          wasn't your responsibility. You
          can't keep beating yourself up
          over it.

He says nothing.

                        AMY
          What do you think? You could have
          stopped that girl from getting
          killed?

                        JEFF
          You don't understand...

He stops, lifts his eyes.

                        JEFF
          It was different this time.

He breaks off and pushes through the curtain.    She
watches him go.

                                             CUT TO:


INT. LIVING ROOM - KITCHEN AREA - NIGHT

Jeff pours himself a glass of milk. Amy enters, stands
on the other side of the counter. Jeff doesn't meet her
eyes. After a beat:

                       JEFF
         I talked to Reynolds.
                (a beat)
         He thinks I could still get the
         job at the San Diego station.

                       AMY
         Oh, Jeff, you didn't...

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                           8.

CONTINUED:

                           JEFF
             Think of it. Low pressure, a
             steady paycheck. So I shoot city
             council meetings -- how bad could
             it be?

She looks at him, concerned.

                           AMY
             Is that what you really want -- or
             are you just running away?

                       JEFF
         Who's running? It's good money,
         full benefits. I'm tired of
         freelance. We could finally put
         some money in the bank.

                       AMY
         You know I'll never stand in your
         way. But you've worked so hard.
         Are you sure you want to throw it
         away?

                       JEFF
         Throw what away? Don't you get
         it? I don't do anything. I sit,
         I watch, I film -- I let it
         happen.

                           AMY
             You're supposed to let it happen.
             It's your job.

                            JEFF
             No, Amy.   It's my excuse.

She looks at him, not understanding.       He hesitates.

                        JEFF
          That girl... it's like I was
          paralyzed. I wanted to do
          something, but I didn't. I just
          stood there and watched her get
          killed.

He looks at her, emotional.

                           JEFF
             Please, babe, I need this.     Say
             yes and we'll take as long    as you
             want -- drive cross-country    and
             make a vacation out of it.     What
             do you say?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                        9.

Amy looks at him, considering. We hear a faint RUSH OF
WIND. Then it gets LOUDER... LOUDER... and --

                                              CUT TO:


EXT. CREDIT MONTAGE - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - LOW ANGLE -
DAY AND NIGHT

The metallic grill of the Cherokee explodes INTO FRAME as
the car whooshes over us, hurtling down the Massachusetts
Turnpike.

In a SERIES OF SHOTS, with CREDITS OVER, we see landmarks
form the cross-country trip: a Pennsylvania Dutch
farmhouse, a smoke-spewing factory in Ohio, the
Mississippi River, Kansas wheat fields, Loveland Pass and
the Continental Divide.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. OPEN DESERT - DAY

The middle of nowhere. Sand, weeds and sagebrush. A
two-lane highway stretches to the horizon like a ribbon
of asphalt.

The Cherokee cruises along the road. Its Massachusetts
plates seem out of place in this stark landscape.

There are no other vehicles.

MOVING CLOSER, we see that Jeff is driving.    Amy is sound
asleep in the reclined passenger seat.

In back, luggage, moving boxes, camera cases.


INT. JEEP CHEROKEE - DAY

The AIR CONDITIONING WHISPERS. On the console are two
empty Styrofoam McDonald's coffee cups and a state-of-
the-art Nikon Camera.

Jeff stretches in the driver's seat. He forces his eyes
open, fighting sleep. He reaches for the coffee cup...
it's empty. He glances into the back of the Jeep. There
is a thermos of coffee on the back seat.

Keeping one hand on the wheel, he reaches for the thermos
and fumbles it to the floor. He strains to reach it. He
doesn't notice...

                                                     10.

EXT. HIGHWAY - 200 YARDS AHEAD

A slow-moving Dodge Ram pickup truck is approaching the
highway along a small road that cuts across the desert
floor.

The pickup, equipped with oversized tires, roll bar, and
a CB whip antenna, bounces over the uneven terrain and
turns onto the highway, stopping just before entering
Jeff's lane.


INT. CHEROKEE - DAY

Jeff glances up just in time to see the Ram lurch into
the road in front of him. Jeff drops the thermos and
spins the wheel!

Amy's eyes fly open --


EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The Cherokee goes into a wild looping skid. The Ram
jerks to a halt as the Cherokee whips past, averting a
collision by inches.


INT. CHEROKEE - DAY

Jeff expels a breath. Amy turns to see the pickup
stopped in the road. She looks at him, concerned.

                           AMY
          Jesus, Jeff...

                           JEFF
          Sorry.     I took my eyes off the
          road.

                        AMY
                 (seeing thermos
                  on floor)
          Maybe it's time we took a break,
          you know?

Jeff nods, looks in the rearview mirror.


HIS POV - PICKUP

halted in the middle of the road. Inside, dimly-visible
through tinted windows, are two figures in cowboy hats.

The driver leans out the window and gives Jeff the
finger.

                                                        11.

BACK TO JEFF

angry at himself.    He looks over at Amy.

                        JEFF
          I'll pull over next chance we get.
                 (a beat)
          Sorry...

He glances in the rearview again, still a bit shaken.

                                              CUT TO:


EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

A small desert gas station/mini-mart just off the
highway. A sign over the building: "Last Gas For 30
Miles." The Cherokee is parked at the pumps, hood
raised.

Jeff comes out of the mini-mart, carrying a   plastic quart
of oil. He unscrews the cap and starts to    fill the
crankcase, careful not to spill on the new   engine. In
the b.g., Amy is visible inside the store,   browsing a
magazine rack.


INT. CONVENIENCE MART - SAME TIME

Amy thumbs through a cheap tourist guide, The Desert
Southwest. A TRUCK DRIVER stands nearby, perusing the
magazines. He glances in Amy's direction, notices what
she's reading.

                          TRUCKER
          On vacation?

Amy looks up at him. He's 50ish, plain-looking,
friendly, wearing a "U.S.A." logo baseball cap.

                          AMY
          Sort of.    We're moving, actually.

                         TRUCKER
          Whereabouts?

Amy hesitates. She's not used to talking with strangers,
but the guy seems harmless enough.

                        AMY
          California. We thought we'd take
          the scenic route.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                         TRUCKER
           Huh. In that case, you oughta try
           the Pass Road, 'bout thirty miles
           west. Real pretty, makes a loop
           through the hills, then hooks back
           up with the highway.

Amy smiles politely, moves toward the cash register.

                        AMY
           Thanks. I'll mention it to my
           husband.

The Trucker tips his cap.

                         TRUCKER
           Okay, then. Good luck.   Enjoy the
           rest of your trip.


EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

As Jeff continues pouring the oil, he doesn't notice the
mud-streaked Dodge Ram pickup pulling up to the pumps
behind him. The driver, EARL, climbs out. The other man
remains in the cab with the smoked windows rolled up.

Earl is a beefy man about Jeff's age. He wears a sweat-
stained Western hat, cowboy boots and a T-shirt with the
sleeves cut out to display his tattooed biceps. He
saunters over to the Cherokee, stands there a beat,
looking over Jeff's shoulder.

Jeff senses something behind him, turns. His eyes widen
as he sees Earl, recognizes the pickup as the one he
nearly hit a few minutes before. Earl stares at him,
unsmiling.

                         EARL
                  (flatly)
           Nice car.

Jeff is in an awkward position. He's got a half-full
upside-down bottle of oil in his hands. If he lifts it
now, he'll spill on the engine. He turns his gaze back
to the engine, decides to keep pouring.

                         JEFF
           Thanks.

Earl steps around to the open passenger window, peers in.
Jeff watches him, wary.

                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                         13.

CONTINUED:

                           EARL
             Air, C.D., leather -- I guess you
             sprung for the whole nine yards.

                              JEFF
             I guess.

                           EARL
             Then again, out here, what you
             really need's a C.B. radio.

                              JEFF
             Is that right?

The oil bottle empties    out. Relieved, Jeff pulls it away
and screws back on the    crankcase cap. He shuts the hood
with a thunk and moves    around to the side of the car to
remove the gas nozzle    from the tank. Earl blocks his
path.

                           EARL
             'Course, if you use a C.B., you
             gotta have a handle.

Jeff says nothing.      This is not a friendly conversation.

                           EARL
             How about Shit-for-Brains?
                    (beat)
             You damn near killed us back
             there, boy.

                       JEFF
         Look, I'm sorry, I didn't see you.
         You pulled out in front of me.

                       EARL
         The hell I did. I saw what
         happened.

Looking past Earl, Jeff sees Amy come out of the mini-
mart with a bag of groceries. He speaks carefully,
anxious to avoid a confrontation.

                       JEFF
         How about if we just forget it,
         okay? I'm sorry it happened. I
         don't want any trouble.

                          EARL
                   (snorting)
         Yeah.     I bet you don't.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                       14.

CONTINUED:

Earl glares at Jeff before turning away.    He passes Amy,
gives her a broad smile.

                           EARL
             Howdy, ma'am. Caught this fellow
             tryin' to steal your Cherokee.

Amy takes in the situation. She nods politely. Earl
continues into the mini-mart. She approaches Jeff,
puzzled.

                           AMY
             What was that about?

                           JEFF
             Nothing. Guy in the truck.
             Thinks I tried to hit him.

Jeff glances apprehensively at the man in the pickup, who
has not moved during the scene. He looks back at the
mini-mart.

                           JEFF
             C'mon, let's go.

                           AMY
             You want me to drive?

                            JEFF
             Later.   Just get in.

                           AMY
             Is something wrong?

                           JEFF
             No, let's just go.

Jeff climbs in behind the wheel. Amy glances at him and
gets in the car. Jeff keys the IGNITION and pulls away.


INT. CHEROKEE - DRIVING - DAY

As Jeff steers back onto the highway, he glances in the
rear-view mirror, sees --


MIRROR POV

Earl coming out of the mini-mart, staring after the
disappearing Jeep.

CONTINUED:

Jeff shifts in his seat, relieved to be getting away from
there. Amy watches the speedometer as it climbs to 75,
then 80, then 85.

                           AMY
             This isn't the Grand Prix, you
             know.

Jeff releases his foot from the accelerator.     The needle
sinks back down to 65.

She gives him a long contemplative look.

                           AMY
             What's bothering you?

                         JEFF
          I told you. Nothing.
                 (pause)
          The guy was an asshole.

Keeping an eye on the rear-view mirror, Jeff nods toward
the grocery bag, trying to change the subject.

                        JEFF
          What'd you get?

Amy pulls out an assortment of candy bars and junk food.

                        AMY
          Junk food fiesta. Sno Balls, Yoo
          Hoo, Moon pies... can you believe
          they still make this stuff?

                        JEFF
          You kidding. It's probably
          gourmet cuisine around here.

                                              CUT TO:


EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - AERIAL - DAY

Far below us, the Cherokee traces the empty highway.
There are no buildings, no houses, no other vehicles.

INT. CHEROKEE - DRIVING - FEW MINUTES LATER

Jeff drives in silence. Amy stares out the window,
bored. Looking for a distraction, she picks up a
cellophane package of doughnuts and peruses the label.

                    (trying to brighten
                     the mood)
             This is crazy. Look at this.
             Says if you win this mail-in
             contest, you can choose either
             ninety thousand dollars or ninety
             thousand doughnuts.

She gives him a playful glance.

                           AMY
             What would you do with ninety
             thousand doughnuts?

Jeff shrugs, disinterested.

                           JEFF
             I dunno... Sell 'em for thirty
             cents each and pay off this car.

                           AMY
             Very funny.
                    (beat)
             Alright, what about ninety
             thousand dollars? What would you
             do with that?

Jeff stares out the window.       He's not into this.

                          JEFF
          I don't know.    Look, Amy, I'm
          not --

Suddenly his eyes drop to the console between them --

                        JEFF
          Sonofabitch!! My camera!        He
          stole my camera!

          The redneck at the gas station!
          He lifted it right under my nose!
          My brand new Nikon.
                 (pounds wheel
                  in frustration)
          Goddammit.

                           AMY
             Should we go back?

                        JEFF
          What's the use. He's probably

          bastard.

                        AMY
          Look, maybe if we call the cops --

Jeff is about to reply when suddenly the car bucks.

                            JEFF
          What the hell?

The car gives another jolt.

                        AMY
          What'd you do?

                            JEFF
          Nothing.   I --

A warning light flashes on the instrument panel. The
brakes and steering lose power. The engine quits cold.

                        JEFF
          Hang on -- I can't steer!

The CAR bucks and SCREECHES. After a few HICCUPS, it
jerks to a halt, just beyond a crest in the road.

For a moment, they sit there dazed, staring ahead at the
empty road. Then Amy notices an object on the floor --
the Nikon. She picks it up.

                        AMY
                 (deadpan)
          Found your camera.

He rolls his eyes.   He yanks the hood release and gets
out.


EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Steam pours from under the    hood of the Cherokee. Amy
gets out and looks around    at the scorched wasteland.
Jeff goes to the front of    the car, gropes under the hood
for the release latch. He     yanks his hand away, burned by
the hot metal.

                         JEFF
          Ow!

                             JEFF
             I'm fine.

Amy moves to Jeff to examine the burn.     She reaches out.

                        JEFF
                 (annoyed)
          I said I'm fine, okay?

Jeff lifts the hood, examines the engine. He tugs on a
cable, checks the battery connection and radiator.

He goes to the passenger's side and takes a hand-held
cellular phone from the glove box. He dials zero and
hits "send." The PHONE BEEPS.

                             AMY
          Out of range?

Jeff grunts, tosses the phone on the seat. It bounces
and lands on the floor. Amy watches as he returns to the
engine and begins unscrewing the radiator cap.

                        AMY
          What's going on, Jeff?

                        JEFF
          What's it look like?      I'm trying
          to fix the car.

                             AMY
          Not the car.

                             JEFF
          What?

                        AMY
          What's going on with you?

Jeff busies himself with the engine, not answering.

                         AMY
          It's been a month since you got
          back. You can't keep shutting me
          out like this.

Jeff says nothing.

                        AMY
          Jeff, I'm talking to you.

             Look, I really don't want to go

He stops in mid-sentence. There is a RUMBLE in the
distance. They look down the road.

                           JEFF
             Christ, not these guys...


JEFF'S POV - DODGE RAM PICKUP

approaching fast on the road. As it streaks past, Earl
yells and launches a beer bottle from the window. The
BOTTLE SHATTERS on the asphalt.


BACK TO JEFF

watching the Ram speed away.

                           JEFF
          Asshole...

                           AMY
                    (looking down
                     the road)
          Jeff --

A quarter-mile away, the pickup is slowing. It pulls a
U-turn and stops, facing the Cherokee. It just sits
there, ENGINE IDLING.

                           JEFF
          What the hell?

                        AMY
          What's he doing?

                          JEFF
         I don't know.

Jeff watches the pickup, frowning. Then, from the
opposite direction, they hear a LOW RUMBLE. They turn
and stare at --

                                                         20.

MASSIVE TRACTOR-TRAILER

coming over a crest in the road.

It's a huge eighteen-wheeler. A white 1988 Peterbilt.
It grinds into low gear and slows, BRAKES CREAKING.

The TRUCK comes to a halt with a HISS of compressed air.


DOWN HIGHWAY

the PICKUP STARTS UP again. It pulls another U-turn and
drives away, melting into the desert.


AMY

breathes a sigh of relief.

The driver dismounts from the cab, leaving the ENGINE
IDLING. We recognize him as the Trucker in the mini-
mart. He removes his cap, revealing a shock of
prematurely white hair. He is well-shaven, his clothes
immaculate. His name is Red.

                        RED (TRUCKER)
          You folks all right?

                         JEFF
          Yeah.   Our car broke down.

                        RED
                 (chuckling)
          I figured that much. You want a
          hand pushing it off the road?

                        JEFF
          Thanks, I'd appreciate it.    Amy,
          you want to steer?

Amy gets behind the wheel and puts the shift in neutral.
Jeff and Red push the car to the shoulder. As they push,
Jeff glances at the CB antenna on Red's cab.

                        JEFF
          Think you could radio a tow truck
          for us?

                       RED
         I sure would if I could, mister,
         but my C.B. blew a fuse this
         morning. I'm waiting till I hit
         the truck stop on I-40 to get it
         fixed.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                        21.

CONTINUED:

                           JEFF
             How far is that?

                           RED
             About 60 miles.

                            JEFF
                     (disappointed)
             Oh.

Red walks around to the front of the car and peers down
at the exposed engine.

                        RED
          I'd offer to take a look, but it's
          hard to say with these new
          engines. Used to be, you could
          give 'em a kick and a holler and
          they'd start right up. Now it's
          all computers and chips.

                        JEFF
          It's a new car.

                        RED
          That could be the problem. You
          been running it pretty fast?

Amy gives Jeff a reprimanding look.     It's subtle, but Red
notices.

                        RED
          Tell you what. If you want a
          ride, there's a little diner up
          the road. Belle's. They got a
          pay phone. You could call a tow
          truck from there.

Jeff considers this, glances back to where the Dodge Ram
was last seen.

                            JEFF
          Nice     of you to offer. But we've
          got a     lot of stuff in the car. I
          think     we're better off waiting for
          a cop     to come along.

Amy rolls her eyes. Red sees the look, trying not to
smile. He glances up at a small plane flying overhead.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                            22.

CONTINUED:

                              RED
                       (casually)
             Suit    yourself. Not many cops on
             this    road, that's why the truckers
             use    it. Maybe you'll get lucky.
                       (tipping his cap)
             Good    luck.

He turns and heads back toward his truck. Amy looks at
Jeff. She waits till the trucker is out of earshot.

                             AMY
             Are you nuts?

                           JEFF
             We don't know this guy.

                        AMY
          He's offering to help. It       could
          be hours before anyone else      comes
          along. It's 100 degrees.        You
          really want to be stuck out      here?

                        JEFF
          Amy, I've got my equipment in the
          car. All our stuff. What if
          those guys come back and we're not
          here?
                 (turns away,
                  quietly to
                  himself)
          Jesus... don't be stupid...

Amy hears this.       She's had enough.   Flares.

                        AMY
          Stupid is sitting out here waiting
          for a cop when we already have a
          ride.

In the b.g., the TRUCK is THROTTLING UP.       Then, mad and
careless:

                           AMY
             Stupid was letting you talk me
             into leaving Boston.

She turns away. The truck starts to pull out. She bites
her lip, thinking, then steps into the road and flags the
truck down. Red brakes.

                           AMY
             Excuse me? Do you think you could
             drop me at that diner?

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                       23.

CONTINUED:

                           RED
                    (surprised)
             Sure thing. How about you,
             mister? I could take you both
             just as easy.

                        AMY
          That's okay. My husband wants to
          stay with the car. I'll just get
          my purse.

She goes to the passenger side of the Jeep for her purse.
Jeff follows, lowering his voice.

                        JEFF
          What do you think you're doing?

                        AMY
          I'm going to the diner. I'm going
          to call a tow truck. Then I'm
          going to order an iced tea and
          wait. Good-bye, Jeff.

                        JEFF
                 (firm)
          You're not riding with that guy.
          End of story.

                        AMY
          You wanted to be alone. Well...
          you're alone. Why don't you take
          the time to get your head
          together?

She walks to the truck. Jeff stands there. She climbs
into the cab. Red moves some papers out of the way.

                        RED
          Watch your step, ma'am.

She pulls the door shut. The TRUCK THROTTLES UP and
pulls away. Jeff watches the truck dwindle in the
distance, flashers blinking. After a beat, the flashers
cease.

                                        SLOW DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. ROADSIDE - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

Beneath a blazing sun, Jeff paces restlessly in front of
the Cherokee, checking his watch, wiping beads of sweat
from his face. He looks down the highway.

CONTINUED:

Nothing in sight. Extremely bored, he wanders over to
the raised hood and studies the engine again.

After a few moments, something catches his eye. Curious,
he kneels down and peers under the chassis. He frowns.


JEFF'S POV - LOOSE WIRE

dangling under the engine.


BACK TO JEFF

                          JEFF
            Oh for Christ's sake...

He pulls his Swiss Army knife  from his pocket and slides
under the car. Working with   the screwdriver blade of the
knife, he reconnects the plug  to its socket. In the
process, his hands and shirt  become stained with grease.

Jeff slides out from under the car, brushes himself off
and gets behind the wheel. He tosses the Swiss Army
knife on the center console and keys the ignition. The
ENGINE ROARS to life.

                                               CUT TO:


EXT. DESERT ROAD - MINUTES LATER

The Cherokee speeds down the empty highway.


INT. CHEROKEE - SAME TIME

Jeff drives, a determined expression.


EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

The Jeep blows past.

                                               DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. BELLE'S DINER - DAY

A weather-beaten structure with a gravel parking lot.     A
peeling sign on the roof: "Belle's: Beer & Food."
There is a phone booth outside.

The Cherokee pulls in and parks.      Jeff CHIRPS the ALARM,
heads for the entrance.

                                                       25.

INT. BELLE'S - DAY

Dark and dingy. Formica tables, a bar. Chunky customers
in K-Mart clothes sit at the bar, nursing beers and
watching a football game on a big MUTED TV.

Jeff enters and all conversation stops. The other
patrons turn and stare. After a moment, they return to
their beers.

Jeff glances around.   No sign of Amy.   No sign of Red.

A bored-looking BARTENDER stands behind the counter,
preparing a sandwich. Behind him, a blackboard menu.
Jeff approaches.

                         JEFF
          Excuse me.

The Bartender looks up, a cutting knife in his hand.

                        JEFF
          I was supposed to meet my wife
          here.

The Bartender shrugs, gives him a look:    Yeah, so?

                        JEFF
          Dark hair, slender, about five-
          five. Wearing a pale blue
          Benetton shirt.

                        BARTENDER
          A pale blue what?

                        JEFF
          Benetton shirt.

The Bartender plops the sandwich on a plate, tears off an
order slip.

                        BARTENDER
          Hank!  Your order's ready.
                 (to Jeff)
          I been busy. They come and go.

                       JEFF
         It would've been within the last
         half hour. She might've been with
         a trucker?

                        BARTENDER
         A trucker.

             Guy with a baseball cap.   Driving
             an eighteen wheeler.

The Bartender thinks a moment, shakes his head.

                           BARTENDER
             Don't ring a bell.

                           JEFF
             You sure?

The Bartender leans over the counter, calls out:

                           BARTENDER
             Hey! Man here's looking for his
             wife, dark hair, button-on shirt,
             travelin' with a guy in a baseball
             cap. Anybody see 'em?

Jeff looks up and down the counter. Blank faces, a few
disinterested shrugs, a few headshakes no.

A disheveled female barfly, FLO, grins up at him.

                           FLO
             Looks like she got away from ya,
             cowboy.

A few of the regulars chuckle at this.     Jeff ignores
them, turns back to the Bartender.

                           JEFF
             Could she have left a message with
             another one of your employees?

                        BARTENDER
          Don't see how. I'm the only one
          who works here.

Jeff scratches his head.    This doesn't make any sense.

                        JEFF
          I don't understand. Is there
          another Belle's Diner?

                        BARTENDER
                 (chuckles)
          No siree. Definitely not.

Jeff clenches his jaw, takes another look around.      An
elderly couple sit at a rear table, watching him.      They
whisper to each other.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                     (under his breath)
             Shit.

He turns and goes outside...


EXT. BELLE'S - DAY

Jeff squints in the bright sunlight.

Maybe he got this place confused with a different diner.
He peers up at the sign. It says "Belle's," all right.

He walks to the phone booth, looks inside.   The phone
book is missing.

He picks up the receiver, listens for the dial tone...
Phone works okay. He hangs up.

He stands there for a moment, scanning the horizon in all
directions. There is nothing else out here, nowhere else
she could have gone.

Jeff marches back into the diner...


INT. DINER - DAY

Jeff goes to the Bartender.

                        JEFF
          Excuse me, how far is the next
          town?

                        BARTENDER
          About twenty miles.

                        JEFF
          Look, if my wife comes in -- her
          name is Amy -- tell her I was
          here. Tell her to stay put till I
          get back, not to move. Would you
          do that, please?

                            BARTENDER
                     (shrugs, bored)
             Okay.

Jeff regards the Bartender skeptically.    He takes one
last look around, then heads out.

                                                        28.

EXT. BELLE'S - DAY

Jeff marches briskly to his car and opens the door,
forgetting to deactivate the alarm. The SIREN WAILS.
Jeff fumbles for the remote and shuts if OFF.


HIGH ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER

The Cherokee pulls out of the parking lot, kicking up
gravel.

                                             CUT TO:


INT. CHEROKEE - DAY

The stereo is off, the windows rolled up.   Jeff drives,
his jaw set tightly.

The speedometer reads 88 mph.

EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - MINUTES LATER

The Cherokee crests a rise...


INT. CHEROKEE - DAY

... and then across the desert plain, traveling on
another road, he sees it...


PETERBILT

The 18-wheeler that picked up Amy.    Cruising leisurely.

Jeff presses the accelerator...


EXT. FORK IN ROAD - DAY

The Cherokee turns sharply onto the other road.


EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - AERIAL VIEW - DAY

The Cherokee speeds down the road, gaining on the
Peterbilt. It comes up behind.

                                                            29.

INT. CHEROKEE - DAY

Jeff HONKS his HORN, flashes his lights.

                         JEFF
           C'mon, you fat-ass.    Pull over.

Either the driver doesn't notice, or he's ignoring Jeff,
but the truck does not slow down.

Jeff shifts into the oncoming lane and pulls alongside
the cab. He HONKS again and waves, gesturing for the
truck to pull over. But the Peterbilt maintains its
speed.

Jeff cranes his neck to get a glimpse of the driver...


POV SHOT

It's Red, alright. But he's wearing a different cap.
FROM this ANGLE, we can't see into the passenger side of
the cab.

Red peers down at Jeff, puzzled.      Jeff shouts at him,
waves:

                           JEFF
           Pull over!    Pull over!

Red suddenly notices something ahead in the road, BLARES
his HORN.

Jeff looks up, sees --

An RV camper approaching in the oncoming lane!


HIGHWAY

Jeff swerves onto the far shoulder as the RV whooshes
past in the opposite direction, HORN BLARING.


CHEROKEE

Jeff is rattled, catching his breath.      He swings back
onto the road.


HIGHWAY

Jeff slips in ahead of the Peterbilt, then starts weaving
and braking, forcing the truck to slow.

Both vehicles pull to the side of the road and stop.
Jeff leaps out of the Cherokee and runs over as Red
climbs down from the empty cab.

(NOTE: Throughout this scene, various cars and trucks
pass in either direction.)

             Jesus, pal, what the hell you
             doing?

             I was signaling you to stop.
             Didn't you see me?

          No.

Jeff reacts.    How thick can this guy be?

                        JEFF
          Where's my wife?

                          RED
          Huh?

                          JEFF
          My wife.     Where is she?

Red gives him a puzzled look.

                        RED
          How should I know where your wife
          is?

                         JEFF
          I checked at the diner.      No one
          saw her there.

                         RED
          Mister, I don't know what you're
          talking about.

Jeff stares -- is this guy nuts?

                        JEFF
          You gave her a ride. You were
          supposed to drop her at Belle's
          diner.

Red searches his memory, trying to be as helpful as
possible. He shakes his head.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                            31.

CONTINUED:

                              RED
             Nope.   Sorry.

                           JEFF
             How can you not remember? It was
             just half an hour ago, for
             chrissakes!

Red gives him a peculiar look.

                           RED
             Mister, I never seen you before in
             my life.

Suddenly, there is a loud SQUAWK from inside the cab --
the CB RADIO.

                           CB VOICE (V.O.)
                    (filtered)
             Breaker, breaker -- Iron Man, you
             copy?

                           JEFF
                    (reacts)
             Your radio works --
                    (locks eyes with Red)
             What the hell are you doing -- ?

Jeff freaks out, circling the truck, calling loudly:

                              JEFF
             Amy?    Amy?!   You in there?

Red shrinks back, unnerved.

                           RED
             Look, mister, I don't know what
             you want, but --

                           JEFF
             I want my fucking wife, is what I
             want! What have you done to her?!

Red's eyes dart to something in the distance.        Jeff
catches this, turns...


SHERIFF'S PATROL CAR

Cruising toward them.

Jeff runs into the middle of the road and waves
frantically. The patrol car switches on its flash bar
and speeds up, pulling to a stop behind the Peterbilt.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

SHERIFF BOYD, 50ish, climbs out, sizing up the situation.
Jeff runs over.

                           JEFF
             Officer, I need your help!

                           SHERIFF BOYD
             What's your problem?

                        JEFF
          I don't know, this guy has my
          wife!

                        SHERIFF BOYD
          Calm down, sir. Tell me what's
          going on.

Jeff catches his breath.

                        JEFF
          I don't know what the hell's going
          on. Last time I saw her she was
          with this guy in his truck. Now
          he's saying he's never seen her!

                        RED
          Officer, he's crazy -- I don't
          know what he's talking about.

                        JEFF
          Don't lie, you son of a bitch!

The Sheriff unsnaps the safety strap on his holster...
just a precaution.

                        SHERIFF BOYD
          All right -- everybody just calm
          down.
                 (to Jeff)
          Sir, you want to tell me what
          happened?

                        JEFF
          Our car broke down. This guy
          stopped to help us, said he'd
          drive my wife to a pay phone.    But
          she never showed up.

                          SHERIFF BOYD
                   (turning to Red)
          Sir?

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                        33.

CONTINUED:

                        RED
          I don't know, officer. I'm
          driving along, suddenly this fella
          runs me off the road and starts
          hollering about his wife. I
          swear, I never seen the guy
          before.

                        SHERIFF BOYD
          And you didn't give his wife a
          ride?

                           RED
          No, sir.

                           JEFF
          He's lying!

The Sheriff takes a long look at both of them, unsure
what to think. He turns back to Red.

                        SHERIFF BOYD
          Sir, all right with you if I
          search your truck?

                        RED
          Hell yes, officer. Go right
          ahead. Name's Red, by the way.
          Red Barr.
                 (pulls out his
                  wallet)
          My permits are all current. You
          can check 'em out.

                        SHERIFF BOYD
          That won't be necessary yet. Just
          stand back behind the line. Both
          of you.

As Red closes his wallet, several credit cards fall to
the ground. He bends to scoop them up. Jeff eyes this
suspiciously.

The Sheriff climbs up into the truck.


INT. PETERBILT CAB - DAY

The Sheriff pokes his head inside, looks around.

Pretty much what you'd expect in a long-haul big rig:
a CB radio, a plastic Jesus, a map of the U.S. taped to
the ceiling with hundreds of magic marker X's showing
where the truck has been.

                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                       34.

CONTINUED:

The Sheriff looks into the sleeping area behind. A
blanket is folded over a foam mattress. A stained pillow
rests on top.


EXT. PETERBILT - DAY

Jeff and Red keep a careful eye on each other as the
Sheriff climbs down from the cab, wiping his hands.

                       SHERIFF BOYD
                (to both of them)
         All right, let's see your license
         and registration.

Jeff and Red fish into their wallets and hand over
I.D.'s. The Sheriff examines them, comparing faces to
pictures and writing down names.

                       SHERIFF BOYD
         What are you hauling today, Mr.
         Barr?

                       RED
         Nothing, empty load. I'm heading
         to Fresno for a pick up -- ball
         bearings or something.

                       SHERIFF BOYD
                (eyeing him)
         Long way to go empty.

                       RED
         Tell me about it. Too much
         competition nowadays. One horse
         guys like me gotta drive halfway
         'cross the country just to get a
         payin' job.

                       JEFF
                (to Sheriff,
                 impatient)
         Are we gonna keep looking or what?

The Sheriff hands back the I.D.'s.

                       SHERIFF BOYD
         Yes, we are.
                (to Red)
         Sir, I'm gonna have to see
         everything.

                        RED
         No problem.   I understand.

                                                        35.

EXT. REAR OF PETERBILT - DAY

Jeff and the Sheriff observe as Red unlatches two heavy
padlocks. Grunting, he raises the slatted METAL DOOR.
It retracts along the ceiling with a noisy RATTLE.


INSIDE

The cavernous interior is mostly empty, except for a few
randomly strewn cardboard boxes, too small to contain a
person.

                       SHERIFF BOYD
                 (re: boxes)
          Those yours?

                       RED
          Yeah. Personal stuff. Clothes
          and whatnot. You want to take a
          look?

The Sheriff considers it, shakes his head.

                       SHERIFF BOYD
          No. I think we're pretty much
          done here. You're free to go.

                        JEFF
                 (reacts)
          Whoa, whoa -- wait a sec. That's
          it? You're not going to question
          him anymore?

                        SHERIFF BOYD
          Sir, I searched the truck.
          There's no evidence of suspicious
          activity, no sign of struggle.

Red has been looking on.   He chimes in, trying to be
helpful:

                        RED
          Look, I don't mean to butt in, but
          maybe you got my truck confused
          with someone else's.

                        JEFF
                 (lunges)
          Go to hell, you sonofabitch --

The Sheriff grabs Jeff, holds him back.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                         36.

CONTINUED:

                            SHERIFF BOYD
             Hey! Hey! You want to get
             arrested? Now the man has a
             point. This is a plain-looking,
             John Doe truck. Maybe you did get
             them mixed up.

Jeff stares at the Sheriff a beat, then bolts suddenly
for the front of the truck. He yanks open the door and
leaps up into the cab.

                           SHERIFF BOYD
             Hey!

The Sheriff jogs after him.      Red walks to the cab,
unconcerned.


INT. PETERBILT CAB - DAY

Jeff searches the cab for signs of Amy. He tosses aside
a jacket, rifles papers on the floor. There is nothing.


EXT. CAB - DAY

Sheriff Boyd looks up sternly as Jeff continues searching
the cab. Red watches calmly.

                        SHERIFF BOYD
          Mr. Taylor, either you come down
          from there or I'm going to have to
          arrest you.

Jeff gives up reluctantly. He looks lame and desperate
and he knows it. He steps down from the cab, gritting
his teeth.

                          JEFF
          It was him.    It was this truck.

                        SHERIFF BOYD
          Uh-huh, I can see that. Did you
          get a license plate?

Jeff stares at him, knows where this is going.

                          JEFF
          No.

                        SHERIFF BOYD
          What about the information on the
          door panel. You recall any of
          that?

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                            37.

CONTINUED:

                           JEFF
             I wasn't paying attention.

The Sheriff studies him a beat, nods.

                           SHERIFF BOYD
             Mr. Taylor, did you by any chance
             have a beef with your wife today?

                           JEFF
             What does that have to do with
             anything?

                           SHERIFF BOYD
             Well, for starters, maybe she left
             you.

                           JEFF
             I don't believe this...

                        SHERIFF BOYD
          I've seen it a hundred times.
          Lovers, married couples, gay guys.
          You put two people in a car long
          enough, they'll go at it. Hell,
          I've even seen men dump their
          women on the side of the road, and
          vice versa.

Jeff stares at the cop.    Emphatic:

                        JEFF
          My wife did not leave me.

                       RED
                (cuts in)
         Officer, I'm sorry, I'd like to
         stay and help, but I really got to
         make it to Fresno...

                       SHERIFF BOYD
         I understand. Go ahead, sir.         I
         appreciate your cooperation.

                        JEFF
         This is insane. You're just going
         to let him go?

                        SHERIFF BOYD
         I've got his information. If we
         need to find him later, we'll know
         where to look.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                        38.

CONTINUED:

                        RED
          Much obliged.
                 (to Jeff)
          Good luck findin' your wife,
          mister. No hard feelings.

Red climbs into the cab. Jeff watches helplessly,
resigned to the fact there's nothing more he can do.        The
Sheriff goes to the cruiser and speaks on the radio.        As
the truck drives off, Jeff goes over to the cruiser.

                        SHERIFF BOYD
          Sir, I believe you that your wife
          is missing. Maybe you got
          confused about what truck she got
          into, maybe you had a fight -- you
          don't have to tell me. The point
          is I'm trying to help.

He hands Jeff a card with an address printed on it.

                        SHERIFF BOYD
          The town of Brackett's 31 miles
          that way. My deputy's name is Len
          Carver. He's a good man. He'll
          help you fill out the necessary
          forms if you want to report your
          wife missing.

Jeff clenches his jaw as the words sink in.    The Sheriff
softens, his tone sympathetic.

                        SHERIFF BOYD
          If you want my opinion, your wife
          is probably around here. Lost or
          plenty pissed off and giving you a
          scare. Either way, she'll turn
          up.

As Jeff stares at the Sheriff, the police RADIO SQUAWKS.

                        DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                 (filtered)
          Sheriff, this is dispatch. Mrs.
          Gilbert's locked out of her
          trailer again. Can you respond?

                         SHERIFF BOYD
                  (into mike)
          10-4, dispatch. Tell her I'm on
          my way.

He racks the mike.

CONTINUED:

                           JEFF
             I want your name and badge number.

The Sheriff looks up at Jeff, sighs.

                           SHERIFF BOYD
             Sheriff Arthur Boyd. 226-93.
             This really isn't necessary --

                        JEFF
          Don't tell me what's necessary,
          goddamnit. I'm noting the exact
          time of this conversation. 10:52
          A.M.

                        SHERIFF BOYD
                 (exhaling)
          Suit yourself, Mr. Taylor.

The Sheriff shifts into gear and drives away. Jeff is
left standing on the side of the road, desert in all
directions.

                                              CUT TO:


INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

A wall is covered with missing persons' notices.
Photographs of men, women and children stare back at us.
Names and dates are printed across the bottom of the
notices.

PULL BACK to reveal Jeff staring at the gallery of faces.
It's a creepy feeling. Several yards away, DEPUTY LEN
CARVER, a young puffy-faced lawman, sits at a desk
filling out a form. Jeff looks shaken.

                        DEPUTY CARVER
          Is this a recent picture?

Jeff glances over. Deputy Carver is holding up a wallet-
sized photograph of Amy.

                        JEFF
          Two months old.

                        DEPUTY CARVER
          She still wear her hair like that?

                          JEFF
          Yes.

                                              (CONTINUED)

The Deputy resumes filling out the form.   He clicks his
tongue sympathetically.

                        DEPUTY CARVER
          We'll certainly do our best, Mr.
          Taylor. There's over a hundred
          thousand people go missing in this
          country every year. Runaways,
          deadbeat dads, dropouts, folks
          hiding from the I.R.S. -- all
          vanishing without a trace.

Jeff stares at the faces.

                        DEPUTY CARVER
          Now I'm not saying she's one of
          them. I sure hope not. But
          unless there's a ransom demand or
          evidence of forced abduction,
          believe me, the F.B.I. won't even
          look at your case till it's been
          24 hours.

Deputy Carver finishes the paperwork and staples the
photograph to the form. He looks up at Jeff.

                        DEPUTY CARVER
          Nevertheless, we'll sure keep our
          eyes peeled. How's that sound?

Jeff clenches his jaw.

                                           CUT TO:


EXT. ROOF OF BELLE'S DINER - DAY

From this high vantage point, we see Jeff's car
approaching.


EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

The Cherokee pulls up to the side of the building.   Jeff
gets out and walks inside.


INT. BELLE'S DINER - DAY

Jeff enters, looks around. It's the same scene as
before: same Bartender, a slightly different cast of
characters.

No sign of Amy.

                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                       41.

CONTINUED:

Jeff advances to the Bartender, who stands at a sink
rinsing beer mugs.

                           JEFF
             Did she come in?

                           BARTENDER
                    (looks up, uninterested)
             Didn't see her.

                        JEFF
          You didn't see her, or she didn't
          come in?

                        BARTENDER
          Buddy, I told you the last time.
          I'm busy. Maybe she came in,
          maybe she didn't. All I know is,
          I didn't see her.

Jeff looks around, not particularly trusting the
Bartender's skills of observation. He grinds his jaw.

The other customers at the bar have been watching all
this. One of them, an older grizzled BARFLY, looks up at
Jeff.

                        BARFLY
                 (confidentially)
          None of my business, mister. But
          if I was you I'd take a look in
          the ladies room.

The Barfly gives Jeff a wink and turns back to his beer.
Snickers from some of his bar mates, who avert their eyes
when Jeff glances at them. Jeff knows this is almost
certainly a put-on, but he can't take a chance.

While the Barflies watch, poker-faced, Jeff walks to the
door of the ladies room, hesitates, then knocks. His
knock is answered by a wordless sound, HALF-GROAN, HALF-
GASP.

                          JEFF
          Amy?

Silence. Jeff tries the door. It's locked. He rattles
it. Another GROAN. Jeff puts his shoulder against the
door, heaves inward. The door swings open, revealing --

                                                       42.

INSIDE BATHROOM

Flo, bent over the toilet, vomiting. She whirls around,
a strand of spittle dangling from her lip.

                        FLO
          Hey -- what the hell you doing?!

Jeff backs away, yanks the door shut.   The barflies
chuckle among themselves.

Jeff strides angrily for the exit. He stops at the door,
takes one last look around. No one seems to be paying
him much attention. He turns to leave...

... but something stops him. He can't put his finger on
it. There's something wrong here...

He stares at the other customers. Why do they avoid eye
contact? Are they hiding something?

He scrutinizes more closely...

There is the gruff trucker, sitting at a nearby table
shoveling food in his mouth. He's been averting his gaze
ever since Jeff walked in.

And then there's the traveling salesman. Overweight,
sweaty. Popping vitamins along with his coffee.

Or what about the shirtless biker, reading a comic book
at the bar? Probably an ex-con.

While Jeff is running these suspicions through his mind,
a trucker approaches the counter to place an order. The
Bartender jots it down on a pad, then tears off the
carbon slip. He places one copy above the grill and
another in a pile by the cash register.

Jeff stares, an idea forming...

He approaches the bar.

                        JEFF
          I want to see your order slips.

                         BARTENDER
          What?

                        JEFF
          You write down the names.   I want
          to see them.

                       BARTENDER
         What are you, nuts? I don't have
         to show you jack shit.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                       43.

CONTINUED:

Jeff leans in his face.

                           JEFF
             If my wife came in here, then her
             name's in that pile.

The Bartender stiffens, stares him straight in the eye:

                        BARTENDER
          You calling me a liar?

A tense beat.

Possessed by a sudden impulse, Jeff makes a grab for the
receipts. Before he can reach them, the Bartender's hand
clamps onto his.

                        BARTENDER
          Mister, I've had just about enough
          of you.

                        JEFF
          Let me see the fucking slips.

In one swift motion, Jeff overpowers the man and extracts
the receipts. He starts going through them, fast,
looking at names. TULLY, MARK, FLO, ANDY and...

Jeff raises his eyes to face the unpleasant end of a
Smith & Wesson revolver.

                        BARTENDER
          Now, mister, you're going to have
          to leave.

Jeff takes a step back. Everyone in the diner is
staring. He stumbles backwards, heads for the exit.


EXT. BELLE'S DINER - DAY

Jeff exits, breathing hard, and runs to the phone booth.


PHONE BOOTH

is occupied by a YOUNG MAN with an awkward oversized
frame, ill-fitting clothes. Jeff raps on the glass
anxiously.

                        JEFF
          Please, I need the phone -- I have
          to call the police!

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                        44.

CONTINUED:

The Man looks up, dull and glassy-eyed. His sluggish
demeanor suggests mental retardation. He hangs up and
slowly opens the door.

                        SLUGGISH MAN
                 (drawls)
          My name's Billy. You the feller
          lookin' for his wife?

                        JEFF
          How'd you know? Did you see her?

The Sluggish Man hesitates. There's something holding
him back. Jeff senses this.

                        JEFF
          Please, if you know something,
          anything, tell me.

                        BILLY (SLUGGISH MAN)
                 (a beat)
          I seen her... maybe.

                           JEFF
          What?    When?

Billy is about to answer. In b.g., the Bartender sticks
his head out of the diner. Billy backs away, spooked.

                       BILLY
          Oh man. Never shoulda opened my
          damn mouth. Now I'm gonna git it.

Billy breaks into a loping run through the parking lot.
Jeff hurries after him and catches up, cornering Billy
between two cars, trying to calm him.

                        JEFF
          No one's going to hurt you, Billy.
          Just tell me what you saw.

Billy glances around nervously, swallowing.

                        BILLY
          She came in on a truck.   A big
          white one.

                           JEFF
          Yes...

                        BILLY
          Then she... she got in another
          truck.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                            45.

CONTINUED:

                           JEFF
             Another truck? With who?

                        BILLY
          Dunno. Some men. Bad men. They
          say I'm a dummy, but I ain't. I
          see things.

Jeff reels, struggles to stay focused.

                        JEFF
          Do you know where they went?

                          BILLY
          Uh-huh.    Route seven.   Up by the
          river.

                        JEFF
          Where by the river?

                         BILLY
          Dunno. They don't tell me that
          kind of stuff.

                        JEFF
          Who doesn't? The bartender?      The
          men in the truck?

Billy's expression darkens.     He starts backing away.

                        BILLY
          I ain't talking to you no more.

                        JEFF
          Billy, I need you to come to the
          police. If you tell them what you
          saw, they'll be able to help me.

Billy laughs.

                        BILLY
          Man, you're the dummy.

Jeff looks at him, confused.

                        BILLY
          Don't you git it? The police is
          the ones in on it!

Billy turns and runs back into the diner.       ON Jeff's
sickened reaction, we --

                                                CUT TO:

                                                          46.

INT. CHEROKEE - DAY

Jeff drives flat-out, his face grim.    The speedometer
reads 100 mph.

Keeping his eye on the road, he thumbs through the pages
of a pocket address book. He picks up the handheld
cellular phone and dials.

                        JEFF
          C'mon... work, goddammit...

The "NO SERVICE" INDICATOR BEEPS.

                        JEFF
          Fuck.


EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

The highway intersects Route 7. The Cherokee slows just
enough to take the corner without tipping over.

It flies past a sign:   "Route 7 - North."

                                             CUT TO:


EXT. ROUTE 7 - DAY

The road ascends into the rocky hills above the desert
plain. The route is narrow and windy, forcing Jeff to
reduce his speed.


INT. CHEROKEE - DAY

Jeff drives, desperately searching for any sign of a
truck. There are no other vehicles on the road.

He keeps pressing the "REDIAL" button.    The "NO SERVICE"
INDICATOR BEEPS over and over.


EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY

The road curves through a tunnel, then climbs higher,
past sharp cliffs and drop-offs. Jeff follows the signs
for "Route 7."


INT. CHEROKEE - DAY

Something catches Jeff's eye on the cell phone. For the
first time, the "SERVICE" indicator blinks green. Jeff
immediately grabs the phone again and presses "REDIAL."

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                          47.

CONTINUED:

There is a burst of STATIC, then we hear a SCRATCHY
RINGING. The call is going through.

                           JEFF
                    (thank God)
             Yes.

He waits for an answer.

                        JEFF
          Hello, Steve? It's Jeff Taylor...
          Listen, I -- don't put me on hold!
          I need a favor... I've gotta talk
          to that friend of yours at the
          F.B.I... No, it's about Amy, she's
          missing --

There is a burst of STATIC.       The reception is very poor.

                        JEFF
          I said Amy's been --

More STATIC.

                          JEFF
          Fuck!

Jeff holds the phone tight to his ear.

                        JEFF
          Yes, I'm still here.       No -- don't
          call back -- Steve?!       Steve?!

The SIGNAL CUTS OFF.    Jeff slams the phone against the
dash, furious.

                          JEFF
          Goddammit!

He punches redial, gets the "NO SERVICE" BEEPING, then
glances up, sees a --


CHAINLINK FENCE

covered with high-visibility markers stretched across the
road. The sign: "ROAD CLOSED."


BACK TO JEFF

He mashes the brakes. The CHEROKEE SKIDS to a halt just
short of the fence. Jeff stares at it.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                      48.

CONTINUED:

                         JEFF
             Shit!

He grinds his teeth. Beyond the padlocked gate, the
highway continues as an unpaved dirt road.

He deliberates, then throws the Cherokee in reverse and
does a three-point turn so he's facing back in the
opposite direction.

He looks up, sees --


DODGE RAM PICKUP TRUCK

has been hiding in the bushes off the road. It lurches
forward and stops in the middle of the road, blocking
Jeff's escape. Jeff's eyes widen in fear as he
recognizes the vehicle and its driver: Earl.

Earl gets out of the cab with a hunting rifle.   He raises
it to his shoulder.

                         EARL
                  (calling out)
           Out of the car! Put your hands
           where I can see 'em!


JEFF

swears, panicking.

                         EARL
           I said get out, dammit!   Now!

Jeff stares into the rifle, deliberating.   His hand moves
to the gearshift.

He jerks it into reverse and floors the gas!


CHEROKEE

peels out in reverse, snaking wildly side to side, aiming
for the chainlink fence.

It BURSTS the FENCE!   Poles and chain mesh go flying!


JEFF

cranks the wheel and brakes hard. The rear end of the
Cherokee swings wide to the edge of the road.

He throws the shift into drive and punches the throttle.

                                                        49.

EARL

jumps in the Ram and takes off in pursuit.


JEFF

GUNS the ENGINE. The Cherokee bounces wildly on the
rutted, storm-damaged road. He yanks the four-wheel-
drive lever.


DIRT ROAD

The huge pickup streaks after the Cherokee, its 7.5-LITER
V10 ROARING, oversized tires devouring the terrain.


JEFF

GUNS the ENGINE on the washboard road surface, the
vibration nearly shaking the suspension apart while --


RAM

keeps pace in the dust from its wake. Inside the cab,
Earl can be seen speaking on a CB transmitter.


JEFF

throws the Cherokee into a sharp turn in the road. As
the car rounds the bend, he looks up, reacting, as --


IDLED BULLDOZER

blocks the road at a construction site. More unattended
earthmoving equipment fills the road beyond.


JEFF

brakes wildly. To his right, a cliff goes straight up;
on the left, a guardrail protects a steep ravine.

He cuts the wheel left, CRASHES through the GUARDRAIL and
plunges into the ravine!


CHEROKEE

bounces wildly as it hurtles down the slope, CRASHING
through sagebrush and manzanita.

                                                        50.

JEFF

clings to the wheel, tossed about violently, as suitcases
and packing boxes go everywhere.

The Cherokee hits a bump on the steep slope and CRASHES
through the upper branches of a willow grove.

As the leaves part, we see... a river.


CHEROKEE

lands on the passenger side with a SPLASH and comes to
rest half-submerged in the RUSHING WATER.


EARL

jerks the Ram to a halt, leaps out and runs to the edge
of the road to look down on the Cherokee in the river.

                             EARL
            Sonofabitch...

He grabs the rifle and begins making his way down the
slope.


INSIDE CHEROKEE

The world is sideways. Water rushes into the car. Jeff
is strapped into the driver's seat by the seatbelt. The
AIRBAG DEFLATES with a HISS.

Jeff grimaces in pain. He looks around, blinking.   The
river is flowing right through the Cherokee!

Luggage, styrofoam hamburger clamshells and empty Coke
cans bob on the surface of the water.

Jeff fumbles with the seatbelt release. The belt comes
free and he drops suddenly into the water on the
passenger side.

He gets to his feet, reaches overhead to unlatch the
driver's side door and pushes it open.

He hoists himself through the door.


RIVERBANK

Earl sees Jeff emerging from the half-submerged Cherokee,
levels the RIFLE and FIRES!

                                                      51.

JEFF

ducks back inside the Cherokee, freaking.

The passenger side is on the river-bottom and if he tries
to get out through the driver's side, he's a sitting
duck!

Jeff swears and looks around, seeing a metal camera case
underwater in the back seat.

He grabs the case and swings it at the windshield.   The
first three blows bounce off harmlessly.

Then the WINDSHIELD SHATTERS with a CRASH!

He takes a deep breath, submerges and swims underwater
through the broken windshield.


ON BANK

Earl stiffens as he sees movement in the water. Several
items of debris from the car are floating on the current.

                            EARL
             Fuck!

He begins moving downstream along the bank, eyeing the
river.


UNDERWATER

Jeff breaststrokes for all he's worth. Sand swirls in
the swift current. He pushes away from a boulder in his
path.

He swims until his lungs are bursting, then surfaces for
air.


ON BANK

Earl sees Jeff break the surface. He aims the RIFLE and
FIRES! A BULLET SMACKS the WATER near Jeff's head.

Then Jeff is under again.

                            EARL
             Goddammit...


UNDERWATER

Jeff struggles to stay in control. The current is
turning swifter. His shoulder glances painfully off a
boulder.

                                                        52.

ON BANK

Earl works his way through the brush at the river's edge.
His foot lands between two rocks. He pulls it out,
swearing.


BEHIND ROCK

Jeff surfaces and gulps in air, staying out of sight of
Earl on the bank. Then he is down again.


ON BANK

Earl works his way along the shore. Up ahead, the river
runs over rapids before passing around a bend.

Earl hears an ENGINE and turns. A huge moving van has
arrived on the dirt road overlooking the ravine.

He shouts to the DRIVER, pointing downriver.

                          EARL
            He's getting away!

The Driver shouts something inaudible. Earl runs along
the bank, ducking under low-hanging branches.


IN RAPIDS

Jeff is carried over the rocks by the fast-moving
current. He slams into a boulder, letting out a cry and
swallowing a mouthful of water.

A downed tree hangs over the river. Jeff grabs
desperately and takes hold of a branch. He's got it!

Hanging on to the branch, he notices a familiar object
floating past in the water: the "90,000 Donuts" pack.

Jeff tries to haul himself from the river. The BRANCH
bends under his weight. Then it comes free with a CRACK!

Jeff is carried downstream on the rushing water.


ON BANK

Earl works his way along the shore.    The unseen Driver of
the van shouts to him from upriver.

                           DRIVER OF VAN (O.S.)
            Where is he?

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                         53.

CONTINUED:

                           EARL
             He's in the water!   I just saw
             him!


BELOW RAPIDS

The river has turned slow again.

Jeff fights to his feet in the shallows and staggers to
the bank. He drops to his knees, retching.

Clutching his ribs, he raises his head and looks upriver.
For the moment, there is no sign of Earl. But he could
appear anytime.

Jeff gets to his feet, wincing. He looks up at the rocky
canyon wall bordering the river. It's steep but
scalable.

He begins climbing.

                                               DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. ROCK OUTCROPPING - MINUTES LATER

Jeff has climbed to higher ground. He lies flat on his
belly and peers THROUGH a gap in the rocks at the river
valley below.


JEFF'S POV - RIVER

The men have given up their pursuit.

The moving van, a jumbo three-axle GMC, has turned around
and backed up to the edge of the ravine.

A stocky man, AL (whom we recognize as Earl's passenger
at the minimart), operates a gas-powered winch in the
cargo door of the van.

A cable runs from the winch down to the Cherokee in the
river.

Standing knee-deep in the current, Earl signals to Al
while the winch slowly tugs the Cherokee onto its wheels,
then backwards out of the river.

                                                        54.

BACK TO JEFF

watching in amazement.   He can hear only snatches of
their conversation.

                        AL
          ... can't believe you let him get
          away...

                        EARL
          You try chasing... through this
          shit...

                        AL
          Fuck... this is what happens when
          you get one without the other...

Jeff can't believe it. The Cherokee is being pulled
backwards up the slope toward the road.

He belly-crawls back from the outcropping, gets to his
feet and climbs higher.

                                              CUT TO:


EXT. ANOTHER PART OF CLIFF - LATER

Jeff has moved to higher ground. He crouches behind a
stand of manzanita and looks down at the activity below.


JEFF'S POV - ROAD

The Cherokee is now back on the road.

Operating the winch with precision efficiency, Earl and
Al drag the Cherokee up a ramp into the rear of the
moving van.

Once the vehicle is aboard, they stow the ramp and close
the van doors.


BACK TO JEFF

watching in amazement, straining to hear what Earl and Al
are saying. Behind Jeff, a PEBBLE SKITTERS on the rock.

He turns, reacts.

It's Billy -- the halfwit from the diner! Wielding a
shotgun like a club, he swings the butt at Jeff's skull!

Jeff drops to the ground, unconscious.

                                            CUT TO BLACK.

                                                     55.

FADE IN:

INT. CAR TRUNK - DAY

There is a CREAK as the TRUNK opens. Jeff lies inside,
dazed and disoriented, blinking into the sun. His eyes
won't focus. Earl and Billy stand over the trunk in
silhouette. He can hear their voices:

                         EARL
           He coming around?

                         BILLY
           Should be... I clocked him pretty
           good...

A gun barrel jabs Jeff in the ribs.

                         BILLY
           Rise and shine, dad.

Jeff blinks. A face slowly comes INTO FOCUS. Is it
really Billy? The halfwit from the diner? Only he isn't
a halfwit anymore.

                         BILLY
           C'mon, shake a leg.

Jeff looks at Billy. Nothing makes sense anymore. But
one thing is clear: Billy's mental retardation was all
an act.

                           JEFF
                  (weak)
           Where is she?

                         BILLY
           Give us some answers and you might
           find out. According to her,
           you've got a pretty good pile of
           ready cash sitting in the bank.
           Is that true?

                         JEFF
           There's some... yeah...

                         BILLY
           Uh-huh... well, 'some' doesn't cut
           it. Your wife gave us a dollar
           figure. I want the same exact
           from you.

                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                       56.

CONTINUED:

                        JEFF
                 (coming around;
                  stalling)
          I don't -- there's different
          accounts... the balance
          fluctuates...

                        BILLY
          Fluctuates, my ass. If a hotshot
          like you ain't tracking his bottom
          line, it'd be the first time in
          history.
                 (turning)
          What do you think, Earl?

                        EARL
          We been fucked with, is what I
          think. Little slut lied to us.
          Put 'em on the spot, they'll say
          anything to stay alive.

Billy nods, disappointed.

                        BILLY
          Yeah, I suppose. Too bad.
                 (peers down at Jeff)
          Guess you're not the donut magnate
          after all.
                 (to Earl)
          Waste of time. Plug him.

Earl raises a pistol.   Jeff's eyes flash.

                        JEFF
                 (blurting out)
          Ninety thousand.

Earl stops, glances at Billy.   They both eye Jeff
carefully.

                        BILLY
          Say again.

                        JEFF
                 (emphatic)
          Ninety thousand dollars.

A faint smile plays on Billy's lips.     He slams the trunk.


INT. CAR TRUNK - DAY

It's nearly pitch black. A beam of sunlight shines
through a rusted hole. It illuminates Jeff's eyes.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                          57.

CONTINUED:

The car shifts into gear and sets off across the desert.
Jeff grunts as the car bounces on the uneven terrain.

He braces against the confines of the trunk. The ENGINE
NOISE is deafening. The car hits a depression and
jounces wildly. Jeff is thrown about violently.

                                                CUT TO:


EXT. MESA OVERLOOK - DAY

There is a CREAK and the TRUNK opens. Jeff squints into
the sun. Earl and Billy stand over the trunk.

                            EARL
             Get out.   Don't try anything
             stupid.

Jeff gets out, grimacing.     His clothes are stained with
grease and tire grime. He     sets his feet unsteadily on
the ground, looks around.     We see that he has been
confined in the trunk of a    Pontiac Firebird.

The Firebird and Dodge Ram are parked on a bluff. Red
stands on the highest point, peering through binoculars
at the desert below. He glances at Jeff.

                           RED
             You're a tough man to get a hold
             of, Jeffrey.

Jeff stares, a mix of emotions -- anger, fear, confusion.

                           JEFF
                    (barely able to
                     control himself)
             What do you want?

                           RED
             It's not me we're talking about.
             Question is what you want.

Jeff looks at him with loathing.

                       RED
         See, I've got something you might
         want to buy. Can't show you the
         merchandise right now, but I can
         describe it for you. About five-
         five, hundred and fifteen pounds.
         I'd say three, maybe four of that
         is tits. Black curly hair
         upstairs and down. Interested?

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                        58.

CONTINUED:

Jeff's anger bubbles over...

                       JEFF
         You sonofabitch --

He advances toward Red. Billy and Earl grab him from
behind and tackle him to the ground. Billy drives a fist
into his kidney. Jeff gasps in pain.

Red nods impassively.

                           RED
             Bring him up here.

Earl and Billy hoist Jeff to his feet and propel him up
the mound closer to Red.

From here, Jeff can see a small desert town spread out
below, as well as the highway leading through it. Red
gestures.

                           RED
             Welcome to Brackett, Jeff. If
             ever there was a two-bit shithole
             in the middle of nowhere, this is
             it. One gas station, a half-dozen
             stores and a V.F.W. hall.
                    (pointing)
             See that building?

Jeff follows his gaze.

                           RED
             That's the bank. Brackett
             Commerce Bank. You with me?

Jeff nods tightly.

                           RED
             Then here's the drill. You're
             gonna walk in there and tell the
             manager you want an express wire
             in the amount of $90,000 from your
             account in Boston. Got your
             wallet?

Jeff nods.

                           RED
             You ask for the money in cash.
             Small bills.
                           (MORE)

                        RED (CONT'D)
          Today's payday at the copper mine,
          so don't take any horsecock about
          how they haven't got it. If the
          manager gives you a hard time,
          that's your problem. It's your
          wife who's counting on you.

                        JEFF
          How do I know she's still alive?

Billy slugs him in the gut again.   Jeff doubles over.

                          BILLY
          Shut up.

                        RED
          She's tucked away someplace safe.
          You get her back as soon as we get
          the money. Simple as that.

Jeff compresses his lips.

                        RED
          Now a smart guy like you, you're
          already thinking about calling the
          cops, right?

Jeff says nothing. Red raises a hand-held CB to his
mouth. He keys the transmitter.

                        RED
                 (into mike)
          Iron Man to Blacktop, let's open
          the gate.

                        AL (V.O.)
                 (filtered)
          Copy that, Iron Man.

Red turns back to Jeff.

                         RED
          Like I said, Jeff, if you want to
          call the cops, there's nothing I
          can do. Hell, with the fire
          you've got in your eyes right now,
          I figure you're fixing on calling
          the F.B.I., C.I.A. -- even the
          82nd Airborne.

Jeff stares back.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                     60.

CONTINUED:

                        RED
          Problem is, you can see this town
          for miles around. So ask
          yourself: How's the law gonna get
          here? They gonna fly in? Drive
          in? Either way, we'll see 'em.
          So let me be very clear: if we see
          one unmarked car, one plane, one
          human being who even smells like a
          cop -- this deal is dead.

He tosses Jeff the binoculars.

                        RED
          Now take a look at the building
          with the flagpole.

Jeff hesitates, then raises the binoculars.


THROUGH BINOCULARS

The IMAGE SHIFTS, then STEADIES and FOCUSES ON a small
building with a police cruiser out front and a barely
legible sign: "BRACKETT SHERIFF." It's the police
station where Jeff filed the missing persons' form
earlier.

                        RED (O.S.)
          There's exactly two cops in this
          town. One of them's inside
          pulling ass duty; the other's on
          patrol in the foothills. Now a
          minute ago one of my men called in
          a non-injury accident on the I-40
          connector.

Deputy Carver comes out of the building gulping down a
sandwich. He gets in the cruiser and pulls away, lights
flashing.

                        RED (O.S.)
          It'll take that good ol' boy 20
          minutes to get to the connector,
          another 10 to see there's no
          accident, and another 20 or so to
          tool his way back. 50 minutes all
          in.

The cruiser pulls away down the highway.

                                                          61.

JEFF

lowers the binoculars and looks at Red.

                         RED
          That's your deadline. If for any
          reason one of those cops pulls
          into town before I'm looking at a
          bag of money, your wife is dead,
          you're shit out of luck and we're
          gone for good.

He smiles at Jeff.

                        RED
          See, that's why there's no risk to
          us in this thing. You do the
          legwork. We sit back, we watch,
          we listen to our scanners, we
          monitor you every step of the way.
          If at any moment we don't like
          something, we split. Period.
                 (beat)
          Helluva lot safer than sticking up
          7-11s, wouldn't you say?

They lock eyes.   Red tosses Jeff a Windbreaker.

                        RED
          Put this on. You can't go into
          the bank like that.

Jeff puts on the jacket.    It covers his filthy shirt.
Red checks his watch.

                        RED
          How about it, Jeff? Time to get
          the show on the road?

ON Jeff's expression...

                                            CUT TO:


EXT. BOTTOM OF MESA - DAY

Jeff stumbles and nearly falls as he descends   the loose
rock at the foot of the mesa. He looks up at    the ridge,
but Red and his crew have pulled back out of   view. Jeff
starts across an open field toward the town,   first
jogging, then running.

                                                        62.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Jeff hurries toward the bank. He looks back at the mesa
again. The gang has disappeared.

Up ahead, a mud-streaked pickup cruises the main street.
Jeff eyes it warily. Is it one of theirs? The truck
pulls around a corner.


INT. BANK - DAY

Jeff pushes through the main doors. It's a typical small
town operation. A guard stands near the entrance.
Several customers wait in line for the woman teller.

Jeff looks at the slow-moving line and swears softly. He
doesn't have time to wait. He glances around, sees an
older man sitting at a desk in the rear of the bank, the
nameplate on the desk identifying him as Roger Calhoun.
Jeff approaches.

                        JEFF
          I need to see the manager. I need
          a wire transfer from my bank in
          Boston.

CALHOUN looks up from his paperwork, hesitates at Jeff's
appearance.

                        CALHOUN
          Yes... sir. I'm the manager.
          Would you like to have a seat?

Jeff remains standing.    He eyes the other customers
nervously.

                           CALHOUN
          Sir?

                           JEFF
                    (turning; preoccupied)
          What?

                        CALHOUN
          I said you can have a seat if you
          want.

                           JEFF
          Right.

He takes a seat across the desk from the manager, reaches
into his wallet and brings out several forms of
identification.

                        JEFF
          Here's my driver's license, credit
          card if you need it, my account
          number in Boston... How long is
          this going to take?

Calhoun looks at him curiously.

                        CALHOUN
          Are you all right?

                        JEFF
                 (quickly)
          Yes, I'm fine. Look, that account
          only has $5,000 in it. How much
          can you advance me on my credit
          card?

                           CALHOUN
          Excuse me?

                        JEFF
                 (impatient)
          My credit card. I've got a $6,000
          limit. Can you advance me the
          whole $6,000?

Calhoun looks mystified.

                        CALHOUN
          No, I can't. For non-customers
          the limit is $500 a day. Sir, are
          you sure you're all right?

                        JEFF
          Yes, I'm fine. Just... transfer
          the money, okay?

Calhoun raises an eyebrow and begins filling out the
transfer form. Jeff eyes him, decides he has to risk it.
He leans toward the desk.

                       JEFF
         Look, I'm going to tell you
         something. Whatever happens, just
         keep filling out that form, okay?

                       CALHOUN
                (looking up;
                 baffled)
         Sir?

                       JEFF
         There are people watching --

                                            (CONTINUED)

                           COWBOY (O.S.)
             Excuse me, you the manager?

Jeff turns. A GUY wearing cowboy boots and a feed cap
stands behind him.

                           CALHOUN
             Yes, I am.

                           COWBOY
             Lady over there said to see you
             about a car loan.

                           CALHOUN
                    (indicating
                     waiting area)
             Certainly, sir. Would you like to
             have a seat?

The guy takes a seat ten feet away. Jeff looks at him,
paranoid. Their eyes meet. Jeff looks away quickly.

                           CALHOUN
                    (turning back
                     to Jeff)
             You were saying, Mr. Taylor?

                           JEFF
             Just... transfer the money.

INT. BANK REST ROOM - DAY

Jeff enters and locks the door.

He startles at his reflection in the mirror.     He is
sunburned, dirty, lacerated.

He opens a cabinet and rifles through the supplies,
looking for anything that could be used as a weapon.     He
tosses aside detergents and air fresheners.

He picks up   the toilet plunger, pulls the wooden rod from
the rubber   base. He swings it into his palm a few times,
testing it   as a club. It's too bulky. He won't be able
to conceal   it.

He checks his watch. Time is running out.      He takes one
last look around the bathroom, then exits.

                                                        65.

INT. BANK - DAY

Jeff comes out of the rest room. The manager is behind
the teller's counter. The cowboy is gone. In his place
sits a middle-aged blue collar worker. He looks at Jeff.

Jeff takes a seat, glances at Calhoun's empty desk.
There is a letter opener on the desk, several paper bands
for wrapping currency.

Positioning his body so no one can see, Jeff takes the
letter opener and slips it into his sleeve. He scoops up
a handful of currency wrappers.

Jeff goes to the teller's window, scribbles something on
the back of a deposit slip and hands it to the teller.

                        JEFF
          Would you tell the manager I want
          the money in these denominations?

The teller looks at him oddly.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Jeff comes out of the bank with a manila envelope,
glancing up and down the street. There's no sign of the
men. He squints toward the mesa. No sign of them there
either.

He stands there. What's he supposed to do now? He
checks his watch, growing anxious. Finally he is about
to jog back in the direction he came, when... a PHONE
RINGS.

Jeff turns. There's a pay PHONE down the street. It
RINGS again. He approaches quickly, lifts the receiver.

                       JEFF
         I'm here.

                       RED (V.O.)
                (filtered)
         No shit. I can SEE that.   How
         much you got?

Jeff looks up and down the street, trying to figure out
where they're watching from. He looks toward the bank,
glimpses the manager peering through the window.

                        JEFF
          The whole thing. Ninety thousand.

             Good. Turn left and start walking
             toward the main road. Get in the
             first car that stops.

                           JEFF
             When do I see my wife?

          at the bank. Is the Sheriff
          there?
                 (a beat)
          Well, maybe it's nothing, but you
          might tell him we just had a
          fellow in here acting kind of
          strange...

EXT. HIGHWAY - OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - DAY

Jeff walks along the road, carrying the envelope.
Various cars pass in either direction, but none slow
down.

Jeff stiffens as an 18-wheeler approaches. But the TRUCK
THUNDERS past, blowing a cloud of dust and sand in his
face.

Jeff continues walking, anxiously checking over his
shoulder every few moments. His eyes narrow.

The Dodge Ram pickup is cruising toward him. It slows,
then brakes to a halt. The passenger door opens. Earl
sits behind the wheel, aiming an automatic pistol.

                        EARL
          Toss the envelope on the seat.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                           67.

CONTINUED:

Jeff stands firm.

                            JEFF
             No.   First you tell me where she
             is.

                        EARL
          Wrong, asshole. First you give me
          the money, then you find out.
          Unless you want me to shoot you
          dead right here on the highway.

Jeff looks around, wonders if Earl would risk shooting
him in view of passing traffic.

Jeff hesitates, then tosses the envelope on the      seat.
Earl opens it, reaches in and pulls out several      packets
of currency. They are wrapped with paper bands       and
appear to be stacks of fifties and hundreds. He       replaces
them and gestures at Jeff with the gun.

                        EARL
          Now lift your shirt and jacket and
          turn around.

Jeff complies. Earl sees that he isn't carrying a gun.
He beckons Jeff toward the truck with the automatic.

                        EARL
          Turn around, hands behind your
          back, and step toward the truck.

Jeff takes two backwards steps toward the passenger side
door. Earl grabs his arms, yanks roughly and wraps them
with several layers of duct tape.

                        EARL
          Now get up in the truck, knees on
          the floor. Do it now!

Jeff struggles into an awkward kneeling position on the
floor, facing the rear of the pickup, his belly pressed
against the seat.

Earl reaches over and pulls the door shut. He throws the
truck in gear and starts driving. Jeff grimaces, looking
up at him.

                        JEFF
          I gave you the money.     Now let her
          go.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                          EARL
          'Let her go.'    Do I look like I
          have her?

                        JEFF
          What the hell --

Earl backhands Jeff against the passenger door. There is
a RINGING sound and Earl pulls a CELL PHONE from his
pocket. He presses a button and raises it to his face.

                         EARL
                  (on phone)
          It's done. I'm heading in.
                  (a beat;
                   listening)
          Gotcha.

He ends the call and tosses the cell phone on the dash.

                        EARL
          You gotta be the dumbest
          motherfuck yet. You think we
          picked you out of the blue? New
          car, Massachusetts plates --
          probably be days before anyone
          misses you. Hell, you shoulda got
          the bumper sticker that goes with
          it: 'Rich Assholes Looking for
          Trouble!'

He tucks the pistol in his belt.   Jeff looks at him,
seething.

Jeff tries to squirm free. Earl sees it and belts him
across the temple. Jeff slams into the passenger door,
wincing.

                        EARL
          I'd have loved to see the look on
          your face when that car seized up.
                 (mimicking panicked
                  driver)
          Help, help, I ain't got no power!

Earl laughs. Jeff has come to rest with his back against
the door. By contorting his arms, he is able to draw the
letter opener from his pocket.

He manipulates the letter opener into position and begins
cutting the duct tape that binds his wrists.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                        69.

CONTINUED:

Steering with one hand, Earl reaches into the envelope,
pulls out a packet of bills and waves it in Jeff's face.
Jeff saws faster at the duct tape.

                        EARL
          You know what I'm gonna do first
          with your money, boy? Well, do
          you?

Jeff glares at him.

                       EARL
                (fluttering bills
                 under his nose)
         I'll give you a hint. Only one
         thing smells better than money.
         You wanta guess what?

Earl laughs obscenely. He riffles the bills under his
nose again, then stops abruptly, frowning. He looks down
at the bills.

                          EARL
         What the hell?

Earl stares at the bills. Jeff works feverishly behind
his back. Earl pulls out another packet, then another,
examining the bills.

                       EARL
         These are... it's nothing but
         singles...
                (erupting)
         You lyin' sonofabitch!

There is a RIPPING SOUND. Jeff wrests his hands free and
lunges across the cab. He plants the letter opener in
Earl's shoulder!

                           EARL
          Aaagghh!


EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

The pickup veers across the center line on the narrow
mountain road. It swerves back, over-correcting wildly,
and drifts for the opposite shoulder.


INT. PICKUP - DAY

Jeff seizes the pistol from Earl's waistband.    Earl
flails and knocks the pistol from his grasp.

The pistol flies onto the floor.

Earl uncorks a vicious backhand. Jeff's head snaps
sideways. He grabs Earl by the arm and twists sharply.
Earl howls!


EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

The pickup careens back and forth across the treacherous
roadway.


INT. PICKUP - DAY

Jeff gropes on the floor. His hand closes around the
pistol and he swings it at Earl -- crack! Earl's nose
erupts! Jeff reaches across and jams his foot on the
brake.


EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

The PICKUP SCREECHES and comes to a halt straddling the
road.


INT. PICKUP - DAY

Jeff swings the pistol into Earl's face -- crack! Earl
tries to fend off the blows. Jeff creams him again --
crack!


INT. TOW TRUCK - DAY

A TOW TRUCK DRIVER traveling in the opposite direction
pulls to a stop. He gawks at the two men struggling in
the pickup.


INT. PICKUP - DAY

Jeff aims the pistol at point blank range.     Earl is a
bloody wreck. His head lolls groggily.

                        JEFF
          Where is she, goddammit?   What'd
          you do with her?

Earl sneers. Jeff is about to slug him again when he
notices the two truck parked across the road, the driver
staring out.

CONTINUED:

Jeff swears and wrestles Earl into the passenger seat.

He seizes the roll of duct tape and binds Earl's wrists,
then passes the tape under his legs so Earl is
effectively hog-tied.

He then slams Earl back in the seat, circles his neck
twice with tape and wraps the free end around the base of
the passenger side headrest. Earl begins to gasp for
air.

The Tow Truck Driver gets out and approaches.

                            TOW TRUCK DRIVER
             Hey!   You there!

Jeff gets behind the wheel and throws the pickup into
gear.


EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

The Two Truck Driver leaps out of the way as the pickup
surges forward, tires smoking. He stares open-mouthed
after the departing vehicle.


INT. PICKUP - DAY

Jeff drives, one hand on the wheel, the other brandishing
the pistol at Earl.

                              JEFF
             Where is she?!

                           EARL

                     to breathe)
             Fuck you!

Jeff swings the pistol. There is a crack of exploding
teeth! Earl's mouth erupts with frothy blood!

                              JEFF
             You like that?     How about this?

Jeff hits the brakes. Earl is thrown forward, letting
out a strangled cry as the duct tape chokes off his
windpipe.

                           JEFF
             Four wheel anti-lock brakes, you
             sonofabitch! You want to try 'em
             again?

He hits the brakes again, harder.       Earl's tongue
protrudes from his lips, choking.       His face is red.

                           JEFF
             How about an emergency stop? You
             want to try that, Earl? Where is

         Fuck you, you don't!

He slams the brakes again. Earl's eyes bulge
sickeningly. He is being choked to death.

                             EARL
         Stop!

                       JEFF
         Is that what you want? You really
         want me to stop? 'Cause I bet

INT. DODGE RAM - DAY

Jeff glances in the rearview mirror. The cruiser is on
their tail, SIREN WAILING, lights flashing. He swears
and pumps the brakes in a series of rapid bursts.

                        JEFF
          End of the line, Earl! How about
          it? You gonna tell me?

                    (losing it)
             To the truck stop...

                           JEFF
             Where?

                           EARL
             Main highway... Texaco...

Jeff has the information he needs.       He slams on the
brakes!


INT. CRUISER - DAY

Sheriff Boyd swerves to avoid a crash as the RAM
SCREECHES to a halt in front of him!


EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The cruiser skids to a stop. Jeff leaps from the pickup
with the pistol in his hand. He rushes toward the
cruiser. Sheriff Boyd hops out, levels his service
revolver.

                           JEFF
             I know where she is!   My wife!

                           SHERIFF BOYD
                    (ignoring him)
             Drop the gun!

Jeff pitches the gun away and it skitters down an
embankment. He raises his hands.

                        JEFF
          You don't understand!      She's been
          kidnapped!

                        SHERIFF BOYD
          I understand plenty. Now get down
          on the ground or I'll shoot!

He means it.

                                                        75.

INT. PICKUP - DAY

Earl struggles for breath. The duct tape is still tight
around his neck. He strains against the tape binding his
limbs.

He glances in the side view mirror to see the Sheriff
ordering Jeff down on the ground.

By wriggling and contorting his wrists, Earl is able to
tear one hand free. Then he pulls away the rest of the
duct tape from his knees.

The tape is still wrapped tightly around    his neck,
pinning him to the backrest. Earl claws     at the tape, but
it won't come free. Finally, with both     hands, he reaches
behind his head and yanks the read rest    from the seat.

He reaches into his boot for something...


EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Jeff is spread-eagled on the ground. Sheriff Boyd calls
out to Earl in the cab. He keeps his gun leveled.

                        SHERIFF BOYD
          You there -- in the pickup! You
          all right? Can you get out?

                       EARL
          Yeah! Just don't shoot me,
          officer! He's crazy, I tell you!

                        SHERIFF BOYD
          Well, get out dammit!

                        JEFF
          Officer, please. You gotta listen
          to me --

                         SHERIFF BOYD
                 (glances down
                   at Jeff)
          Shut up.
                 (to Earl)
          C'mon out, sir. It's safe --

Earl sets one foot on the road. The headrest dangles
against his back, still taped to his neck. Suddenly Earl
whirls, holding a .22 snub-nose REVOLVER and FIRES!

The sheriff stumbles away, blood spurting from his
shoulder, the gun flying from his hand.

Jeff looks up in horror as the sheriff falls.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                        76.

CONTINUED:

Earl comes around the pickup after Jeff, raising the gun
to fire. Jeff scrambles to his feet and dives down the
embankment.

Earl runs to the edge of the embankment. Down below,
Jeff is reaching for the automatic pistol the sheriff
ordered him to drop.

He finds it... too late...

Earl is aiming at point-blank range from the top of the
embankment. He is already squeezing the trigger when...

BLAM! Earl's chest erupts outward as a bullet passes
through his body from behind!

Earl staggers and flops down the embankment. He comes to
rest near Jeff, blood gurgling from a massive chest
wound.

Jeff climbs the embankment. The sheriff is lying on the
road, critically injured, gun lying nearby and still
smoking from the shot that killed Earl.

The sheriff is struggling to speak into a remote
transmitter strapped to his uniform.

                        SHERIFF BOYD
                 (weak)
          Shots fired... Officer down...
          Suspect...

                        DISPATCHER (V.O.)
          Help is on the way, Sheriff. Just
          hang on. I have units and an
          ambulance en route.

Jeff bends over the Sheriff and examines his wound with a
grimace. He is verging on unconsciousness. Jeff
deliberates, torn. There is nothing he can do here.

Making up his mind, Jeff runs to the pickup. The hand-
held cellular phone has spilled into the road. He scoops
it up, jumps behind the wheel and LAYS RUBBER.

                                           CUT TO:


EXT. BLUFF - DAY

Jeff stands on a ridge overlooking a Texaco truck stop.
Behind him, the Dodge Ram pickup lies hidden in a growth
of scrub oak and tumbleweeds.

Jeff looks overwhelmed by what he sees spread out below.

                                                         77.

JEFF'S POV - TEXACO TRUCK STOP

It's a giant truck stop. There are hundreds of big rigs
parked in rows like silvery sardines.

A sign towers over the main building:    "DIESEL $.99 GAL."


BACK TO JEFF

He looks shaken. How will he ever find Red here?    It
seems impossible.

He descends the bluff to the truck stop.


EXT. TRUCK STOP - DAY

Jeff skids on his heels down the loose hillside and
reaches the edge of the parking lot. There are trucks
everywhere. Diesel MOTORS RUMBLE. Exhaust fills the
air.

He reaches the end of a row of big rigs, starts searching
the grounds for the markings of Red's 18-wheeler.

It's nowhere in sight.

A high-pitched FEMININE SQUEAL from an adjacent truck's
sleeping compartment startles Jeff.

                        TRUCKER (O.S.)
                 (muffled)
          C'mon, baby, give it up!

The woman GIGGLES, O.S. Jeff ignores it, scanning the
truck stop. He stiffens.

A police car is arriving at the truck stop.

Staying out of sight, Jeff passes quickly to the rear of
a tractor trailer.


EXT. TRUCK WASH - DAY

Jeff peers out from behind a parked mini-van as trucks
emerge wet and dripping from an immense truck wash.

Across the way, trucks are filling up on diesel at the
gas islands. Jeff's eyes narrow. Is that Red's
Peterbilt among them?

He quickens his pace, then falls back, slumping. The
rig's black driver is getting in the cab. Jeff glances
to the side, frowns.

                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                      78.

CONTINUED:

An older vacationing couple is eyeing Jeff warily.

Jeff looks down, cops to it instantly. His clothes are
ripped, caked with blood. He ducks between two parked
cars, using a side-view mirror as he hastily wipes blood
off his face. He checks to be sure no one is watching.

Something catches his eye.


EXT. BLUFF - JEFF'S POV

A highway patrol car with flashing lights is parked near
the place where Jeff ditched the pickup. Beside it, a
state trooper surveys the truck stop with binoculars.


EXT. TRUCK WASH - DAY

Jeff's jaw tightens. He glances toward the road, sees
two more highway patrol cars cruising the perimeter of
the truck stop.

Swearing, Jeff turns on his heels and walks away in the
opposite direction, shielding his face.


EXT. TRUCK STOP PARKING LOT - DAY

Jeff emerges from between two vehicles, glancing over his
shoulder nervously. He keeps his head down, moving fast.

He scans the truck stop in all directions. The patrol
car is still parked on the ridge, the patrolman peering
through binoculars.

Jeff quickens his pace alongside the truck stop building,
passing a row of pay phones. He looks up, stops dead.

Red is talking on a pay phone six feet away.

Jeff stares. Red is facing away, unaware of his
presence. Jeff darts into an adjacent pay phone.

He shields his face with the receiver and listens.

                       RED
                (on phone)
         I don't know, dammit, he was
         supposed to be here a half hour
         ago. There's reports on the
         police band about a cop down and
         this place is crawling with
         uniforms...

                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                        79.

CONTINUED:

Red waits, listens.

                        RED
          Look, I'm getting out of here.
          Stay off the airwaves. Bring the
          girl and meet me at the barn...
          You got that?

He hangs up.   Jeff presses the phone against his face and
turns away.

When he looks up, Red is walking toward his Peterbilt
truck, parked in a row of big rigs. Jeff starts to
follow, then freezes.

Several cops are fanning out on foot, questioning
everyone they encounter.

Jeff sees Red getting into his truck. The ENGINE KICKS
OVER. The BRAKES HISS and the truck begins pulling out.

Jeff whips around. The older vacationing couple are
talking to a cop fifty yards away. The husband points
toward the pay phones.

Jeff makes a sudden decision, doubles back behind a
rolling farm truck.


COP

thanks the couple, calls out something to his fellow
officers.


JEFF

runs alongside the farm truck, using it as a shield. He
overtakes the truck, cuts across its path. The farmer
BLARES his HORN.

Jeff glances left. Red's tractor trailer is traveling
across the crowded parking area, slowly gaining speed.
Jeff sprints in front of a moving car.

The driver jerks to a halt and HONKS, catching the
attention of a nearby cop. Jeff quickly turns away,
avoiding being seen.

Red's 18-wheeler turns toward the access road. Jeff
looks around, panicked. More cops are spreading out on
foot. They'll notice him any second.

                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                      80.

CONTINUED:

Jeff crouches low and scurries underneath a slow-moving
postal truck. The truck speeds up, nearly crushing him
under the rear wheel assembly.

Jeff rolls out of the path of the giant wheels, gets to
his feet on the other side and finds himself...

... in the path of another huge truck!

A cop is standing only 20 feet away! Jeff goes
underneath another trailer, crawling between the moving
wheels. He springs to his feet.

Red's Peterbilt is pulling away!

Jeff runs for all he's worth. His arms and legs pump
furiously. He runs abreast of the truck...

... and seizes the spare tire mount!


EXT. INTERSTATE - UNDER TRUCK - DAY

Jeff hangs on for dear life. His legs drag over the
asphalt. He lets out a cry of pain.

The truck is joining the highway, accelerating.

Grimacing, Jeff swings his legs over the universal joint
as the roadway races past below. The huge TIRES are a
HOWLING blur.

Suddenly his grip falters on the grease. His back
scrapes the rushing asphalt. Jeff gasps, makes a grab
and holds firm.

As he hangs on, a station wagon overtakes the Peterbilt
in the passing lane. A three-year-old boy sits in the
rear compartment, staring out at Jeff, a puzzled
expression on his face.

Jeff stares back. It's an odd moment between the two.
The station wagon continues forward and EXITS FRAME.


EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY

The PETERBILT THUNDERS over a patch of highway that is
being graded for paving.

                                                          81.

EXT. UNDER TRUCK - DAY

The tires kick up a hail storm of loose gravel and dirt,
pelting Jeff all over his body.

He realizes he can't stay where he is. Grunting with
effort, he works his way hand over hand along the
underside rigging toward the cab.

He seizes the trailer hitch and hoists himself up.


EXT. BETWEEN CAB AND TRAILER - DAY

Standing on the coupler, Jeff clutches his ribs and
catches his breath. He's in pain. The road whips by
below his feet.

The truck hits an uneven stretch of road and bounces
violently. Jeff grabs the coiled brake line for support.

The truck is doing 70 mph, exhaust racketing.

Jeff pulls the cell phone from his pocket and dials 911.
He holds it tightly to his ear, shouting above the wind.

                          JEFF
                   (on phone)
            Hello? Can you hear me? This is
            Jeff Taylor. I need to talk to
            the deputy.

He strains to hear the reply.

                          JEFF
            The name is Jeffrey Taylor. I
            just witnessed your sheriff being
            shot. Now put someone on,
            goddammit!

He waits.


INT. TRUCK CAB - DAY

Red glances in the side mirror at the road behind him as
he drives, unaware of Jeff's presence.


EXT. TRUCK COUPLER - DAY

Jeff clutches the cell phone to his ear, waiting.    He
reacts suddenly as the call is put through.

                           JEFF
            Hello?

INTERCUT WITH:

                                                         82.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Deputy Carver speaks on a phone extension while the
DISPATCHER sits nearby.

                        DEPUTY CARVER
          It's no good. He's not talking.
          You better mobilize your boys.

The troopers stare back.    They look like they have a
score to settle.

                                             CUT TO:


EXT. RED'S PETERBILT - DAY

The truck streaks along the interstate.   Sitting on the
coupler, Jeff is a picture of despair.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. RED'S PETERBILT - DUSK

Hours later.

The truck races toward the bloated lowering sun, with no
sign of slowing down. Jeff lies curled under the
windfoil on the roof of the cab. He hugs himself,
shivering in the cold draft.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. RED'S PETERBILT - NIGHT

The TRACTOR TRAILER RUMBLES in low gear along a sparsely
populated two-lane road. A neighborhood DOG YAPS.


EXT. ROOF OF TRUCK CAB - NIGHT

From his hiding place under the windfoil, Jeff peers out
into the darkness, unable to figure out where he is.

He catches his balance as the truck turns a corner and
slows, driving past a tract of undeveloped land, before
turning into the driveway of a...


EXT. RESIDENTIAL LOT - NIGHT

and braking to a halt under the broad overhanging eave of
an old dilapidated barn.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                       83.

CONTINUED:

Behind the two-story farm house, a rusted Volkswagen bus
and satellite dish hunker in the weeds. A newer car, a
1981 Cadillac Deville, is parked to the side.

Red kills the engine and climbs out of the cab. As he
walks toward the house, a screen DOOR SLAPS. DEKE, 9,
squirts across the lawn in his pajamas.

                           DEKE
             Daddy, you're home!

Red scoops him up.

                        RED
          Hey, Deke, you miss me?

ARLEEN, 35, comes out of the house in a bathrobe.

                        ARLEEN
          Deke, get back to bed! I said
          now!
                 (to Red)
          Warren? I thought you were coming
          back next week.

She comes out into the yard.


EXT. TRUCK CAB - NIGHT

Jeff flattens against the sleeper. He can see Red
greeting his wife, their words carrying faintly across
the lawn. Jeff is baffled by this domestic scene.


EXT. YARD - NIGHT

Arleen reacts with disappointment to something Red's told
her.

                        ARLEEN
          ... but it's four in the morning.
          Why can't Al and Billy come some
          other time?

                        RED
                 (reasoning)
          I told you, we've got some stuff
          to take care of. Won't be more
          than a couple of hours -- I
          promise.

Red turns to his son, extends a key.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                          84.

CONTINUED:

                        RED
          Say, Deke, how 'bout opening up
          the barn for your daddy?

Deke takes the key and sprints for the barn while Red
returns to the cab, passing within several feet of Jeff's
hiding place.

He reaches into the cab, brings out a duffel bag and
unzips it. Jeff keeps his breathing shallow, squeezes
against the windfoil.

                        RED
          Deke, c'mon over here, I got
          something for you.

Deke runs up, breathless. Red holds two hands behind his
back. Red and Deke are just six feet from Jeff.

                        RED
          Guess which hand.

                        DEKE
                 (pointing to
                  right hand)
          This one.

Red opens his right hand.    Empty.

                          RED
          Nope.    Try again.

                        DEKE
                 (pointing to left)
          This hand.

Red opens his left.    Empty.

                          RED
          Nope.

                          DEKE
                   (he's been
                    tricked)
          Dad...

                           RED
                    (laughing)
             Okay, okay, I'll give it to you.

He opens his hand, revealing Jeff's Swiss Army knife.

                          DEKE
          Cool!

                                                (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Deke takes the knife and runs off. Red goes to the rear
of the trailer, unlocks it and raises the slatted door.

He hops up inside. His FOOTSTEPS ECHO in the metal
trailer. We hear him SHIFTING BOXES.


EXT. BARN - NIGHT

Jeff seizes his chance. He crawls out from under the
windfoil and hoists himself onto the overhanging eave.

The STRUCTURE CREAKS under his weight.


INSIDE TRAILER

Red sticks his head out of the trailer, puzzled.

                            RED
             Deke?   Deke, you back there?


EXT. ROOF OF BARN - NIGHT

Jeff crouches in the shadows. He can see Red poking his
head out from the trailer, peering up at the roof.


INSIDE TRAILER

Red shrugs, lets it go. He resumes unloading boxes,
tosses down a full set of Louis Vuitton luggage. He lugs
the items into the barn.


EXT. ROOF OF BARN - NIGHT

Jeff goes to a second-story window. A board has been
nailed over the window. He pulls it away, steps into...


INT. BARN HAYLOFT - NIGHT

and looks around, amazed.     Everywhere around him there
are stolen goods.

Matching luggage sets... a rack of women's coats... a
table piled with cameras... a crate filled with car
phones...

A stack of windshields... two sets of golf clubs... three
child safety seats... a ten-speed bicycle...

CONTINUED:

Several dozen "COMMERCIAL VEHICLE" license plates are
scattered about -- Arkansas, Oregon, Texas, Iowa, South
Dakota...

As Jeff stares, reeling, there is a RUMBLE outside.


EXT. BARN - NIGHT

Red looks up from toting a box of car stereos and snarled
wiring as the moving van and Pontiac Firebird arrive at
the barn.

He beckons for the vehicles to pull forward into...


INT. BARN - NIGHT

Al dismounts from the moving truck. Billy climbs out of
the Firebird. They are travel-sore, stretching. Red
shuts the door behind them.

                           AL
             Man, if I never see another couple
             from Massachusetts it'll be too
             soon.

                           RED
             Tell me about it.   You get any
             word on Earl?

                           BILLY
                    (shakes head)
             There's reports of an accident up
             Five Mile, but that's about it.

Red grunts, unlatches the door to the moving van, lowers
a ramp. The three men begin unloading boxes.


INT. BARN HAYLOFT - NIGHT

Jeff lies on his belly peering through a knothole.


JEFF'S POV THROUGH KNOTHOLE

The men unload Jeff and Amy's belongings -- luggage,
photography equipment, miscellaneous items. Inside the
moving van, the battered Jeep Cherokee is visible,
partially covered with a tarp.

             I told you we shoulda gotten rid
             of 'em like that couple up in
             Utah. Nice and clean.

                           RED
             So it got a little fucked up -- so
             what? We stay out of the area for
             a while, things will cool off.

There is a HAMMERING noise, O.S.    Red looks over,
irritated.

                           RED
             Dammit, Al, what the hell you
             doing?

Al sits at a workbench hammering precious stones out of
Amy's jewelry. He looks over at Red.

                           AL
             Figured I'd get started on the
             jewelry.

                           RED
             Fuck that, you can work on it
             later. Help us with the girl.


INT. BARN HAYLOFT - NIGHT

Jeff breathes in sharply, presses his eye against the
knothole.


INT. BARN GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

Red unlatches a hidden compartment under the chassis of
the moving truck. He and Billy slide out a long metal
box, similar to a drawer in a morgue.

They lift the metal lid, revealing --


CANVAS SACK

The sack is stained and ripped.    Red pokes at it.   The
sack doesn't move. Red shrugs.

                       RED
         Must've died from the exhaust.

                                                      88.

INT. BARN HAYLOFT KNOTHOLE - NIGHT

Jeff stares, paralyzed, his universe exploded.   Moisture
forms in his eyes.


INT. BARN GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

Billy and Al reach into the compartment, start to lift
out the sack.

                        RED
          I'll get some plastic. We'll bury
          her before it gets light out.

Suddenly the sack drives its legs into Al's belly.

                         AL
                  (startled)
          Aagh!

Al falls backward, drops the sack on the floor. It tears
open revealing Amy -- gagged with duct tape, her wrists
and ankles taped. She squirms and kicks wildly, her
screams muffled.


INT. BARN HAYLOFT KNOTHOLE - NIGHT

We see Jeff's eye in the knothole. It's all we need to
see to gauge the effect on him of seeing Amy alive.


INT. BARN GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

Al gets to his feet, furious.

                         AL
          Goddamn.   Scared me half to death.

                        BILLY
                 (chuckles)
          Gotcha good, huh, Al? Oughta be
          more careful next time.

                        AL
          Shut up.
                 (glaring at Amy)
          Lemme do her, Red. I'll cut her
          head off right now.

                        ARLEEN (O.S.)
                 (muffled)
          Warren? You in there?

Red reacts.

                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                         89.

CONTINUED:

                           RED
             Shit, it's my wife. Help me get
             her in the freezer.
                    (calling out)
             Just a second, Arleen.

Red walks to a corner, moves aside a section of false
flooring. He pulls up a hidden trap door, revealing a
root cellar.


AMY

squirms on the hay-strewn floor. Her clothes are ripped,
face bruised. She looks up, reacting: Jeff's eye is
visible in the knothole.

Their gaze meets... and holds...


RED

returns and takes Amy by the legs. Al and Billy lift her
by the arms. As they carry her to the root cellar, Red
peers into her terrified face.

                          RED
          Don't   worry, honey. It's not as
          bad as   it sounds. It'll take you
          about   10 minutes to suck the air
          out.    Probably won't even feel it.

Amy reacts, writhing even more violently, but she's no
match for the three men.


BARN HAYLOFT

Jeff watches helplessly as...


BARN GROUND FLOOR

The men disappear with Amy into the cellar. We hear a
METALLIC THUD, then a few moments later, the men reappear
without her. Red closes the trap door, secures it with a
heavy padlock, then slides the panel of false flooring
over it.

                        RED
          C'mon, let's go.

They turn, walk toward the door. Red opens it. Arleen
is standing there. Al and Billy greet her politely:

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                           90.

          AL                             BILLY
  Howdy, Arleen.                     Hey, Missus C.

                           ARLEEN
             Well finally. Are you coming to
             breakfast? I've been calling you.

                           RED
             Sure thing, honey.

The barn goes dark as the men leave.        The barn door rolls
shut. A LOCK CLICKS.


INT. BARN HAYLOFT - NIGHT

Jeff quickly climbs down a ladder in the pitch darkness.
He crosses the room, bumping into a workbench. He
swears, makes his way toward the...


INT. REAR OF BARN - NIGHT

Jeff drops to his hands and knees, feeling for the
padlocked trap door. He finds it, speaks in an urgent
whisper.

                            JEFF
             Amy?   Amy, can you hear me?

No reply.     Jeff cups his hands, presses his mouth to the
floor.

                            JEFF
                     (louder)
             Amy?

Still no reply.

Jeff swears, glances around the dark room.       There is a
tool bench across the room.

                           JEFF
             Hang on, baby. They're in the
             house; I can't use the lights.
             I'm gonna get you out.

He goes to   the tool bench, fumbling in the darkness. He
knocks over   a cardboard box -- a pile of car keys spill
across the   table. His hands run over an assortment of
tools.  He   locates a hammer, takes it.

Returning to the trap door, Jeff inserts the claw in the
padlock and tries to pry it open. The lock won't give.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                         91.

CONTINUED:

He strains, using all his strength.     Suddenly the handle
snaps! Jeff flies backwards.

                          JEFF
             Fuck!

He gets up, goes to the tool bench. His hands feel over
and reject an assortment of small tools. He finds a
crowbar, returns to the trap door and inserts it into the
shackle, twisting with all his might. After several
failed attempts, he swears.

                           JEFF
             It's not working. If I make any
             more noise, they'll hear.

Jeff mulls his options.    He sets his jaw, exhales.

                        JEFF
          I'm going to get you out of there,
          Amy.

He swallows, emotional, clearly torn.

                        JEFF
          I love you.
                 (under his breath)
          Please, God, let her still be
          alive.


INT. BARN - MOVING VAN CAB - NIGHT

Jeff opens the door. A weak dome light flickers on. He
climbs up into the cab and tries turning on the CB radio,
but no luck -- the keys are gone.

He opens the glove compartment. There are maps, trip
logs, truck stop receipts. He rifles through them
quickly.

Jeff frowns, gets on the floor of the cab and gropes
under the driver's seat. His eyes register a discovery.

He brings out a big black semi-automatic pistol.

Jeff studies the base of the grip, clearly unfamiliar
with guns. He fumbles with the clip, ejects it. The
clip is full of bullets.

He snaps the clip back in place.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                       92.

             Fuck you, asshole.

                                             CUT TO:


EXT. BARN - NIGHT

Jeff climbs out of the window onto the broad overhanging
eave. He steps to the edge of the roof and lowers
himself onto the Peterbilt cab, then drops to the ground.

He looks around. Red's is the only house visible. A
light flickers in the trees a mile away. It could be
anything.

Jeff moves toward the house.


EXT. RED'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT

Jeff holds the gun ready as he eases open the screen
door. The DOOR CREAKS on its hinges. Jeff steps into...


INT. RED'S HOUSE - REAR ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

Jeff lets the door close silently. There are VOICES
coming from a distant room. He passes a washing machine,
a hamper full of dirty clothes, and moves silently
down...


HALLWAY

toward the voices. VIDEO GAME sound effects emanate from
a room off the hall. Jeff flattens against the wall,
peers into the living room.

Seated on the floor with his back   to Jeff, Deke is
playing Nintendo on a wide-screen   television.  Various
items are scattered about: stereo    speakers, a jukebox, a
brand new Nordic Track. There is    a rifle rack across the
room.

Stepping past the doorway, Jeff continues down the hall
toward...


INT. RED'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Red is in the middle of telling a story.    Arleen, Billy
and Al sit around the table.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                             93.

CONTINUED:

The plates are cleared away.       They are drinking beer.

                           RED
             ... So there I am, it's a howling
             snow storm, I've got 2000 live
             chickens that are supposed to be
             in Denver days ago, and this cop
             is busting my balls because I
             haven't got chains...

Arleen and the men laugh heartily.

                           RED
             So what happens but   this big old
             rooster, damn thing   must've
             weighed ten pounds,   he reaches out
             toward that highway   patrolman...

Al glances toward the door, stops laughing.         Billy and
Arleen follow his gaze, go silent.

                           RED
             ... just reaches out with his
             beak, see, and...

Red notices his audience is no longer paying attention.
He turns in his chair, sees --


REVERSE ANGLE - JEFF

Standing in the doorway. Aiming the pistol. His clothes
caked with blood and dirt. He sways slightly.

Nobody else moves.

                           JEFF
             Give me the key.

                           RED
                    (placating)
             Now hold on, mister. I don't know
             who you are or what you want --

                           JEFF
             Give me the fucking key!

There is silence.

                           RED
                    (a beat)
             Mister --

                                                            94.

CONTINUED:

                           JEFF
             Don't mister me, you sonofabitch!
             My wife is locked in a hole in
             your fucking barn! You don't give
             me the key, I'll blow your fucking
             head off!

Arleen glances at Red, frightened.

                        ARLEEN
                 (clueless)
          Warren? What's going on?

                       RED
         I don't know, honey.        Just stay
         calm --

                       JEFF
                (to Arleen)
         Your husband's a kidnapper and a
         murderer is what's going on! Did
         you know that about him? Huh?
                (gestures)
         Ever wonder where all this stuff
         comes from?

Arleen looks up at Jeff, scared.      She starts to open her
mouth, when --

                             DEKE (O.S.)
             Stick 'em up.

Jeff turns. Nine-year-old Deke is aiming a rifle at Jeff
from the hallway. The rifle looks enormous in his hands.
The boy's lip quivers.

The room is silent. No one moves. Jeff keeps the pistol
aimed at Red. He swallows, speaks slowly:

                       JEFF
         You don't want to do that, kid.
         Just put the gun down.

                       RED
                (firm)
         Don't listen to him, Deke.        Keep
         the gun on him.

                       JEFF
         Put the gun down.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           95.

CONTINUED:

                           DEKE
                    (voice quavering)
             My daddy keeps his rifle loaded
             all the time. He showed me in
             case I needed to protect Mommy
             when he's away.

                        JEFF
          I understand that, Deke. I'm not
          gonna hurt Mommy. But if you pull
          that trigger, there's a chance
          I'll still kill your father.

                        RED
          He's lying, Deke. He can't get
          me. Just pull the trigger.

                        JEFF
          No, Deke, don't listen to him.
          He's wrong.

                           RED
          Plug him, boy!     Do what I tell
          you!

Deke looks at his father, fights back tears.        His finger
tightens on the trigger.

                        RED
          That's right, boy.       Do it.   Don't
          worry about me.

Deke whimpers, squeezes the trigger...

                          JEFF
          Deke, no -- !

Suddenly, Billy bolts from the table. The RIFLE FIRES!
The recoil knocks Deke off his feet. The bullet rips
into Al's shoulder!

                        AL
          Oww -- goddammit, you little shit!

Red is out of his chair. Jeff dives first and seizes the
rifle. He whirls, aims the pistol at Red.

                           JEFF
             Don't fucking move!

Everyone freezes.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                            96.

CONTINUED:

Jeff sidesteps to the window. Billy is running across
the yard. Is he headed for the barn? Jeff swears, turns
back.

                             JEFF
             Deke?   Deke?   Get on your feet!

Deke rises, tears streaming down his face.

                           JEFF
             It's okay, kid. Go over there,
             stand next to your mother. Hurry
             up.

Deke obeys. Clutching his shoulder wound, Al glares at
the child as he passes.

Jeff deliberates. Where the hell was Billy going?          He
gnaws his lip, decides.

                           JEFF
             Okay... on your feet.   Now,
             everybody!

Red, Arleen and Al get to their feet. Deke stays at his
mother's side. Jeff aims the pistol at Red, holds the
rifle with his other hand.

                            JEFF
          Let's go.      Out.

He herds them to the door.      Arleen looks to Red
nervously.

                        RED
          Do like he says, Arleen.      He's
          crazy.

                                                 CUT TO:


EXT. BARN - NIGHT

Jeff trains the pistol as his captives stand at the
entrance to the barn. He glances around, keeping an eye
out for Billy.

                        JEFF
                 (to Red)
          Okay. Reach into your pocket and
          hand the key to your wife.

                        RED
          This ain't gonna work, boy.

Red fishes a key ring out of his pocket and extends it to
Arleen. She just stands there.

                           RED
             It's okay, Arleen.      Take it.

She takes the keys.

Arleen inserts a key, opens the padlock.

             Good.  Now give me the keys.
                    (turning to Deke)
             Deke, push the door open.
             Quickly.

Deke looks at his father. Red nods.         Deke goes to the
door, begins wheeling it open.

                        JEFF
          That's enough, Deke.
                 (gesturing them
                  inside with gun)
          Let's go. Move it.

Jeff herds all four into --


INT. BARN - NIGHT

Jeff leads the group through the barn at gun-point.

He glances right and left, wired. The rifle is strapped
to his back. He keeps the handgun ready. He peers under
the tractor-trailer, looking for any sign of Billy.

They reach the trap door. Jeff circles it, constantly
keeping an eye on Red and Al. He hands the keys to Deke.

                        JEFF
          Deke, I need you to open this.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                       98.

CONTINUED:

Deke looks at his father. He kneels, unlocks the padlock
and heaves open the trap door, revealing a narrow
staircase slanting into the cellar.

Deke looks down into the darkness and swallows.

                           JEFF
             It's okay, Deke. There's a
             freezer down there with a woman in
             it. I need you to let her out.

Deke descends the steps, frightened.

                           DEKE (O.S.)
                    (voice quavering)
             I can't see.

Jeff jabs the pistol at Red:    Tell him where the light
is.

                        RED
                 (a beat, to Deke)
          The switch is on the right.

There's a CLICK and the light goes on in the cellar.
Deke lets out a yip of fear.

                          DEKE (O.S.)
          Dad...

                        RED
          It's all right, son.     Just ignore
          that stuff.

Jeff crouches to peer into the cellar.


JEFF'S POV - CELLAR

Roots and mildew hang in strings from the ceiling. The
light is a bare bulb. There are several distressingly-
shaped garbage bags against the wall.


BACK TO JEFF

His gaze shifts back to Red.

                          JEFF
                   (to Deke)
          Deke!    You at the freezer?

                          DEKE (O.S.)
          Yeah.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                          99.

CONTINUED:

                           JEFF
             Okay. You're almost done. Just
             open it up, let the woman out.

We hear a FREEZER BEING OPENED.

                           DEKE
             She's all tied up with tape.

                           JEFF
             You got that Swiss Army knife your
             dad gave you?

                           DEKE (O.S.)
             Uh-huh.

                           JEFF
             Good man. Use that.   Make sure
             you don't hurt her.

They wait tensely while Deke works downstairs.

                        JEFF
                 (to Red)
          You better pray she's all right.

                          DEKE (O.S.)
          I got her --

                          AMY (O.S.)
          Jeff!!??

                          JEFF
          Amy!!!

                        AMY (O.S.)
          I'm almost free!!!

                        JEFF
          Amy, come up here!

Amy climbs the stairs quickly. Scraps of duct tape cling
to her wrists. She throws her arm around Jeff.

                        AMY
          They were going to kill me.

                        JEFF
          I know, baby. It's okay.       They
          can't hurt you now.

While Amy embraces him, Jeff keeps the gun on Red and the
others. He gestures toward the cellar.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                            100.

CONTINUED:

                             JEFF
                      (to Red, Arleen, and Al)
             Okay.    Everybody in the cellar.

Nobody moves.

                             JEFF
             Do it!

Arleen and Al descend the steps.        Red follows, then
stops, halfway down.

                           RED
             Remember this moment, pretty boy.
             'Cause whatever happens, no matter
             how far you run, I will hunt you
             down and kill you like a dog.

Jeff stares back.       A beat, then:

                             JEFF
             Go to hell.

He boots Red in the chest, sending him backward down the
steps. He slams the trap door shut and locks the
padlock.

He looks around, sees a massive tool chest.         He tips it
onto the trap door -- crash!

Then he takes Amy's hand, still keeping an eye out for
Billy.

                           JEFF
             Let's get out of here.

They run from the barn.


EXT. BARN - DAWN

The first rays of sunlight are beginning to poke over the
horizon.

Jeff wheels the barn door shut and locks it.         He sees Amy
running toward Red's house.

                             JEFF
             Amy, no!    It's not safe --

                       AMY
                (turning)
         But there's a phone inside.         We
         have to call the police.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                        101.

CONTINUED:

                        JEFF
          One of them's still loose.      C'mon
          -- this way!

It's too much to explain. Jeff grabs her arm. As they
take off running toward the light flickering in the
distance.


REVEAL BILLY

lurking in the shadows at the corner of the barn,
watching.


EXT. FIELD - LONG SHOT - DAWN

Jeff and Amy are tiny figures sprinting across the flat
terrain, illuminated by the red glow of a rising sun.

                                              CUT TO:


EXT. TRAILER HOME - DAWN (MINUTES LATER)

The morning sky is lighter now.

A rickety trailer surrounded by a chicken coop, junked
appliances and a clothesline. There's an old utility
pickup truck parked in front. Jeff and Amy arrive out of
breath. Jeff pounds on the door.

                            JEFF
          Hello?   Hello?     Anybody home?

There's no answer. Jeff puts his shoulder to the door
and rams it open. The flimsy door gives way easily.


INT. TRAILER - DAWN

Jeff enters. The place is ramshackle -- torn vinyl
furniture, empty beer bottles scattered about. A
tattered flag hangs on the wall. There's no one around.

                        JEFF
                 (shouting)
          Hello? Anyone home?

Amy follows him inside, looks around. Jeff crosses the
room, snatches up a phone and dials 911.

                        JEFF
          C'mon, c'mon...

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                      102.

CONTINUED:

While he waits for an answer, Amy leans the rifle against
the wall. She notices a set of car keys hanging by the
door.

                         JEFF
                 (re: keys)
          Take it. We may need to get out
          of here --
                 (into phone,
                  suddenly)
          Hello! This is Jeff Taylor. I'm
          reporting an emergency... I don't
          know the address, the house
          belongs to a Red Barr -- I mean,
          Warren something... No, I don't
          know his name!

                            AMY
                     (suddenly hearing
                      something)
          Jeff --

A DEEP RUMBLE is approaching, GETTING LOUDER by the
second...

                        JEFF
          No -- he kidnapped my wife, he's
          locked in a barn... Jeffrey
          Taylor. If you contact the police
          in --

Amy pulls a curtain aside, reacts to what she sees --

                            AMY
                     (panicked)
             Jeff!

Suddenly, the ROAR is DEAFENING --

The PETERBILT EXPLODES through the wall of the trailer
home!


JEFF AND AMY

dive out of the way.


INT. RED'S PETERBILT - DAY

Inside the truck cab, we catch a glimpse of Red behind
the wheel, shouting something inaudible. Fragments of
debris cling to the grille.

                                                       103.

INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

The rickety structure spins 360 degrees!

Jeff goes flying. A TELEVISION somersaults across the
room and EXPLODES. Amy slams into a wall.

The speeding Peterbilt shears away a section of the
trailer home with a horrible RIPPING sound!

The trailer home is suddenly open to the sky.


INT. TRUCK CAB - DAY

Red puts the truck into a hard turn, circling for another
run at the devastated trailer.


INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

Jeff struggles to his knees.

                             JEFF
          Amy?!

Amy is crawling over the debris. Jeff pulls her to her
feet. He grabs the rifle and car keys.

                             JEFF
          C'mon!

They stagger through the gaping hole in the trailer.


INT. TRUCK CAB - DAY

Red sees Amy and Jeff flee the trailer and head for the
utility pickup. He throws the Peterbilt into a turn.


YARD

Amy and Jeff run for the Ford F100 utility truck -- an
aging blue-collar workhorse equipped with side-mounted
toolboxes and a lumber rack bearing a ladder.


IN FORD

Jeff keys the ignition. The ENGINE SPUTTERS. Amy whips
around to see the Peterbilt bearing down from the side.

                             AMY
          Jeff, go!    Go!

                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                        104.

CONTINUED:

Jeff turns the key. The ENGINE CATCHES!   He throws the
Ford in gear and floors the gas.

The Ford shoots out of the Peterbilt's path!


HIGHWAY

The FORD PEELS OUT of the driveway and joins the road,
spewing exhaust. It's an old vehicle that doesn't
maneuver well.


IN FORD

Jeff mashes the gas pedal. The ENGINE STRAINS,
BACKFIRING. Amy looks back, sees the Peterbilt joining
the road.

                         AMY
           Can't this thing go any faster?!

A SHOTGUN BLAST SHATTERS the passenger WINDOW! Amy
screams as glass showers the cab. Jeff swerves wildly.

                         JEFF
           What the fuck?!

He swivels his head right, sees --


FIREBIRD

kicking up a cloud of dust as it pulls alongside the Ford
on the right-hand shoulder.

The driver, Billy, is levelling a shotgun through the
window.


JEFF

cranks the wheel.

                          JEFF
           Get down!


IN FIREBIRD

Billy triggers a BLAST!

                                                       105.

AMY

yelps as the passenger-side MIRROR DISINTEGRATES!    She
whips around, sees --


CADILLAC DEVILLE

pulling even with them on Jeff's side. The drive, Al,
leers as he spins the wheel and creases the Ford --
CRUNCH!


JEFF

raises the PISTOL and FIRES!


HIGHWAY

The Ford is sandwiched between the Cadillac and Firebird
as they race down the highway with the Peterbilt in the
rear.


JEFF

lets out a cry as they carom off the Cadillac. Blood
flows in a trickle down his neck. Amy sees it,
panicking.

                        AMY
          Jeff!

                         JEFF
          It's glass!   Use the rifle!

Amy raises the rifle, thrusts the barrel awkwardly out
the window and aims at Billy. She FIRES wildly -- BANG!


BILLY

grins as the SHOT WHISTLES past harmlessly. He reloads
the SHOTGUN, snaps it shut and RETURNS FIRE -- BLAM!


HIGHWAY

The BLAST hits the Ford's side-mounted toolbox.     The door
flies open. Tools scatter on the road!

                                                      106.

BILLY

veers away, swearing, as hammers and chisels and power
tools hit the asphalt and bounce up into his path.

The front end of the extension ladder comes free from the
lumber rack and hinges into his path, SMASHING the
WINDSHIELD!

                         BILLY
          Sonofabitch!

Billy swears and jerks the wheel, steering away. He
glances up suddenly, sees Jeff aiming the pistol.

The PISTOL FIRES!

Billy slams backward against the headrest, hit in the
face. There's blood everywhere. The car careens toward
the shoulder.


HIGHWAY

The Firebird hits a mound of earth, flies through the air
and lands with a CRASH!


IN PETERBILT

Red sees the crash, scowling. He presses the gas and
pulls closer, taking Billy's place alongside the Ford.


IN FORD

Amy sees the Peterbilt advancing. Whipping her head to
the other side, she sees Al raising a pistol.

                         AMY
          Look out!

Al jacks the trigger -- BLAM!    BLAM!


ON PETERBILT

a STRAY BULLET SLICES the hydraulic brake line running to
the trailer. The HOSE HISSES and whips through the air!


IN PETERBILT

Red swears and lets the truck fall back, swearing. Up
ahead is a long, curving downgrade. He taps the brakes.
There is a jolt as the trailer bumps the tractor.

                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                     107.

CONTINUED:

                              RED
             Sonofabitch --

He realizes:    The trailer's got no brakes.


HIGHWAY

The Peterbilt descends the grade, letting out a RAPID-
FIRE BLAT of BACKFIRES. It's gaining speed, bearing down
on the Ford.


IN FORD

Amy turns in the seat, terrified. The truck looms
closer. Jeff keeps the gas pedal on the floor.

                              JEFF
             Hang on!

They are flying into a hairy curve.


IN PETERBILT

Red struggles to stay in control. Every time he applies
the brakes, the unchecked trailer jars the cab forward.

The Peterbilt races into the curve.

Red has no choice. He has to pump the brakes and risk
jackknifing or the truck will fly off the road
altogether.

He hits the brakes!


HIGHWAY

The huge TRUCK SCREECHES on the asphalt, tires smoking,
cab and trailer folding at right angles!

Then, unexpectedly, the trailer disconnects from the cab!


IN CADILLAC

Flanking the Peterbilt, Al glances to the side and sees
the trailer come untethered from the cab.

Now the trailer is an unguided missile, weaving drunkenly
back and forth across the blacktop.

Al tries to swerve away. The trailer streaks toward him.
Al SLAMS on the BRAKES, screaming!

                                                        108.

HIGHWAY

The trailer piles into the Cadillac. There is a huge
IMPACT as trailer and Cadillac are reduced to scrap
metal!

And just as this is happening...


PETERBILT

blasts into the rear of the Ford, jarring it forward with
a CRUNCH of METAL and taillights!


JEFF

slams against the wheel. Amy is thrown against the
dashboard. The Ford is being propelled downhill by the
Peterbilt.


HIGHWAY

The two vehicles are now locked together, gaining speed
as they hurtle down the grade.


JEFF

jams the pistol through the rear pass-through window and
FIRES at Red in the truck. BULLETS PING off the grille.

The GUN CLICKS empty.


IN PETERBILT

Red hits the brakes, but it's no use. The bumpers are
meshed. The two vehicles plunge downhill, skidding
sideways.

Up ahead, a concrete bridge spans a deep gorge.


HIGHWAY

The Peterbilt and Ford fly onto the bridge. The big
truck glances off a railing. The vehicles suddenly come
unlocked.

The FORD plows into the concrete railing with a CRASH!

The PETERBILT creams it from behind and caroms away,
SKIDDING the length of the bridge before SMACKING the
opposite railing!

                                                        109.

INSIDE ROAD

Jeff grimaces. In front of them, the concrete railing
has broken away. Debris falls 300 feet to the bottom of
the gorge. The Ford's right front tire hangs in the air.

Jeff looks at Amy.   She looks wildly adrenalated, eyes
wide.

                           JEFF
          You all right?

Amy looks back at him.   She expels a long breath and
nods.

Jeff forces his upper body through the driver's window
and looks over the Ford's roof at the Peterbilt.


JEFF'S POV - PETERBILT

It's facing them, 50 yards away on the bridge. The
engine is dead. STEAM HISSES from the crumpled radiator.
One tire is shredded.

There is blood on the broken windshield.


BACK TO JEFF

sitting in the driver's window. He squints toward the
truck, searching for any sign of Red. There is none.

                         AMY (O.S.)
          Jeff...

                         JEFF
          Yeah?

                        AMY (O.S.)
          Jeff... I can't get out...

Jeff drops back into the cab. The dashboard is crushed
against Amy's legs. She tries to wriggle free.

                         JEFF
          What is it?

                        AMY
                 (wriggling)
          It's just... I can't get out...

                       JEFF
         What do you mean?

                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                        110.

CONTINUED:

                           AMY
             I mean I can't get out!

Jeff blinks. He climbs out of the Ford, runs around to
Amy's side and yanks the door. It comes open with a
CREAK of METAL.

Behind Jeff on the bridge, a MOTOR KICKS OVER.   He
whirls.


JEFF'S POV - PETERBILT

EXHAUST BELCHES from the smokestacks. Red is behind the
wheel. His face is covered with blood. He stares
hatefully.

With a RASP of GEARS, the Peterbilt lurches forward.


BACK TO JEFF

He pushes against the dashboard with life-or-death
urgency.

                          JEFF
            C'mon, Amy, push!

Amy struggles and struggles to free her legs.

                          JEFF
            Push, goddammit!

Amy glances toward the Peterbilt, terrified.


PETERBILT

creeps toward the Ford. The truck's grille is smashed.
One wheel RIM SCRAPES the asphalt. It gains speed.


IN FORD

Jeff crawls over Amy and tries pushing with his legs.
She winces as the metal cuts into her skin. Jeff
strains.

                           AMY
                    (turning, reacting)
            Jeff!

                                                       111.

PETERBILT

rams the rear of the FORD -- CRASH! It jars the pickup
farther through broken concrete guardrail.


IN FORD

Jeff and Amy are thrown forward by the impact. The
Peterbilt's ENGINE ROARS. It's pushing them over the
edge!


IN PETERBILT

Red's eyes burn as he presses the accelerator and forces
the pickup farther through the broken railing.


FORD

lurches through the widening gap in the railing.
Concrete sails into the canyon. The front tires hang
over the void.


IN FORD

Jeff strains against the dashboard. It won't give.     He
whips around, swearing, and leaps from the Ford.

                           AMY
                    (panicked)
            Jeff?


ON BRIDGE

Jeff runs to the Peterbilt and jumps on the driver's side
running board, grasping the door handle.

Red heaves the door open suddenly. It strikes Jeff's
head with a crack! He falls backward to the ground.


IN PETERBILT

Red presses the gas, yelling over the ENGINE ROAR. The
railing is giving way. He sees Jeff struggling to his
feet.

                          RED
            You think you can come into my
            life and fuck with me? Nobody
            fucks with me!

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                       112.

CONTINUED:

He looks down.   Jeff is no longer visible.   Red frowns.

Suddenly the passenger side door flies open and Jeff
surges into the cab, landing on Red, clawing at his eyes!

They grapple in the cab. Red swings an elbow into Jeff's
face -- crack. Jeff drives a fist to his jaw!

The steering wheel drifts counter-clockwise as the truck
inches forward, ramming the Ford closer to the precipice.

Red gets his hands around Jeff's neck as the steering
wheel continues to move counter-clockwise...


ON BRIDGE

The truck is no longer hitting the Ford squarely.
Instead, the Peterbilt's right front tire is riding up
and over the cargo bed, crushing the left side of the
Ford under its massive weight.


IN PETERBILT

Red has both hands around Jeff's windpipe.    He glances up
for a second, reacts, but it's too late.


ON BRIDGE

The Peterbilt is surging up the driver's side of the
Ford, using the pickup like a ramp!


IN FORD

Amy screams as the left side of the cab is flattened
under the Peterbilt's weight!


ON BRIDGE

For an instant, the Peterbilt's front tires seem to hang
in the air... then the truck is falling!


IN PETERBILT

Red and Jeff are thrown forward in the cab, still
flailing at each other, as the truck plunges nose-first
into the gorge.

Then it jerks to a halt in mid-air!

                                                       113.

ON BRIDGE

The left rear set of wheels on the trailer is snagged on
the thick rebar reinforcement in the crumbled concrete
railing.

The Peterbilt is dangling nose-down from the bridge!


IN PETERBILT

Jeff slams into the windshield. Red lands on top of him.
Loose objects from the cab rain against the windshield.

They grapple. Red grabs Jeff's arm and twists sharply,
forcing it at an impossible angle. Their faces are
inches apart.

                          RED
            You think you can fuck with me?!

He headbutts Jeff viciously -- crack! Blood erupts from
Jeff's nose and mouth. Red is about to deliver another
blow when...

... the windshield falls away! The loose items in the
cab plummet 300 feet to the canyon floor below.

Jeff drops through the windshield opening. He clings to
the center support column. His legs dangle over the
hood.

Red slips through the opening, his hand locking on the
steering wheel at the last instant.

The windshield sails away into the gorge.


ON BRIDGE

The iron REBAR GROANS. It's beginning to give way under
the weight of the truck. The truck slips slightly.


ON PETERBILT

Jeff feels the truck shifting. He grabs the windshield
wiper blade with his free hand. The blade snaps away.

Red is clinging to the steering wheel. He flails at Jeff
with his feet, swearing. Jeff is barely out of reach.

Jeff looks to the side. There is a grabhandle on the
corner of the cab. He reaches with his free hand and
seizes the handle.

                                                      114.

ON BRIDGE

The REBAR GROANS. The truck is wedged against the Ford.
As the truck slips, it forces the Ford closer to the
edge.


ON PETERBILT

Jeff clings to the handle. He reaches for the passenger
side door handle, working his way up toward the bridge.


REBAR

gives away once more and --


JEFF

scales the cab, finding more handholds.   He climbs past
the passenger door.

Behind him, Red is working his way higher in the same
manner. He grabs Jeff's foot, trying to pull him off the
cab.

Jeff kicks free and climbs past the sleeping compartment.
Red grabs the door handle. Jeff boots the door release
button.

The passenger door flies open!

Red falls away as the door opens. He's clinging to the
open passenger door, suspended over the gorge.


IN FORD

Amy breathes in sharply, feeling the Ford move closer to
the edge. She struggles to free her legs from the
dashboard.

                          AMY
            Oh God... Jeff...


JEFF

climbs higher. The Peterbilt slips again.    Below, Red
loses his grip and almost falls.

Jeff hauls himself onto the bridge with a final gasp of
exertion. He runs to the passenger side of the Ford.

                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                        115.

CONTINUED:

The Ford teeters precariously. Any move could send it
over the edge. Jeff can only extend his hand to Amy over
the void.

                          JEFF
            C'mon, Amy, it's all you now...
            you can do it...

With a huge effort, Amy frees herself from the dashboard
and reaches for Jeff's outstretched hand just as --


PETERBILT

comes free from the rebar!


AMY

takes hold of Jeff's hand.


PETERBILT

plummets into the canyon!


RED

screams!


PETERBILT

seems to fall forever... before landing with a huge
EXPLOSION!


ON BRIDGE

Jeff and Amy fall backward on the road. Down below,
secondary EXPLOSIONS rock the canyon. Jeff takes Amy in
his arms.

                          AMY
            Don't let me go, Jeff...

                          JEFF
            I won't, baby... I won't ever let
            you go...

He looks into her eyes.   Their lips meet in a kiss and
we --

                                              DISSOLVE TO:

                                                       116.

EXT. RED'S HOUSE - DAY

Police cars and official vehicles are parked outside the
house. RADIOS CHATTER. Yellow crime tape holds back
onlookers and news reporters.

Cops and evidence technicians work the scene. A
criminalist photographs stolen property as it's carried
out of the barn.

A plainclothes FBI AGENT closes a cellphone and walks
over to where Jeff and Amy are sitting at a picnic table.
They are battered and bandaged.

                        JEFF
          How's the sheriff?

                        FBI AGENT
          Out of surgery. It looks like
          he's gonna make it. As for the
          wife and kid, she's not talking,
          he's being turned over to
          Protective Services.

Jeff nods soberly.

                        FBI AGENT
          We've got I.D. on the dead
          suspects. Turns out they were all
          licensed truckers. One of 'em had
          a rap for check kiting. Otherwise
          they could've been model citizens.

                        JEFF
          What about the leader?

                        FBI AGENT
          Same thing. His real name's
          Warren Claney. Three speeding
          tickets in five years -- apart
          from that, he's clean as a
          whistle.

Amy watches as cops stack windshields outside the barn.

                         AMY
                 (dazed)
          How could they do it? How could
          they treat it like a... business?

                       FBI AGENT
                (shaking his head)
         I don't know. I've been doing
         this 15 years, I've never seen
         anything like it.
                       (MORE)

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                         117.

CONTINUED:

                           FBI AGENT (CONT'D)
             It was simple, efficient and
             organized. They stayed on the
             move, spread it over a dozen
             states. As long as no witnesses
             survived, it's an untraceable
             crime.
                    (looking at them)
             You were just a couple of the
             lucky ones.

Up ahead, a television news helicopter is landing on the
road. A cameraman, reporter and producer hurry over.

Jeff watches the news crew, a bemused expression.   It
seems like a million years ago...

The FBI Agent shakes his head, disdainful.

                       FBI
                (re: media)
         C'mon -- let's get you folks out
         of here before things really get
         hairy.

He escorts them to a waiting sedan. As they climb in,
Jeff looks back over his shoulder, surveying the scene
one last time.

He gets in and the car pulls away just as the frenzied
news crew arrives, mikes and cameras at the ready,
running alongside the departing sedan, shouting
questions.

Through the rear window, we see Jeff putting his arm
around Amy, pulling her close as we hear:

                        AMY
          Promise me one thing...

                          JEFF
          Name it.

                        AMY
          Next time... we fly.


EXT. HOUSE - AERIAL - DAY

Over this last line, the sedan drives away, and we CLIMB
HIGHER and HIGHER AWAY FROM the bristling crime scene
until the ranch house is just one in a town of modest
houses and the pink desert floor spreads out endlessly in
every direction.
                                           FADE OUT.
                         THE END
