          In the third millennium, the
          world... changed.

                         NARRATOR(CONT'D)
          Climate. Nations. Borders. All
          were in upheaval. Humanity itself
          turned as violent as the planet.
          Civilization threatened to collapse.
          And then... a solution was found.
          The crumbling, teetering legal
          system was merged with the
          overburdened police, creating a
          powerful and efficient hybrid.
          Trained equally in jurisprudence
           and combat, these new guardians (X)
           of Society could dispense both
           justice and punishment. They were (X)
           police, jury and executioner, all
           in one. They were... The Judges.

          It looks like the beginning of time... or its end. Nothing
          grows here. Nothing could. This is the CURSED EARTH. With a
          WHIRR, a SHUTTLE appears in the sky. We PAN it to a GIANT CITY

          Hershey nods. Brisco, eager to prove himself, steps in front
          of Dredd at the Heavenly Block entrance.

          Dredd pushes Brisco behind Hershey. Turns toward Heavenly as

          Order, order! As presiding Justice,
          I only vote to break a tie. But
          I wish to address the question of
          Judge Griffin's crime package. Is
          there any objection?

                         GRIFFIN

          choices will bring peace and order. (X)
          That delusion has been tried and
          failed before. If the citizens of
          Mega-City are demanding more control
          of their lives, that's not a threat

          (a look to Griffin)
          Not to bolt the door and throw away
          the key! My fellow Judges, I was (X)
          barely in my teens when I put on
          this badge. When the time comes
          for me to take it off... let me do
          it. knowing that it stood for
          Freedom... and not for Repression.
          He sits down. Clearly he has changed the mood of the room.

          Nine years ago, the Lawgiver Model
          Two replaced the Lawgiver Model One.
          The difference lies in two areas:
          The computer chip and the ammunition
          coding. Like the Model one, the
          computer chip recognizes the
          thumbcode of all Judges. Judges
          may use each other's firearms; but
          a suspect dare not use a Judge's
          .weapon against "a Judge.
          ANIMATION reminds us of this in non-gory fashion.

                         CENTRAL(CONT'D)
          However, the ammunition coding in
          the Model Two is not cued to the (X)

          Instead, it is coded to the personal
          DNA of the Judge using the weapon.

EXTREME CLOSEUP of glowing honey-colored stones.  Their shapes ABSTRACT
as THE CAMERA EXAMINES air bubbles and crystalline patterns.

MOVING UP AND OVER this amber abstraction, the CAMERA FINDS unusual
shapes and imperfections caught in the glassy stone:  flecks of dirt,
hairs, cracks.  STILL MOVING.  STARBURSTS OF LIGHT ricochet off the
different surfaces of the stones.

CAMERA TURNS along a creamy stretch of amber.  IT TURNS IN DEEPER,
abstracting the picture further only to find A TINY BLUR that suddenly
RACKS INTO FOCUS - a bug, a mosquito lodged within an amber tomb.  It is
folded on its back.

SLOW MOTION
 as the tip of a fine-pointed drill bores into the amber
toward the trapped bug.  Orange flecks fly.  The mosquito trembles.  The
drill continues, stopping just before it touches the tiny body.

A SHINY PAIR of thin needle-nose pliers reach in the borehole and
extricate the mosquito remains.  These are dropped on a brightly lit
glass slide.  A conveyor belt starts, and the slide moves along.
arriving under a long-lensed microscope.

IN MICROSCOPIC PERSPECTIVE, a thin needle pierces the bug and delicately
removes a fragment of tissue.

PINCERS snare the fragment, dropping it into a narrow tube.  The tube
SPINS, faster and faster until it is a BLUR on the screen.

THE SCREEN FLOODS with an INFRA-RED LIGHT.  Gray, oval shapes rock in a
neutral mist.

                                                     WASH OUT TO:

HOT SUN overhead in a BIG SKY -


EXT  BADLANDS - AFTERNOON

Lodged in the cracked earth are the partially-exposed fossilized remains
of A VELOCIRAPTER, a carnivorous dinosaur.  WIDEN OUT to a SWEEPI
NG
PANORAMA of a dinosaur dig, a major excavation filled with workers
shoveling earth and stone, making measurements, taking photographs,
scribbling notes, and conferring with each other.

The center of all this activity is one man.  In a roped-off area that
circumscribes the exposed bones of the raptor, is DR. ALAN GRANT, head
paleontologist.  Good-looking, late 30's, with a think beard.

Grant lies on his belly, completely absorbed in a small piece of bone.
A GROUP OF TWELVE STUDENTS, notebooks in hand, await his next sentence.

CLOSE ON - the tiny bone.  Grant's nose touches it.

Grant brushes the bone with a toothbrush.  Then he decides on a quicker
way to clean it.  He licks it.  Excited by his discovery, he gets to his
feet and addresses his students, who listen raptly.

                            GRANT
          Right calcaneus of an adult female
          raptor.  Mild stress fractures.  What's
          this tell me?

Students look at each other.  A tentative hand.  Grant continues.

               
             GRANT
          It tells me that this bone connects to
          the navicula which we already found
          articulating to the cuboid.

OFFSCREEN, a woman SHOUTS to him.

                            ELLIE (off)
          Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!

Grant looks up.

DR. ELLIE SATTLER, late 20's, sharp-eyed, tough if she wants to be, runs
like a gazelle across the arid land.  Exuberant, she leaves a trail of
dust behind her.

She zips by A STUDENT guarding the cordoned area.  He tries to stop her.

                            STUDENT
          Dr. Sattler!  Dr. Grant is thinking!

Dr. Grant waves her over enthusiastically with his bone and continues.

                            GRANT
          So, what can we stay for sure?  Stress
          fractures in the heel ...

Uncertain students.  Ellie arrives and immediately gets into it.

                            ELLIE
          She jumps.

Grant turns around to her and smiles.  She's got it.  Other students to
- they knew is all along.

            
                GRANT
          Right as rain, Ellie.  Now, why did she
          jump?

No answer.  Ellie gives it a try.

                            ELLIE
          A defensive posture against a vicious,
          blood-thirsty T-Rex?

                            GRANT
              (nodding)
          Perhaps.  Or maybe to select the smaller,
          more tender leaves in the higher branches
          with which to suckle her young?

Ellie jumps up.

                            ELLIE
          I bet is was a mating ritual.

Students laugh.  One student eyes Grant's self-conscious smile at Ellie.

                            GRANT
          The science of paleontology can't answer
          these questions.  Novelists and artists
          who dream a vision of the Jurassic period
          can attempt these questions with their
          imaginations.  What we scientists can say
          is considering the mass and kinetic
          articulation of these bones, this animal
          had a vertical leap
 of about twelve feet.
          Not as entertaining as fiction, but
          absolutely fact without prejudice.

Ellie intrudes again.

                            ELLIE
          Excuse me, Dr. Grant.  But ... fact is,
          we're late.  There's the car.

She points.  On the horizon, a limousine speeds toward them, leaving a
dusty wake.

Grant sets the rules for his departure, giving instructions individually
as Ellie pulls him away, carrying their bags.

                            GRANT
          Jim, you keep making up the plaster
          batches.  Whatever ratio you're using,
          it's perfect.  Nora, no digging after
          five - when the temperature drops, those
          bones are just too brittle.  Bill, I
          don't want any tourists walking over my
          raptor - I don't care if the Governor of
          Montana is with them, just you guys.

Grant and Ellie continue walking.  She interrupts his continued barrage.

                            ELLIE
          You know, if ev
ery scientist stuck to his
          method like you, there would be no body
          of theory - no quasars, no big bang -

Grant stops at the sight of the stopped limo and freezes.

                            GRANT
          Jesus, a limousine.  We're re-entering
          Hammond's world, that's for sure.  (beat)
          Remind me why we're doing this, Ellie.

Ellie is gentle.  She's telling him something they've discussed before.

                            ELLIE
          We're leaving the raptor dig -

                            GRANT
          - at a critical time -

                            ELLIE
          - because Gennaro is paying us sixty
          thousand dollars to observe some resort
          of Hammond's in Costa Rica. And that's -

                            GRANT
          - enough money to keep us free of
          commercial affiliations for two summers.
          All right, all right.  Good.

Then, half-kidding with Ellie:

                            GRANT
          Financial
 independence for fraternizing
          with the enemy?  (beat)  I'll do it.

She laughs.  But he can't quite leave.  He grabs a computer printout

                            GRANT
          This is all could come up with, Skip?

Skip turns the printout right-side up in Grant's hand.  Grant smiles.

                            GRANT
          Wise guy.  Let's go, Ellie.

Grant and Ellie board the limo amidst many goodbyes from the students.
The limo pulls away.


EXT  HIGH TECH BUILDING - BIOGENETIC CORPORATION HQ - SUNSET

A purple sunset irradiates the exterior glass walls of the building.


INT  BIOGEN HQ

A peanut flies in the air.  Then falls into a big open mouth.  THOMP.

                            MOUTH
          Five hundred thousand is peanuts!

He tosses another peanut and misses his open mouth.  This is DENNIS
NEDRY, a 40 year old computer programmer.  He's fat, with greasy hair
and a permanently wrinkled suit.  His slovenly looks are wildly out of
place on the rich leather sofa where he reclin
es.

Across a gleaming granite coffee table is BILL BAKER, businessman.  A
smooth meticulous dresser, Baker is disgusted by Nedry's sloppy
appearance and voracious consumption of food and drink.

Nedry finishes a coke.  Over his shoulder is an impressive skyline view.

                            NEDRY
          I'm not reneging.  I'm re-evaluating.

Nedry holds the can of coke upside-down, drains the last drops.

                            NEDRY
          You think I'm a scumbag, I know.

Nedry chuckles, lines up three peanuts on the table.  One after the
other, he throws them in the air.  He gulps down two, misses one. It
skids across the glossy floor.

Baker's head involuntarily cocks as he looks disgustedly at Nedry.

                            NEDRY
          Look pal, you make a career in biogenetic
          industrial espionage, and you're bound to
          run across a scumbag or two.  Guaranteed!
          Part of the job description.  Look, who's
          to say, who is the real scumbag?  After
          all, I know what you guys need so bad.
          I've heard of reverse engineering.

As Nedry continues he shovels nuts into his mouth and CHOMPS and SPEAKS.

                            NEDRY
          Let the other guy put in all the work,
          all the R and D.  You take the finished
          product, work backwards, breaking it down
          to reveal its genetic code.  Presto!  In
          a few measly months you have know-how
          that took researchers ten years to
          determine.  You know how much Hammond has
          invested of his own personal wealth?
          Over five billion dollars!  And if you
          guys get the jump on his - in no time,
          the market's wide-open.

Nedry starts the LAUGH as he EATS and TALKS.

                            NEDRY
          But, boy, he's really got his product!
          Oh yes siree, massive, gargantuan, money-
          making, never-heard-of-profit-like-that
          product.  It is a sight!  Yes, indeedy!

Nedry LAUGH
S explosively.  He begins to choke, COUGHING and GASPING.

Baker is repulsed.  He stares out the window as the sun sets.

Nedry, in true distress, clutches his own throat.  He clumsily runs
toward Baker, toppling chairs as he goes.  Nedry grabs Baker's hand and
squeezes it tightly, imploring Baker for help.  Baker coolly shakes his
hand loose and shoves Nedry to the floor.  Baker looks down at the prone
and desperate Nedry.

                            BAKER
          Scumbag.  We have a deal.  That deal is
          not open to renegotiation.  Or even re-
          evaluation.

Bakers kneels down next to Nedry, who is beginning to turn blue.

                            BAKER
          The deal stands.  Take it or leave it.

Baker glances at his watch.

                            BAKER
          I'll give you a few minutes to decide.

Nedry makes a superhuman effort just to nod his head.  Baker nods back
and SLAMS his fist into Nedry's solar plexus.  It works.

Nedry sucks in a huge gulp of air.  He sits up
, rubbing his belly.  As
Baker leaves the room:

                            BAKER
          Make sure the eggs are on that supply
          ship.  Just make sure!

CAMERA LEAVES NEDRY and exits the window.    IT SWISHPANS the concrete
canyons of Wall Street and enters another office.


INT  CONSERVATIVE LAW OFFICE - DAY

DONALD GENNARO, handsome,  meticulously dressed, paces the highly
polished, glassy corner suite.  His boss, ROSS, is seated.  He's a
powerful black man who waves a prosthetic arm.

                            ROSS
          We can't trust Hammond anymore.  He's
          under too much pressure.  There's the
          EPA, he's behind schedule, and the in-
          vestors are getting nervous.  There have
          been too many rumors, too many accidents.
          We can't screw around with this.

                            GENNARO
          I've asked Hammond to arrange independent
          site inspections every week for the next
          three weeks.

                            ROS
S
          What does he say?

                            GENNARO
          Insists nothing's wrong on the island.

                            ROSS
          You know him.  Do you believe him?

                             GENNARO
          No, I don't.  I spent a lot of time with
          him five years ago when we raised the
          capital.  And it was a wild ride.  He's
          unpredictable, a dreamer.

                            ROSS
          Potentially dangerous.  We should never
          have gotten involved.  What's our position?

                            GENNARO
          The firm owns five percent.

                            ROSS
          General or limited?

                            GENNARO
          General.

                            ROSS
          We should have never done that.

                            GENNARO
          It seemed wise at the time.  We all
          wanted the park to happen.  It was in
          lieu of fees.

                            ROSS
        
  In any case, I agree an inspection is
          overdue.  Who are your site experts?

Gennaro tosses a list on Ross' desk.  He check it out.

                            ROSS
          Will they tell the truth?

                            GENNARO
          I think so.  That guy Grant's a hotshot
          in his field, always goes his own way -

                            ROSS
          - Good.  You're making all the arrangements?

                            GENNARO
          Hammond asked to place the calls himself.
          I think he wants to pretend the park is
          not in trouble.  That it's just a social
          invitation, showing off the island.

                            ROSS
          All right ... Good.  But let's be very
          clear about one thing.  I don't know how
          bad this situation actually is, Donald.
          But if there's a problem on that island -
          don't be afraid to screw Hammond and burn
          Jurassic Park to the ground.

Gennaro shakes hands 
awkwardly with Ross and leaves.  Ross paces.  Fed-
up, he whispers to himself.

                            ROSS
          Costa Rica, my ass.

He whacks his desk globe, sends its spinning.

CAMERA MOVES IN on spinning globe as we HEAR the ROTOR BLADES of a
helicopter and DISSOLVE TO:


INT/EXT  HELICOPTER IN SKY - DAWN

On the helicopter tail is a little blue logo that reads: Isla Nublar.

INSIDE, Grant, Ellie and Gennaro are in the right back row.  Ellie
dozes, her head occasionally dropping onto Grant's shoulder, to his
discomfort.  Gennaro looks at papers, trying not to look through the
clear plexi-bubble at their feet.  Next to THE PILOT, Nedry chews a
candy bar.  He offers candy to the back row.

Grant loses himself, looking out the window.

GRANT'S POV - the aquamarine blue of the ocean.  Below the waters there
are the shadows of ample marine life.  Dolphins leap in the air.
Suddenly the clear scene becomes obscured by clouds.

There is turbulence.  Ellie wakes, glances at Grant, then out the
window.  
There is mist and she absently traces her finger in it, shaping
a dinosaur figure.  Now land comes into view and for a moment, the
island below them eerily fits right into her doodling.

                            PILOT
          That's Isla Nublar.  Buckle up, the
          descent is a little hairy.

Gennaro cinches his belt tightly and half-shuts his eyes.  Nedry takes
out a sandwich and cockily loosens his belt.  Ellie looks every way.

                            ELLIE
          This is exciting!

                            GRANT
          What is, Ellie?  Where are we going?

Grant looks out his window. The helicopter rushes forward, low to the
water.  Ahead, Grant sees the island, rugged and craggy, rising sharply

                            GRANT
          Looks like Alcatraz.

The pilot coughs and rubs his goggles with the back of his hand.

                            PILOT
          There's bad wind shear on this peak.

Grant nods.  Gennaro sweats, watching the pilot tighten his own belt.

Ellie
 smiles excitedly as the helicopter starts down.  Now, A BLANKET
FOG.  Grant can't see a thing out his window.  Ellie's startled.

                            ELLIE
          How the hell is he landing this thing?

No answer.  Grant dimly discerns green branches of pine trees through
the mist.  Some are very close.  Ellie's hands grasps her seat cushion.

                            ELLIE
          This is not fun.

Grant looks through the plexi-bubble at his feet.  He sees the giant
glowing fluorescent cross below.  Lights FLASH at corners of the cross.

                            GRANT
          Relax, Ellie.  I'm sure they wouldn't
          land if it weren't safe.

The copter suddenly SHAKES violently.  Ellie grabs Grant's hand.
Gennaro sits straight up, eyes squeezed shut.

                            GRANT
          Gennaro?  This guy knows what he's doing,
          Right?  Hey, Gennaro?  I'm talking to you!

Another violent shake.  Grant squeezes Ellie's hand back.

CLOSEUP - Nedry's hand crushes a 
packet of crackers.

Gennaro is soaked.  He opens one eye and looks about, very frightened.
He speaks a mantra.

                            GENNARO
          No problem.  Relax, relax.

The pilot whispers to himself and corrects slightly.  The copter sails
sharply the other way.

                            GRANT AND ELLIE
          Whoa!!!!

CLOSE ON - the pilot jerks back the stick.

THE COPTER zooms upward.  Grant's beverage flips to the ground, pours
across the floor.

Nedry's lunch does flying.  Sandwich, candy, and cracker crumbs hang
suspended in the air.  Now it all FREE-FALLS onto Nedry's lap.

Grant and Ellie lean tightly into each other,

                            ELLIE
          I don't like this feeling ...

The pilot swings his gaze, left then right, looking at the pine forest.
Trees are close, then far, then close.  The helicopter drops rapidly.
Ellie and Grant shut their eyes.  They brace themselves for the worst.

IN AND OUT OF THE MIST, the copter descends.  Tail raised high, nose
low, fo
r a moment it looks like a strange bug-eyes prehistoric animal
bucking in its pen.  In a flash, it corrects itself.  The copter touches
down on a heli-pad.  The SOUND of the rotors fades and dies.

For a second, no one moves.  Grant lets out a great sigh of relief.
Gennaro mouths a silent prayer.  The pilot stretches his fingers.

Grant and Ellie self-consciously shake their hands free of each other.
Nedry unbuckles and laughs as he brushes off his lap.  He turns:

                            NEDRY
          Just think, Gennaro -
              (laughs harder)
          - you gotta agree it's funny!  These two,
          they dig up dinosaurs!  It's wonderful,
          isn't it?

Nedry pats Grant on his shoulder.

                            NEDRY
          Dr. Bones, you're going to love this place.

Nedry bursts out laughing again as he heads out the helicopter door.

A smile comes across Gennaro's face.  As he smiles he motions with his
hands he doesn't mean any harm.  Grant and Ellie stare at him.

      
                      PILOT
          Come on folks.  Gotta get back, there's a
          storm alert.

ROTORS TURN.  OUTSIDE, a man reaches the copter.  He wears a baseball
cap over short red hair and he's dressed in phony safari garb.  He
shakes Gennaro's hand.  This is ED REGIS, 35, head of Public Relations.
He throws open the copter door next to Grant.  Big, cheerful smile.

                            REGIS
          Hi!  Ed Regis.  Real big welcome to Isla
          Nublar, Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler.  Little
          tough landing here, I know.  But you did
          it!  Come on down, we're so happy to have
          you.  Now, watch your step.

Ellie and Grant jump into the world of Jurassic Park.


EXT  LUSH TROPICAL FOREST - MORNING

Grant takes in the beautiful tropical terrain.  This place is the
opposite of the Badlands.  There is elaborate planting everywhere:
huge, hairy ferns; exotic, spiked flowers; berries of every color;
rushing vines.  Peeking through the thick greenery are beautiful birds
a
nd flying squirrels.  The strange, prehistoric world impresses Grant
and Ellie.  Even Nedry and Gennaro take in the vegetal wonder.

Then, the SOUND of men working, grunting from exertion.  Ahead, Muldoon
directs A GROUP OF WORKMEN.  Flame-throwers roar and machetes fight back
the abundant foliage.  As they attack a new area, Regis waves Muldoon
over.  Muldoon has a pronounced limp as he walks over to join them.

                            ED REGIS
          This is Robert Muldoon, great African big
          game hunter.  And he's working for us now.
          Doing a bang-up job, too.

Muldoon rests his rifle by a tree stump and shakes with Grant and Ellie.

                            MULDOON
          Ed's a little more BS than PR.  Mr.
          Gennaro, nice to have you back.

Gennaro nods warmly as Muldoon limps back to work.

Regis leads on, taking Gennaro's arm and talking to him like and old
friend.  Nedry lumbers in the middle, alone.  At the rear, Grant and
Ellie study everything they see.  Grant
 calls to Regis but is ignored.

                            GRANT
          Mr. Regis, what is the nature of this park?

Ellie looks behind and sees cramped ferns spring out to capture the path
they just walked on.  She nudges Grant, who has seen the same.

                            ELLIE
          Aggressive growth, huh?

                            GRANT
          Hammond's trademark.

A distinct HOOTING in the distance.  Then a loud TRUMPETING.  Grant and
Ellie stop.  Nedry doesn't look up.  Regis flashes his salesman's smile.

                            REGIS
          Out animals are greeting you!

They pass a crude sign nailed to a tree:  Welcome to Jurassic Park.
Grant cringes at the sign.  Ellie nudges him to loosen up.

                            GRANT
          I hope this isn't one of those animatronic
          exhibits in a Jurassic botanical setting.

                            NEDRY
          Nope.

Gennaro wipes his brow.  They enter a green tunnel of over-arching palm
that leads to the 
VISITOR'S CENTER, a modern complex in the distance.

Ellie notices a large fence hidden in the brush.  She nudges Grant.

THEIR POV - CAMERA SLOWLY CLIMBS a fifteen foot high chain-link fence.
The needle-spiked top of this fence cuts deep into the brush.

This fence is only the prelude.

Sprawling massively above and behind it is a thirty foot high fence.
Woven throughout the fence's mesh is an intricate system of electrical
wire.  There is a prominent warning:  DANGER!  ELECTRIC FENCE: TEN
THOUSAND VOLTS - KEEP OFF!

CAMERA KEEPS CLIMBING to the top:  ominous barbed wire, curled into the
highest growth with coiled razors glistening in the sun.

Grant strains to understand.  The quickens his steps to catch the others.

They reach a clearing with an unfinished brick sidewalk and potted shade
trees waiting for planting.  A crosshatching of tiny lizards scamper off
the walk.  An empty swimming pool is being filled by A MAN with a pumper
truck.  Next to him, WORKERS water the large ferns.

                       
     REGIS
          I hope you brought your bathing suits!
          Doesn't this mist and these plants really
          create a bonafide prehistoric feeling?

Regis points to a low building with glass pyramids on the roof.

                            REGIS
          There's the Visitor's Center.

A CRANE lowers an iron grating on top of one pyramid.  An animal TRUMPETS.


INT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

CLOSE ON - the iron security grating as it fits over a glass skylight.
Above, MASKED WORKERS weld it on.  Sparks fly.

Grant stares up at it, thinking.  Footsteps echo behind him as Regis,
Ellie, Gennaro, and Nedry look around the unfinished building.

The Visitor's Center is two stories high, a lot of glass with exposed
girders and supports.  It's incomplete:  vines swing in the breeze where
the back wall will go and undressed cables litter the floor.  Even so,
exhibit areas are in varying stages of completion.  Behind, SEVERAL
SPANISH WORKERS unpack masonry supplies.

                            GRANT
     
     Where's Hammond?

                            REGIS
          Mr. Hammond is dying to see you guys.

Grant strides over to an exhibit as Gennaro paces impatiently.

                            GENNARO
          Hot, hot, hot.  Ten billion bucks and the
          air conditioning sucks.

Regis smiles apologetically and pushes open a large window on one of the
finished walls.  Giant leaves and vines burst inside.

Grant studies an exhibit in progress entitled When Dinosaurs Rules the
World.  This is a large clock that presents millions of years as hours
in a single day.  Many brightly colored hours are allocated to the
dinosaurs.  Man receives the last second of the day.  Ellie joins Grant.

                            ELLIE
          The audicity of man to get here at the
          last second and think he runs the show.

Grant smiles at her inexhaustible enthusiasm.  He looks at a painted
mural of a Raptor on one of the walls in the half-completed gift shop.

Nedry is at a coke machine, feeding in change
.  It doesn't work.  He
SLAMS his hand against it, and finally, a cup drops down the chute.
Upside-down.  It pours.  Coke splashes Nedry.  He curses and exits.

THE ROTUNDA - Ellie pulls Grant over to a raised, round display with a
catwalk.  In this unfinished display, a skeletal T-Rex and a Raptor are
locked in combat.  Scaffolding is up around it, and painting supplies
are scattered all around.

Regis glances at his watch, looks up, and smiles.

At that moment, doors adjacent to the rotunda swing open automatically.
A soothing female voice comes out of the public address system.

                            VOICE (ON P.A.)
          Please come to the theater.  In a moment,
          our film will begin.

The voice goes on to give this information in a number of languages.
Regis waves everyone into the theater.   Nedry doesn't join them.  He
climbs the stairs to the second floor.


INT  SCREENING ROOM - DAY

Small and plush.  Regis sits in the front, full of enthusiasm.  Grant and
Ellie sit further behind. 
 Gennaro stands in the back and smokes.

CELESTIAL MUSIC fills the room.  Mist covers and curls on the stage
floor.  Colored spotlights illuminate the mist in an eerie fashion.
overall effect is the touristy Where's NY? high-gloss production.

years young, with a glint in his eye and very comfortable with his own
effect.  He wears a white linen suit with a red rose in the breast
pocket.  Like an elder Carl Sagan, he addresses the group.

                            HAMMOND
          Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome
          to an ancient and mysterious world, a
          world long before humankind inhabited it
          with all out remarkable dreams and
          questions.  Enter a world that existed
          one hundred million years ago.  When our
          changing earth was the abode of
          magnificent creations.

          Today, the late twentieth century has
          witnessed a scientific gold rush of
          astonishing proportions:  the headlong
          and furious haste to un
ravel the mystery
          of genetic engineering has become more
          than just a subject for science fiction
          writers.

ON GRANT - he whispers to Ellie.

                            GRANT
          - the furious haste to commercialize
          genetic engineering.

BACK ON HAMMOND - he warms to his subject.

                            HAMMOND
          Biotechnology promises the greatest
          revolution in human history.  It will
          outdistance atomic power and computers in
          its effects on our everyday lives.  We'll
          see square trees for easy lumbering and
          white trout for super visibility to
          fisherman.  Why it will transform every
          aspect of human life: out medical care,
          our food, our health, even our very
          entertainment.

ON GRANT - confirmed in his thinking, he whispers again.

                            GRANT
          Here we go.

BACK ON HAMMOND - he concludes.

                            HAMMOND
          
Nothing will ever be the same again.
          It's literally going to change the face
          of our planet as we know it.


MUSIC SOARS.  Hammond smiles appreciatively, removes his rose.  A screen
descends behind him.

                            HAMMOND
          ... Jurassic Park.  What we do here is
          made possible through the miracle of DNA
          replication, commonly known as cloning.
          To explain what cloning means, I'm going
          to need my own clone - John Hammond.

Another Hammond appears, projected on the screen beside the real one.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Hi, John!

                            HAMMOND
          Hi, John.

IN THE AUDIENCE - Ellie laughs aloud.  Grant, shaking his head, smiles.

BACK ON HAMMOND - The original speaks to the clone.

                            HAMMOND
          Okay John, hold out your finger.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Why?

                            HAMMOND
          I need some of your
 genetic material.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Now just a minute here, John.

                            HAMMOND
          Your genetic material is the same in
          every cell of your body.  You have a
          hundred billion cells.  You won't miss a
          couple.

Hammond holds his rose to the screen the pricks his clone's finger with
a thorn.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          OW!!!  That hurt!  Hey, what's -

The clone dissolves into a cascade of blood as WE SEE a magnified view
of the bloodstream.  ANIMATION begins which illuminates the parts of the
blood and its actions.  Hammond provides voiceover for the visuals.

                            HAMMOND
          John, let's look into your blood, the
          river of life.  There's your white cells,
          exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily
          wastes.  And there's a mighty nucleus,
          the heart and brain of a cell.  This
          nucleus has an amazing property.  It can
          sp
lit in half and reproduce itself.
          That's how it grows.  And then those two
          can do it again.  And again.  Making copy
          after copy of itself.

Back to the two Hammond's.  Joined by a third, then a fourth, and so on
until the screen is crammed with Hammond's, elbowing each other for room.

                            NEW HAMMOND'S
          Hi, I'm John Hammond.  Hey, I'm John
          Hammond.  No, I am.  I am.

                            HAMMOND
          Come on, that's enough of this!  And I
          thought to reproduce myself I had to do it
          the old-fashioned way.

New mist fades out this show.  The lights go up.  Regis applauds.  Grant
joins in the laughter with Ellie and Gennaro.

Hammond jumps down from the stage and greets Gennaro and Regis.

                            HAMMOND
          That's all we've got so far.  A lot of
          fun, isn't it, Mr. Gennaro?

                            REGIS
          You bet!

Hammond greets Grant and Ellie warmly.  Then 
Hammond baits Grant.

                            HAMMOND
          It's been a long time, Alan.  I know the
          preceding was not your sort of enter-
          tainment.  Popular science -

                            GRANT
          No, I don't mind popular science.  I dislike
          the commercialization of science.  It breeds
          a sloppiness, a disregard for method.

                            HAMMOND
          Well, I don't disregard method.  But think
          of mutation - which is nothing more than
          sloppy communication on the cellular
          level.  Think how triumphant mutations
          have been in natural selection.

          Oh, but I know what you're saying.  It's
          true that I have never been afraid to make
          money with science.  I've always
          considered profit to be a measure of
          success, a barometer of public reaction.

                            GRANT
          Mr. Hammond, the essential truth of a
          scientific law ha
s nothing to do with
          public reaction.  Water freezes at
          thirty-two degrees, whether you pay for
          it or not.

Hammond turns to Gennaro.  Gennaro smiles nervously at their clash.

                            HAMMOND
          Donald, in bringing my old friend, Alan
          Grant, you've brought an excellent critic
          to observe the viability of my island and
          out venture.  I look forward to winning
          you over, Dr. Grant.

                            ELLIE
          Just what is it you're trying to clone?


EXT  A SPRAWLING LAWN - DAY

Outside, Hammond leads Gennaro, Grant and Ellie.  He points out the
staff living quarters, a group of graceful teepees.  Next to their
homes, WORKERS hang laundry and cook on grills.

They pass a large Mechanical Building.  The generator housed within is
very LOUD.  The wind increases, rippling clothes.

Suddenly, the SOUND of a speeding jeep.  Grant turns.

Racing across the rolling green landscape is A RED JEEP.  Muldoon is 
at
the steering wheel.  Two kids bounce happily around in the open jeep.
They are TIMMY, 9, and LEX, 6, brother and sister.  The jeep stops.

                            LEX
          Grandpa!

Hammond looks up, delighted.  Arms open.  Gennaro pulls him close.

                            GENNARO
              (incredulous)
          Mr. Hammond, this is a serious investiga-
          tion of the island, not a weekend
          excursion or a social outing.  We're
          talking about the safety of this place!

Hammond waves to the children.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm aware of that.  But I built this
          place for children.  You can't
          investigate it without their reactions.
          They're what this place is all about.

Hammond beams to Grant and Ellie and indicates the running kids.

                            HAMMOND
          My grandchildren.  Genetics were kind.
          They're more like my ex-wife than me.

Lex jumps right into her Grandpa's arms.  Timmy s
hyly walks up and
embraces him.  Hammond shines.  Gennaro holds in his fury.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY

Hammond ushers his guests into his own richly appointed baronial suite.
Ellie looks out a small window at the tee-pees and the contrasting
lifestyle below.  She then focuses on the high fence, circling the
perimeter of Hammond's quarters.  Above is a skylight, with metal bars.

Grant whispers to her, indicating the obviously modified window frame.

                            GRANT
          Who makes a windows ... smaller?

Timmy smacks him forehead, points to Grant.

                            TIMMY
          I know you.  You wrote my book.  Lost
          World of The Dinosaurs.  It's awesome.

                            LEX
          Timmy's got dinosaurs on the brain.

                            GRANT
          Don't worry - he'll grow out of it.

                            ELLIE
          Dr. Grant's embarrassed that his book was
          so widely successful.  He wrote if for
          gra
duate students.

Hammond smiles intensely.  But he's patient.  He stands be a huge table
covered with a sumptuous velvet drape.

                            HAMMOND
          Although Dr. Grant suspects otherwise,
          this is not an ill-conceived, half-baked,
          poorly funded plan that I've headed.
          This is a plan to which I committed all
          of my personal resources, literally
          billions of dollars.  And Donald Gennaro
          here has kindly helped me raise that sum
          again from wealthy Japanese.  They love
          theme parks.  I have recruited pre-
          eminent scientific minds from hallowed
          universities and we've taken the time to
          do things right.

Lex peeks under the cloth.  Hammond smiles at her and recovers the table.

                            HAMMOND
          Jurassic Park is the most advanced
          amusement park in the world.  We work
          with genetics - life's essential building
          blocks - to create new 
worlds.  I set out
          to make biological attractions.  Living
          attractions.  Attractions so astonishing
          that they'd capture the imagination of
          the entire world.

                            GRANT
          What exactly do you mean ... biological
          attractions?

                            HAMMOND
          As you well know, long ago, creatures ten
          times larger than whales roamed our
          adolescent Earth.  And then mass,
          mysterious extinction created a time
          barrier unscalable until ... now.

BEAT.

                            GRANT
          Yes?

                            HAMMOND
          Dinosaurs.
              (superbly proud)
          I've been cloning dinosaurs!

CAMERA PUSHES IN on Grant's incredulous face.

Hammond whips off the drape, revealing a complex and detailed scale
model of the entire resort.

                            HAMMOND
          Ladies and Gentlemen, Jurassic Park.  Not
          a resort, not a scien
tific conservatory,
          just a little piece of pre-history that
          every child in the whole wide world will
          insist on visiting.

Hammond grins with delight.

                            GENNARO
          At least every rich child.

Grant and Ellie come forward to examine the model.  The kids crowd in.

CAMERA SNORKELS through the model - revealing different enclosures with
miniature dinosaurs, moats, fences, roads, a river.

                            HAMMOND
          Apatosaurs in the lowland.  Gallimimus in
          the grassy plain.  Dilophosaurus above
          the river.  The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex!
          238 fabulous creatures so far!

                            TIMMY
          Real dinosaurs, Grandpa?  Don't they want
          to just kill each other?

Hammond excitedly punches a button - colored display grids light up.

                            HAMMOND
          Timmy, there's electric fences and moats
          and video surveillance at all times.
          There
 are monitors every hundred feet
          whatever we could plant them on the
          island.  A computer to tabulate it all.

                            ELLIE
          You created dinosaurs?  Who gave you the
          right to do that?

                            HAMMOND
          I didn't create them.  I found a way to
          wake them up, to stir them out of their
          prehistoric slumber.

                            GRANT
          We don't have the science.  There's no
          source of dinosaur DNA.

Hammond's proud, excited face shifts to one that divulges modestly.

                            HAMMOND
          Yes ... there is.


INT  HALLWAY, UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

Hammond leads Grant, Ellie, Gennaro, Timmy, and Lex out of an elevator
and down an endless corridor.  A WORKMAN ON CRUTCHES passes them.

They go through a series of security doors.  To get them open, Hammond
places his palm on a screen before each door.  Each time, it lights up
with an x-ray-like image of 
his hand and each door HISSES open.

CLOSEUP - Security x-ray. of Hammond's hand.  BEEP.  A red line writes
through the screen.  Can't get in.  Complaining, under his breath:

                            HAMMOND
          Glitches.

Hammond tries again.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - DAY

The door HISSES open, revealing an elaborate technology-crammed room.
In dim light, clusters of computer consoles and video monitors glow.

Nedry sits in a corner at a keyboard with a pile of papers next to him,
typing away.  JOHN ARNOLD, 45, park supervisor, sits directing the
activities of the park and chain-smoking.  There are large windows
looking out to the park, one of which is cracked and being replaced from
the outside by a TEAM OF WORKMEN.

Hammond wears a big smile as he leads in his entourage.  He's the
ringmaster.

                            HAMMOND
          And this is the right side of my brain.
          The entire park is safely controlled from
          here.  John Arnold, that genius over
          there, is the m
aster control operator.
              (with genuine concern)
          John, don't smoke so much, you're far too
          valuable a man to me.

                            ARNOLD
          Oh, you'd survive just fine without me.

Arnold exhales smoke and waves good-naturedly.  Nedry stares darkly at
Hammond, who ignores him.

                            HAMMOND
          Everything's controlled from here.
          Remote everything. Cars, feeding
          programs, medicine dispensers, fecal
          clean up - and that can be tons in a park
          like this.  We run this place with twenty
          workers.  This computer does it all.  And
          it polices each and every single animal
          out there.

                            ELLIE
              (whispers to Grant)
          Who polices the computer?

Hammond points up.  Overlooking the control room and the park is a
raised platform with a huge chair, like a throne in a court.  A large
video screen faces this chair.

                     
       HAMMOND
          That's where I will watch the astonished
          watchers.  Okay, let's go.

They practically race as a group to keep up with Hammond.  The security
door seals shit, leaving Nedry and Arnold alone again.

                            NEDRY
          Thanks for the kind word, Mr. Hammond.

                            ARNOLD
          Come on, Dennis, he knows your technical
          contributions have made it all possible.

                            NEDRY
          Right.


BACK ON HALLWAY -

Hammond and his group turn off the corridor and reach a door marked:
CAUTION: Teratogenic Substances.  Timmy backs off, grabs Lex's arm.

                            TIMMY
          That stuff turns you into a mutant!

He contorts his face into strange shapes.  As Hammond leads them all in
Lex pulls on his pocket.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't mind the signs.  They're only legal
          precautions.

Gennaro frowns.  The door opens and Lex peeks in.

                  
          HAMMOND
          My laboratory, Lex.  It will be yours and
          Timmy's someday.


INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY - CONTINUING ACTION

Grant and Ellie share a baffled look.  Grant stares.

Grant's POV - PAN ACROSS a room filled with honey-colored glowing stones
arranged on glass shelves in large pull-out trays.  Each stone is tagged
and numbered.

Grant leans down, studying the stones.  He bumps right into Gennaro.
Lex jumps excitedly.

                            LEX
          It's ... gold!

                            TIMMY
          It's amber.  Fossilized tree sap.

                            LEX
          Grandpa found gold.

Grant shushes the kids and looks to Hammond.

                            HAMMOND
          You're both right.  Amber is our gold.
          The alpha or our alchemic alphabet.  The
          precious course of our genetic material.
          You already know amber is the fossilized
          resin of prehistoric tree sap, of course.

Grant and Ellie nod impatiently. 
 Hammond sets the scene.

                            HAMMOND
          Imagine - millions of years ago, tree sap
          flowing over insects, as it does now as I
          speak, in thousands of forests and backyard
          trees everywhere.  Imagine that ancient sap
          trapping a little struggling insect and
          consuming it in a syrupy death.  Millions
          and millions of years pass and we come
          along and discover this prehistoric insect.
          If we're lucky, he's perfectly preserved in
          a fossil form inside the hardened sap which
          is now amber.  And as we examine more and
          more amber, we find many perished insects,
          including among them, biting insects -

                            GRANT
          Like mosquitos -

                            HAMMOND
          Like mosquitos, precisely, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          Mosquitos that sucked the blood of
          dinosaurs.  That's your source of DNA
        
  material?  My God!  It just might work.


INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY

A TECHNICIAN carefully positions a piece of amber under a fine-pointed
drill.  With a nod, the technician's goggles drop from his forehead onto
his eyes and he starts up the drill.  Hammond yells over the loud WHIRR.

                            HAMMOND
          The extraction room speaks for itself.

CLOSE ON - drillbit boring into the amber.  Orange fleck fly.

                            GRANT
          It does?

The technician shuts the drill.  Placing his hands into a mounted pair
of gloves, he operates an automated pair of needle-nose pliers to
carefully lift out the remains of a mosquito.  He drops this bug on a
slide and places this slide on a tray full of such slides.

                            LEX
          That's a million year old mosquito?

A conveyor belt starts, carrying this tray on to the NEXT TECHNICIAN.
The group follows.  This technician puts the first slide under a
microscope.  Grant watches on a video monito
r as the tech inserts a long
needle into the prehistoric bug.

                            ELLIE
          Put in a piece of amber, find a mosquito,
          drill it out.  Right?

                            HAMMOND
          Right.  You are witnessing the extraction
          of tissue from the thorax of this humble
          insect.  If this mosquito has ingested any
          foreign red blood cells - say it bit a
          hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a T-Rex -  we
          will extract those blood cells and obtain
          paleo-DNA, the how-to-build instruction
          book of an extinct creature.
          So you see, Ellie, I'm not creating dino-
          saurs. Fossils left behind the information,
          the map of how to bring them back.  I'm
          helping them escape from the confined of
          time.

                            GRANT
          But even thousands of mosquitos wouldn't
          give you enough tissue to determine a
          complete DNA strand.

                 
           HAMMOND
          Right you are, Dr. Grant!  More like
          hundreds of thousands of mosquitos are
          necessary to provide even a partial
          strand of DNA.  And without a complete
          strand, we don't have a dinosaur.


INT  GENETICS ROOM

A LOUD HUMMING SOUND.  Along the walls are rows of waist-high stainless
steel boxes.  In the room's center are two six-foot-high round towers.
At a single console, a man studies a monitor.

DR. WU, 35, looks up from his study and beams at his guests.  He jumps
up and knocks over his cup of coffee.  ASSISTANTS clean the area as Wu
comes forward and actually hugs Grant, much to Grant's embarrassment.

                            HAMMOND
          Ah, I knew you two would hit it off!  Dr.
          Grant, this is Dr. Wu, my chief geneticist.

                            WU
          Finally, you are here!  I've been working
          without the encouragement of my peers for
          too long.  Welcome, welcome!

He kisses Ellie, who takes 
it in stride.  Gennaro, We already knows.

                            WU
          Mr. Hammond never lets me publish and
          he's interested only in results, not in
          science.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't forget to thank me when you pick up
          your Nobel prize.

Hammond and Wu resume the tour.

                            HAMMOND
          You are standing in the middle of the
          most powerful genetics factory created
          since the expulsion from Eden.

                            WU
          These are Hamachi-Hood automated gene
          sequencers, those are Cray XMP's,
          supercomputers that take DNA information
          and organize it.  In this room, we take
          fragmented or incomplete DNA strands and
          compare them to other incomplete strands.

                            HAMMOND
          It's like finding the missing pieces of a
          jigsaw puzzle.

                            WU
          The computers make sever
al trillion
          calculations to provide us with a
          complete DNA strand - the genetic code of
          an extinct animal.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY

A vast room bathed in infrared light, filled with long tables.  The
first tables have rows and rows of centrifuges, each bearing dozens of
test tubes.  Wu leads the group.

                            GRANT
          Okay, you have your "complete" DNA
          strand.  How do you grow it?

                            WU
          We use unfertilized crocodile ova as our
          breeding medium.

                            HAMMOND
          Our primordial soup.

                            GRANT
          And how do you know what it is you're
          growing?

Wu shrugs.

                            WU
          Well, we have computer techniques to try
          and map out finds on an evolutionary
          basis.  But mostly, we just grow it and
          find out what it is.  If it's something
          we're interested in, and it 
survives, we
          keep it.

Grant and Ellie share a concerned look.

                            GENNARO
          And if you're not interested?

Wu indicates a cabinet of chemicals with skull-and-crossbone warnings.
Timmy regards the poison with excitement.

Lex calls from deeper in the room.

                            LEX
          Come look!

Here, plastic eggs lay on the long tables, their pale outlines obscured
by a grey mist that covers the tables.  The eggs are all gently rocking
as TECHNICIANS roam up and down the aisles.

Hammond walks ahead of the group.  As Wu speaks, Hammond listens and
enjoys it as though he's hearing it for the first time.

                            WU
          This is the incubation room.  We keep the
          temperature at ninetynine degrees and a
          relative humidity of one hundred percent.

                            GRANT AND TIMMY
          Jurassic atmosphere.

Timmy smiles at Grant.  Hammond winks at Timmy.

                            WU
          We
 also run a high oxygen concentration,
          up to thirty-three percent, so if you
          feel faint, please tell me right away.

Lex feigns a faint, Timmy cracks a small smile. They move forward,
waist-deep in the mist.  A strange green light emanates from the
incubators.  Lex is half-consumed by the mist. She mimics the witch.

                            LEX
          I'm ... melting!

Ellie laughs and pulls Lex close.

                            WU
          Reptile eggs contain large amounts of
          yolk but no water at all.  The embryos
          must extract water from the surrounding
          environment.

                            GRANT
          That's why you create the mist.

Wu nods.  Hammond just enjoys the scene as Grant and Ellie watch a
thermal sensor moving from one egg to the next, touching each with a
flexible wand, beeping.  Lex and Timmy let their hands glide over the
sides of the green glowing incubators fully awed by the strange, big
eggs they hold.

                   
         WU
          Children, please do not touch!  The eggs
          are permeable to skin oils.

Grant that very close to an egg.  He sniffs it.

                            GRANT
          What kind of eggs are these?  Are these
          shells plastic?

                            WU
          Yes, they are,  The embryos are
          mechanically inserted and then hatched in
          this room.  But we've managed to
          sufficiently mimic the actual biological
          process - these creatures rupture the
          plastic membrane that they're contained
          in when they're born.  Like real births.

They reach an endless row of incubators, lined up along the wall,
beneath a viewing area like those found in an OB-GYN ward.

                            WU
          Eggs that are determined viable spend
          their last couple days in our specially-
          designed incubators, which help
          accelerate the pre-natal developmental
          stages.  Which is interesting becaus
e
          we're having a problem with the adult
          animals -

Hammond claps a hand over Wu's mouth and laughs.

                            HAMMOND
          There's no problem Dr. Wu can't handle.
          Now who wants to see the real thing?

As they exit the CAMERA PANS the misty aisles, studying the eggs.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

Blue shadows of clouds sweep across an expansive green hill in front of
the Visitor's Center.

Grant and Hammond make their way down below to the loading area for the
park tour.  A little ahead is Gennaro and Ellie.  Gennaro chatters on
while Ellie energetically explores the area, looking at the plants.

                            GENNARO
          ... so naturally, Hammond's going to
          present everything in the best light.  I
          need to know that this park is safe.

                            ELLIE
          I'll tell you something that troubles me
          from the start.  The carnivores are all
          well-fed and kept separated from their

          natural prey.  That'll keep 'em alive,
          but it won't keep 'em happy.

                            GENNARO
          How do you mean?

                            ELLIE
          The carnivores will want to hunt.  It's
          an instinct.  And that instinct will have
          to be satisfied or suppressed.

FURTHER UP THE HILL, moving slowly, Hammond eyes the pair suspiciously.

                            HAMMOND
          Gennaro is putting negative ideas into
          Ellie's head.  He's a naysayer.  I have
          no affection for that type of thinking.

                            GRANT
          Don't worry.  Ellie makes her own
          judgments.

At the base of the hill Timmy and Lex toss a baseball.


EXT  TOUR START - DAY

The group gathers.  TWO ELECTRIC CARS glide to a stop behind them.
Regis leans out of the first one.

                            REGIS
          Hey!  Great day for a tour!

                            GENNARO
          Looks like rain to me.

         
                   REGIS
          No!  I told the rain-god to hold it off
          till we got back.

The kids pile in next to Regis and explore the high-tech cars.  Timmy
finds a a pair of very think, strange-looking goggles with dials on top.

Grant, Ellie, and Gennaro climb in the second car.

                            HAMMOND
          Kids, mind Mr. Regis.  He's in charge now.

The cars begin to move and pass Hammond.  He waves.

Gennaro looks back as the cars turn into the brush.  Hammond waves.

                            HAMMOND
          Gennaro, for once in your life, let
          something really move you.

In the cruiser, Gennaro rubs his neck.  He turns to Grant.

                            GENNARO
          Ever get the feeling we're just Hammond's
          damn guinea pigs?

                            GRANT
          I like to wait and see.

Ellie motions ahead, with excitement and apprehension, to a huge gate.
Regis and the kids wave behind to Grant, Ellie and Gennaro.

The gate's doo
rs swing open and the cruisers move forward.  The kids
squeal out a YA-HOO that floats through the air to Grant.  But Grant
wears a cautious face, his skeptical eyes scan the landscape.

A FANFARE of trumpets and then a pre-recorded voice speaks from a
console in each cruiser.  Video screens display a welcome message.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          Welcome to Jurassic Park.  You are now
          entering the lost world of the
          prehistoric past, a world of mighty
          creatures long gone from the face of the
          earth, which you are privileged to see
          for the first time ...

Regis uses his walkie-talkie to contact Grant's cruiser.

                            REGIS (ON WALKIE)
          That's Richard Kiley.  We spared no
          expense.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          We'll begin our tour today with the
          herbivores ...


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, FIRST TOUR STOP - DAY

Between massive tree trunks, a spectacular view:  stor
m clouds touch
mountaintops.  Below, the lagoon ripples in pink crescents.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... and the grasses are a species of
          juniper, and samples can be purchased at
          the gift shop.  Now, if everyone will
          take a look to the right ...

All eyes swing that way.  Grant doesn't see a thing.  Nor do the others.

AHEAD, Timmy pulls the binoculars out of the equipment pouch and studies
the location.  Lex grabs the night goggles.  Timmy pulls them from her.

                            REGIS
          Look ...

                            LEX AND TIMMY
          I don't see anything.  Do you see
          anything?  There's nothing there.

                            REGIS
          Something's out there ...

IN THE SECOND CAR, a fly buzzes on Grant's windshield.  Grant hangs out
his window almost sniffing the air for some movement.  Nothing.

SUDDENLY the trees in front of them move!  A deep trumpeting SOUND and
TWO BRACHIOSAURS rumble away fr
om the side of the road.  The ground
SHAKES as they walk, their BELLOWING fills the air.  Led by Grant, the
passengers rise through the open top of their Land Cruisers, to look up
at the dinosaurs far above.

DROOPING FROM ABOVE, leaves and little branches shower on Grant.  Utter
amazement fills Grant's face, then his mouth breaks into a giant smile
then a laugh.  He simply can't believe his eyes. His laugh becomes
raucous and euphoric.

                            GRANT
          Ellie!  Can you imagine the excavation
          team seeing this!

Behind him, Ellie's whole person is awestruck, immobile.  Gennaro
squints, straining to make sense of this unbelievable reality.

IN THE CAR AHEAD, Lex and Timmy stare open-mouthed.  Regis looks at the
animal and then at the group's reverie.  He smiles knowingly: he's been
there, too.  He bends and whispers:

                            REGIS
          Congratulations. You're the first kids in
          the whole wide world ever to see real
          dinosaurs.

The
 kids look up at Regis with wonder in their eyes.

GRANT CAN'T stop laughing.  Still chewing, a brachiosaur cranes down to
peer at this laughing man.  The brachiosaur's huge head stops inches
away from Grant.  Grant, awestruck, stares and them -

CLOSE ON - Grant as his eyes slowly roll back and ... he faints.

The dinosaur casually moves away as Ellie comes to Grant's aid.

                            ELLIE
          Alan?  Alan?
              (sort of delighted)
          He fainted!

Gennaro waves to Regis that all is okay.  Grant slowly revives.  He
looks back at the brachiosaur, groggily, smiling away.  He looks at
Ellie and their eyes linger on each other longer than usual, sharing a
look of serene delight.

Gennaro plops back in his seat and ponders the scene before him.  A
glazed look fills his face.

                            GENNARO
          My God, we're going to make a fortune
          here!

CAMERA PUSHES IN on the majestic, gentle beauty of the Brachiosaurs.
JUNGLE SOUNDS DOMINATE, growing l
ouder and louder.


INT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Hammond sits at his throne, happily watching the huge video screen which
displays the tour group.  He laughs raucously and calls to Arnold.

                            HAMMOND
          He fainted.  I've waited fifteen years to
          impress that young man.

                            ARNOLD
          Oh Mr. Hammond, I'm sorry to interrupt
          you, but Muldoon needs you by the pit.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh, balls.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, SECOND TOUR STOP - DAY

The cruisers come to a stop.  In the distance, A HERD OF GALLIMIMUS
graze.  They stand on their hind legs to get at high palm trees, then
drop gracefully down on all fours to chew.  BABY GALLIMIMUS scamper
around the adults, eating leaves that drop from the larger animals.

                             PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... Gallimimus, known as the ostrich
          dinosaur for the shape of its shoulders,
          have a very strong nesting instinct ...

Grant do
esn't listen.  He is simply intoxicated with the pastoral beauty
of the gentle, grazing dinosaurs.  Suddenly, he looks away with a deep
concern.  Ellie looks at him questioningly.

                            GRANT
          Ellie?  What the hell are we going to do
          with the rest of our lives?

Ellie smiles at him, puzzled.

                            ELLIE
          What to you mean?

                            GRANT
          Can't you see it, Ellie?  We're the ones
          that are extinct now.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, THIRD TOUR STOP - DAY

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... lots more to see in the herbivore
          section of our park.  But as we come
          alongside out Jurassic jungle river to the
          left, let's try and catch a glimpse of a
          very unusual and dangerous carnivore.
          Look across the river and above ...

A lovely mossy clearing.  And to the side, bounded just by a thicket of
bushes, a precipitous drop to a tropical river, lus
h and clear.  The
river runs fast but it is narrow.  On the other side is a sharp rise.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          And there they are!

Standing on that natural pedestal and watching our tour come to a stop
are TWO DILOPHOSAURUS, man-sized dinosaurs with gills that hang around
their necks.  Grant and Ellie chime in with the pre-recorded voice.

                            ALL THREE
          Dilophosaurus!

Timmy and Lex point enthusiastically.  Regis holds them down with a
gentle but restraining arm.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          Dilophosaurus is one of the earliest
          carnivores.  Scientists once thought
          their jaw muscles were too weak to kill,
          but now, through the miracle of their
          cloning, we know Dilophosaurs spit venom,
          a poison which causes blindness and then
          unconsciousness.

Their distinctive HOOT drifts across the afternoon air.

                            GENNARO
          Poisonous d
inosaurs, there's a liability
          issue without a lot of precedent.

CLOSEUP of the nearly motionless Dilophosaurus.  One yawns wide.

                            GRANT
              (assessing)
          It's like a Gila monster of a cobra.  It's
          a poison ...

                            ELLIE
          Spitter!

The Spitters bound off as Grant watches, transfixed.  A flock of birds
burst from a tree and cross the sky.  Trees filter the light.

                            ELLIE
          Are we dreaming all this?


EXT  RAPTOR PIT - DAY

A big hole in the ground, covered with a think wire mesh.  Suddenly, a
dark claw pushes against the wire web. A SHOWER OF SPARKS.  A SCREECH
animals GROWL and SNARL.  An animal slams its face into the mesh.  SPARKS
illuminate a set of RAZOR-SHARP TEETH.

Muldoon stands next to the pit, carefully loading an assault rifle.
Hammond comes in a hurry.  Muldoon sees Hammond and puts down the rifle.
He walks to Hammond, talking before he gets there.

               
             MULDOON
          These raptors are too damn dangerous. One
          of them tunneled out this morning.  He
          ripped a boy's arm off before I could get
          a bullet in him.

                            HAMMOND
          A bullet?  Muldoon - no!  Now what?  I
          have five left?

                            MULDOON
          John, they're mean as scorpions and smart
          as chimps.  Their little fingers make
          them natural cage-breakers.  We should
          terminate the raptor program.  They're
          just too smart.  Too damn smart.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh balls.  I will not terminate the raptors
          just because they're behaving normally.
          They're hunters.  Why can't we contain them
          properly?

Hammond starts to walk away.  Muldoon follows, he's not finished at all.

                            MULDOON
          John, remember back in '88, when we
          started to build the containment devices?
         
 We ordered cattle prods, tasers, guns
          that blow out electric nets.  They're all
          too slow for these guys. If we're going
          to keep the raptors, I want TOW missiles
          and laser-guided devices.

Hammond laughs warmly.  He pats Muldoon on the back.

                            HAMMOND
          It's just a zoo, Muldoon.  A zoo.  Figure
          out a way to contain them.  And we'll sit
          down and have a nice long discussion about
          raptors - after my guests leave, okay?

Hammond walks away.  Muldoon stares after him, jingling keys in his
hand.  Muldoon lumps over to A WORKER.

                            MULDOON
          Okay!  Get a 'dozer, start digging round
          the pit.  We're gonna bury some fence.
          And wear your rifle when you're working!


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Hammond enters and crosses to his throne.  Hammond swivels to Arnold who
exhales smoke.  Nedry looks over, keeps typing.

                            HAMMOND
          Wh
ere are they?  Punch 'em up.

                            ARNOLD
          They'll be by the trike's in a moment.
          Trike's sick again.

                            HAMMOND
          How can you say it so matter-of-factly?
          The trike's.  You casually accept it, but
          I never can.  You know what it means when
          you say "by the trikes"?  "By the
          trike's" means that they're out there by
          the species:  triceratops horridus.  It
          astounds me every time what I've done
          here.  What magic, what alchemy.  We
          turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur.
          I will never be complacent about that.

Arnold smiles and punches a button.  WE HEAR the pre-recorded tour voice
and some chatter of the kids.

EAVESDROPPING on the tour IS INTERRUPTED by a radio transmission to the
control room.  Arnold slides over and shuts off the tour monitoring.
The picture on the video screen is now of a cargo boat at a dock.

                            RADIO
 
         Hello, John.  This is the Anne B at the
          dock.  I'm looking at the storm patterns
          just south of us.  Requesting permission
          to leave before unloading the last three
          food containers.

Nedry looks up quickly, listening carefully.

                            RADIO
          Don't want to be stuck here if this chop
          gets much worse.

Hammond reacts with quiet dismay.  Nedry quietly gets up.

                            NEDRY
          Coffee anyone?

He's ignored.  Arnold defers to Hammond who leans to the microphone.

                            HAMMOND
          Hello skipper, John Hammond, how are you
          tonight?  I certainly don't want to
          imperil anyone.  But can you give us one
          more container of food?  Then we'll feel
          comfortable is the storm delays your
          return.  Could you help us out here?  Of
          course, if it looks too choppy just go,
          but you'd be doing us a big favor.

                 
           RADIO
          Well ... we'll do our best, sir.  We'll
          get one more container off. How's that?

Hammond thanks him and signs off.  Arnold looks at the darkening clouds.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, FOURTH TOUR STOP - LATE AFTERNOON

The cars twist through dense vegetation with a GRINDING of gears.  The
first car comes to a jerky stop.

There is a huge TRICERATOPS lying on its side, moving very slowly,
breathing laboriously.  HARDING, the tall, balding park vet, kneels on
the ground.  He peers into the animal's mouth with a large flashlight.

Before the second car can stop completely, Grant leaps out, races to the
trike.  Regis tries to restrain the kids but they chase Grant and Ellie.

Grant joins Harding on the ground.  The trike lets out a low MOAN.
She's too sick to move.  Ellie and Lex squat by the animal.

                            LEX
          I feel so sorry for her.  She's so sick.

                            VET
          We don't know what's wrong with Freda.
          Every six we
eks she gets like this.

                            REGIS
          Oh, she'll be up and around in no time.
          After a big night, I feel the same way.

Grant very gently opens the Trike's mouth.

                            GRANT
          Poor girl.  What's the matter?  Ellie,
          look at this.

A dark purple tongue droops limply from her mouth.  Ellie shines the
light on it, illuminating silvery blisters.  Gennaro turns away.

                            ELLIE
          Microvesicles.  Interesting.

Grant scratches one of the blisters with his ball-point pen.  It oozes.
The kids share a grossed-out look.

                            LEX
          Doesn't she have a mommy and a daddy?

                            HARDING
          We make these dinosaurs in the lab,
          sweetheart.  But they do form attachments.
          Freda has a little one that follows her
          around, thinks Freda's his mom.

Grant starts to look around.

                            ELLIE
          What does sh
e eat?  Where does she feed?

                            HARDING
          Animal this size takes in a minimum of
          six hundred pounds of plants a day.  We
          truck in hay and meadow grasses seven
          times a day.  That's all she touches.

Grant studies the nearby grass and bushes.  Timmy quietly follows Grant.

Ellie lifts a huge eyelid on the triceratops.  A runny eye just stares.

Grant comes up triumphantly with a bouquet of weeds clutched in his
hand.  These weeds have little purple berries.  Ellie looks over.

                            ELLIE
          West Indian Lilacs!

                            GRANT
          These'd give anybody a stomachache.

                            HARDING
          I'm telling you, the animals don't eat
          don't eat that stuff.

Regis keeps a babysitter's eye on the kids.  Timmy comes up with a
handful of smooth stones.  He approaches Grant shyly.

                            TIMMY
          Dr. Grant, sir?  How 'bout these?
          There'
s lots of little piles of these?

Grant fingers one distractedly, then suddenly comes to attention.

                            GRANT
          Hey, Ellie take a look at his.  Good
          work, Timmy.

Ellie gets up, brushes herself off, comes over and examines the stone.

                            ELLIE
          Extremely smooth.  Purple stains, could
          be those lilac berries.

She and Grant smile and each other and nod.  Gennaro is curious.

                            HARDING
          I don't get it.

                            GRANT
          Looks like your trike swallows stones to
          help her digest her food.  Walking
          around, she crushes berries against the
          stones.  And even just a little crushed
          berry is eventually enough,

                            ELLIE
          So, she poisons herself periodically.

                            HARDING
          Bet we tested her saliva for any trace of -

                            GRANT
          But with th
e stones, she swallows them
          and probably bypasses any mucosal
          contact.  Straight to the stomach.  I
          would test her excrement.

                            LEX
          Yo, yuk!

A light RAIN begins.  Automatically, with a soft hiss, the glass roofs
of the cruisers slide shit.  Gennaro taps Regis and indicates the cars.

                            GENNARO
          Hey Regis, where are your rain gods?
          It's gonna pour.  Let's finish our tour.

Grant agrees, heads for the cruisers.  He turns and looks for Ellie.
Ellie stands by the Trike.  She gives Grant a meaningful look.

                            ELLIE
          I'm staying.

Grant smiles at her decision.

                            GRANT
          Soil samples?

                            ELLIE
          You read my mind.
              (confidentially)
          I think she's sicker then they're saying.
          Her skin is dry and flaky.  And her gums
          are pale.  I'm going to talk to Dr. Wu.

        
                    GRANT
          Good idea.  I'll keep my eyes open.

Gennaro climbs in with Grant.  The two cruisers start off and Timmy
turns backward to stare wistfully at Grant.  Regis and Lex wave to the
Trike.  Grant looks back to Ellie who has already begun to work.

ON TRIKE - a mosquito lands on its back.  The trike's tail slaps it dead.


INT  MACHINE ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

With difficulty, Nedry shoves his large body down the crawl space behind
a large rack of electronic equipment.  He stops and uses a suction cup
device to lift a section of the tiled floor.  He gropes among cables and
pulls out a small wireless radio.  He transmits:

                            NEDRY (INTO RADIO)
          Jim, what the hell's with you  ... I know
          a storm's coming, I can't ... it's all so
          tightly planned ... that's not enough ...
          ok, twenty minutes, I'll be there.  Damn!

Nedry returns the radio to its hiding place.  He sucks in his gut to
make the crawl out of  the narrow space.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA - DUSK

The cruisers stop on the rise of a hill.  They over look a forested area,
sloping down to the edge of the lagoon.

                            TOUR
          The mighty T-Rex arose late in dinosaur
          history.  Dinosaurs ruled the earth for a
          hundred and twenty million years, but
          there were tyrannosaurs for only the last
          fifteen million years of that period ...

Farther south, they see the graceful necks of the brachiosaurs standing
at the water's edge.  Their bodies, mirrored in the moving surface,
break apart with the continuing drops of rain.  Hear lightning rhythmic-
ally pulses the sky.  All is quiet except for the soft drone of cicadas
and the tapping of light rain.

Regis calls Grant on the walkie-talkie.

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          You know, Dr. Grant, Hammond likes to
          come here in the evening and just sit.

                            GRANT (OVER WALKIE)
          Where is the T-
Rex?

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          Good question.

ON GRANT - as he takes that in, nodding to himself. Studies the land.

                            GRANT
          Maybe she's down hunting apatosaurs.

OVER WALKIE - Regis laughs, his voice tinny over the radio.

                            REGIS (OVER WALKIE)
          Would if she could, believe me.  Some-
          times she stands by the lagoon and stares
          at those animals, and wiggles those
          little forearms of hers in frustration.
          But the T-Rex territory is completely
          enclosed with trenches and fences.
          Believe me, she can't go anywhere.

                            GRANT
          Then where is she?

They hear A SOFT BLEATING.  In the center of the field, a small cage
rises into view, lifted on hydraulics from underground.  The cage bars
slide down.  A GOAT remains tethered in the field, BLEATING plaintively.

The tour group stares out their windows, expectantly.


BACK ON CONTRO
L ROOM -

Hammond, pleased, watches the giant screen that displays the tour group.
Muldoon limps into the control room.  Arnold looks over.

                            MULDOON
          Just checking in.  Everything ok?

                            HAMMOND
          Look at them.  Leaning out the windows,
          so eager.  They can't wait to see it.
          They have come for the danger.

                            MULDOON
          That's what I'm afraid of.

Muldoon twirls the keys on his fingers and watches the land cruisers.


BACK ON CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA -

Grant watches quietly.

The BLEATING becomes louder, more insistent.  The goat tugs frantically
at its tether, racing back and forth, kicking.

                            LEX
          What's going to happen to the goat?  Is
          the T-Rex gonna come eat the goat?

Grant senses something.  He sits straight up.  Looks out intently.

                            GRANT
          He's here.

The goat is tethered in the middle of the fi
eld, thirty yards from the
nearest tree.  Grant scans the tree for the T-Rex.

The goat senses something too.  It struggles and strains, bleating
frantically.  Suddenly the mechanical SOUND of the cage coming up.  Its
bars surround the goat with safety once again.

                            REGIS
          Looks like the Rex will have its snack a
          little later today.

                            RECORDED VOICE
          The sensors don't see the Rex around.
          She usually comes within five minutes of
          hearing dinner. If she doesn't, that
          means she's sleeping - we might have
          access to her at the picnic area.

Lex and Timmy let out a sigh of relief.  The tension is gone.

                            LEX
          I didn't want to see him get eaten.  I
          liked the goat.


BACK IN THE CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond studies the large video monitor.  He watches Grant and Gennaro.
Their voices are heard in the control room.

                            GENNARO (MONITOR
ED)
          What is a carnivore got out?

                            GRANT (MONITORED)
          There'd be no stopping it.  Huge, with no
          natural enemies, and a suppressed hunting
          instinct.

Hammond glares.  Arnold, aware, shuts off the screen.

                            HAMMOND
          Damn those people.  They are so negative.

                            ARNOLD
          It's natural.  They can't fully
          appreciate that we've engineered the
          animals and the park for total safety.

                            HAMMOND
          They comb this island like a bunch of
          accountants.  They don't experience the
          wonder, the awe of it all.

                            ARNOLD
          You can't make people experience wonder.

Hammond gets up and stands before the big windows overlooking the park.
The quartz FLOODLIGHTS outside their area COME ON with a rosy glow and
the dark jungle is opened again to their inspection.

At his console, Nedry looks at Hamm
ond.  Hammond stares out the window.
The RAIN PICKS UP and bounces off the window.  Hammond speaks to Arnold
without turning.

                            HAMMOND
          It's like the Garden of Eden out there.
          This is the most beautiful time of day.

                            ARNOLD
          Better rout the tour back.  They can
          start again sun-up tomorrow morning.

                            HAMMOND
          Yup.  Call the kitchen.  Those kids'll be
          hungry when they get in.

Arnold picks up the phone.  STATIC.  He glances over at Nedry.

                            NEDRY
          Sorry 'bout that.  I've taken all the
          lines to upload some data.

Hammond's annoyed, but contains it.  Arnold looks at Nedry, who smiles.

                            NEDRY
          I'll clear a couple of lines for you at
          the end of the next transmission, sir.
          Here you go now, this will make it all
          better, Mr. Hammond.

Nedry punches in a code.

CLOSE ON 
- Nedry's fat finger punching a last key.

CLOSE ON - amber video display terminal as a countdown begins.

As the screen counts down from ten to zero, Nedry peers at Hammond with
a steely glint in his eyes.

BACK ON SCREEN - three, two, one, the countdown hits zero.

Nedry's data-filled screen blinks off.  Nedry looks up to the rack of
monitors.  Unnoticed by Hammond or Arnold two more monitors go blank.
Then a third one.


BACK  ON CRUISERS, REST AREA - NIGHT

The electric cars turn up into a scenic area high above the rest of the
park.  HUGE QUARTZ LIGHTS REVEAL a dramatic view down to the ocean.
There the supply ship, the ANNE B, unloads its last crates.

RAIN INCREASES.  On the other side of the road are picnic tables, an
unfinished snack bar and rest rooms.  To the side of this rest area is a
view of the interior of the island.  A guard-rail separates visitors

To the other side of the rest area is a concrete moat and in the back of
this is a tall, electrified fence.  Surrounding the electric fence is a

smaller protective fence.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... enjoy a healthy snack.  This is also
          a good time to ...

                            LEX
          Hey, is that bathroom working?

                            REGIS
          Sure.
              (he uses his walkie)
          Rest stop.

The kids take off towards the bathroom, running through the rain.  Grant
gets out of his cruiser, strides to Regis.  He indicates the fence.

                            GRANT
          Is that still the T-Rex paddock?

                            REGIS
          Yes.  But she never comes here.  I don't
          know why not.  Probably too much
          construction.

GENNARO, jacket over his head against the rain, looks down to the ocean.

GENNARO'S POV - THE ANNE B UNLOADS he last cargo crate.

GRANT LOOKS at the concrete moat.  Studies its deep curve.  He looks up
at the tell electrical fence with its 10,000 volt warning.  He sees
conventional power lines on the opposite sid
e of the road.

CAMERA EXAMINES the empty cruisers.  Inside, the pre-recorded voice is
chatting on.  It slows eerily and stops.  Video SCREENS BLINK OUT.


BACK ON CONTROL ROOM -

Nedry yawns loudly.

                            NEDRY
          Yup!  Looks like a never-ending weekend
          for me.  I'm gonna get a Diet Coke.
          Don't touch my console, ok?  Line will
          be clear in five minutes.

Nedry leaves.  Hammond swings around and growls under his breath.

                            HAMMOND
          Slob!

                            ARNOLD
          Well, at least he knows what he's doing.


INT  UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - NIGHT

Nedry races through the series of security doors.  He ignores the
security x-ray device and just SHOVES each door open with his hand.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

THE QUARTZ LIGHTS GO OUT, leaving the group in shadowy darkness and now
STEADY RAIN.  There's a ripple of surprise from the group.  Regis rounds
them all up and directs them back into the 
cruisers.

                            REGIS
          Everything's just fine.  It's a temporary
          glitch due to the rain.  No doubt,
          they're going to re-rout some circuits
          back at the mainframe.  We'll have the
          power back on in moments.  Let's get back
          in the cruisers, they may start up, and
          I'd like us all to be seated in them.

The cruisers are STILL.  IN THE REAR CRUISER, Gennaro turns to Grant.

                            GENNARO
          I knew we shouldn't have kids here.

A vivid FLASH of LIGHTNING.  IN THE FIRST CAR:  Lex covers her eyes.
Then she looks up at Regis with a frightful face.

                            LEX
          Mr. Regis, are dinosaurs ... nocturnal?

                            REGIS
          No, darling, of course not.

                            LEX
          Mr. Regis?  What's ... nocturnal?

Another LIGHTNING FLASH.  Lex cries.  Regis comforts her.

                            REGIS
          Don't you worry about d
inosaurs.  They're
          all very safe in their paddocks just like
          animals in a big, strong zoo.  They're not
          going anywhere we don't tell them to go.

Timmy looks out the window excitedly.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

All those eggs on tables.  No moving sensors.  Nedry pulls a portable
incubator away from the dozens lined up against the wall.  Its
electrical cord goes flying.  Furiously, Nedry fills the incubator with
eggs, one after the other.

                            NEDRY
          Okay, little ones!  Here we go!

Nedry grabs the handles of the incubator and runs with it.  The
incubator careens on one wheel as he turns the corner and exits.


BACK ON CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond looks out the large window as the LIGHTS EXTINGUISH.  He twirls.

                            HAMMOND
          What's going on, Arnold?  I want those
          lights on.  I don't want my grandchildren
          scared.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus, the computer's gone
 down.

                            HAMMOND
          Well, I want the computer up.  This is
          the wrong weekend for glitches.

Arnold still examines his console.  He looks out with worry.

                            ARNOLD
          That's not the worst of it.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh yeah?  Please tell me what's worse
          than the lights going out?

Wu smashes through the door.

                            WU
          All the security doors are open.  Someone
          has been in my laboratory and the eggs
          have been disturbed.

The camera pushes in on Hammond's face.

                            HAMMOND
          Where the hell is Nedry?  Where is he?
          Did anybody check the damn john?

Hammond storms out.


INT  CORRIDOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION

Hammond enters the hall.  Muldoon, racing from the other direction, yells:

                            MULDOON
          John, the generator's shut down.  Who cut
          the power?

     
                       HAMMOND
          Arnold's on it.  You go out and bring
          back the tour right away.  I don't need
          any of this!

Muldoon is already running back the way he came.


INT  GARAGE - NIGHT

Several electric land cruisers are stored in this shadowy room.  There
is a glassed-in area where Muldoon's weapons are stored:  assault
rifles, tasers, tear gas canisters.

To the side of the garage s Muldoon's red jeep.  In the passenger side
of the front seat is a rocket launcher.

Nedry storms in, wheeling his incubator.  He stop suddenly and listens.
Approaching FOOTSTEPS.

                            NEDRY
          Oh, shit!


INT  BASEMENT STAIRS, VISITOR'S CENTER -

Muldoon runs down a long corridor, stop with a skid and yanks open the
door to the garage.  He runs out.  His boots RESOUND on the concrete.

BACK ON - NEDRY'S PANICKED FACE as he listens to the footsteps.
Wheezing, with great difficulty, Nedry bends his knees and strains.  With
everything he's got, he lifts the incub
ator waist-height.  And holds it.

BACK ON MULDOON - Muldoon's footsteps ECHO as they come closer and closer
to the garage.  Muldoon whips down the curve in the stairs.  His jacket
catches on an incomplete section of banister. Yanks him to a stop.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon's jacket as it RIPS, stays caught.

BACK ON - NEDRY as he tries to heave higher, can't.  Beads a sweat roll
down his brow.

MULDOON FREES HIS caught jacket and then keep going.

Nedry's face drips with sweat.  The incubator slips out of his sweaty
palms.  Catches it with his knee.  Nedry curses and with one forceful
boost, he lifts the incubator shoulder height.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon's feet on long stairwell. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.

NERVOUS, NEDRY BREATHES in a labored fashion.  He looks this way and
that.  He closes his eyes and with one superhuman effort, he heaves the
incubator into the back seat of the red jeep.  Nedry exhales.

At that moment, MULDOON ENTERS the vestibule between stairs and garage.

NEDRY EYES the shadowy figure in the vestibule.  
Nedry's frightened face.

MULDOON STOPS and reaches in his belt.  He pulls out his pistol.  He
takes out long, shiny cartridges.  He loads the pistol.

NEDRY LEAPS in the front of the jeep, pushing aside the rocket launcher,
and zooms into the night.

A moment later, Muldoon enters the garage.  He sniffs at the exhaust
that still hangs in the air.  He looks over and is surprised to see his
jeep gone.  He bends and inspects fresh tread marks. He looks up, his
face straining to understand.


EXT  PARK ROAD - NIGHT

Nedry's red jeep flies down the park road.

CLOSE ON - Nedry's wheel as he turns it.

His tires skid sideways, then regain traction.  The jeep bolts up a
smaller access road.  He skids to a stop at the top of the hill.

Nedry jumps out and looks up.  His high beams illuminate a huge electric
fence prominently labeled:  DANGER!  10,000 Volts!

Two safety fences separate Nedry from the electric fence.  He races to
the first one, pulls out a key chain.  He tries one key, then another,
and another.  It f
its.  Nedry unlocks the gate, swings open the door.

Nedry runs to the second gate.  He slips in the mud.  He slides to the
ground, dropping keys in a muddy pool.

CLOSE ON - Nedry's hand frantically fishing for the key chain in the
muddy water.  Got them!   Unlocks the second gate.

He races to the electric fence.  RAIN PELTS him now.  Water beads on his
face.  Lightning flashes on the 10,000 volts warning.

He grabs the gate with his bare hand and swings it open.

Nedry heads back to his jeep, his fat body strobed by its high beams.
He jumps in the jeep and drives through.  Behind him, the open gates
move recklessly in the stormy night.


BACK ON GARAGE

Ellie and Harding pull in, in their own gas-powered jeep.  Muldoon is
waiting for them.  Now there's a rifle slung over his shoulder.  Harding
jumps out of the jeep.

                            MULDOON
          Get out, get out!  I need this jeep.
          There's a problem with the tour.  Ellie,
          Hammond'll fill you in.

Ellie is concerned, the
n decisive.

                            ELLIE
          No!  I'm going with you, Muldoon.

They race out.


EXT  DOCK - NIGHT

Headlights blazing in the darkness, Nedry's jeep skids to a stop by the
dock where the ANNE B is preparing to leave.  The water is very choppy.

Nedry jumps out and pulls his incubator to the ground.  He begins to
drag it through the mud, toward the ship.  CAPTAIN FARRELL comes to meet
him, along with A COUPLE MEN, who hoist the incubator easily and carry
it toward the ship.

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Good.  Glad to see you.  Were you seen?

                            NEDRY
          Nah.  I'm back in five minutes, they'll
          never know I was gone.
              (yells after the men with the incubator)
          Careful with that thing!  It's worth more
          than the ship.
              (to the Captain)
          When's the copter meeting you?

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          It's not.  The storm's coast-to-coast,
       
   nobody could land on the water.

                            NEDRY
              (totally panicked)
          Shit!  What's the backup?  I don't like
          this.  Maybe we should do it another time,
          I don't like it.  I just don't like -

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Shhh!  I wired Baker, he'll have a man at
          the dock in Puntaremas.  We should be
          able to make that in time.

                            NEDRY
              (somewhat relieved)
          Ten hours?

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Yeah, now relax.  I got a lot riding on
          this too, you know.  No one's going to
          mess up now.  Baker's not going to mess
          up.  His people won't let him.

                            NEDRY
          Ok.  Ok.  Here.

Nedry pulls an aerosol can out of the baggy crotch of his pants.

                            NEDRY
          Look, this is insulating spray.

CLOSE ON - Nedry sprays a big mound of white foam into his
 hand,

                            NEDRY
          In about eight hours, spray down all the
          eggs with this stuff.  It'll keep 'em
          warm but not too warm.  I hope Baker has
          it together with the dock.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

Rain drums down on the cruiser.  Timmy stares out at the dark.  Lex
stares nervously out the side window.  Timmy picks up the night goggles
and snaps them on.

                            TIMMY
          Hey, these thing work great.  I can see
          in the dark and I can see far.

He swivels away from the T-Rex paddock and looks out toward the ocean.
He reaches up and adjusts the knob.

                            TIMMY
          Hey!  I wonder if that boat's still
          there?  It is. I think they're getting
          ready to go.

TIM'S POV - the fluorescent green image of men untying casting lines on
the boat.

Another LIGHTNING FLASH and Lex SCREAMS and covers her face.  She cries.

                            REGIS
          Timmy, can you
 give her the goggles?

Lex clamps her hands over her eyes.  Timmy gently nudges her.

                            TIMMY
          Want to look at the boat, Lex?

Timmy hands her the night goggles. Lex dries her eyes and takes a peek
with the goggles toward the ocean.

                            LEX
          Hey, that fat guy's down there. Is he
          gonna come get us and take us to Grandpa?

LEX'S POV - the picture streaks but clearly reveals Nedry shouting at
the Captain.  Men heave the incubator onto the ship.

                            LEX
          They have one of those things from the
          room with all the eggs - you know, where
          they help the baby eggs grow up.

                            TIMMY
          You mean an incubator?

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          What's the commotion?

                            REGIS
          Let me see.  Give them to men, sweetheart.

                            TIMMY (TO WALKIE)
          Uh, Dr. Grant?

REGIS GRABS th
e walkie talkie and tries to silence Timmy.  He knows he
gets there too late and reluctantly lets Timmy have it back.

                            TIMMY
          We saw that computer guy helping 'em load
          an incubator onto the ship.

                            LEX (TO WALKIE)
          Yeah, he's stealing them, Dr. Grant!
          He's stealing my Grandpa's eggs!

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          Nedry?  With an incubator?  Regis??

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
              (finally acknowledges)
          That's what they saw.

ON GRANT - He looks sharply at Gennaro.

                            GRANT (TO WALKIE)
          We gotta tell Hammond and Arnold right
          away.  How far is it to the mainland?

ON TIMMY - He looks at Regis.

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          Uh, it's a hundred miles to Puntaremas.
          About a sixteen hour voyage in this
          weather.

ON GRANT - He fiddles with the radio in his cruiser.  No r
esponse still.

                            GRANT
          I wouldn't like to see dinosaurs running
          around Costa Rica.

                            GENNARO
          When's the damn power coming on?


INT/EXT MULDOON'S JEEP, OTHER BACK ROADS

Muldoon and Ellie drive into the storm.  Suddenly, he slams on his
brakes.  In front of him, a tree has fallen, completely blocking the
road.  Muldoon curses, swerves around, and skids to a stop.

As Muldoon gets out and assesses the situation, Ellie lodges herself
between the tree and the jeep.  She pushes the tree with her strong legs
and moves it a good five feet. Quickly, Muldoon and Ellie drag the tree.
As they struggle.

                            MULDOON
          Strong legs.

                            ELLIE
          Lot of track in college.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

IN THE FIRST CAR, Regis drums his fingers on the dashboard.  Timmy wears
his goggles and stares into the rain.  Lex shifts her body around,
trying to get comfortable to rest.

 
                           LEX
          I'm hungry.  When can we get going?

                            REGIS
          When the electricity comes back on,
          honey.  These cars run on electric cables
          buried in the road.

IN THE SECOND CAR, Grant tries the radio to no avail.  Gennaro smokes.
Grant looks forward toward the first cruiser.  He can barely make out
the car in the dark and rain.  Occasionally, LIGHTNING reveals all.

TIMMY PULLS GUM out of his pocket.  Feels a tiny shake, looks around.
He puts it in his mouth, chewing quietly.  SUDDENLY, the whole car
VIBRATES.  Regis' sunglasses jump off the dashboard and fall to the
floor.  The kids look at him.

                            REGIS
          Must be turning on the electricity.

Lex sits up, looks around groggily.

                            LEX
          Feels like a vibration.


INT  T-REX PADDOCK - NIGHT

The T-Rex's huge hind feet crash down, one large foot following after
the other in long, powerful strides.


BACK ON CRUISE
RS, REST AREA - FIRST CRUISER

There is a thud, and then a THUD, and then a THUD.   Tim and Lex share a
frightened look.  Now the thud grows LOUDER.  There is a CRASHING SOUND,
the whole cruiser SHAKES.  Then silence.  Then another SHAKE.

CAMERA PUSHES IN TILL CLOSE - Timmy stares out with his night goggles.

TIM'S NIGHTSCOPE POV IN CLOSE - T-Rex paws rest on the electric fence.

Tim takes off his goggles, stares, transfixed.  Regis picks them up.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - of muscular forepaws with pebbled, grainy skin and
thick, curved nails comfortably gripping a thick wire strand.

The T-Rex moves his body forward of the brush, pushes against the fence.


IN THE SECOND CRUISER -

Grant and Gennaro stare out, unseeing in the rain and darkness.


CLOSE ON LEX -

Tears roll down her cheek.  She cries silently with an unknown fear.
Regis pulls the goggles from his eyes, starts to gag, checks it.

                            REGIS
          Jesus Christ.

                            LEX
          Bad language.

     
                       REGIS
          Jesus Christ.  The fence isn't
          electrified.

                            LEX
          Is that bad?

Regis turns, looks out the side window, away from the T-Rex.

Regis is shaking uncontrollably.  Suddenly he throws open his door and
bolts off into the rain, leaving the door open.  No move from the Rex.

Regis races by the second cruiser.  Grant stares out at him.

                            TIM
          Mr. Regis!  Mr. Regis, where are you
          going?

                            LEX
          He just left us.  He just left us all
          alone.  Timmy, Timmy how could he do
          that?  We're all alone!  We're all alone!

FLASH OF LIGHTNING.  FLASH.  The Rex butts his head.

TIM'S POV - The fence bangs down on top of his cruiser.

Timmy and Lex recoil from the scrape  of the wire mesh against the car.


IN THE SECOND CRUISER -

GRANT AND GENNARO'S POV - through the almost obscuring rain they see the
fallen fence.  An unseen weight pulls on it fur
ther, causing its
electric wire to pop like over-tuned guitar strings.


TIMMY REACHES -

out into the rain for the open door handle.

Another LIGHTNING FLASH and the creature is revealed standing between
the two cruisers, atop the crushed fence.  His head turns back and
forth, he's deciding on his prey.  Grant and Gennaro or Tim and Lex?

Timmy slams the door shut.  He looks directly at the Rex, just a few
feet away.  The Rex turns to him, stares back.

Lex SCREAMS and Timmy claps a hand over her mouth.

There is a whisper over Tim's walkie-talkie.

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          Timmy, be quiet. Don't move.


BACK ON GRANT -

He snaps off the walkie-talkie.

HIS POV - The rain runs in rivulets down the pebbled skin of the
muscular hind legs.  The animal's head is out-of-view, above the
rooftops of the cars.  The Rex lifts its huge hind leg.

                            GENNARO
          Holy shit!  Any suggestions what we do
          now?

                            GRANT
        
  Can't think of a thing.

The T-Rex slowly circles Grant's cruiser.


BACK ON TIM -

He watches the beast move.


BACK ON GRANT AND GENNARO -

As they twist and turn, trying to find a circling Rex in dark and rain.
The Rex pauses right next to Gennaro's window.  He lowers his head,
looking for movement inside.

CLOSE ON - the beady, expressionless reptilian eye moving in the socket.

Grant whispers, hardly moving his lips.

                            GRANT
          Don't move.

Gennaro's leg trembles uncontrollably.


IN THE FIRST CRUISER -

Very frightened, Lex discovers a flashlight.  She flicks it on and off,
distracting herself.  The beam shows her eyes full of a quiet panic.

                            LEX
          It's too, too dark out there.

Tim waves his hands in caution.


BACK ON GRANT, GENNARO, AND THE REX -

The Rex bends down, bumps the windshield with his nose.  Just stays
there, breathing heavily.  In the distance, the flashlight goes on
again.  The Rex raises his head suddenly.  Grant g
rabs his walkie.

                            GRANT (TO THE WALKIE)
          Shut that flashlight, Tim!

As the Rex heads off, a casual swipe of his tail SMASHES the side of the
cruiser, throwing Grant and Gennaro across the inside of the car.


ON TIM -

He lunges for the flashlight.  Lex dodges him, keeps it lit.

                            LEX
          No, it's mine.  Please, I need it.

Tim looks up through the sun roof.  The massive head of the
Tyrannosaurus Rex appears.  Tim watches, transfixed.  Lex looks up.
Irrational with terror, she aims her flashlight like a gun.  Blasts him.
Her flashlight beam cuts through the dark and rain - she sees the beast
plainly for the first time and SCREAMS!

The POOL OF LIGHT bathes the Rex's face.  He smashes his head down onto
the Plexiglass bubble.  It crunches, and falls into the car, crushing
the children.  Tim uses his feet to push it to the side.

Above, the Rex displays is gaping maw, drooling toward the opening.


GRANT -

watches the Rex raise his mighty h
ead again, above the kids' cruiser.


TIMMY AND LEX -

have a half-instant of relief.  Then SLAM.  The Rex butts his head
against the cruiser.  The Rex comes back down, tries to discover his
prey inside the cruiser.  Pushes his head close to the glass, looking.

The dinosaur stands in front of the cruiser, his whole chest heaving,
his forelimbs pawing the air.

Timmy whispers to Lex.

                            TIMMY
          Are you ok?  Be quiet and don't move.

Lex barely nods and grabs Timmy's hand.

The Tyrannosaur places his head next to the car.  He begins to shove the
cruiser with his head.  The cruiser ROCKS.  The back window bursts,
shards go flying.

Inside, the kids are THROWN back and forth, SHOVED against each other,
and finally FLUNG against the top of the car as the cruiser FLIPS.

The whole world TILTS CRAZILY - trunks of palm trees slide by, the
ground above, the blazing eye of the rex, the tops of palm trees.

The cruiser SLAMS DOWN on its side, the windows splat in the mud.  Lex
falls he
lplessly against the side window and lies motionless.  Timmy
falls beside her, banging his head.  He reaches for Lex.

                            TIMMY
              (softly)
          Lex?  Lex?

SILENCE.  No movement from Lex.

THE ANIMAL toys with the cruiser.  Like a dog with its bone, the
dinosaur pushes the cruiser along with his head.  He pushes it past the
picnic tables toward the ripped fence and the embankment.  Each shove
sends the children flying again.

The cruiser is pushes closer and closer to the unprotected embankment.
The cruiser slams to a stop completely upside-down.  The T-Rex steps
right on the cruiser, crushing the roof against the ground.

INSIDE - the children crawl for their lives as the car crushes further
down from above and a tidal wave of mud oozes in from the sides.

THE REX - gnaws at the car, grabs a tire with his teeth,  It ruptures
with a pitiful pop.  The Rex grabs at the axle with his teeth, begins to
drag the car back.  THe kids, half-outside, are pulled with the car.



GRANT DANCES -

with a flare!  The Rex is distracted.

CLOSE ON - the Rex as he ROARS.  The flare gleams in his eyes.

The Rex starts toward Grant.  He tosses the flare over the half-standing
part of the fence.  The Rex lunges after the flare.

GENNARO has reached his limit.  Terrorized, he leaps out and SCREAMS:

                            GENNARO
          Extinct animals should stay extinct!

He bolts.  The Rex sees him and starts after him, THUNDERING by Grant,
who stays frozen in place.

Gennaro sprints for his life.  He's not even a distant match for the T-
Rex jogging behind him.

Gennaro dives into the LADIES ROOM.

INSIDE - he slams the door and shoves the trashcan against the door.
POUNDING FOOTSTEPS APPROACH!  Gennaro backs up into one of the stalls.
LOUDER POUNDING, THE WALLS BEGIN TO VIBRATE!  Gennaro assumes a 'tuck'
position.

ON THE INTERIOR DOOR - The Rex smashes right through the steel-clad
door.  Pieces go flying.

Gennaro hides amidst the wreckage as the Rex sniffs around.


GRANT RUNS BA
CK -

to check on the kids.  He reaches a hand underneath the flipped car,
sitting in the mud.  Lex's soft voice can be heard.

                            LEX (OFF)
          Dr. Grant!

Grant fishes under, finds Lex's hand, drags her out.  He quickly checks
her for broken bones.

                            GRANT
          Lex, are you okay?

                            LEX
          Timmy's unconscious, he won't move.

Lex SCREAMS.  Grant turns to see the Rex return.  He squeezes Lex tight.
The animal goes right past them, back to his toy - Tim's land cruiser!

The Rex BELLOWS a huge cry.  Timmy awakens and sees the Rex above him.
He SCREAMS.

Lex, squeezed in Grant's arms, sees her imperiled brother.

                            LEX
          Timmy!

The Tyrannosaur looks up, GROWLS across the upside-down cruiser, opens
its huge jaws menacingly, all the time staring at Grant and Lex.

INSIDE THE CAR - Timmy tries to unwedge himself.  A thin trickle of
blood runs down his forehead.  He's jammed between the
 crushed roof and
the bent bench seat.  He can't free himself.

The Rex begins to SHOVE the cruiser toward Grant and Lex.  They back up
but they have very few feet left - they're almost at the embankment.
But if they don't move, they'll by crushed by the oncoming car.

Grant slings Lex onto his back.  She grabs her hands around his neck and
digs her feet into his sides.  Grant begins to climb over the downed
fence and into the embankment - it's a huge drop!

Grant grabs a broken cable and lowers himself and Lex over the side of
the embankment.

Just in time as the Rex SHOVES the cruiser further.  Now, the cruiser
TEETERS right on the edge, turning again on its side.  Tim hangs halfway
out of the car, unable to get out further.

Grant, with Lex on his back, slides down the cable, rappelling down the
embankment.  ABOVE, the car looms over them, rocking on the edge.  Lex
looks up and grabs Grant so tightly, she chokes him, unknowingly.

Grant, eyes bulging, sees the danger from above.  He pushes off the wall
and
 swings them toward the next hanging cable.  He reaches out and -

- GRABS THE NEXT CABLE just as -

- the T-Rex BELLOWS and lowers her head, and gives a final shove.  Timmy
and the cruiser SAIL INTO SPACE.  Timmy SCREAMS!

Grant and Lex swing out of the way as the cruiser sails past them.  Lex
SCREAMS, squeezing Grant's neck even tighter!   They watch helplessly as
the cruiser BOUNCES off the wall and CRASH-LANDS into the top of a tree
at the base of the wall.

Grant and Lex stare down at the wreck in the tree.  Timmy can't be seen.
Grant, choking from Lex's grip, grabs her fingers.

                            GRANT
          Let ... go ... please.

The Rex ROARS above.  They look up.

THE REX paws the air, GRUNTS in frustration and STALKS off, LIGHTNING
FLASHES.


EXT  NEDRY'S JEEP, BACK ROADS -

Nedry speeds along the rain-slick road, fish-tailing as he goes.

CLOSE ON - Nedry at the wheel.

NEDRY'S POV - the dark, wet road running alongside a ten-foot chain-link
fence.  Suddenly, a beast-like visage blur
s across the road.

Nedry swerves.  The jeep skids.  Nedry tries to over-steer, can't bring
the careening jeep under control.

The jeep crashes though the fence, bounces down a cement culvert, and
dives into a raging gully.

Nedry curses.  He spins the wheel.  The tires spin and spray.  The
jeep's hopelessly stuck in the gully.  From Nedry's seat in the jeep, he
cranes his head around, examining his situation.

NEDRY'S POV - On the opposite side of the gully, there is an equipment
graveyard.  By the titled jeep headlights, steely monsters all around
can be seen - discarded earth movers, graders, and tractors.

Nedry gets out of the jeep, grabs the winch from the jeep's back end.
and wades over to an abandoned tractor.

                            NEDRY
          Shit. I'm going to have to change clothes.

He loops the winch around the tractor's base.  Suddenly, he stops and
looks around as he hears a gentle HOOTING.  He squints, looking at the
strange steel graveyard lit by the bright beams of the jeep headli
ghts.

HOOT!  HOOT!  A distinctive HOOTING.  Nedry looks up in fear.  SILENCE.

Nedry starts moving toward his jeep.  Again, the HOOT!  Nedry stops,
looks right, looks left.  A RUSTLE in the trees.  Nedry's head cocks.

Looking through trees, lit by the strong beams, Nedry sees a SPITTER in
the eerie mist.  Now it's gone.  Now it's back.  It circles Nedry
warily, hunting him.  Nedry stares.

                            NEDRY
          I hope this is one of them herbivores.

Nedry scrambles the other way, full-tilt.  Hop, hop, and the Spitter
drops in front of Nedry from the other side.  HOOT!

Nedry jumps back, lands on his butt.  The Spitter zips in from the side
- HOOT!

Nedry doubles back, racing through the abandoned equipment, ducking and
rolling under a cement mixer, spinning past a tree.  He splashes down
the embankment, trying to get to his jeep.  He uses the winch line to
steady himself again the raging current.  He finally reaches the jeep,
swings open the door - and, surging out of the water like a
 demonic
apparition, is the SPITTER!  Nedry backs away, directly into the glare
of the headlights!

CLOSE ON - the Spitter.  It's plume opens, bright orange gills swell out
like an umbrella around its neck.  Something squirts beneath its jaws.

A big glob SMACKS Nedry on the arm.  He brushes it off.

                            NEDRY
          Gross.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - the Spitter's head.  The jaws puff, the hood flares
out, the neck snaps forward.  And - it spits.

This glob misses Nedry, splashes off the steaming headlight.

VERY EXTREME CLOSEUP - The Spitter's swollen poison sacs are inflated.
They fire!

This glob hits Nedry in the eyes.  He SCREAMS.

                            NEDRY
          I'm blind, I'm blind.

He falls against the jeep, rubbing his eyes.  The Spitter calmly hops to
the embankment and watches the blinded Nedry weave drunkenly in the
water.  Nedry grabs onto the jeep and pulls himself along toward the
driver's door.  The Spitter stalks, watching him.

Nedry pulls open the jeep door, 
thrusts his head in, slams it against
the door frame.  Now Nedry heaves his whole body into the jeep.  The
Spitter's long ostrich-like legs stretch and bend in an easy gait as it
closes it on Nedry.

Nedry sits behind the wheel, unseeing as the Spitter watches patiently
turns his blind eyes that way.

A long beat.  The Spitter leaps forward, the CAMERA PULLS BACK WIDER AND
WIDER.  Nedry lets out an ear-splitting SCREAM and the car horn BLARES.


INT  TIMMY'S CRUISER

Timmy lies against a spidered side window, his head pressed against the
door handle.  He pushes himself up on one elbow, opens his eyes, and
tries to focus.  Rain has nearly stopped but a light drizzle hits him

Timmy tries to straighten up, but he's too dizzy.  He stops and hears A
CREAKING and feels the whole car gently swaying back and forth.  With a
further effort, he raises his body so that he's standing with his feet
on the window frame and looks out the broken roof.

TIM'S POV - Dense foliage, moving in the wind, hard to see through.  An
o
pen space and - THE GROUND, FORTY FEET AWAY!


INT/EXT  CRUISER - CONTINUING ACTION

Tim's cruiser is lying on its side, stuck in the higher branches of a
tree on the hillside.

                            TIMMY
          Oh shit!

Timmy pulls his body up carefully, trying to get a better view.  He
grabs the steering wheel for support and it spins free in his hand.

CRACK!  The cruiser slips a few inches down the tree.  Timmy grabs the
window frame and freezes.  The car sways in the wind.

CRACK!  The car slips a quick and rocky two feet.

                            TIMMY
          Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

Timmy hears something.  He raises his head very carefully.  Climbing up
the tree, pulling himself on a nearby branch, is Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          Timmy.  Are you ok?

                            TIMMY
          Thank God you're here.  Where's Lex?

                            GRANT
          Below.  She's fine.  Let's get you down.

Timmy nods.

Grant peers throug
h the broken roof of the cruiser, analyzing Timmy's
predicament.  He cranes his head back to examine how the cruiser is
supported in the tree.  Grant turns back to Timmy.

                            GRANT
          Try the door you're leaning against.
          Nice and slow.

Timmy places his weight on the two sides of the door frame and reaches
between his legs, trying to open the door handle.  Stuck.  CRACK!  The
cruiser drops another foot.

Grant scrambles down a couple branches until he is even with the cruiser
again.  He motions for Timmy to hold still.

Grant reaches across to the other car door and tries the outer door
handle.  This one opens and very slowly, he pushes open the door.  Grant
gingerly holds it half-open in mid-air.

                            GRANT
          Crawl this way.  Slowly.

Carefully testing his weight with each step, Timmy lowers his body down.
He pushes his legs out the door.  They kick in the air and slowly come
to rest on a lower branch.  He lets himself down.  Now he si
ts on a
branch, a few feet below the cruiser.

CRACK!  The cruiser drops.  Grant still hangs onto the door but now his
footing on the branch is gone.  His legs hang in space.  The cruiser
hangs precariously above Timmy.  They're all twenty feet in the air.

                            GRANT
          We're going to have to make a jump for
          it, Timmy.  Okay?

Timmy agrees.

                            GRANT
          One, two, three, jump.

Timmy lets go and DROPS.  Grant follows.  So does the cruiser.  It's
hurtling right at them.

Timmy BANGS against the wet tree-trunk and slides down.  Branches WHIP
against his face, his hands SCRAPE against the trunk.  Grant BOUNCES
them.  They scramble down as quick as they can.

Timmy pulls his hands along the sap-sticky surface of the tree.  CRACK!
Grant is stopped for a terrible instant - doubled over a branch, he
flips himself over, dropping further.  The cruiser jolts along, just a
half-step behind them.

Timmy dives the last six feet and HITS the wet earth 
with a THUD!  Grant
CRASHES next to him.  Before they can roll out of the way, the cruiser
keeps coming.  Grant and Timmy look up at it.

GRANT'S POV - The cruiser dropping, dropping toward them.  And finally
stops, just inches away, its dented grill grinning at them, its cracked
headlight glaring.

Oil drips down on Grant.  He grabs Timmy, who grabs the night goggles.
The two roll away.  That second the cruiser SMASHES to the ground.

Grant brushes himself off painfully, extends a hand to Timmy.  Timmy
slowly reaches up and pulls himself standing.

                            TIMMY
          Thanks, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          You owe me one.

Grant turns around in a slow, fluid circle, checking out the forest.

                            GRANT
          Where'd Lex go?

They hear a faint WHIMPERING.

                            TIMMY
          There's Lex.

He runs.  Grant follows.


INT  DRAINPIPE -

Lex is curled up inside the drainpipe.  Her baseball glove is in her
mouth and
 she is rocking back and forth, rhythmically banging her head
against the back of the pipe.  She WHIMPERS.

ON THE HILLSIDE -

Grant and Timmy arrive at the drainpipe and stare in at Lex.

                            GRANT
          Come on out now, Lex.

Lex continues to band her head.  Timmy tries again.

                            TIMMY
          It's your turn to wear the goggles, Lex.

She shakes her head.  He holds up her baseball but she doesn't look.

                            TIMMY
          I found your baseball.

                            LEX
          You did?

But she doesn't move.  Grant speaks encouragingly.

                            GRANT
          Cone on, Lex, it must be cold in there.
          And tight.  Why don't you come out?

                            LEX
          I'm afraid of the "animals".

                            TIMMY
          The "animals" are gone.

                            LEX
          Where did it go?

                            TIMMY
          I don't kno
w but it's not here now.

                            LEX
          Are there any grownups out there?

                            GRANT
          I'm a grownup, Lex.  Come on out.  Gimmie
          you hand, come on, here you go.

                            LEX
          I'm hungry.

                            GRANT
          Me, too.  We've got to get ourselves back
          to civilization.


EXT  ROADSIDE

Regis slowly crawls out from between a couple large boulders.  He looks
around carefully.  He peels mud off his face and rubs his neck.

He touches his cheek.

CLOSE ON Regis' swollen cheek.  He rubs it with his finger.  Suddenly,
he swats at his own mouth.  He reaches in and pulls out a leech fat with
blood.  He hurls it to the ground, spitting.  He grabs another off his
arm and rips if off, leaving a bloody streak.  He digs in his pants and
pulls out another.  He SCREAMS.

As soon as he has done so, he knows he's made a mistake.  He looks
around frantically.  Sees the Rex trot down the road toward 
him.

                            REGIS
          Noooooo!


BACK ON HILLSIDE -

Grant and the kids crest the hill.  Grant puts on the night goggles and
adjusts the dial and looks toward Regis.  The kids can't see that far.

                            TIMMY
          What's going on?

Grant's green POV - Regis and the Rex bounding after him.  Regis hugs a
tree, unmoving.

Grant whispers to the kids.

                            GRANT
          It's Regis and the Rex is after him.  But
          it's okay.  Regis knows the Rex can't see
          him.  Evidently, he can only see move-
          ment.  Regis'll be ok if he stays still.

AFTER A LONG MOMENT, the tyrannosaur walks away, disappears into the
shadows.  Regis waits another long moment and releases his tree.

GRANT'S POV - The tyrannosaur leaps out of the shadows and knocks Regis
to the ground.  Regis jumps up and backs off.  The animal knocks him
right back down.  Regis jumps up again and screams at the beast.

                            REGIS
    
      You don't want to hurt Mr. Regis.  Go
          away.  Ed's your friend.  Back off!

THE REX watches him dance around.  It goes toward him.  This time its
jaws are open.  Regis SCREAMS and in the middle, the scream cuts off.

Grant lets the goggles fall off his face.  They hit the ground with a
METALLIC CLINK.  The Rex turns toward Grant and the kids.

                            GRANT
          Let's go!

Grant grabs both the kids' hands and they begin to run.


BACK ON  TOUR REST AREA -

Drops of water splat on a big fern.  Light swims in the little puddle.
In the sky above, clouds hurry by, intermittently revealing a half-
obscured moon.

The torn fence lies in a crumpled, twisted mess.  The wheel of a Land
Cruiser spins.  A little lizard runs in place on it.

The SOUND of the jeep's engine.  It's Muldoon and Ellie.

THEIR POV - a single cruiser lies on its side in the middle of the road.

                            ELLIE
          Oh, My God!  Where's the other one?

Before the cruiser stops, she j
umps out.   Muldoon shouts a whisper.

                            MULDOON
          Ellie!

Ellie turns in the headlight beams.  Muldoon tosses her a flashlight.

                            MULDOON
          Wait up.

Muldoon skids to a stop, leaps out of the car.  He catches up to Ellie.

They share a frightened, apprehensive look.  Muldoon gets on his knees
and and touches a muddies area.

                            MULDOON
          T-Rex tracks.

Ellie looks out into the forest.

                            ELLIE
          Then they must be out there.  They must
          be out there.  I know it.

                            MULDOON
          Perhaps.

                            ELLIE
          No!  They're out there.

                            MULDOON
          I've seen a lot of animal attacks in the
          bush.  It's not as gory and horrifying to
          see as you'd think.  No pools of blood or
          exposed bones.  There is usually little or
          no evidence left behind.  And if
 victims
          are small, a predator can kill by just
          shaking the little thing to death, eating
          it, and leave not so much as a button.

A definite RUSTLING in the brush.

Ellie jumps and SCREAMS.  Muldoon puts his hand over her mouth and
pushes her down.  They both squat by the cruiser.  SILENCE.  Ellie
swallows.  Muldoon slowly gets up.  Ellie follows.

Their flashlights swing back and forth in the night.  Twigs crack under
their feet.

Ellie hears the RUSTLE at the edge of the forest.  She shines her light
into the brush.  She catches her breath.  Her hand shakes.

Ellie flashes her beam right, left, up, down.  Jumps.  Something is
coming at her, rolling at her.  She gasps, steps back.  It's too late.
It's Gennaro.  His limp body stops at her feet.  She covers her mouth.
Muldoon runs to her.

Gennaro is face-down.  Muldoon takes his pulse.

                            MULDOON
          Thank God.  (beat)  We have to carry him.
          First I have to ...

He stands and removes his 
jacket.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon tears the jacket into long strips.

He wraps Gennaro's wounds.

                            MULDOON
          He's losing a lot of blood.  Help me.

Muldoon and Ellie carry Gennaro to the jeep.  They lay him on the back
seat.  Muldoon jumps in back with him.  He keeps wrapping the wounds.
Ellie starts the engine, looks back at him.

                            ELLIE
          Looks like you've been through this
          before.

Muldoon looks up.

                            MULDOON
          I told you I've seen big game attacks in
          Africa.

She starts the engine.

                            ELLIE
          Right.

Ellie skids out of there.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

The dark room is lit with two outdoor torches.  Light flickering on
their faces, Arnold and Wu stare at the console screen.

                            WU
          Why?

                            ARNOLD
          Because Nedry messed with the code.
          That's why I'm checking it.

              
              WU
          But that could take weeks.  What would be
          faster?  Try keychecks.

Arnold snaps his fingers, grabs Wu,

                            ARNOLD
          That's true.  Keychecks will give me a
          record of every button Nedry pushed.

With a rapid series of keys, Arnold initiates "keystrokes".  The
computer displays a short series of commands.  Arnold runs his finger
down the screen.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus, that's all he did all afternoon?
          He was just dicking around, maybe waiting
          to get his nerve up.

Wu points to a line.  It reads:  WHTE-RBT.OBJ

                            WU
          What's that?

                            ARNOLD
          Some sort of object.  Let's see if we can
          trace it.

Arnold types FIND WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  Nothing.  He tries DEFINE WHTE-RBT.OBJ.
Still nothing.  LIST WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  The screen fills with data.  Each
line defines another security system that has been shut off:  SECURITY
PERIM
ETER FENCES OFF/   SECURITY - INTERIOR FENCES OFF/  SECURITY -
LABORATORY DOORS OFF/, etc.

                            WU
          What's it mean?

                            ARNOLD
          It wasn't a bug.  It was a trap door that
          fat bastard left for himself.  When he
          hit WHTE-RBT. OBJ, it initiates a set of
          commands that turned the whole goddamn
          park off.  Hammond was right about him.

                            WU
          If I did that I'd leave a way to turn it
          back on.  In case I had to.  I'm sure
          Nedry did.  You're find it.

Arnold nods grimly.


INT  CAFETERIA - NIGHT

Hammond sits quietly in the deserted cafeteria, calmly spooning ice
cream into his mouth.  This room is lit by dozens of candles.

Muldoon walks in, stares at Hammond in the semi-darkness.

                            MULDOON
          We found Gennaro.  He'd badly injured.
          Harding's tending to him in your
          quarters.  He'll be all right if we can
    
      radio for help.  Your grandchildren and
          Grant are somewhere in the park.  I
          believe they're alive but I don't know
          where they are.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm sure you'll find them.

                            MULDOON
          I certainly hope so.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm sure we will.  After all, I keep
          telling everyone, this park is made for
          children.

                            MULDOON
          Just so you understand that they're
          missing, sir.

                            HAMMOND
          Missing?  Of course I know they're
          missing.  You just said that.  Look, Bob,
          let's not get carried away.  We've had a
          little breakdown from the storm or
          whatever, and as a result we've had a
          regrettable, unfortunate accident.  And
          that's all that happened.  We're dealing
          with it.  Arnold will get the computers
          cleaned up, and
 the radio and phone lines
          open.  You'll find those kids and my good
          friend, Dr. Grant.  I'm sure they'll want
          some of this ice cream.  It's very good.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

Dark.  Ellie helps Harding get Gennaro comfortable on Hammond's couch.
Blood from Gennaro's injuries stain the rich leather.  Gennaro babbles.

                            GENNARO
          That Rex didn't even give me his full
          attention.  That's what hurts.  I was
          just an afterthought.  I gave him my full
          attention.

                            HARDING
          He's had a lot of morphine.

                            GENNARO
              (sings)
          Not enough.

                            ELLIE
          I need to find Wu.  I have to run a few
          tests in his lab.

                            HARDING
          He's probably in the control room, get-
          ting in the way while Arnold tries to put
          things together.

As Ellie leaves, Genna
ro is singing a shanty in his morphine stupor.

                            GENNARO
          Yo ho, I'll close this place down ...


EXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - NIGHT

The ship is tossed around on a stormy sea.

                                                     MATCH CUT TO:


INT  STATEROOM -

The eggs are tossed around in the womb of the incubator.  The swell
settles but the rocking of one egg doesn't stop.  The egg cracks, a
silvery line runs down its side.


EXT  PARK - NIGHT

Somewhere in the dark park, laced by low fog, Grant, Timmy and Lex walk.

                            LEX
          I'm tired.

                            TIMMY
          You're too big to be carried.

                            LEX
          But I'm tired-tired.

                            GRANT
          Okay, Lex.

Grant picks her up.

                            GRANT
          Oof!  You're heavy.

The full moon is blurred by drifting clouds.  Their blunted shadows lead
the three across an open field toward dark woods beyond
.  Grant is lost
is thought, trying to decide where to go.

                            GRANT
          I think we're still in his paddock.

Lex's heavy eyes open.  Her eyes grow big.  She taps Grant's shoulder.

                            GRANT
          What?

                            LEX
          Don't you see?  Don't you see?

                            GRANT
          What?

                            LEX
          The fence.

                            GRANT
              (squinting)
          No.

                            TIMMY
          Oh I do, right there!

Lex lets herself slide off Grant and runs into the woods.  Timmy
follows.  Grant follows, squinting.  Finally, he sees.  A big smile.

The kids look up at a twelve foot high electric fence.  Timmy gulps.

                            LEX
          Timmy's scared of heights.

Timmy spins in fury.

                            TIMMY
          Shut up.

Lex and Timmy stare at each other.  No fighting - now.  They relax.

                   
         GRANT
          Okay with the fence, Timmy?

Timmy eyes it.  Nods hesitantly.  They start to climb.  Lex climbs easily.

                            LEX
              (mumbles quietly)
          'Fraid of heights.

Timmy climbs tentatively.  A dinosaur ROARS in the distance.

CLOSE ON - Timmy's foot loses its grip.

Timmy hangs for a moment, held only by his straining hands.

All three stop.  Wait.  Timmy regains his balance.  Slowly, they proceed
up and over.

On the other side, Grant looks around.  More high trees.  Beyond a field.

                            GRANT
          A herbivore grazing area.  Excellent.

Grant starts to walk toward it.  Timmy stops.  Lets sits on a tree root.

                             TIM
          We gonna walk all night?

Grant looks at his watch.

                            GRANT
          Twelve hours before that ship reaches the
          mainland.

                            TIM
          We need sleep.

True, and Grant's thinking the same thing.  He looks aro
und, surveying
the misty forest.  He looks straight up into the beautiful, tall trees
that ring the wide-open grassy meadow.

                            GRANT
          Up there.

                            TIM
          Climb?  Again?  I can't climb again?

Grant smiles.

                            GRANT
          Sure you can.

Grant checks out and rejects tree after tree.  Near the meadow he finds
it.  A good, basic climbing tree.


EXT  UPPER BRANCHES OF THE TREE

Grant helps Lex get comfortable on his lap.  Timmy tucks himself in
between Grant's outstretched legs.  Grant looks out.  Back to kids.

Timmy and Lex are already snoring.  Lex turns and hugs Grant close to
her.  She murmurs in her sleep.  Grant starts to pat her shoulder when
Timmy, without waking, reaches to her and strokes her hair.

                            TIMMY
              (mumbles)
          It's ok, Lex.  Everything's gonna be okay.

                                                       CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - amoeba-like creatures 
swimming in a pool.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

Ellie lifts her head away from the powerful microscope.

The dark room is lit by flashlight.  Battery packs power the microscope.
Wu paces the room, regarding his eggs with dismay.  Sitting on their
long tables with no moving wands above them - no thermal sensors.

                            WU
          What is taking Arnold so long?  This room
          is too cold.  My eggs will be damaged.

Ellie swings the lens to Wu.  Not so interested but peers in politely.

                            ELLIE
          No sign of those berries.  Really
          interesting.  There are indications of a
          similar virus in every tissue sample.
          But it's not in the ground.  Could I look
          at some of the discarded embryos?

Wu reluctantly agrees.  He opens a cabinet and brings her samples.

                            WU
          I'm sure you'll find your virus ... or a
          similar one.  All animals carry many
          viruses 
in a dormant condition.  It's
          almost impossible to say with certainty
          which are the same strains.

Ellie begins a test on a sample.  She adds a reagent and marks up a
slide.  As she works:

                            ELLIE
          And yet from what Harding tells me, many
          of you animals have similar symptoms -
          besides the microvesicles, a lack of
          hunger, loss of reproductive urges, sores
          in the mouth and gums.

Wu waves his arms.

                            WU
          What the hell does Harding know?  He's a
          veterinarian, not a pathologist.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Arnold pushes his chair away from his console and claps his hands as
Muldoon walks in.  Muldoon asks hopefully.

                            MULDOON
          What is it?

Arnold points to the screen.

                            ARNOLD
          That's it.

Muldoon comes closer.

                            MULDOON
          That's what?

                            ARNOL
D
          I found the command to restore the
          original code.  It resets the linked
          parameters.

                            MULDOON
          The fences and the power?

                            ARNOLD
          Right.  And it does something else. It
          erases the code lines that refer to it.  It
          destroys all evidence it was ever there.

                            MULDOON
          Nedry could steal the eggs, get back and
          reset the whole show.  No one would ever
          miss him.

                            ARNOLD
          Watch this.

Arnold types in a command.  The screen flickers and changes.  Arnold and
Muldoon look out the window as lights come on through out the park.

                            ARNOLD
          Hot damn!

                            MULDOON
          Are the fences back on?

                            ARNOLD
          You bet they are.  It will take a few
          seconds to get up to full power, because
          we've got fift
y miles of fence out there,
          and the generator has to feed the
          capacitors along the way.  But in a half
          a minute we'll be back in business.

Arnold points to the transparent map of the park.  On it, bright red
lines snake out, moving throughout the park, as electricity surges
through the fences.

                            MULDOON
          Motion sensors?

                            ARNOLD
          Got them too.   It will be a few minutes
          while the computer counts.  Then I'll
          tell you where Grant and the kids are and
          you can go and get them.  But every-
          thing's working.  Half past ten and we've
          got the whole thing back up and running.

Muldoon picks up a phone, shakes his head.

                            MULDOON
          Just hiss.


BACK ON  GRANT AND KIDS IN TREE -

Grant snores.  A mosquito buzzes around him.  He waves him away and
continues to sleep.

In the distance, a tiny BEEPING. Below the towering tree, across the
f
ield, a sensor beeps, it's green light blinks, and the beeping stops.

IN THE HIGH TREE, the branches sway.  Grant and the kids sleep on.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

The glowing, glass map.  Arnold and Muldoon stare at it.

                            MULDOON
          What is taking so damn long?  Where are they?

                            ARNOLD
          There's a lot of extraneous movement out
          there.  Branches blowing, birds, back-
          ground movement.  It may take, ah, okay,
          count's finished.

Muldoon looks at Arnold anxiously.  Arnold looks down.

                            ARNOLD
          Hmmmm.  I don't see them.  Maybe they're
          out of range of a sensor.

                            MULDOON
          Shit.  I don't know where they are.  I
          wish I could go out there   But I haven't
          got anything to use on the Rex.  My
          rocket launcher's in the jeep Nedry
          stole.  And going out with a big gun in
          the dark would be suicide
.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

Brightly lit again.  Ellie performs tests with a centrifuge.  She looks
at Wu, who sits across from her in a high stool, stifling a yawn.

                            ELLIE
          Why don't you get some sleep, Dr. Wu?
          I'm just going to run a couple more tests
          and then I'm going to turn in myself.

Wu doesn't need to be told twice.  He climbs off his stool.

                            WU
          No point in everyone being exhausted.

He starts to leave.  He comes back and speaks consolingly at Ellie.

                            WU
          I'm sure Muldoon will find Dr. Grant as
          soon as there is light.

Ellie appreciates his effort, nods seriously, goes back to work.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


EXT  OCEAN - JUST BEFORE DAWN

Beautiful dark ocean.  The sky is a rich blue.  A morning star fades as
the sky lightens.  The Anne B is a small dot on the massive ocean.


INT  STATEROOM, ANNE B 
-

Eggs sit in the incubator.  A hand sprays them with foam.  Leaves.
CAMERA EXAMINES the eggs as the foam disperses.  More cracks.  One egg
jumps with a bolt from within.  It settles.  Jumps again.

                                                      CUT TO:

ESTABLISHING AERIAL - the primordial beauty of Isla Nublar at dawn.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAWN

Muldoon drives out into the park in Harding's jeep.  THREE WORKERS
travel with him.  Each carries a rifle.


EXT  GRANT'S TREE - DAWN

CAMERA LOOK DOWN on Grant, Lex and Timmy still sleeping in the tree.  A
large shadow falls on their quiet faces.  Lex opens an eye. She SCREAMS.

Grant and Timmy wake up with a start.

THEIR POV - AS THE CAMERA LOOKS THROUGH THEIR LEGS AND TILTS UP right
into the huge face of A DUCK-BILLED HADROSAUR, a gigantic dinosaur with
cow eyes.  Its head moves up through the canopy of the trees.  Then the
head swoops way down below.  And returns to Grant's level and stares at
his shoe.

The hadrosaur tastes Grant's shoe.  The kids
 press tightly into Grant.

                            LEX
          He gonna eat us?

                            GRANT
          I don't think so.  She's a ...

                            GRANT AND TIMMY
          ... herbivore.

The hadrosaur HONKS.  Lex covers her ears.  Grant smiles and motions to
Lex.  He picks a big fruit off the tree and tosses it into the
hadrosaur's mouth.  CHOMP.  He feeds it again.  Lex and Timmy toss a few.

CHOMP!  CHOMP!  HONK!  HONK!

The hadrosaur's big head swoops way down, momentarily gone.

When she returns, all three quickly gather fruits and throw them into
her mouth.  The hadrosaur pulls back with her giant mouthful of fruit.
She pulls further and further back and then her huge head turns and
moves down.

Grant, Lex and Timmy strain to see through the branches.

THEIR POV - The hadrosaur is feeding four scampering, baby hadrosaurs.
Letting the fruit tumble from her mouth into theirs.  Lex YELLS:

                            LEX
          Come here, babies!  Get your b
reakfast!

The babies run to the base of the tree.  The kids toss fruits right down
to them.  Lex and Timmy climb lower to feed them right from their hands.

Grant and the mother hadrosaur stare at each other.  She sniffs his
foot.  He moves closer, straddling a branch.  He lifts up her lip and
examines her gums.

CLOSE ON - a ripped piece of fence stuck in her teeth.

Grant yanks it out.  He lets it drop to the ground.  He take a large
leaf and rubs her teeth with it.

CLOSE ON - her mouth as Grant's hand touches the side of her tongue.  He
sees little tiny bumps.

The hadrosaur lets out a low groan.   Grant is puzzled, rubs harder.

                            GRANT
          Like the trike.  Maybe it's not the stones.

HONK!   She pulls her mouth away.  The baby hadrosaurs turn to the
honking adult.  She is leaving quickly.  They follow quickly behind her.
The small herd leaves, casually trampling trees as they go.


EXT  BACK ROADS, PARK - MORNING

Muldoon and workers drive rapidly in the jeep.  Suddenly,
 Muldoon slams
on the brakes.

MULDOON'S POV - ABOUT TWENTY PROCOMPSOGNATHIDS (COMPYS), small chicken-
sized scavenging dinosaurs, scramble across the road.

                            MULDOON
          Where the hell are they going?

Muldoon watches them cross.  He thinks it over.  Spins the wheel and
follows them off the road.

                            MULDOON
          Let's see what's up.


EXT  BELOW THE TREE, PARK - MORNING

Timmy bravely jumps from a very low branch.  He smiles and looks at
Grant, who's already on the ground.  Grant looks off in the distance.

                            GRANT
          Tim, I think there's a motion sensor
          across the field and down there.

                            TIM
          Where's Lex?

ALONE IN THE BUSHES -  Lex kneels.  She holds a big fruit and calls:

                            LEX
          C'mere boy, c'mere.

She tosses the fruit.

CLOSE ON - the fruit rolling away.

Lex gets up and follows the rolling fruit.  She picks it up.

           
                 LEX
          It's very, very good.

She tosses it again.

                            LEX
          C'mere boy, c'mere.

Lex's eyes scan the bushes, then stop.  She smiles.

LEX'S POV - hidden in the brush, a baby triceratops' eye peeks at Lex.

Lex pushes the fruit closer.  The BABY TRICERATOPS comes out of the
brush, squeaking as it goes.  It nibbles the fruit.  Lex rolls another.

BACK ON GRANT AND TIM - They look around.  Timmy stops, mouth open, YELLS:

                            TIM
          Dr. Grant, Dr. Grant, look.

Grant turns, looks OFFSCREEN.  He's astonished by when he sees.

HIS POV - a row of shrubs, which Lex seems to soar above.  As a break in
the shrubs, it's clear that she's riding the baby triceratops.  Loving it.

                            LEX
          Whoa!

With a whoop, Grant and Timmy chase after Lex on her triceratops.

Lex rides through low brush, ducking down as she goes.  Then beneath the
tall trees as she enters the forest.  She crosses a stream on a log
b
ridge.  Light showers down through the branches.  The water shimmers.
Lex in is paradise.

Behind her, Grant and Timmy shout for her to stop.  She waves, kicks the
triceratops like it's a horse and YELLS:

                            LEX
          Giddyup!

The trike takes off, in a rush.  It trips over a fallen tree, downed by
the storm.  The trike takes a spill and Lex goes flying.

                            LEX
          Whoa!!  Take is easy!

She passes over the trike's head, in the air, and SCREAMS as she flies:

                            LEX
          I can't swim!

She SPLASHES into the stream.

Timmy, first to arrive on the scene, dives in heroically.  He comes up
sheepish and muddy - and sees Lex standing in a foot of water.

The baby dinosaur rolls to a stop, mowing down a patch of saplings as
she goes.  It stands up, dizzy and out of breath.

Timmy wipes mud off himself.  Grant helps the kids out of the water.
The baby triceratops follows them.  Grant yells to the baby trike.

                 
           GRANT
          Go home now.  Home to Freda!

                            LEX
          Oh, let him stay.  He likes me to ride
          him.  He could carry me instead of you,
          Dr. Grant.  Please, let him stay,

Grant shakes his head,

                            GRANT
          Go!  Go away.  Go!  Get out of here!

The trike whimpers and watches the three of them walk on.  Lex is
heartbroken.

                            LEX
          Will I ever play with him again?

Grant looks across the field, abundantly beautiful in the early morning.
He has to keep them going.   He points across the field.

                            GRANT
          We gotta get to that motion detector.
          It's still a ways.

Lex looks behind her.  In the distance, more hadrosaurs join the herd
eating from the tall trees.  Some cool off in a shallow lagoon.  They
drink, lowering their flat heads, meeting their own reflections in the
still water.  When they look up again, their heads swivel.  At the
water's 
edge, a baby hadrosaur ventures out, squeaks, and scrambles back
while the adults watch indulgently.


EXT  OFF ROAD, PARK - MORNING

Muldoon and his workers now follow the compys on foot.  The compys trail
off in different directions.  Muldoon and his workers break apart to
track the different groups.

A BEARDED WORKER follows his party of compys.  He looks ahead and sees a
small group stopped ahead.  Their heads are bent to the ground.

A BALD WORKER has reached another cluster of compys.  Kicking, he
scatters them.

Muldoon's tracking leads him to the equipment graveyard where Nedry was
lost.  He sees his stolen red jeep.  He rushes to it.  On the passenger
side still sits the rocket launcher.  He opens the door to retrieve it.
When he leans in, his eye catches the tilted side-view mirror.  The
image is of many compys bent over the ground.  He comes around, YELLING.

                            MULDOON
          I found Nedry!

In the distance, the call is ECHOED.

                            BEARDED WORKE
R (OFF)
          I found him!

                            BALD WORKER (OFF)
          Found him!


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY

Hammond peeks in the door and sees Gennaro, heavily bandaged, dozing on
the couch.  Gennaro's eyes flutter and Hammond enters and smiles.

                            HAMMOND
          He, Donald.  Glad you're awake.  I hope
          you're not going to take this little
          mishap you had and hold it against my
          park.  It would be terrible if the
          finishing funds were in any way held up.

Gennaro just grins and shakes his head.  He's very high on morphine.  He
wants to speak but Hammond keeps talking.  After each sentence, Gennaro
enthusiastically agrees with a nod.

                            HAMMOND
          You really shouldn't have gotten out of
          the vehicle.  The park is actually quite
          safe.  A disenchanted worker sabotaged
          some equipment.  Arnold, Muldoon, and Wu,
          all loyal employees, are righting damage
    
      as we speak.

                            GENNARO
          Oh good, 'cause I love the park!  It's
          more than we ever dreamed!  Those
          brachiosaurs are so big!  And those
          Spitters -
              (he spits)
          - incredible!  I only have one problem.
          Aren't we going to have pterodactyls?
              (he frowns, smacks his forehead)
          Oh, they'd fly away!

Gennaro looks off, watching the imaginary pterodactyls fly away.
Hammond takes out a bag.

                            HAMMOND
          Take a look at these, Donald.  Have you
          seen these?  These are great.

Hammond dumps things out of the bag.  They are souvenirs of the park.

                            HAMMOND
          Wind-up toys.  Spitter umbrellas.

Gennaro is thrilled.

                            HAMMOND
          I got some great t-shirts.  Dinosaur
          bingo, hey ...

Hammond leans closer.

                            HAMMOND
          Wu says he can make a foot high
    
      triceratops.  We'll sell pets as living
          souvenirs.  Bio-engineered to eat only
          food we sell, of course.

Gennaro can't take it.  Great idea!  He high-fives Hammond repeatedly.

Harding enters and gently taps Hammond on the shoulder.

                            HARDING
          You'll have to bear with him, Mr. Hammond.
          He's doped to infinity and back.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - DAY

Sunlight pours through the windows.  Ellie sits with her head in hands.
She looks around and wanders the lab.  Notices a drawer, slides it open.

X-rays.  She shuffles through, finds some marked: FREDA.

Ellie snaps on a viewing light at her lab station.  She studies the X-
ray.  She looks up in surprise.   Studies it again.

The viewing light is snapped off.  Ellie looks again.  Wu stands there.

                            WU
          Who gave you permission -

Ellie attacks back.

                            ELLIE
          I'm here to investigate this park. And
          there's
 plenty you haven't told me.

                            WU
          That's absurd.

                            ELLIE
          These bones aren't fully formed.

                            WU
          You're qualified to interpret x-rays of
          living dinosaurs?  I doubt it.  It took
          me many months to learn.

                            Y
          I'll tell you something else, Freda isn't
          an adult, just a huge juvenile.

                            WU
          You're making a lot of assumptions here.

                            ELLIE
          Right.  What the hell is going on, Wu?

They stare at each other in the bright sunlight.

                            HAMMOND (OFF)
          Growth hormones.

The two swing around.  Hammond stands in the sharp shadows of the room.

                            WU
          She didn't have a right to explore my lab.

                            HAMMOND
          Let's not argue, Wu, we have a serious
          problem.
              (to 
Ellie)
          These animals don't last.  There is a
          regularity, a predictability about when
          they die.  It's always ... very young.
          We don't know why.  Given time, I'm sure
          Wu will figure it out.  It's just ...

                            WU
          Just some adjustment in the code is
          required.

                            HAMMOND
          But there are deadlines.  The park opens
          next summer. And it requires full-grown
          specimens.  So Wu uses growth hormones to
          achieve the desired size in a short
          amount of time.  But they all keep dying
          and we don't know how to stop it.

Ellie and Wu stare at Hammond.  He steps forward.  The light is so hot
behind him that his appearance is like an apparition.

                            HAMMOND
          I was going to tell you all this myself,
          Dr. Sattler, after Gennaro stopped
          breathing down my neck.  That's why I
          wanted you and Dr. Grant 
here on my
          island - you have to help me keep the
          dinosaurs alive.  Won't you please help
          me?

                                                      CUT TO:

IN THE SKY, the sun momentarily burns through the clouds -


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY


Ellie enters.  On the couch, Gennaro snores lightly.  In a chair nearby
Harding sleeps, a roll of gauze grasped in his hands.

Ellie walks over to the large model of the park that Hammond revealed.
She looks at the miniature dinosaurs that sit in different sectors of
the park.  She picks up the plastic Rex, examines it, drops it back in.

She brushes by Harding and studies Gennaro's pasty, sleeping face.  Air
blows in and out of his dry lips.  She examines the gauze wrapped around
his wounded leg.  It seeps with blood.


INT CONTROL - DAY

Arnold works at his console.  Hammond and Wu lean over his shoulder.
Ellie bursts in, very agitated.  Hammond looks up.

                            ELLIE
          Gennaro's losing a lot of blood. 
 He
          needs transfusions.  We gotta get a
          rescue helicopter.  Arnold, what's with
          the phones?

                            ARNOLD
          Ah hell. I just can't find it.

He sips his coffee and stares bleary-eyed at the screen.

                            ELLIE
          Find what?

                            ARNOLD
          Nedry jammed all the communication lines.
          He inserted some command, a lockout into
          the program code.  I can't find it,
          because I gave that restore command and
          it erased part of the program listings.

                            WU
          So?  Just reset - shut the system down
          and you'll clear the memory.  Everything
          will be in the normal wakeup mode.

                            ARNOLD
          Shut the system down?

                            WU
          And reset.

                            ARNOLD
          I've never done that before.  And I'm
          reluctant to do it.  Maybe it's tr
ue, all
          systems will come on, but maybe they won't.

                            ELLIE
          Look, there is a sick man here who needs
          medical attention or he'll die.  Four
          people are out there, missing in your
          park.  We need search teams.  We have to
          have a phone or radio.

Arnold still hesitates.

                            ELLIE
          Well?

                            ARNOLD
          Well, it's just that the safety systems
          don't function with the computer shut
          down and -

Ellie boils over.

                            ELLIE
          - turn the goddamn safety systems off!
          Can't you get it through your head that
          we have no choice?

Arnold looks at Hammond, who now stares out into the park.  Without
turning, Hammond nods his consent.

                            ARNOLD
          Okay.

Arnold gets up and goes to the main panel.  He opens the doors and
uncovers the metal swing-latches over the safety switches. 
 He pops them
off, one after another.

                            ARNOLD
          You asked for it.  And you got it.

He throws the master switch.

The control room goes black.  All monitors go black.  Arnold, Wu and
Ellie stand in the dark.

                            ELLIE
          How long do we have to wait?

                            ARNOLD
          Thirty seconds.


EXT  FIELD IN THE PARK -

Grant and kids walk through a clearing.  Lex stops.

                            GRANT
          What is it?

                            LEX
          I hear something.

                            GRANT
          Come on.

Timmy looks around. The morning is still and peaceful. Branches are
motionless.  Only a little bird jumps from one branch to another.

                            LEX
          Hear it now?

                            TIMMY
          You're hearing things.  Come on, we gotta
          get back and warn them about the boat.

Lex hesitates but doesn't want to be left behind.  She runs betw
een
Grant and Timmy.  Then they all hear it.

HONKING.  It comes from the herd of duck bills behind them.  First the
honking of a single animal, then another animal joins in, then another
and another, until the whole herd has taken up the honking cry.

                            TIMMY
          What's going on?

                            GRANT
          They're agitated.

The duckbills twist and turn.  They hurry out of the water, circling the
young ones to protect them.

With a ROAR, the T-Rex bursts from the trees, just a hundred yards away
straight toward the hadrosaurs.

                            LEX
          I told you I heard something!

The earth SHAKES.  A low rumble is heard and felt as the hadrosaurs begin
to run  in a parallel direction to the course of Grant and the kids.

                            GRANT
          Outta the way, kids! Run!

Grant grabs Lex, lifting her bodily off the ground, and carries her like
a football.  Timmy runs beside them.

Hadrosaurs run alongside of them.  Grant
 hears the crashing of trees.
He takes a glance over his shoulder.

GRANT'S POV - a flurry of flamingos takes flight and spooks the herd
into changing direction.  The hadrosaurs swerve and charge right into
the path of Grant, Lex and Timmy.  They all SCREAM.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

The quiet black room.  Hammond stands by the big window.  His pensive
presence affects all in the room.

Arnold looks at his illuminated watch.

                            ARNOLD
          Memory should be cleared by now.

He pushes the main switch back on.  Nothing on.

                            ARNOLD
          Damn.

Arnold pushes the switch off and then on again.  Still nothing.  He
glances at Hammond's back.  Sweat forms on his brow.

                            ELLIE
          What's wrong?

                            ARNOLD
          Oh hell!  I have to turn the safety switches
          back on before I restart the power.

Arnold flips on three safeties, and covers them again with latch covers.
Holding his breath, he
 turns on the main power switch.

First, there is the computer beep.  Ellie jumps.  Then relaxes.  The
lights come on.  The screens hum.  Hammond's shoulder twitches slightly.

                            ARNOLD
          Thank God!

The room is jubilant.  Hugs and cheers.  Ellie picks up a phone.

                            ELLIE
          Arnold!  They're still not working.

                            ARNOLD
          No, it sounds dead but after a reset, all
          system modules have to be brought on line
          manually.

Arnold quickly goes back to work at his console.  Hammond turns.

                            WU
              (to Hammond)
          Arnold's about to get the phones up.

Arnold pushes the chair back.

                            ARNOLD
          Okay, we're up again!

Ellie grabs the phone back up.

                            ELLIE
          No we're not.  Phones still dead.

Arnold swings her way.

                            ARNOLD
          Can't be -

                    
        HAMMOND
          My God, look at this, Arnold.

Hammond points to the transparent map.  A tight cluster of dots by the
lagoon move in a coordinated way.  Moving fast, in a kind of swirl.

                            ELLIE
          What's happening?

                            ARNOLD
              (tonelessly)
          The duckbills.

                            WU
          My good God.

                            ELLIE
          What?

                            ARNOLD
          It's the Rex ...

                            HAMMOND
          They've stampeded ...


BACK ON  THE HADROSAURS - LOW ANGLE ON THE STAMPEDE -

Grant and kids run for their lives.  Behind them the duckbills charge
with surprising speed.  Their enormous bodies charge in a tight group,
kicking up dirt, rocks, whole trees as they thunder along.

CLOSE ON - a charging duckbill as he HONKS, eyes wild with fear.

A horrible ROAR of the T-Rex sends a duckbill infant squealing and
struggling to stay out from underfoot.

CLOSE ON
 - A huge adult foot almost tramples the infant.

Frightened and confused the infant scampers even deeper into the
maelstrom.  The frenzied herd raises a great cloud of yellow dust.

GRANT AND LEX AND TIMMY run wildly.  The stampede is very close behind
Grant and the kid's faces are covered with sweat and dust.

Another deafening ROAR of the T-Rex.

Grant leads them toward a rocky outcrop with a stand of big conifers.
The animals continue to close.

CLOSE ON - the running feet of the stampeding animals.  The ground
VIBRATES every time it is struck by the huge feet.

GRANT AND THE KIDS scramble onto the rocks.  They frantically tuck in
between big boulders as the the herd reaches them.  Lex shields her
dusty face with her hands as she wedges deeper between the rocks.  Grant
pushes her down deeper and looks up from between the rocks.

GRANT'S POV - the immense legs of the first hadrosaur to pass.  Another
slams its big tail against the rocks, leaving a splash of hot blood.

Stampeding legs send clods of dirt fl
ying in the air.  Above, even the
birds are running.  Disoriented, they fly frantically along.

GRANT AND THE KIDS are enveloped in dust.  Just shadows of huge bodies
with giant limbs.  BELLOWS of pain as animals wheel and circle.

A boulder is dislodged and it rolls toward Timmy.  He dives out of his
rocky hiding place.  The boulder continues on toward Grant and Lex.
They dive after Timmy.  The group buries itself anew in a group of thick
roots tangled amidst smaller rocks.  The boulder continues on, SMASHING
the rocky enclave they have just left.

Grant and the kids huddle and watch the last under-bellies oscillate
above them.  The stampede goes past.  They lie there, unable to move.
They watch the herd trample on.


CLOSE ON - The Rex's foot as it crushes a motion sensor.

Lex SCREAMS.  Grant and Timmy cover her mouth.

The T-Rex hunts down the herd.  He targets his prey.  A young hadrosaur.

As the hadrosaur gallops into the shadowy treeline, the Rex lunges
fiercely.  The Rex and its victim are enveloped 
in dust.

Grant holds Lex close.  She watches the terrible cloud with a quiet
horror.  Timmy makes the first move to leave.

                            TIMMY
          Let's go.  Now!

The herd's remainder gallops off into the safety of the deep jungle.

Grant, Lex and Timmy run in the opposite direction.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond, Arnold, Wu, and Ellie watch the monitor as the dust slowly
clears.  Hadrosaurs scatter.

Now the Rex is calm and quiet.  BACK TO CAMERA, he gnaws on something.

                            HAMMOND
          No!  Oh no!  He make a kill.  He killed
          one of my animals!  Where's Muldoon?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm sorry, Mr. Hammond.

                            HAMMOND
          My animals!  My animals!

Muldoon enters, limping in.  Hammond is very upset.

                            HAMMOND
          Where have you been?  My Rex killed a
          hadrosaur.  You should be out there,
          doing something.

                            MUL
DOON
          I just came to tell you - you're minus
          one computer expert.


EXT  BY THE RIVER, PARK - DAY

The water rushes a few hundred yards away.  Grant and the kids have
finally rested enough.  Grant nods to Timmy.

                            GRANT
          We'll walk by the river.  That leads back
          to the Visitor's center.

                            LEX
          Not me.  I'm not walking anymore.

                            TIMMY
          Come on Lex, I'll carry you.

                            LEX
          Nope.  Too scared.

Timmy looks up at Grant.  Grant kneels down by Lex.  Lex embraces Grant.

                            GRANT
          You ready?

She wipes her tears.

                            LEX
          Can we go on the raft?  Then we don't
          have to walk so close to the animals!

                            GRANT
          What raft?

Lex points to a low concrete maintenance building with bars.  It is
twenty yards away.

                            LEX

          Where I found Freda's baby.

Grant start to stand.  He's thinking.

                            GRANT
          It's still mid-morning.  I bet we have at
          least ten miles to go.  If we take the
          raft along the river, we can make much
          faster progress.

                            TIMMY
          Let's do it.


INT  MAINTENANCE BUILDING -

Grant stumbles deep in the gloomy recesses of the building.  He pushes
past drums of herbicide, tree-pruning equipment, spare tires, coils of
cyclone fencing, huge fertilizer bags, stacks of ceramic insulators,
empty motor-oil cans, work-lights and cables.

                            GRANT
          Lex, I don't see any raft.

Timmy looks at Lex.  Where is it?  Lex doesn't know.

                            TIMMY
          Keep going.

Grant keeps pushing through bags of cement, lengths of copper pipe,
piles of green mesh.  Two plastic oars hang on the concrete wall.

                            GRANT
          Bullseye!

Timmy is reliev
ed.  Lex smiles.

                            LEX
          Told you!

Grant grabs them.  Looks around, still -

                            GRANT
          No raft. Where did you see it, Lex?

                            LEX
          Actually, I never really saw one. Just
          assumed.

                            GRANT
          Assumed?

She nods.  Grant and Timmy resume looking.

IN THE REAR OF THE BUILDING - Lex walks below a barred window.  Slats of
light fall on her back.  She sees a dark closet door ajar.  She brushes
the handle.  It swings opens and two bright orange life preservers fall
on her, knocking her to the ground.

LEX SCREAMS, frantically pushing the life preservers off.

Grant's head pops up.  Timmy runs to her side.  She is wrestling
irrationally with the life preservers.  Timmy drops to the ground.

                            TIMMY
          Lex!  Lex!  You're okay, you're okay!

Lex is overcome with fear.  Timmy grabs a preservers and puts it on.

                            TIMM
Y
          Look, Lex!  Look!

She looks at him, realizes, and bursts out laughing.  Timmy laughs with
her.  Grant joins them.  He sits on a box and laughs.

                            GRANT
          I'm afraid there's no raft.

Grant gets up.  He reaches for the hands of the kids.  Timmy sees it -
the box Grant sat on is labeled: RAFT STORAGE.  Timmy smiles..


AT THE RIVER'S EDGE -

Grant pulls a cord.

With a LOUD HISS, the rubber begins to expand uncontrollably, jerking
and jumping like a wild marionette.  Then, with a whopping HISS-WHAP! it
pops fully open on the deck: a large bright yellow rubber raft.

Timmy and Lex climb in, wearing the life preservers.  Grant gets in and
pushes off with his oars.

The small disturbance causes the cicadas to ROAR.  The raft drifts out
into the lagoon.  Grant fixes his oars into the oarlocks.

Grant surveys the river.

                            GRANT
          Looks pretty calm.

THUMP.  The raft stops moving.  They are aground.  Lex looks overboard.
She reaches in
 about elbow deep.

Grant stands and puts the oars in the water.  He pushes with all his
might.  There is a long scraping sound of the raft against the mud
floor.  But it moves.  And the raft goes into deep enough water.

A general sigh of relief as they gently float downstream.


A WIDE AREA OF THE RIVER -

Grant energetically works the oars.

CLOSE ON - Lex lets her hand trail in the water.

                            LEX
          I'll row, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          No.

But he's sweating and takes a moment to rest.  Lex looks down at her
hand in the water.  It still trails.

                            LEX
          Hey, we're still moving.

Grant looks into the water.  She's right.

                            GRANT
          There's a current.

Grant lays back against the rubber gunwales, closes his eyes.  The two
kids look at him.

                            LEX
          You can't sleep.

                            GRANT
              (eyes closed)
          I'm not sl
eeping... yet.

                            LEX
          I'll do it!

Lex picks up the oars and begins.

                            TIMMY
          We gotta warn them about the boat.

Grant opens one eye and looks up at the sun in the sky.  He sighs and
takes up the oars again.  He rows powerfully with the current.


A BEND IN THE RIVER -

Current picks up speed.  The water begins to rush and ROAR.

                            TIMMY
          Cool!

White foam crashes on the raft and sprays the kids.  They burst out
laughing.  Grant smiles at them, but there is concern in his eyes.


ANOTHER BEND -

Now the raft is really racing.  The kids hold on tightly as the raft is
rocked.  White water crashed over, drenching the kids.  When Grant takes
a moment to look, he is soaked by a huge wave.

The raft tosses right and left.  Timmy holds the rubber grips.  He's
yanked to one side.  He's knocked to the raft floor.  Quickly gets his
grip again.  SHOUTS to Grant.

                            TIMMY
          Thought
 is looked calm?

                            GRANT
          Guess I was wrong.

Grant looks ahead.  The river widens.  The raft really starts to fly.

Lex, gripping very tightly, looks out.  Water sprays her again and
again.  Her face is serious.

                            LEX
          I can't swim!

Grant grabs the raft's tie line and pulls it out of its rubber rings.
He lashes it around Lex and Timmy.  Then he ties it around one of the
rubber grips.

                            GRANT
          Hold on real tight.

They go flying down the river.  The ROAR deafens.

The raft lifts out of the water.  And crashes down, rocking every way.

Jagged rocks appear.  Grant uses his paddle as a club to push off the
rocks and the rushing shoreline.  The kids duck from sudden overhanging
trees.

Grant looks ahead.  He blanches.

HIS POV - the surging edge of a tumultuous waterfall.

They're almost there.  At the huge waterfall, water rushes violently,
heaving over the magnificent precipice.

Timmy tries to tighten L
ex's vest but is thrown back down .  He YELLS:

                            TIMMY
          Hold my hand.  Hold my hand when we go.

The raft spins in the rushing water.  Everyone is thrown around.

The rope holding the kids to the raft tautens. The oars are wrestled out
of Grant's hands and go flying through the air, spilling over the edge.

At the last moment, Grant spots a tree branch arching over the cascade.
With all his might, he stands and holds his balance long enough. to let
his hands smash into the overhanging branch.

They stop right at the waterfall's edge.

Grant struggles mightily to hold onto the branch.  But the water keeps
rushing.  His strength ebbs.

                            TIMMY
          Don't let go!

Grant's veins pop out in his arms.  His hands start to slip off the wet
tree bark.  Lex watches his hands slowly lose their grip.

The rubber raft jumps and leaps below him.  Water pours into the raft.
Lex tries fruitlessly to let it out.  Timmy holds down Grant's feet.

               
             TIMMY
          You can do it!

                            GRANT
          I'm trying.  I'm trying ... Ooooo!!! ....

His hands slipping, slipping ...

                            GRANT
          No!!!!!

                                                      CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - The T-Rex, face down in the mud.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Arnold, Wu, Muldoon, and Ellie stare raptly at the monitor.

                            MULDOON
          Son-of-a-bitch.  He's taking a nap.
          Hasn't been this well fed ... ever.

Hammond is above, in his throne.  He calls down:

                            HAMMOND
          Could he drown in that position?  That's
          a very valuable animal.

                            MULDOON
          I know it's a valuable animal.

Muldoon takes a step up toward Hammond's throne and the two argue
quietly back and forth.  In the foreground, Wu calls Arnold over.

                            WU
          What's that, John?

Wu points to the screen behind 
Arnold's head.  In the upper right-hand
corner, it blinks a yellow warning:  AUX PWR LOW!  Ellie regards it.

                            ELLIE
          You running on auxiliary power?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm not.

                            WU
          Looks like you are.

                            ARNOLD
          Can't be.

                            WU
          Print the system status log.

Arnold nods and rapidly strikes keys.  In the corner, a printer whirs to
life.  Moments later, it spins out a single page.  Arnold tears it off.

Ellie continues to stare at the screen.  It now flashes red:  AUX PWR
FAIL!  An alarm klaxon BLARES.

Hammond holds his ears against the noise.  He stands up.

The room lights begin to FLASH.  They're reflected in Hammond's eyes.
Hammond ROARS above the chaos.

                            HAMMOND
          What the hell is going on?

Onscreen, numbers begin to count backward from ten.  Hammond lurches.
At zero, the lights go off, the monitors,
 even the computer.  Just the
alarms keep screaming.

                            HAMMOND
          You're ruining my ordered, precise park!

Arnold ignores him, keeps pressing buttons.  Hammond rushes toward
Arnold.  Arnold looks over his shoulder in surprise.  Hammond SCREAMS.

                            HAMMOND
          Fix my park, Arnold!  Fix it!

Arnold crosses his hands in front of his face, blocking Hammond's
attack.  Hammond grabs Arnold's wrists and the two twirl to the ground.
Breathing heavily, Hammond clutches his hand to his own chest.

Arnold stands up, brushes off.  He puts himself together, looks at
Hammond.  He SHOUTS over the siren:

                            ARNOLD
          I know it's hard, I know it's hard, but
          I'm going to put it all back together for
          you - I promise.  I will


BACK ON RAFT AT WATERFALL -

Grant still clings to the overhanging branch, holding the raft from
toppling over the crashing waterfall.  Lex and Timmy hold onto his legs.

The ROAR of the
 water diminishes.  And the flow subsides from a raging
current to a rolling river.  And then to a gentle stream.  A trickle.
Nothing.

Grant slowly relaxes, lets go.  So do the children.  Around the raft,
the water level begins to drain.  Gradually, Grant and the kids are left
in the raft sitting in just a few puddles of water.  Around them,
various pumps and other equipment is exposed where it was once covered
by rushing white water.

                            LEX
          The waterfall stopped.

                            TIMMY
          Waterfalls aren't supposed to stop.

                            GRANT
          I think they cut the power.  Hey -

He points and the three of them look over the edge where the waterfall
once poured.  There's a shimmering rainbow and beyond that, in the mist
is the visitor's center.

                            GRANT
          Well, there's our pot of gold.  Let's go,
          kids.

They grab his hands and clamber out of the raft, running toward shore.


BACK ON CON
TROL ROOM -

Muldoon pulls open the blinds and the hot sun filters in, so the room is
alternate patches of bright and dark.

In a hot corner, Ellie squats over a prostate Hammond, mopping his brow
with a cool cloth.  He murmurs, only barely intelligible.

                            HAMMOND
          Told him, fix my park, fix my park.

Wu brings the printout to Arnold.  The printout is a chronological
rendering of control room events since the restart.  It is clear they
have been running on auxiliary power.  Wu yells above the alarm:

                            WU
          You shut down as six thirty-four this
          morning, and when you started back up, it
          was with auxiliary power.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus.  The auxiliary generator fires up
          first and then that's used to start the
          main generator because it needs a heavy
          charge.  The main generator has to be
          manually reset.

                            WU
          Outside?  In
 the generator building?

Arnold nods.  Muldoon points to a line in the printout:

06:35:22   WARNING: FENCE STATUS (NB)  OPERATIVE - AUX POWER

                            MULDOON
          This doesn't mean the fences have been
          off since six-thirty, does it?

Arnold grabs the paper, looks at it, slams it down.

                            ARNOLD
          Backup power doesn't generate enough
          amperage to power the electrified fences,
          so they were automatically kept off.
          That's also why we had no phones or
          radio.

                            MULDOON
          All of the fences?

                            ARNOLD
          Yes.

                            MULDOON
          Including the velociraptor mesh?

                            ARNOLD
              (disgusted, exhausted)
          Yes, yes, yes.

In the corner, Hammond lifts his head and Ellie gently helps him to a
sitting position.

                            HAMMOND
          Do you mean those raptor
s could be loose?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm afraid so.

                            MULDOON
          No, no way.  Last time, it took 'em two
          days to chew through that mesh.  But give
          'em enough time, they'll get out.  We
          better get that power on now.

                            HAMMOND
          Regardless, check the pit.  Make sure
          there' five of them there.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - AFTERNOON

Muldoon and Arnold run across the lawn.  Muldoon carries his rocket
launcher at a ready position.  In the distance, the alarm still SOUNDS,
lights FLASH a continued warning.

They reach the maintenance building where the generator is housed.  Its
familiar him has been replaced by its own alarms.  The closer they
approach, the louder and brighter these alarms are.  Grey steam pours
out of the vents of the building, obscuring everything.

                            ARNOLD
          What's that steam coming out of my
          generator room?

           
                 MULDOON
          Relax, it's just refrigerated air.
          There's a leaky cooling pipe.  I fixed it
          a couple times before but the original
          installation was at too sharp an angle.

Arnold accepts this.  He is about to enter when Muldoon instructs him.

                            MULDOON
          Just go and turn on your generator, then
          get right back to the control room.

Arnold lights a cigarette and disappears into the steam-shrouded door.


EXT  RAPTOR PIT - AFTERNOON

Muldoon inspects an extremely discouraging sight.  The thick mesh that
covered the pit has been chewed through and ripped open.  With heavy gun
in one hand, Muldoon shines his flashlight into the pit.  It's empty.

Muldoon looks up.

MULDOON'S POV - the dense forest surrounding the Visitor's Center.

Muldoon examines the ground.  He locates the raptor prints leading away

Muldoon breaks into a run.


INT/EXT  GENERATOR ROOM - AFTERNOON

Muldoon comes back to the generator room still runnin
g full-tilt.  He
kicks open the door.  Steam pours out.  Standing in the thick steam,
Muldoon yells for Arnold.  No answer.  He steps in the doorway and
shines his flashlight around.

MULDOON'S POV - Only the dark abstract shapes of rakes and coiled ropes
and small machinery can be seen in the steam.

Muldoon yells again.  No answer at all.  Muldoon curses and leaves.

As soon as Muldoon is gone, there is movement.  Even above the sirens,
an animalistic breathing, grunting can be heard.  Obscured by steam and
flashing lights, a reptilian claw clutches a shadow.  A pack of
cigarettes falls to the ground, spilling out on the floor.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Muldoon enters and confronts Hammond, Ellie, and Wu,

                            MULDOON
          Raptors chewed their way out.  All five
          are out there.

                            ELLIE
          Arnold's not with you?

Muldoon looks around grimly.  He shakes his head.

                            MULDOON
          I was hoping he was ba
ck here already.

Hammond takes charge.

                            HAMMOND
          This is why my quarters were specially
          fortified.  To assist in an emergency just
          like this one.  Let's go.  Muldoon, round
          up the workers.  They'll go with us too.

Muldoon stares at Hammond, then drops it.  They prepare to go.

                            ELLIE
          Wait.  What about Arnold?


EXT  HILLSIDE, PARK -

Grant and the kids come over the hill.  Timmy sees the big fence and the
Visitor's Center close behind.

                            TIMMY
          We're home!

Lex and Grant happily run down the hill.


EXT  ELECTRIFIED FENCE IN PARK - AFTERNOON

Grant and the kids stand in the long shadows of the electric fence.
This huge fence is much higher than what Timmy has had to climb.  Grant
turns to him apologetically.

                            GRANT
          Sorry, Tim.  We gotta climb up.

                            TIM
          That's all right, Dr. Grant.  You owe me
   
       one.


EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - AFTERNOON

Wu stands at the open sliding gate of the perimeter fence surrounding
Hammond's quarters..  Next to him is Ellie.  Behind both of them,
launcher at the ready, is Muldoon.  Watching from the window above,
Hammond waves.  Ellie and Wu wear radio headsets.

                            MULDOON
          Okay Wu, I'll have you covered at every
          moment.  But this shell carries quite a
          punch, so if you're too close, it'll take
          a piece of you.  Ellie's on the headset
          with you.  If another ones come at you,
          let her know.  Then Ellie - you start
          jumping and yelling.  The buggers are
          easily distracted.  They'll come running
          and let Wu get that power on.  Then both
          of you, get behind this fence as quick as
          possible.

Wu and Ellie nod seriously and test radio contact.  We starts his way
across the lawn, Muldoon limps behind with his launcher.  Ellie stands
ready at the open 
gate.

Wu takes slow steps.  Muldoon follows.  Wu is just five feet away from
the door to the generator building.

CLOSE ON - Wu's tense face.

THE ATTACK is sudden and fierce.  It comes from the brush.  The raptor
leaps onto Wu in an instant.  Wu and the raptor roll on the ground.  Wu
struggles for his life.  Muldoon can't get a safe shot.  He SCREAM:

                            MULDOON
          Wu, get away.  Give me room to shoot.

Ellie comes running away from the safety of the gate.  She jumps up and
down, waving her hands, and SCREAMS:

                            ELLIE
          Hey you cretaceous dromaeosaur, you can't
          catch me.  Hey, come and get me, you
          flat-snouted Mongolian beast.  Hey!

The Raptor is distracted by this.  He lets Wu go for a moment, shaking
him loose from his bloody jaws.  Instantly, Wu rolls away.  Muldoon
fires the rocket launcher.  With a SIZZLE, the missile fires.  BOOM!
Direct hit!  The raptor is blown to tiny pieces.

Muldoon grabs Wu and pulls the inju
red man to safety.

                            MULDOON
          You ok?

In reply Wu gets to his feet, looks where the Raptor was.

                            WU
          Now, there's four.

Muldoon helps Wu back inside the fence.  He waves for Ellie to come in
and join them.

Ellie takes off toward the generator building.  She YELLS:

                            ELLIE
          I'm going in.  Muldoon, cover the door
          after I go in.  Wu, guide me!

Muldoon yells for her to wait but stops when he realizes that this may
be their best plan.

Ellie races like a gazelle across the open lawn.  She's very fast and
graceful.  She ducks into the generator building.

Above it all, Hammond watches at the small viewing window.


BACK ON - GRANT AND KIDS AT FENCE

The three are at the top of the fence now.  Grant carefully lifts Lex
above the barbed wire and she grabs onto the other side of the fence to
begin the climb down.  Grant grabs Tim and lifts him next.  Tim's tense
face is a river of sweat.


INT  GE
NERATOR BUILDING -

Ellie finishes the stairs and feels her way along the basement wall.
Her face is lit by a flashing yellow light.  She bangs her head on a
pipe.  She rubs her head.

                            ELLIE
          Damn, I banged my head.

                            WU (OVER RADIO)
          Oh that's good, that must be the water
          pipe.  You're really close now, there's a
          cabinet just above your head.  Reach up
          and open it.  The handle turns to the
          left.

Ellie turns the handle.  The cabinet opens.

                            WU (OVER RADIO)
          It's a large throw-switch.  Pull it down,
          count to three, and push it back up.
          That's all there is to it.

Ellie throws it down.  She counts:

                            ELLIE
          One -


BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -

Just a few feet from the bottom of the fence.


BACK ON ELLIE -

                            ELLIE
          Two -


BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -

Grant and Timmy jump down. 
 Lex is just behind.  Her sneaker catches in
the fence pattern.  She pulls on it.


BACK ON ELLIE -

                            ELLIE
          Three!

She throws the large switch back.


BACK ON LEX -

She jumps off the fence.  Her sneaker comes off, falls to the ground.

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON LEX - it celebrates her narrow escape.

Grant casually leans against the fence to help Lex with her shoe.
NOTHING!  STILL NO ELECTRIC FENCES!

The Visitor's Center is in sight.  They all turn to each other.  Elated.

                            LEX
          We did it!

                            TIM
          We made it!

Lex jumps up and down.  Grant smiles, high-fives Timmy.


BACK ON ELLIE -

The siren and the flashing lights stop.  The room lights go on.  Ellie
turns to go back upstairs.  Her foot slips, she falls to the ground.
She has slipped on a pool of blood.  She jumps up, recoils.

It's Arnold.  She squelches a SCREAM, covering her own mouth.

SMASH!  Ellie SCREAMS as a raptor lunges at her.   He jumps down
 from
above the water pipe Ellie banged her head on.

Ellie turns and races toward a ventilation shaft.  She dives into it.
The raptor gets there a second late and smashes against the shaft wall.

Ellie pushes herself against the shaft wall and, using her legs to push
against the wall, begins to climb up.

The raptor smashes against the shaft again and gets inside.  Ellie
scrambles up.  The raptor snarls and spits but it is momentarily pinned.

Ellie continues her scramble up the shaft.  At ground level, she slams
her feet hard against a vent, popping it open.  Scraping the wall and
banging against pipes, she races toward the door.


EXT  GENERATOR BUILDING - CONTINUING ACTION

Ellie runs full-tilt toward the fence surrounding Hammond's quarters.
Wu, injured, lies within the safety of the fenced area.  Muldoon stands
with his rocket launcher just outside the fence waiting for Ellie.
Ellie screams to him as she speeds across the lawn.

                            ELLIE
          Raptor!

The raptor EXPLODES th
rough the door of the generator building after
Ellie.

Muldoon fires at the raptor. Misses.  No time to reload.

The raptor gains on Ellie.  Muldoon ducks inside the fence's heavy gate.
He slides the gate half-shut, waving Ellie on.

Ellie dives inside the safety of the fence, losing her headset as she
goes.  The gate is almost closed.  The raptor lunges.

Muldoon slides shut the heavy gate, bashing the raptor's head with all
his might.  The raptor shudders, caught in the gate.  Stunned, for a
second, it doesn't move.

Ellie and Muldoon run to the building.  They push open the steel-clad
security door and dive inside.  Wu limping, chases after them.  With a
curse, Muldoon pushes the door back open, waves for Wu.

ELLIE AND MULDOON'S POV - Wu runs frantically.  The raptor jerks out of
the gate, inside of the fence.  He races after Wu.

                            WU
          Keep it open!  I'm coming!

Wu runs faster.  The raptor gains on him.  Wu screams, runs spastically.
Wu and the raptor are neck-and-neck
, equally close to the open door.

                            ELLIE
          Come on, Wu!  Come on!  Run!

The raptor is inches from Wu.  Both are closer and closer to the door.

                            ELLIE
          They're coming inside!

                            WU
          Help!

Wu and the raptor are at the door.

                            MULDOON
          No they're not, Ellie.

Muldoon slams the door shut on Wu and the raptor.  Wu's screams are
horrific.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - CONTINUING ACTION

Ellie drops to her knees, her chest heaving, pulls her headset off with
a bleeding hand.  Muldoon, affected, turns to her.

                            MULDOON
          I couldn't compromise everyone's safety.

Ellie nods, catches her breath.

                            ELLIE
          Why didn't the power go on?

                            MULDOON
          You just reset the power.  Now the
          computer has to be booted.

Muldoon looks out the tiny barred window of the security do
or.

MULDOON'S POV - There is already almost no sign of Wu.  The gate to the
perimeter fence slides shut.  The raptor looks up.  He is trapped within
the perimeter fence of Hammond's quarters.

CAMERA SLOWLY TILTS to the viewing window above.  Hammond stares down.


INT  VISITOR'S CENTER -

Grant and kids walk through the open security doors.  All is empty and
quiet.  They call out but there are no answers.

                            LEX
          Where did everybody go?

Grant thinks.

                            GRANT
          Probably your grandfather's quarters.
          Let's go.

A DISTANT BELLOW.  Grant reconsiders.

                            GRANT
          Actually, stay here.

He corrals the kids into the half completed enclosure of the Gift Shop.

                            LEX
          No, I want to stay with you.

Grant looks around tensely.

                            GRANT
          No, keep an eye on things round here for
          me.  I'll be back with the others.

                 
           TIMMY
          What about -

Grant looks at Timmy.

                            GRANT
          I'll radio the ship as soon as I find
          somebody.  (beat)  You're in charge now.
          Don't move from here ... unless you have
          to, ok?

Timmy nods.  Lex is happy, sinks to the floor.

                            LEX
          Goody!  I'm gonna rest.

She finds a box of wind-up dinosaur toys. She winds one. Sends it
walking to Timmy.

                            TIMMY
          Tired!  He carried you the whole way.

Grant slips off into the concealing shadows of the skeletal display of
the T-rex and raptor in combat.  He looks back above his own shoulder
into the menacing jaws of the skeletal raptor.  He shouts back.

                            GRANT
          Be right back.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

It's a madhouse in the crowded baronial quarters of Hammond.  Gennaro is
singing at the top of his-lungs while Harding tries to restrain him.
Scared Workers huddle together, many a
re injured.  Hammond sits on the
floor, in a meditative trance.

Ellie and Muldoon stare out the window.

THEIR POV - The raptor is jumping in the air.  With every jump he comes
closer to leaping onto the roof of their small building.

Muldoon regards his rocket launcher ruefully.

                            ELLIE
          Why don't you just nail that bastard?

                            MULDOON
          No more ammo.  I requisitioned six
          charges but the bean-counter -
              (he thrusts a finger at Hammond)
          - cut it down to two.

Ellie looks up to the ceiling.  There is a large glass skylight with
crisscrossing iron bars casting an ominous shadow in the sun.


EXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - DAY

The ship continues along smooth sunlit sea.  Land is in distant sight.


INT  STATEROOM -

The cracked egg is nudged open.  The cute scaly head of a six-inch baby
raptor nuzzles its way out of the shell.  It shakes off a few pieces of
clinging shell and immediately begins to devour one of the
 remaining eggs.

                                                      CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - The wind-up dinosaur skitters across the polished floor.  It
bands against the  the wall again and again.

Timmy looks down at it and smiles at Lex.

                            LEX
          Any candy behind the counter?

                            TIMMY
          Hungry?

                            LEX
          Starved.

Timmy looks behind the counter.  He sees boxes of goods.  He moves a
stack of umbrellas out of his way.  Lex gets up and pulls one out.

                            TIMMY
          Nothing.

                            LEX
          Let's go to the kitchen.

She smiles and pops to her feet.  Timmy's not sure.

                            TIMMY
          Dr. Grant said -

                            LEX
          - let's go.  We'll come right back.

CLOSE ON - Timmy's torn face.  He's hungry, too.

He makes the right decision.

                            TIMMY
          Nope.  We're waiting here t
ill Dr. Grant
          gets back.  He'll help us get some -

Interrupted by A SOUND.  A rhythmic, horrible BREATHING.   Now some
light and rapid STEPS.  And a SNIFFING.  It's definitely an animal.

Lex backs off in a hurry. She knocks the umbrella over.  It skirts
across the floor.  It spins and opens by itself.  Printed on it is the
ferocious face of the Spitter, the sides of its bright poisonous gills
spinning to a stop.

The breathing gets closer and closer.  The children huddle together in a
corner of the gift shop.  They SCREAM.

It's A RAPTOR, lean and ferocious.  More like a cyborg than a hunter, it
studies the kids from just outside the gift shop entrance.  His eyes
flick back and forth between the two pieces of meat.

Timmy grabs the box of toy dinosaurs.  He winds one up and sends it off
across the hall.  The raptor glances over at the moving toy.  Timmy
grabs another, whispers as he winds it.

                            TIMMY
          Start winding now!

Lex and Timmy wind toy after toy, send th
em across the hall.  The raptor
leaps, crushing one in its jaws.  Others waddle by.  The raptor dodges
and darts, grabbing this one, smashing that one.

The kids go running out into the hall.  They race down the Visitor
Center corridor.  Timmy pulls Lex behind him toward the restaurant.

                            LEX
          Where are we going?

                            TIM
          The kitchen!


INT/EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

With a huge leap, the raptor finally makes it to the roof of Hammond's
quarters.  He jumps lightly onto the skylight.  Glass shatters over the
assembled guests and workers below.  Total commotion and SCREAMS.

The raptor immediately begins to gnaw at the iron bars that block the
skylight.  Below, they shake off shards of glass and huddle in the
corners.  Ellie turns to Muldoon.

                            ELLIE
          How long?

                            MULDOON
          Well, they seem to be getting faster all
          the time. I would say - fifteen minutes.

Ellie no
tices something out the window.  It's Grant approaching the
gate.  She hammers on the glass.

Grant's hand reaches for the knob.

The raptor stops gnawing, its ears perked up.

Ellie screams and screams.

Grant notices some of Wu's remains inside the gate.  He stops and looks
up.  At the window, Ellie waves her arms, warning him not to enter.
Grant stops.  He sees Wu's headset on the grass, reaches through the
fence, grabs it, puts it on.

Ellie jumps up and gets her headset.  She barks into it.

                            ELLIE
          There's a raptor on the roof of this
          building.  Open that gate and you're a
          dead man.

Grant stares up at Ellie in the window.  He waves.  She presses her hand
to the glass.

                            GRANT
          Ellie, I'm go glad -

                            ELLIE
          Shut up and listen.  We have about
          fifteen minutes here.  The computer has
          to be rebooted.  That'll turn on the
          electric fences.  Besides the r
aptor
          stuck in here with us, there are four
          more ...

Grant races back to the Visitor's Center as she continues to fill him in.


INT  KITCHEN, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION

The kids hurtle through this huge, industrial kitchen.  The kitchen is a
maze of turns, from the hot lamp pickup area to the rows of stainless
steel burners to the chopping blocks to the potwashing area.  The kids
dart and duck from one area to the next, taking shortcuts under tables,
crawling behind counters, scattering pots and pans behind.

Relentlessly, with a casual speed, the raptor stalks them.  It avoids
their obstacles with a casual grace and when it cannot fit through their
shortcuts, it just continues around.

Timmy pulls open the large silvered door of the freezer.  Lex starts to
hurry inside.  Timmy grabs her.

                            TIMMY
          We'll freeze to death in there.

                            LEX
          He's going to eat us!

Timmy reaches into the freezer and grabs a pile 
of steaks.  He tosses one
toward the raptor.  The raptor gobbles it in one bite.  Timmy shoves Lex
out of the way and begins to toss the steaks on the floor.  One after the
other, he tosses them, in a row, closer and closer to the open freezer.

The raptor mechanically gobbles the steaks, following their path.  He
continues right into the freezer to grab the last of Tim's bait.

Tim leaps and slams the heavy freezer door shut.  Lex comes running and
throws her small weight alongside of Timmy's.

                            TIMMY
          PUSH!

The heave and the lock catches on the door.  From inside, there is a
strangled CRY and the door is slammed repeatedly.  The metal panels of
the door buckle but they do not break.  The door hinges bend and curve
but they do not give.

The kids collapse in relief on the kitchen floor.  In just a moment,
Timmy is back on his feet.

                            LEX
          What is it, Timmy?

                            TIMMY
          I just remembered something.  Rapto
rs are
          born in large litters.  There's probably
          more coming.  We gotta hide.

He grabs her hand and they run out of the back entrance of the kitchen.
There's a stairway and they race up.


INT  GIFT SHOP -

Grant, wearing his headset, calls for the kids and looks around the gift
shop with concern.  He sniffs the air and examines the crushed windup
toys.  He sees some animal scales on the floor.  He hears a NOISE above
and begins to run.


INT  UPPER FLOOR HALLWAY, VISITOR'S CENTER -

The kids hear this NOISE too and it's closer to them.  They bust into -


INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY -

The kids knock over trays of stones as they rush through this room.


INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY -

Automated drills whir as Tim and Lex crash through, knocking equipment
to the ground.  The drills still whir on the ground.


INT  GENETICS ROOM -

The Hamachi-Hood sequencers explode in a heap of punch cards and
magnetic tape as the kids race by.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY -

The kids slide int
o this room.  They race to its far corner, past
incubators and display cases of chemicals.  They look back and see -

KID'S POV - A raptor happily gorging itself on a table of eggs.  He's
been in this room, their place of refuge, the whole time.

CLOSE ON - The raptor's glistening eyes register the children.

He begins to stalk.  The kids SCREAM.  This time there is nowhere to go.

The raptor closes in on the kids.  Timmy feebly stands in front of his
younger sister.

CLOSE ON - The raptor licks its lips, lizard-like.

At the other end of the room, GRANT ENTERS quickly.  He surveys the
situation.  Quickly, he grabs an egg off a table.  He reaches into one
of the chemical cabinets with POISON WARNINGS prominently displayed.  He
comes out with a syringe and a vial.

The raptor is almost on the kids.  Grant coughs conspicuously.  The
raptor whirls, studies Grant.  He looks back at the children.

Grant speaks into the headset.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Talk, Ellie, just keep talking.

He tosses the headset on the ground.  Ellie's voice crackles out.  The
raptor studies it, transfixed.

Grant injects the egg, then gently rolls it on the ground.  The raptor
forgets the headset.  He comes forward and sniffs the egg, then sucks it
up, swallowing it whole.

The raptor turns back to the kids.  He takes two steps toward them,
tenses to pounce - and keels over.  DEAD.

The kids race around the dead raptor to Grant.  Grant grabs his headset
as the three run out of the room.  Grant addresses Timmy as they run.

                            GRANT
          Timmy, you know anything about computers?

                            TIMMY
          Well, I just got an XT at home.  I told
          my Dad I wanted a 386.

                            GRANT
          Ok good, you're elected.


INT  CONTROL ROOM -

Grant and Tim and Lex study the quiet room.  Grant speaks calmly into
his headset.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Okay, we've reached the computer room.
          Who can te
ll Timmy how to reboot?

                            ELLIE (OVER RADIO)
          Ah, Alan, nobody here knows how to boot
          the computer.  Please hurry, we've only
          got a couple minutes left.

                            GRANT
          Tim, you got to book the system.  They
          reset the power and there are no phones.
          We gotta turn on the fences and we gotta
          stop that ship.

                            LEX
          Are they going to be ok?

                            GRANT
          If we can get help very soon.

                            TIMMY
          Sshh, you guys, I'm thinking.

He studies a grid on a large console.  He reaches out and touches a part
of the screen.  There is a beep and a warning sign - INVALID ARGUMENT.
PLEASE TRY AGAIN.


BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

The raptor has chewed almost all the way through the bars.  Panic below.
In the middle of it all, Ellie is focused, listening on her headset.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Timmy tries somethin
g else.  BEEP.  Lex raises a hand.  Grant stops her.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Ellie, we're working as fast as we can
          here.

Timmy tries a screen section.  BEEP.  Again. BEEP.  Again.  BEEP.  BEEP.

Timmy shakes his head.  In desperation he stabs at the keyboard below
the touch screen.  He punches the ESCAPE button.

The screen lights up a new message - SYSTEM RESET COMPLETED.  ALL
SYSTEMS NORMAL.


BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

The raptor has just chewed through.  He squeezes his body into the space
as the bars ELECTRIFY.  Spastically, the raptor jerks back and forth as
the current flows through him.  He can't get out.

Finally, with a WHIMPER, he stops struggling and slides through the
space he created.  With a THUMP, he drops to the floor below.

Ellie, Muldoon, Hammond and the workers look on in shock.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Grant cheers and hugs Timmy.  Lex whoops.

                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)
          Ok, we're all right here for now.
      
    Thanks.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Don't mention it.  It was Timmy.

                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)
          But there's still one more raptor.  So be
          careful.

Timmy is pushing menus and submenus on the touchscreen now.
COMMUNICATIONS - RADIO - VEHICULAR ...  He gets the one he wants.

He indicates the radio-mike to Grant.

                            TIM
          I think this is the boat.  They called it
          the Queen Anne or something.

Grant grabs the mike.

                            GRANT
          Queen Anne, do you read me?  Queen Anne?

The radio crackles to life.

                            RADIO
          This is the Queen Anne B?  I copy.
          What's up?

                            GRANT
          Report your position!

                            RADIO
          Ah, we're just about to dock here in
          Puntaremas.  Who wants to know?  Please
          identify yourself.

Tim punches the screen which displays FARRELL, F
REDERICK D. (CAPT.)
Grant reads it and nods.  His voice is tough as nails.

                            GRANT
          Try this for identification, Captain
          Farrell.  You are in possession of stolen
          biological materials.  If you don't turn
          that boat around and return to Isla
          Nublar immediately with your contraband
          cargo, you will be found in violation of
          Section 509 of the Uniform Maritime Act,
          you will be subject to revocation of
          license, penalties in excess of fifty
          thousand dollars, and five years in jail.
          Do you copy?

SILENCE.

                            GRANT
          Do you copy, Captain Farrell?

                            RADIO
          I copy.  All ahead stern.

A blinking light on a map indicates that the ship is pulling away from
the harbor.  Grant nods to Timmy who terminates the radio contact.

                            TIMMY
          What's the Uniform Maritime Code?

                     
       GRANT
          Who the hell knows?

Grant and Timmy start to celebrate again when Lex interrupts.

                            LEX
          What good does that do?  To have the ship
          turn around?

Grant turns to her seriously.

                            GRANT
          Well it gives us ten more hours.
              (to Timmy)
          Let's see if we can raise the Costa Rican
          Coast Guard on that thing.

The last raptor smashes into the control room through Hammond's viewing
window.  Glass goes flying.  Grant and kids go running into the hallway.


INT ROTUNDA -

With the raptor in hot pursuit, the kids and Grant come flying.  Tim and
Lex jump over the railing, leaping onto the skeletal display.  Grant
goes for the stairs, jumping down them three at a time.

The raptor goes after the kids, scrambling over the balcony onto the
display.  The kids scamper down the display, knocking paint cans and
tools off the scaffolding as they go.  The raptor is just one beat
behind, and his snar
ling face is splashed with red paint as he chases.

The kids burrow into the rib cage of the Rex.  They break off floating
rubs and hurl them back at the raptor.  The raptor is undeterred,
closing the gap on the kids.

The kids are stuck at the end of the rib cage - it's closed off by the
skeleton and they can't break through.  They're imprisoned.  The raptor
is pushing through the rib cage, bones crackling as it goes.

Grant leaps up the scaffolding, grabs a beam, swings his weight onto it,
and slams it into the T-Rex's neck.  The neck shatters and the massive
head of the T-Rex drops free.

It falls directly onto the last raptor, squashing him flat.  Dead.

                            GRANT
              (grimly)
          And then there were none.


EXT  HELICOPTER PAD - DUSK

Muldoon leads his workers onto an army helicopter.  Two workers carry
Gennaro on a stretcher.  Ellie boards with the kids on each side of her,
holding her hands.

Grant and Hammond walk together, toward the helicopter.

              
              HAMMOND
          Dr. Grant, don't abandon this beautiful
          place.  I need a man just like you to
          help me get my park back on its feet
          again.  And it will be on its feet again.

                            GRANT
          We have to leave now.

Hammond stops.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh you don't know.  There are wonderful
          plans in the works, sites already
          purchased for Euro-Jurassic and Jurassic
          Japan.

Grant is unimpressed.  He holds a hand out to Hammond.  Hammond tries a
new approach.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't you see I've exalted human
          potential here?  You must see it.  You
          must feel it.  I called back a life form.
          Listen, Dr. Grant, don't go.  Be a part
          of this.  I'm inviting you to do just
          that - let the others go, if they want.

                            GRANT
          You interrupted natural law.  There are
          regulations,
 rules that nature follows
          that make her knowable.

                            HAMMOND
          You mean there are rules that nature
          follows that create barriers to our
          knowledge.

                            GRANT
          Barriers?  Like the seasons?  The earth
          spinning, orbiting the sun?  The entire
          solar system in interlocking motion.  Our
          own beings in biological step with it
          all.  Mr. Hammond, you've disrupted the
          pattern and look what it's done!

                            HAMMOND
          I know what it's done.  I've made
          triceratops and gallimimus and a T-Rex.
          I've got a batch of iguanadons being born
          on Tuesday.  What do you say to that?

                            GRANT
          Don't count on it.  Now get in.

Grant jumps in the copter, holds out a hand to Hammond.

                            GRANT
          You created mutant forms that you further
          mutated to create amus
ement attractions.
          You made biological puppets with
          heartbeats and an early death sentence.

                            HAMMOND
          I created genetic miracles!

                            GRANT
          You created a park to generate a profit-
          making merchandising operation.

                            HAMMOND
          The merchandise is just a by-product.
          Souvenirs for people to reflect on the
          wonder.  You fainted when you saw the
          brachiosaur.  Alan, look, let's not
          argue.  The problem is that my employees
          were not up to par with my dream.  They
          failed me.  The park, I promise you, is
          safe.  It really is.

Grant grabs Hammond's arm, starts to tug.

                            GRANT
          You park is doomed.  Now come with me.
          
                            HAMMOND
          It is not!  It's blooming!  In the throes
          of labor!  You are one more more negative
          voice in a 
universe of negativity.
          You'll amount to nothing.  You'll be a
          bone-brusher all your life.  I pity you.

Hammond pulls his arm away and strides away from the helicopter just as
the ROTORS START UP.  Hammond's suit whips in the wind.  Grant calls to
him, reaching out his arm.

                            GRANT
          Come back, Mr. Hammond!  It's over!

Hammond keeps walking.  He disappears over a grassy knoll.

Grant's outstretched hand drops to his side when THE ATTACK comes.

With a huge bellow, the T-Rex comes charging at the helicopter.  THE
PILOT screams for all to board as he starts to lift off.

The Rex bites onto the copter skid as the copter tries to escape.  The
copter angles dangerously as the Rex holds on.

Ellie fires a fire-extinguisher into the furious face of the Rex and its
jaws relax.  The copter escapes and starts to climb high into the sky.
The Rex paws after it, then drops down to four legs and gives the copter
a final swipe with its tail.

The tail SWISHES through 
the air and CRACKS against the plexiglass
windshield which fissures and pops.  The pilot struggles to maintain
altitude and manages to keep the craft in the air.

With a ROAR of its own, the copter breaks into the blue sky and soars.
away, leaving an angry T-Rex alone.  Unnoticed by the frustrated Rex,
Hammond slips away and walks into the jungle.


IN THE COPTER -

SLOWLY PAN the exhausted faces of Muldoon and his workers, Lex and Timmy
holding onto each other, and Grant huddles next to Ellie.  He reaches
out and puts an arm around her shoulder.  She reaches up and pulls his
arm close.

                            ELLIE
          They're so beautiful.  They're condemned,
          aren't they?  Even those embryo fragments
          had the same viral contamination.

                            GRANT
          I have a theory.

Ellie looks up in surprise.  She give him a big smile.

                            ELLIE
          You have a theory?

Grant smiles back at her.

                            GRANT
   
       I think that they could never completely          
          isolate the dinosaur DNA.  There was
          always some microscopic mosquito
          contamination.  But at the molecular
          level, that was enough.  Every dinosaur
          received the same genetic massage, the
          encoding that every mosquito gets to
          terminate life after a season.

                            ELLIE
          So the very process itself was flawed.

She's sad.  Grant hugs her.  Over her shoulder he gives a parting glance
to the island.  A green jewel in a blue sea.  Suddenly it is obliterated
by clouds.

CAMERA PANS AWAY AND SWOOPS DOWN from the copter.  IT CROSSES the sky.
THE CAMERA DESCENDS to Isla Nublar, slowly reveling in its natural
beauty and finally coming to earth in the midst of the verdant jungle.


IN THE JUNGLE - MAGIC HOUR

Hammond slowly climbs a steep hill covered with creeping growth.  He
almost reaches the top when he slips.  He falls to the soft ground and
rolls. He tumbles he
lplessly, rolling and spinning down the sharp drop,
finally coming to a complete stop in a shallow pool of water.  Face
down, his head splashes into the puddle.  No movement. Just the sound of
labored breath.

CAMERA PANS to Hammond's hand, half-submerged in water.  CAMERA MOVES
INTO EXTREME CLOSEUP as a mosquito lands on his hand.

                                         RACK OUT AND DISSOLVE TO:


EXT  OCEAN - NIGHT

The army copter circles lower and lower as it finds the Queen Anne B,
slowly drifting across the moonlit water.

shapes and imperfections caught in the glassy stone:  flecks of dirt,
hairs, cracks.  STILL MOVING.  STARBURSTS OF LIGHT ricochet off the
different surfaces of the stones.

CAMERA TURNS along a creamy stretch of amber.  IT TURNS IN DEEPER,
abstracting the picture further only to find A TINY BLUR that suddenly
RACKS INTO FOCUS - a bug, a mosquito lodged within an amber tomb.  It is
folded on its back.

SLOW MOTION
 as the tip of a fine-pointed drill bores into the amber
toward the trapped bug.  Orange flecks fly.  The mosquito trembles.  The
drill continues, stopping just before it touches the tiny body.

A SHINY PAIR of thin needle-nose pliers reach in the borehole and
extricate the mosquito remains.  These are dropped on a brightly lit
glass slide.  A conveyor belt starts, and the slide moves along.
arriving under a long-lensed microscope.

IN MICROSCOPIC PERSPECTIVE, a thin needle pierces the bug and delicately
removes a fragment of tissue.

PINCERS snare the fragment, dropping it into a narrow tube.  The tube
SPINS, faster and faster until it is a BLUR on the screen.

THE SCREEN FLOODS with an INFRA-RED LIGHT.  Gray, oval shapes rock in a
neutral mist.

                                                     WASH OUT TO:

HOT SUN overhead in a BIG SKY -


EXT  BADLANDS - AFTERNOON

Lodged in the cracked earth are the partially-exposed fossilized remains
of A VELOCIRAPTER, a carnivorous dinosaur.  WIDEN OUT to a SWEEPI
NG
PANORAMA of a dinosaur dig, a major excavation filled with workers
shoveling earth and stone, making measurements, taking photographs,
scribbling notes, and conferring with each other.

The center of all this activity is one man.  In a roped-off area that
circumscribes the exposed bones of the raptor, is DR. ALAN GRANT, head
paleontologist.  Good-looking, late 30's, with a think beard.

Grant lies on his belly, completely absorbed in a small piece of bone.
A GROUP OF TWELVE STUDENTS, notebooks in hand, await his next sentence.

CLOSE ON - the tiny bone.  Grant's nose touches it.

Grant brushes the bone with a toothbrush.  Then he decides on a quicker
way to clean it.  He licks it.  Excited by his discovery, he gets to his
feet and addresses his students, who listen raptly.

                            GRANT
          Right calcaneus of an adult female
          raptor.  Mild stress fractures.  What's
          this tell me?

Students look at each other.  A tentative hand.  Grant continues.

               
             GRANT
          It tells me that this bone connects to
          the navicula which we already found
          articulating to the cuboid.

OFFSCREEN, a woman SHOUTS to him.

                            ELLIE (off)
          Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!

Grant looks up.

DR. ELLIE SATTLER, late 20's, sharp-eyed, tough if she wants to be, runs
like a gazelle across the arid land.  Exuberant, she leaves a trail of
dust behind her.

She zips by A STUDENT guarding the cordoned area.  He tries to stop her.

                            STUDENT
          Dr. Sattler!  Dr. Grant is thinking!

Dr. Grant waves her over enthusiastically with his bone and continues.

                            GRANT
          So, what can we stay for sure?  Stress
          fractures in the heel ...

Uncertain students.  Ellie arrives and immediately gets into it.

                            ELLIE
          She jumps.

Grant turns around to her and smiles.  She's got it.  Other students to
- they knew is all along.

            
                GRANT
          Right as rain, Ellie.  Now, why did she
          jump?

No answer.  Ellie gives it a try.

                            ELLIE
          A defensive posture against a vicious,
          blood-thirsty T-Rex?

                            GRANT
              (nodding)
          Perhaps.  Or maybe to select the smaller,
          more tender leaves in the higher branches
          with which to suckle her young?

Ellie jumps up.

                            ELLIE
          I bet is was a mating ritual.

Students laugh.  One student eyes Grant's self-conscious smile at Ellie.

                            GRANT
          The science of paleontology can't answer
          these questions.  Novelists and artists
          who dream a vision of the Jurassic period
          can attempt these questions with their
          imaginations.  What we scientists can say
          is considering the mass and kinetic
          articulation of these bones, this animal
          had a vertical leap
 of about twelve feet.
          Not as entertaining as fiction, but
          absolutely fact without prejudice.

Ellie intrudes again.

                            ELLIE
          Excuse me, Dr. Grant.  But ... fact is,
          we're late.  There's the car.

She points.  On the horizon, a limousine speeds toward them, leaving a
dusty wake.

Grant sets the rules for his departure, giving instructions individually
as Ellie pulls him away, carrying their bags.

                            GRANT
          Jim, you keep making up the plaster
          batches.  Whatever ratio you're using,
          it's perfect.  Nora, no digging after
          five - when the temperature drops, those
          bones are just too brittle.  Bill, I
          don't want any tourists walking over my
          raptor - I don't care if the Governor of
          Montana is with them, just you guys.

Grant and Ellie continue walking.  She interrupts his continued barrage.

                            ELLIE
          You know, if ev
ery scientist stuck to his
          method like you, there would be no body
          of theory - no quasars, no big bang -

Grant stops at the sight of the stopped limo and freezes.

                            GRANT
          Jesus, a limousine.  We're re-entering
          Hammond's world, that's for sure.  (beat)
          Remind me why we're doing this, Ellie.

Ellie is gentle.  She's telling him something they've discussed before.

                            ELLIE
          We're leaving the raptor dig -

                            GRANT
          - at a critical time -

                            ELLIE
          - because Gennaro is paying us sixty
          thousand dollars to observe some resort
          of Hammond's in Costa Rica. And that's -

                            GRANT
          - enough money to keep us free of
          commercial affiliations for two summers.
          All right, all right.  Good.

Then, half-kidding with Ellie:

                            GRANT
          Financial
 independence for fraternizing
          with the enemy?  (beat)  I'll do it.

She laughs.  But he can't quite leave.  He grabs a computer printout

                            GRANT
          This is all could come up with, Skip?

Skip turns the printout right-side up in Grant's hand.  Grant smiles.

                            GRANT
          Wise guy.  Let's go, Ellie.

Grant and Ellie board the limo amidst many goodbyes from the students.
The limo pulls away.


EXT  HIGH TECH BUILDING - BIOGENETIC CORPORATION HQ - SUNSET

A purple sunset irradiates the exterior glass walls of the building.


INT  BIOGEN HQ

A peanut flies in the air.  Then falls into a big open mouth.  THOMP.

                            MOUTH
          Five hundred thousand is peanuts!

He tosses another peanut and misses his open mouth.  This is DENNIS
NEDRY, a 40 year old computer programmer.  He's fat, with greasy hair
and a permanently wrinkled suit.  His slovenly looks are wildly out of
place on the rich leather sofa where he reclin
es.

Across a gleaming granite coffee table is BILL BAKER, businessman.  A
smooth meticulous dresser, Baker is disgusted by Nedry's sloppy
appearance and voracious consumption of food and drink.

Nedry finishes a coke.  Over his shoulder is an impressive skyline view.

                            NEDRY
          I'm not reneging.  I'm re-evaluating.

Nedry holds the can of coke upside-down, drains the last drops.

                            NEDRY
          You think I'm a scumbag, I know.

Nedry chuckles, lines up three peanuts on the table.  One after the
other, he throws them in the air.  He gulps down two, misses one. It
skids across the glossy floor.

Baker's head involuntarily cocks as he looks disgustedly at Nedry.

                            NEDRY
          Look pal, you make a career in biogenetic
          industrial espionage, and you're bound to
          run across a scumbag or two.  Guaranteed!
          Part of the job description.  Look, who's
          to say, who is the real scumbag?  After
          all, I know what you guys need so bad.
          I've heard of reverse engineering.

As Nedry continues he shovels nuts into his mouth and CHOMPS and SPEAKS.

                            NEDRY
          Let the other guy put in all the work,
          all the R and D.  You take the finished
          product, work backwards, breaking it down
          to reveal its genetic code.  Presto!  In
          a few measly months you have know-how
          that took researchers ten years to
          determine.  You know how much Hammond has
          invested of his own personal wealth?
          Over five billion dollars!  And if you
          guys get the jump on his - in no time,
          the market's wide-open.

Nedry starts the LAUGH as he EATS and TALKS.

                            NEDRY
          But, boy, he's really got his product!
          Oh yes siree, massive, gargantuan, money-
          making, never-heard-of-profit-like-that
          product.  It is a sight!  Yes, indeedy!

Nedry LAUGH
S explosively.  He begins to choke, COUGHING and GASPING.

Baker is repulsed.  He stares out the window as the sun sets.

Nedry, in true distress, clutches his own throat.  He clumsily runs
toward Baker, toppling chairs as he goes.  Nedry grabs Baker's hand and
squeezes it tightly, imploring Baker for help.  Baker coolly shakes his
hand loose and shoves Nedry to the floor.  Baker looks down at the prone
and desperate Nedry.

                            BAKER
          Scumbag.  We have a deal.  That deal is
          not open to renegotiation.  Or even re-
          evaluation.

Bakers kneels down next to Nedry, who is beginning to turn blue.

                            BAKER
          The deal stands.  Take it or leave it.

Baker glances at his watch.

                            BAKER
          I'll give you a few minutes to decide.

Nedry makes a superhuman effort just to nod his head.  Baker nods back
and SLAMS his fist into Nedry's solar plexus.  It works.

Nedry sucks in a huge gulp of air.  He sits up
, rubbing his belly.  As
Baker leaves the room:

                            BAKER
          Make sure the eggs are on that supply
          ship.  Just make sure!

CAMERA LEAVES NEDRY and exits the window.    IT SWISHPANS the concrete
canyons of Wall Street and enters another office.


INT  CONSERVATIVE LAW OFFICE - DAY

DONALD GENNARO, handsome,  meticulously dressed, paces the highly
polished, glassy corner suite.  His boss, ROSS, is seated.  He's a
powerful black man who waves a prosthetic arm.

                            ROSS
          We can't trust Hammond anymore.  He's
          under too much pressure.  There's the
          EPA, he's behind schedule, and the in-
          vestors are getting nervous.  There have
          been too many rumors, too many accidents.
          We can't screw around with this.

                            GENNARO
          I've asked Hammond to arrange independent
          site inspections every week for the next
          three weeks.

                            ROS
S
          What does he say?

                            GENNARO
          Insists nothing's wrong on the island.

                            ROSS
          You know him.  Do you believe him?

                             GENNARO
          No, I don't.  I spent a lot of time with
          him five years ago when we raised the
          capital.  And it was a wild ride.  He's
          unpredictable, a dreamer.

                            ROSS
          Potentially dangerous.  We should never
          have gotten involved.  What's our position?

                            GENNARO
          The firm owns five percent.

                            ROSS
          General or limited?

                            GENNARO
          General.

                            ROSS
          We should have never done that.

                            GENNARO
          It seemed wise at the time.  We all
          wanted the park to happen.  It was in
          lieu of fees.

                            ROSS
        
  In any case, I agree an inspection is
          overdue.  Who are your site experts?

Gennaro tosses a list on Ross' desk.  He check it out.

                            ROSS
          Will they tell the truth?

                            GENNARO
          I think so.  That guy Grant's a hotshot
          in his field, always goes his own way -

                            ROSS
          - Good.  You're making all the arrangements?

                            GENNARO
          Hammond asked to place the calls himself.
          I think he wants to pretend the park is
          not in trouble.  That it's just a social
          invitation, showing off the island.

                            ROSS
          All right ... Good.  But let's be very
          clear about one thing.  I don't know how
          bad this situation actually is, Donald.
          But if there's a problem on that island -
          don't be afraid to screw Hammond and burn
          Jurassic Park to the ground.

Gennaro shakes hands 
awkwardly with Ross and leaves.  Ross paces.  Fed-
up, he whispers to himself.

                            ROSS
          Costa Rica, my ass.

He whacks his desk globe, sends its spinning.

CAMERA MOVES IN on spinning globe as we HEAR the ROTOR BLADES of a
helicopter and DISSOLVE TO:


INT/EXT  HELICOPTER IN SKY - DAWN

On the helicopter tail is a little blue logo that reads: Isla Nublar.

INSIDE, Grant, Ellie and Gennaro are in the right back row.  Ellie
dozes, her head occasionally dropping onto Grant's shoulder, to his
discomfort.  Gennaro looks at papers, trying not to look through the
clear plexi-bubble at their feet.  Next to THE PILOT, Nedry chews a
candy bar.  He offers candy to the back row.

Grant loses himself, looking out the window.

GRANT'S POV - the aquamarine blue of the ocean.  Below the waters there
are the shadows of ample marine life.  Dolphins leap in the air.
Suddenly the clear scene becomes obscured by clouds.

There is turbulence.  Ellie wakes, glances at Grant, then out the
window.  
There is mist and she absently traces her finger in it, shaping
a dinosaur figure.  Now land comes into view and for a moment, the
island below them eerily fits right into her doodling.

                            PILOT
          That's Isla Nublar.  Buckle up, the
          descent is a little hairy.

Gennaro cinches his belt tightly and half-shuts his eyes.  Nedry takes
out a sandwich and cockily loosens his belt.  Ellie looks every way.

                            ELLIE
          This is exciting!

                            GRANT
          What is, Ellie?  Where are we going?

Grant looks out his window. The helicopter rushes forward, low to the
water.  Ahead, Grant sees the island, rugged and craggy, rising sharply

                            GRANT
          Looks like Alcatraz.

The pilot coughs and rubs his goggles with the back of his hand.

                            PILOT
          There's bad wind shear on this peak.

Grant nods.  Gennaro sweats, watching the pilot tighten his own belt.

Ellie
 smiles excitedly as the helicopter starts down.  Now, A BLANKET
FOG.  Grant can't see a thing out his window.  Ellie's startled.

                            ELLIE
          How the hell is he landing this thing?

No answer.  Grant dimly discerns green branches of pine trees through
the mist.  Some are very close.  Ellie's hands grasps her seat cushion.

                            ELLIE
          This is not fun.

Grant looks through the plexi-bubble at his feet.  He sees the giant
glowing fluorescent cross below.  Lights FLASH at corners of the cross.

                            GRANT
          Relax, Ellie.  I'm sure they wouldn't
          land if it weren't safe.

The copter suddenly SHAKES violently.  Ellie grabs Grant's hand.
Gennaro sits straight up, eyes squeezed shut.

                            GRANT
          Gennaro?  This guy knows what he's doing,
          Right?  Hey, Gennaro?  I'm talking to you!

Another violent shake.  Grant squeezes Ellie's hand back.

CLOSEUP - Nedry's hand crushes a 
packet of crackers.

Gennaro is soaked.  He opens one eye and looks about, very frightened.
He speaks a mantra.

                            GENNARO
          No problem.  Relax, relax.

The pilot whispers to himself and corrects slightly.  The copter sails
sharply the other way.

                            GRANT AND ELLIE
          Whoa!!!!

CLOSE ON - the pilot jerks back the stick.

THE COPTER zooms upward.  Grant's beverage flips to the ground, pours
across the floor.

Nedry's lunch does flying.  Sandwich, candy, and cracker crumbs hang
suspended in the air.  Now it all FREE-FALLS onto Nedry's lap.

Grant and Ellie lean tightly into each other,

                            ELLIE
          I don't like this feeling ...

The pilot swings his gaze, left then right, looking at the pine forest.
Trees are close, then far, then close.  The helicopter drops rapidly.
Ellie and Grant shut their eyes.  They brace themselves for the worst.

IN AND OUT OF THE MIST, the copter descends.  Tail raised high, nose
low, fo
r a moment it looks like a strange bug-eyes prehistoric animal
bucking in its pen.  In a flash, it corrects itself.  The copter touches
down on a heli-pad.  The SOUND of the rotors fades and dies.

For a second, no one moves.  Grant lets out a great sigh of relief.
Gennaro mouths a silent prayer.  The pilot stretches his fingers.

Grant and Ellie self-consciously shake their hands free of each other.
Nedry unbuckles and laughs as he brushes off his lap.  He turns:

                            NEDRY
          Just think, Gennaro -
              (laughs harder)
          - you gotta agree it's funny!  These two,
          they dig up dinosaurs!  It's wonderful,
          isn't it?

Nedry pats Grant on his shoulder.

                            NEDRY
          Dr. Bones, you're going to love this place.

Nedry bursts out laughing again as he heads out the helicopter door.

A smile comes across Gennaro's face.  As he smiles he motions with his
hands he doesn't mean any harm.  Grant and Ellie stare at him.

      
                      PILOT
          Come on folks.  Gotta get back, there's a
          storm alert.

ROTORS TURN.  OUTSIDE, a man reaches the copter.  He wears a baseball
cap over short red hair and he's dressed in phony safari garb.  He
shakes Gennaro's hand.  This is ED REGIS, 35, head of Public Relations.
He throws open the copter door next to Grant.  Big, cheerful smile.

                            REGIS
          Hi!  Ed Regis.  Real big welcome to Isla
          Nublar, Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler.  Little
          tough landing here, I know.  But you did
          it!  Come on down, we're so happy to have
          you.  Now, watch your step.

Ellie and Grant jump into the world of Jurassic Park.


EXT  LUSH TROPICAL FOREST - MORNING

Grant takes in the beautiful tropical terrain.  This place is the
opposite of the Badlands.  There is elaborate planting everywhere:
huge, hairy ferns; exotic, spiked flowers; berries of every color;
rushing vines.  Peeking through the thick greenery are beautiful birds
a
nd flying squirrels.  The strange, prehistoric world impresses Grant
and Ellie.  Even Nedry and Gennaro take in the vegetal wonder.

Then, the SOUND of men working, grunting from exertion.  Ahead, Muldoon
directs A GROUP OF WORKMEN.  Flame-throwers roar and machetes fight back
the abundant foliage.  As they attack a new area, Regis waves Muldoon
over.  Muldoon has a pronounced limp as he walks over to join them.

                            ED REGIS
          This is Robert Muldoon, great African big
          game hunter.  And he's working for us now.
          Doing a bang-up job, too.

Muldoon rests his rifle by a tree stump and shakes with Grant and Ellie.

                            MULDOON
          Ed's a little more BS than PR.  Mr.
          Gennaro, nice to have you back.

Gennaro nods warmly as Muldoon limps back to work.

Regis leads on, taking Gennaro's arm and talking to him like and old
friend.  Nedry lumbers in the middle, alone.  At the rear, Grant and
Ellie study everything they see.  Grant
 calls to Regis but is ignored.

                            GRANT
          Mr. Regis, what is the nature of this park?

Ellie looks behind and sees cramped ferns spring out to capture the path
they just walked on.  She nudges Grant, who has seen the same.

                            ELLIE
          Aggressive growth, huh?

                            GRANT
          Hammond's trademark.

A distinct HOOTING in the distance.  Then a loud TRUMPETING.  Grant and
Ellie stop.  Nedry doesn't look up.  Regis flashes his salesman's smile.

                            REGIS
          Out animals are greeting you!

They pass a crude sign nailed to a tree:  Welcome to Jurassic Park.
Grant cringes at the sign.  Ellie nudges him to loosen up.

                            GRANT
          I hope this isn't one of those animatronic
          exhibits in a Jurassic botanical setting.

                            NEDRY
          Nope.

Gennaro wipes his brow.  They enter a green tunnel of over-arching palm
that leads to the 
VISITOR'S CENTER, a modern complex in the distance.

Ellie notices a large fence hidden in the brush.  She nudges Grant.

THEIR POV - CAMERA SLOWLY CLIMBS a fifteen foot high chain-link fence.
The needle-spiked top of this fence cuts deep into the brush.

This fence is only the prelude.

Sprawling massively above and behind it is a thirty foot high fence.
Woven throughout the fence's mesh is an intricate system of electrical
wire.  There is a prominent warning:  DANGER!  ELECTRIC FENCE: TEN
THOUSAND VOLTS - KEEP OFF!

CAMERA KEEPS CLIMBING to the top:  ominous barbed wire, curled into the
highest growth with coiled razors glistening in the sun.

Grant strains to understand.  The quickens his steps to catch the others.

They reach a clearing with an unfinished brick sidewalk and potted shade
trees waiting for planting.  A crosshatching of tiny lizards scamper off
the walk.  An empty swimming pool is being filled by A MAN with a pumper
truck.  Next to him, WORKERS water the large ferns.

                       
     REGIS
          I hope you brought your bathing suits!
          Doesn't this mist and these plants really
          create a bonafide prehistoric feeling?

Regis points to a low building with glass pyramids on the roof.

                            REGIS
          There's the Visitor's Center.

A CRANE lowers an iron grating on top of one pyramid.  An animal TRUMPETS.


INT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

CLOSE ON - the iron security grating as it fits over a glass skylight.
Above, MASKED WORKERS weld it on.  Sparks fly.

Grant stares up at it, thinking.  Footsteps echo behind him as Regis,
Ellie, Gennaro, and Nedry look around the unfinished building.

The Visitor's Center is two stories high, a lot of glass with exposed
girders and supports.  It's incomplete:  vines swing in the breeze where
the back wall will go and undressed cables litter the floor.  Even so,
exhibit areas are in varying stages of completion.  Behind, SEVERAL
SPANISH WORKERS unpack masonry supplies.

                            GRANT
     
     Where's Hammond?

                            REGIS
          Mr. Hammond is dying to see you guys.

Grant strides over to an exhibit as Gennaro paces impatiently.

                            GENNARO
          Hot, hot, hot.  Ten billion bucks and the
          air conditioning sucks.

Regis smiles apologetically and pushes open a large window on one of the
finished walls.  Giant leaves and vines burst inside.

Grant studies an exhibit in progress entitled When Dinosaurs Rules the
World.  This is a large clock that presents millions of years as hours
in a single day.  Many brightly colored hours are allocated to the
dinosaurs.  Man receives the last second of the day.  Ellie joins Grant.

                            ELLIE
          The audicity of man to get here at the
          last second and think he runs the show.

Grant smiles at her inexhaustible enthusiasm.  He looks at a painted
mural of a Raptor on one of the walls in the half-completed gift shop.

Nedry is at a coke machine, feeding in change
.  It doesn't work.  He
SLAMS his hand against it, and finally, a cup drops down the chute.
Upside-down.  It pours.  Coke splashes Nedry.  He curses and exits.

THE ROTUNDA - Ellie pulls Grant over to a raised, round display with a
catwalk.  In this unfinished display, a skeletal T-Rex and a Raptor are
locked in combat.  Scaffolding is up around it, and painting supplies
are scattered all around.

Regis glances at his watch, looks up, and smiles.

At that moment, doors adjacent to the rotunda swing open automatically.
A soothing female voice comes out of the public address system.

                            VOICE (ON P.A.)
          Please come to the theater.  In a moment,
          our film will begin.

The voice goes on to give this information in a number of languages.
Regis waves everyone into the theater.   Nedry doesn't join them.  He
climbs the stairs to the second floor.


INT  SCREENING ROOM - DAY

Small and plush.  Regis sits in the front, full of enthusiasm.  Grant and
Ellie sit further behind. 
 Gennaro stands in the back and smokes.

CELESTIAL MUSIC fills the room.  Mist covers and curls on the stage
floor.  Colored spotlights illuminate the mist in an eerie fashion.
overall effect is the touristy Where's NY? high-gloss production.

years young, with a glint in his eye and very comfortable with his own
effect.  He wears a white linen suit with a red rose in the breast
pocket.  Like an elder Carl Sagan, he addresses the group.

                            HAMMOND
          Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome
          to an ancient and mysterious world, a
          world long before humankind inhabited it
          with all out remarkable dreams and
          questions.  Enter a world that existed
          one hundred million years ago.  When our
          changing earth was the abode of
          magnificent creations.

          Today, the late twentieth century has
          witnessed a scientific gold rush of
          astonishing proportions:  the headlong
          and furious haste to un
ravel the mystery
          of genetic engineering has become more
          than just a subject for science fiction
          writers.

ON GRANT - he whispers to Ellie.

                            GRANT
          - the furious haste to commercialize
          genetic engineering.

BACK ON HAMMOND - he warms to his subject.

                            HAMMOND
          Biotechnology promises the greatest
          revolution in human history.  It will
          outdistance atomic power and computers in
          its effects on our everyday lives.  We'll
          see square trees for easy lumbering and
          white trout for super visibility to
          fisherman.  Why it will transform every
          aspect of human life: out medical care,
          our food, our health, even our very
          entertainment.

ON GRANT - confirmed in his thinking, he whispers again.

                            GRANT
          Here we go.

BACK ON HAMMOND - he concludes.

                            HAMMOND
          
Nothing will ever be the same again.
          It's literally going to change the face
          of our planet as we know it.


MUSIC SOARS.  Hammond smiles appreciatively, removes his rose.  A screen
descends behind him.

                            HAMMOND
          ... Jurassic Park.  What we do here is
          made possible through the miracle of DNA
          replication, commonly known as cloning.
          To explain what cloning means, I'm going
          to need my own clone - John Hammond.

Another Hammond appears, projected on the screen beside the real one.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Hi, John!

                            HAMMOND
          Hi, John.

IN THE AUDIENCE - Ellie laughs aloud.  Grant, shaking his head, smiles.

BACK ON HAMMOND - The original speaks to the clone.

                            HAMMOND
          Okay John, hold out your finger.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Why?

                            HAMMOND
          I need some of your
 genetic material.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Now just a minute here, John.

                            HAMMOND
          Your genetic material is the same in
          every cell of your body.  You have a
          hundred billion cells.  You won't miss a
          couple.

Hammond holds his rose to the screen the pricks his clone's finger with
a thorn.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          OW!!!  That hurt!  Hey, what's -

The clone dissolves into a cascade of blood as WE SEE a magnified view
of the bloodstream.  ANIMATION begins which illuminates the parts of the
blood and its actions.  Hammond provides voiceover for the visuals.

                            HAMMOND
          John, let's look into your blood, the
          river of life.  There's your white cells,
          exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily
          wastes.  And there's a mighty nucleus,
          the heart and brain of a cell.  This
          nucleus has an amazing property.  It can
          sp
lit in half and reproduce itself.
          That's how it grows.  And then those two
          can do it again.  And again.  Making copy
          after copy of itself.

Back to the two Hammond's.  Joined by a third, then a fourth, and so on
until the screen is crammed with Hammond's, elbowing each other for room.

                            NEW HAMMOND'S
          Hi, I'm John Hammond.  Hey, I'm John
          Hammond.  No, I am.  I am.

                            HAMMOND
          Come on, that's enough of this!  And I
          thought to reproduce myself I had to do it
          the old-fashioned way.

New mist fades out this show.  The lights go up.  Regis applauds.  Grant
joins in the laughter with Ellie and Gennaro.

Hammond jumps down from the stage and greets Gennaro and Regis.

                            HAMMOND
          That's all we've got so far.  A lot of
          fun, isn't it, Mr. Gennaro?

                            REGIS
          You bet!

Hammond greets Grant and Ellie warmly.  Then 
Hammond baits Grant.

                            HAMMOND
          It's been a long time, Alan.  I know the
          preceding was not your sort of enter-
          tainment.  Popular science -

                            GRANT
          No, I don't mind popular science.  I dislike
          the commercialization of science.  It breeds
          a sloppiness, a disregard for method.

                            HAMMOND
          Well, I don't disregard method.  But think
          of mutation - which is nothing more than
          sloppy communication on the cellular
          level.  Think how triumphant mutations
          have been in natural selection.

          Oh, but I know what you're saying.  It's
          true that I have never been afraid to make
          money with science.  I've always
          considered profit to be a measure of
          success, a barometer of public reaction.

                            GRANT
          Mr. Hammond, the essential truth of a
          scientific law ha
s nothing to do with
          public reaction.  Water freezes at
          thirty-two degrees, whether you pay for
          it or not.

Hammond turns to Gennaro.  Gennaro smiles nervously at their clash.

                            HAMMOND
          Donald, in bringing my old friend, Alan
          Grant, you've brought an excellent critic
          to observe the viability of my island and
          out venture.  I look forward to winning
          you over, Dr. Grant.

                            ELLIE
          Just what is it you're trying to clone?


EXT  A SPRAWLING LAWN - DAY

Outside, Hammond leads Gennaro, Grant and Ellie.  He points out the
staff living quarters, a group of graceful teepees.  Next to their
homes, WORKERS hang laundry and cook on grills.

They pass a large Mechanical Building.  The generator housed within is
very LOUD.  The wind increases, rippling clothes.

Suddenly, the SOUND of a speeding jeep.  Grant turns.

Racing across the rolling green landscape is A RED JEEP.  Muldoon is 
at
the steering wheel.  Two kids bounce happily around in the open jeep.
They are TIMMY, 9, and LEX, 6, brother and sister.  The jeep stops.

                            LEX
          Grandpa!

Hammond looks up, delighted.  Arms open.  Gennaro pulls him close.

                            GENNARO
              (incredulous)
          Mr. Hammond, this is a serious investiga-
          tion of the island, not a weekend
          excursion or a social outing.  We're
          talking about the safety of this place!

Hammond waves to the children.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm aware of that.  But I built this
          place for children.  You can't
          investigate it without their reactions.
          They're what this place is all about.

Hammond beams to Grant and Ellie and indicates the running kids.

                            HAMMOND
          My grandchildren.  Genetics were kind.
          They're more like my ex-wife than me.

Lex jumps right into her Grandpa's arms.  Timmy s
hyly walks up and
embraces him.  Hammond shines.  Gennaro holds in his fury.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY

Hammond ushers his guests into his own richly appointed baronial suite.
Ellie looks out a small window at the tee-pees and the contrasting
lifestyle below.  She then focuses on the high fence, circling the
perimeter of Hammond's quarters.  Above is a skylight, with metal bars.

Grant whispers to her, indicating the obviously modified window frame.

                            GRANT
          Who makes a windows ... smaller?

Timmy smacks him forehead, points to Grant.

                            TIMMY
          I know you.  You wrote my book.  Lost
          World of The Dinosaurs.  It's awesome.

                            LEX
          Timmy's got dinosaurs on the brain.

                            GRANT
          Don't worry - he'll grow out of it.

                            ELLIE
          Dr. Grant's embarrassed that his book was
          so widely successful.  He wrote if for
          gra
duate students.

Hammond smiles intensely.  But he's patient.  He stands be a huge table
covered with a sumptuous velvet drape.

                            HAMMOND
          Although Dr. Grant suspects otherwise,
          this is not an ill-conceived, half-baked,
          poorly funded plan that I've headed.
          This is a plan to which I committed all
          of my personal resources, literally
          billions of dollars.  And Donald Gennaro
          here has kindly helped me raise that sum
          again from wealthy Japanese.  They love
          theme parks.  I have recruited pre-
          eminent scientific minds from hallowed
          universities and we've taken the time to
          do things right.

Lex peeks under the cloth.  Hammond smiles at her and recovers the table.

                            HAMMOND
          Jurassic Park is the most advanced
          amusement park in the world.  We work
          with genetics - life's essential building
          blocks - to create new 
worlds.  I set out
          to make biological attractions.  Living
          attractions.  Attractions so astonishing
          that they'd capture the imagination of
          the entire world.

                            GRANT
          What exactly do you mean ... biological
          attractions?

                            HAMMOND
          As you well know, long ago, creatures ten
          times larger than whales roamed our
          adolescent Earth.  And then mass,
          mysterious extinction created a time
          barrier unscalable until ... now.

BEAT.

                            GRANT
          Yes?

                            HAMMOND
          Dinosaurs.
              (superbly proud)
          I've been cloning dinosaurs!

CAMERA PUSHES IN on Grant's incredulous face.

Hammond whips off the drape, revealing a complex and detailed scale
model of the entire resort.

                            HAMMOND
          Ladies and Gentlemen, Jurassic Park.  Not
          a resort, not a scien
tific conservatory,
          just a little piece of pre-history that
          every child in the whole wide world will
          insist on visiting.

Hammond grins with delight.

                            GENNARO
          At least every rich child.

Grant and Ellie come forward to examine the model.  The kids crowd in.

CAMERA SNORKELS through the model - revealing different enclosures with
miniature dinosaurs, moats, fences, roads, a river.

                            HAMMOND
          Apatosaurs in the lowland.  Gallimimus in
          the grassy plain.  Dilophosaurus above
          the river.  The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex!
          238 fabulous creatures so far!

                            TIMMY
          Real dinosaurs, Grandpa?  Don't they want
          to just kill each other?

Hammond excitedly punches a button - colored display grids light up.

                            HAMMOND
          Timmy, there's electric fences and moats
          and video surveillance at all times.
          There
 are monitors every hundred feet
          whatever we could plant them on the
          island.  A computer to tabulate it all.

                            ELLIE
          You created dinosaurs?  Who gave you the
          right to do that?

                            HAMMOND
          I didn't create them.  I found a way to
          wake them up, to stir them out of their
          prehistoric slumber.

                            GRANT
          We don't have the science.  There's no
          source of dinosaur DNA.

Hammond's proud, excited face shifts to one that divulges modestly.

                            HAMMOND
          Yes ... there is.


INT  HALLWAY, UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

Hammond leads Grant, Ellie, Gennaro, Timmy, and Lex out of an elevator
and down an endless corridor.  A WORKMAN ON CRUTCHES passes them.

They go through a series of security doors.  To get them open, Hammond
places his palm on a screen before each door.  Each time, it lights up
with an x-ray-like image of 
his hand and each door HISSES open.

CLOSEUP - Security x-ray. of Hammond's hand.  BEEP.  A red line writes
through the screen.  Can't get in.  Complaining, under his breath:

                            HAMMOND
          Glitches.

Hammond tries again.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - DAY

The door HISSES open, revealing an elaborate technology-crammed room.
In dim light, clusters of computer consoles and video monitors glow.

Nedry sits in a corner at a keyboard with a pile of papers next to him,
typing away.  JOHN ARNOLD, 45, park supervisor, sits directing the
activities of the park and chain-smoking.  There are large windows
looking out to the park, one of which is cracked and being replaced from
the outside by a TEAM OF WORKMEN.

Hammond wears a big smile as he leads in his entourage.  He's the
ringmaster.

                            HAMMOND
          And this is the right side of my brain.
          The entire park is safely controlled from
          here.  John Arnold, that genius over
          there, is the m
aster control operator.
              (with genuine concern)
          John, don't smoke so much, you're far too
          valuable a man to me.

                            ARNOLD
          Oh, you'd survive just fine without me.

Arnold exhales smoke and waves good-naturedly.  Nedry stares darkly at
Hammond, who ignores him.

                            HAMMOND
          Everything's controlled from here.
          Remote everything. Cars, feeding
          programs, medicine dispensers, fecal
          clean up - and that can be tons in a park
          like this.  We run this place with twenty
          workers.  This computer does it all.  And
          it polices each and every single animal
          out there.

                            ELLIE
              (whispers to Grant)
          Who polices the computer?

Hammond points up.  Overlooking the control room and the park is a
raised platform with a huge chair, like a throne in a court.  A large
video screen faces this chair.

                     
       HAMMOND
          That's where I will watch the astonished
          watchers.  Okay, let's go.

They practically race as a group to keep up with Hammond.  The security
door seals shit, leaving Nedry and Arnold alone again.

                            NEDRY
          Thanks for the kind word, Mr. Hammond.

                            ARNOLD
          Come on, Dennis, he knows your technical
          contributions have made it all possible.

                            NEDRY
          Right.


BACK ON HALLWAY -

Hammond and his group turn off the corridor and reach a door marked:
CAUTION: Teratogenic Substances.  Timmy backs off, grabs Lex's arm.

                            TIMMY
          That stuff turns you into a mutant!

He contorts his face into strange shapes.  As Hammond leads them all in
Lex pulls on his pocket.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't mind the signs.  They're only legal
          precautions.

Gennaro frowns.  The door opens and Lex peeks in.

                  
          HAMMOND
          My laboratory, Lex.  It will be yours and
          Timmy's someday.


INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY - CONTINUING ACTION

Grant and Ellie share a baffled look.  Grant stares.

Grant's POV - PAN ACROSS a room filled with honey-colored glowing stones
arranged on glass shelves in large pull-out trays.  Each stone is tagged
and numbered.

Grant leans down, studying the stones.  He bumps right into Gennaro.
Lex jumps excitedly.

                            LEX
          It's ... gold!

                            TIMMY
          It's amber.  Fossilized tree sap.

                            LEX
          Grandpa found gold.

Grant shushes the kids and looks to Hammond.

                            HAMMOND
          You're both right.  Amber is our gold.
          The alpha or our alchemic alphabet.  The
          precious course of our genetic material.
          You already know amber is the fossilized
          resin of prehistoric tree sap, of course.

Grant and Ellie nod impatiently. 
 Hammond sets the scene.

                            HAMMOND
          Imagine - millions of years ago, tree sap
          flowing over insects, as it does now as I
          speak, in thousands of forests and backyard
          trees everywhere.  Imagine that ancient sap
          trapping a little struggling insect and
          consuming it in a syrupy death.  Millions
          and millions of years pass and we come
          along and discover this prehistoric insect.
          If we're lucky, he's perfectly preserved in
          a fossil form inside the hardened sap which
          is now amber.  And as we examine more and
          more amber, we find many perished insects,
          including among them, biting insects -

                            GRANT
          Like mosquitos -

                            HAMMOND
          Like mosquitos, precisely, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          Mosquitos that sucked the blood of
          dinosaurs.  That's your source of DNA
        
  material?  My God!  It just might work.


INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY

A TECHNICIAN carefully positions a piece of amber under a fine-pointed
drill.  With a nod, the technician's goggles drop from his forehead onto
his eyes and he starts up the drill.  Hammond yells over the loud WHIRR.

                            HAMMOND
          The extraction room speaks for itself.

CLOSE ON - drillbit boring into the amber.  Orange fleck fly.

                            GRANT
          It does?

The technician shuts the drill.  Placing his hands into a mounted pair
of gloves, he operates an automated pair of needle-nose pliers to
carefully lift out the remains of a mosquito.  He drops this bug on a
slide and places this slide on a tray full of such slides.

                            LEX
          That's a million year old mosquito?

A conveyor belt starts, carrying this tray on to the NEXT TECHNICIAN.
The group follows.  This technician puts the first slide under a
microscope.  Grant watches on a video monito
r as the tech inserts a long
needle into the prehistoric bug.

                            ELLIE
          Put in a piece of amber, find a mosquito,
          drill it out.  Right?

                            HAMMOND
          Right.  You are witnessing the extraction
          of tissue from the thorax of this humble
          insect.  If this mosquito has ingested any
          foreign red blood cells - say it bit a
          hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a T-Rex -  we
          will extract those blood cells and obtain
          paleo-DNA, the how-to-build instruction
          book of an extinct creature.
          So you see, Ellie, I'm not creating dino-
          saurs. Fossils left behind the information,
          the map of how to bring them back.  I'm
          helping them escape from the confined of
          time.

                            GRANT
          But even thousands of mosquitos wouldn't
          give you enough tissue to determine a
          complete DNA strand.

                 
           HAMMOND
          Right you are, Dr. Grant!  More like
          hundreds of thousands of mosquitos are
          necessary to provide even a partial
          strand of DNA.  And without a complete
          strand, we don't have a dinosaur.


INT  GENETICS ROOM

A LOUD HUMMING SOUND.  Along the walls are rows of waist-high stainless
steel boxes.  In the room's center are two six-foot-high round towers.
At a single console, a man studies a monitor.

DR. WU, 35, looks up from his study and beams at his guests.  He jumps
up and knocks over his cup of coffee.  ASSISTANTS clean the area as Wu
comes forward and actually hugs Grant, much to Grant's embarrassment.

                            HAMMOND
          Ah, I knew you two would hit it off!  Dr.
          Grant, this is Dr. Wu, my chief geneticist.

                            WU
          Finally, you are here!  I've been working
          without the encouragement of my peers for
          too long.  Welcome, welcome!

He kisses Ellie, who takes 
it in stride.  Gennaro, We already knows.

                            WU
          Mr. Hammond never lets me publish and
          he's interested only in results, not in
          science.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't forget to thank me when you pick up
          your Nobel prize.

Hammond and Wu resume the tour.

                            HAMMOND
          You are standing in the middle of the
          most powerful genetics factory created
          since the expulsion from Eden.

                            WU
          These are Hamachi-Hood automated gene
          sequencers, those are Cray XMP's,
          supercomputers that take DNA information
          and organize it.  In this room, we take
          fragmented or incomplete DNA strands and
          compare them to other incomplete strands.

                            HAMMOND
          It's like finding the missing pieces of a
          jigsaw puzzle.

                            WU
          The computers make sever
al trillion
          calculations to provide us with a
          complete DNA strand - the genetic code of
          an extinct animal.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY

A vast room bathed in infrared light, filled with long tables.  The
first tables have rows and rows of centrifuges, each bearing dozens of
test tubes.  Wu leads the group.

                            GRANT
          Okay, you have your "complete" DNA
          strand.  How do you grow it?

                            WU
          We use unfertilized crocodile ova as our
          breeding medium.

                            HAMMOND
          Our primordial soup.

                            GRANT
          And how do you know what it is you're
          growing?

Wu shrugs.

                            WU
          Well, we have computer techniques to try
          and map out finds on an evolutionary
          basis.  But mostly, we just grow it and
          find out what it is.  If it's something
          we're interested in, and it 
survives, we
          keep it.

Grant and Ellie share a concerned look.

                            GENNARO
          And if you're not interested?

Wu indicates a cabinet of chemicals with skull-and-crossbone warnings.
Timmy regards the poison with excitement.

Lex calls from deeper in the room.

                            LEX
          Come look!

Here, plastic eggs lay on the long tables, their pale outlines obscured
by a grey mist that covers the tables.  The eggs are all gently rocking
as TECHNICIANS roam up and down the aisles.

Hammond walks ahead of the group.  As Wu speaks, Hammond listens and
enjoys it as though he's hearing it for the first time.

                            WU
          This is the incubation room.  We keep the
          temperature at ninetynine degrees and a
          relative humidity of one hundred percent.

                            GRANT AND TIMMY
          Jurassic atmosphere.

Timmy smiles at Grant.  Hammond winks at Timmy.

                            WU
          We
 also run a high oxygen concentration,
          up to thirty-three percent, so if you
          feel faint, please tell me right away.

Lex feigns a faint, Timmy cracks a small smile. They move forward,
waist-deep in the mist.  A strange green light emanates from the
incubators.  Lex is half-consumed by the mist. She mimics the witch.

                            LEX
          I'm ... melting!

Ellie laughs and pulls Lex close.

                            WU
          Reptile eggs contain large amounts of
          yolk but no water at all.  The embryos
          must extract water from the surrounding
          environment.

                            GRANT
          That's why you create the mist.

Wu nods.  Hammond just enjoys the scene as Grant and Ellie watch a
thermal sensor moving from one egg to the next, touching each with a
flexible wand, beeping.  Lex and Timmy let their hands glide over the
sides of the green glowing incubators fully awed by the strange, big
eggs they hold.

                   
         WU
          Children, please do not touch!  The eggs
          are permeable to skin oils.

Grant that very close to an egg.  He sniffs it.

                            GRANT
          What kind of eggs are these?  Are these
          shells plastic?

                            WU
          Yes, they are,  The embryos are
          mechanically inserted and then hatched in
          this room.  But we've managed to
          sufficiently mimic the actual biological
          process - these creatures rupture the
          plastic membrane that they're contained
          in when they're born.  Like real births.

They reach an endless row of incubators, lined up along the wall,
beneath a viewing area like those found in an OB-GYN ward.

                            WU
          Eggs that are determined viable spend
          their last couple days in our specially-
          designed incubators, which help
          accelerate the pre-natal developmental
          stages.  Which is interesting becaus
e
          we're having a problem with the adult
          animals -

Hammond claps a hand over Wu's mouth and laughs.

                            HAMMOND
          There's no problem Dr. Wu can't handle.
          Now who wants to see the real thing?

As they exit the CAMERA PANS the misty aisles, studying the eggs.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

Blue shadows of clouds sweep across an expansive green hill in front of
the Visitor's Center.

Grant and Hammond make their way down below to the loading area for the
park tour.  A little ahead is Gennaro and Ellie.  Gennaro chatters on
while Ellie energetically explores the area, looking at the plants.

                            GENNARO
          ... so naturally, Hammond's going to
          present everything in the best light.  I
          need to know that this park is safe.

                            ELLIE
          I'll tell you something that troubles me
          from the start.  The carnivores are all
          well-fed and kept separated from their

          natural prey.  That'll keep 'em alive,
          but it won't keep 'em happy.

                            GENNARO
          How do you mean?

                            ELLIE
          The carnivores will want to hunt.  It's
          an instinct.  And that instinct will have
          to be satisfied or suppressed.

FURTHER UP THE HILL, moving slowly, Hammond eyes the pair suspiciously.

                            HAMMOND
          Gennaro is putting negative ideas into
          Ellie's head.  He's a naysayer.  I have
          no affection for that type of thinking.

                            GRANT
          Don't worry.  Ellie makes her own
          judgments.

At the base of the hill Timmy and Lex toss a baseball.


EXT  TOUR START - DAY

The group gathers.  TWO ELECTRIC CARS glide to a stop behind them.
Regis leans out of the first one.

                            REGIS
          Hey!  Great day for a tour!

                            GENNARO
          Looks like rain to me.

         
                   REGIS
          No!  I told the rain-god to hold it off
          till we got back.

The kids pile in next to Regis and explore the high-tech cars.  Timmy
finds a a pair of very think, strange-looking goggles with dials on top.

Grant, Ellie, and Gennaro climb in the second car.

                            HAMMOND
          Kids, mind Mr. Regis.  He's in charge now.

The cars begin to move and pass Hammond.  He waves.

Gennaro looks back as the cars turn into the brush.  Hammond waves.

                            HAMMOND
          Gennaro, for once in your life, let
          something really move you.

In the cruiser, Gennaro rubs his neck.  He turns to Grant.

                            GENNARO
          Ever get the feeling we're just Hammond's
          damn guinea pigs?

                            GRANT
          I like to wait and see.

Ellie motions ahead, with excitement and apprehension, to a huge gate.
Regis and the kids wave behind to Grant, Ellie and Gennaro.

The gate's doo
rs swing open and the cruisers move forward.  The kids
squeal out a YA-HOO that floats through the air to Grant.  But Grant
wears a cautious face, his skeptical eyes scan the landscape.

A FANFARE of trumpets and then a pre-recorded voice speaks from a
console in each cruiser.  Video screens display a welcome message.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          Welcome to Jurassic Park.  You are now
          entering the lost world of the
          prehistoric past, a world of mighty
          creatures long gone from the face of the
          earth, which you are privileged to see
          for the first time ...

Regis uses his walkie-talkie to contact Grant's cruiser.

                            REGIS (ON WALKIE)
          That's Richard Kiley.  We spared no
          expense.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          We'll begin our tour today with the
          herbivores ...


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, FIRST TOUR STOP - DAY

Between massive tree trunks, a spectacular view:  stor
m clouds touch
mountaintops.  Below, the lagoon ripples in pink crescents.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... and the grasses are a species of
          juniper, and samples can be purchased at
          the gift shop.  Now, if everyone will
          take a look to the right ...

All eyes swing that way.  Grant doesn't see a thing.  Nor do the others.

AHEAD, Timmy pulls the binoculars out of the equipment pouch and studies
the location.  Lex grabs the night goggles.  Timmy pulls them from her.

                            REGIS
          Look ...

                            LEX AND TIMMY
          I don't see anything.  Do you see
          anything?  There's nothing there.

                            REGIS
          Something's out there ...

IN THE SECOND CAR, a fly buzzes on Grant's windshield.  Grant hangs out
his window almost sniffing the air for some movement.  Nothing.

SUDDENLY the trees in front of them move!  A deep trumpeting SOUND and
TWO BRACHIOSAURS rumble away fr
om the side of the road.  The ground
SHAKES as they walk, their BELLOWING fills the air.  Led by Grant, the
passengers rise through the open top of their Land Cruisers, to look up
at the dinosaurs far above.

DROOPING FROM ABOVE, leaves and little branches shower on Grant.  Utter
amazement fills Grant's face, then his mouth breaks into a giant smile
then a laugh.  He simply can't believe his eyes. His laugh becomes
raucous and euphoric.

                            GRANT
          Ellie!  Can you imagine the excavation
          team seeing this!

Behind him, Ellie's whole person is awestruck, immobile.  Gennaro
squints, straining to make sense of this unbelievable reality.

IN THE CAR AHEAD, Lex and Timmy stare open-mouthed.  Regis looks at the
animal and then at the group's reverie.  He smiles knowingly: he's been
there, too.  He bends and whispers:

                            REGIS
          Congratulations. You're the first kids in
          the whole wide world ever to see real
          dinosaurs.

The
 kids look up at Regis with wonder in their eyes.

GRANT CAN'T stop laughing.  Still chewing, a brachiosaur cranes down to
peer at this laughing man.  The brachiosaur's huge head stops inches
away from Grant.  Grant, awestruck, stares and them -

CLOSE ON - Grant as his eyes slowly roll back and ... he faints.

The dinosaur casually moves away as Ellie comes to Grant's aid.

                            ELLIE
          Alan?  Alan?
              (sort of delighted)
          He fainted!

Gennaro waves to Regis that all is okay.  Grant slowly revives.  He
looks back at the brachiosaur, groggily, smiling away.  He looks at
Ellie and their eyes linger on each other longer than usual, sharing a
look of serene delight.

Gennaro plops back in his seat and ponders the scene before him.  A
glazed look fills his face.

                            GENNARO
          My God, we're going to make a fortune
          here!

CAMERA PUSHES IN on the majestic, gentle beauty of the Brachiosaurs.
JUNGLE SOUNDS DOMINATE, growing l
ouder and louder.


INT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Hammond sits at his throne, happily watching the huge video screen which
displays the tour group.  He laughs raucously and calls to Arnold.

                            HAMMOND
          He fainted.  I've waited fifteen years to
          impress that young man.

                            ARNOLD
          Oh Mr. Hammond, I'm sorry to interrupt
          you, but Muldoon needs you by the pit.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh, balls.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, SECOND TOUR STOP - DAY

The cruisers come to a stop.  In the distance, A HERD OF GALLIMIMUS
graze.  They stand on their hind legs to get at high palm trees, then
drop gracefully down on all fours to chew.  BABY GALLIMIMUS scamper
around the adults, eating leaves that drop from the larger animals.

                             PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... Gallimimus, known as the ostrich
          dinosaur for the shape of its shoulders,
          have a very strong nesting instinct ...

Grant do
esn't listen.  He is simply intoxicated with the pastoral beauty
of the gentle, grazing dinosaurs.  Suddenly, he looks away with a deep
concern.  Ellie looks at him questioningly.

                            GRANT
          Ellie?  What the hell are we going to do
          with the rest of our lives?

Ellie smiles at him, puzzled.

                            ELLIE
          What to you mean?

                            GRANT
          Can't you see it, Ellie?  We're the ones
          that are extinct now.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, THIRD TOUR STOP - DAY

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... lots more to see in the herbivore
          section of our park.  But as we come
          alongside out Jurassic jungle river to the
          left, let's try and catch a glimpse of a
          very unusual and dangerous carnivore.
          Look across the river and above ...

A lovely mossy clearing.  And to the side, bounded just by a thicket of
bushes, a precipitous drop to a tropical river, lus
h and clear.  The
river runs fast but it is narrow.  On the other side is a sharp rise.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          And there they are!

Standing on that natural pedestal and watching our tour come to a stop
are TWO DILOPHOSAURUS, man-sized dinosaurs with gills that hang around
their necks.  Grant and Ellie chime in with the pre-recorded voice.

                            ALL THREE
          Dilophosaurus!

Timmy and Lex point enthusiastically.  Regis holds them down with a
gentle but restraining arm.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          Dilophosaurus is one of the earliest
          carnivores.  Scientists once thought
          their jaw muscles were too weak to kill,
          but now, through the miracle of their
          cloning, we know Dilophosaurs spit venom,
          a poison which causes blindness and then
          unconsciousness.

Their distinctive HOOT drifts across the afternoon air.

                            GENNARO
          Poisonous d
inosaurs, there's a liability
          issue without a lot of precedent.

CLOSEUP of the nearly motionless Dilophosaurus.  One yawns wide.

                            GRANT
              (assessing)
          It's like a Gila monster of a cobra.  It's
          a poison ...

                            ELLIE
          Spitter!

The Spitters bound off as Grant watches, transfixed.  A flock of birds
burst from a tree and cross the sky.  Trees filter the light.

                            ELLIE
          Are we dreaming all this?


EXT  RAPTOR PIT - DAY

A big hole in the ground, covered with a think wire mesh.  Suddenly, a
dark claw pushes against the wire web. A SHOWER OF SPARKS.  A SCREECH
animals GROWL and SNARL.  An animal slams its face into the mesh.  SPARKS
illuminate a set of RAZOR-SHARP TEETH.

Muldoon stands next to the pit, carefully loading an assault rifle.
Hammond comes in a hurry.  Muldoon sees Hammond and puts down the rifle.
He walks to Hammond, talking before he gets there.

               
             MULDOON
          These raptors are too damn dangerous. One
          of them tunneled out this morning.  He
          ripped a boy's arm off before I could get
          a bullet in him.

                            HAMMOND
          A bullet?  Muldoon - no!  Now what?  I
          have five left?

                            MULDOON
          John, they're mean as scorpions and smart
          as chimps.  Their little fingers make
          them natural cage-breakers.  We should
          terminate the raptor program.  They're
          just too smart.  Too damn smart.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh balls.  I will not terminate the raptors
          just because they're behaving normally.
          They're hunters.  Why can't we contain them
          properly?

Hammond starts to walk away.  Muldoon follows, he's not finished at all.

                            MULDOON
          John, remember back in '88, when we
          started to build the containment devices?
         
 We ordered cattle prods, tasers, guns
          that blow out electric nets.  They're all
          too slow for these guys. If we're going
          to keep the raptors, I want TOW missiles
          and laser-guided devices.

Hammond laughs warmly.  He pats Muldoon on the back.

                            HAMMOND
          It's just a zoo, Muldoon.  A zoo.  Figure
          out a way to contain them.  And we'll sit
          down and have a nice long discussion about
          raptors - after my guests leave, okay?

Hammond walks away.  Muldoon stares after him, jingling keys in his
hand.  Muldoon lumps over to A WORKER.

                            MULDOON
          Okay!  Get a 'dozer, start digging round
          the pit.  We're gonna bury some fence.
          And wear your rifle when you're working!


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Hammond enters and crosses to his throne.  Hammond swivels to Arnold who
exhales smoke.  Nedry looks over, keeps typing.

                            HAMMOND
          Wh
ere are they?  Punch 'em up.

                            ARNOLD
          They'll be by the trike's in a moment.
          Trike's sick again.

                            HAMMOND
          How can you say it so matter-of-factly?
          The trike's.  You casually accept it, but
          I never can.  You know what it means when
          you say "by the trikes"?  "By the
          trike's" means that they're out there by
          the species:  triceratops horridus.  It
          astounds me every time what I've done
          here.  What magic, what alchemy.  We
          turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur.
          I will never be complacent about that.

Arnold smiles and punches a button.  WE HEAR the pre-recorded tour voice
and some chatter of the kids.

EAVESDROPPING on the tour IS INTERRUPTED by a radio transmission to the
control room.  Arnold slides over and shuts off the tour monitoring.
The picture on the video screen is now of a cargo boat at a dock.

                            RADIO
 
         Hello, John.  This is the Anne B at the
          dock.  I'm looking at the storm patterns
          just south of us.  Requesting permission
          to leave before unloading the last three
          food containers.

Nedry looks up quickly, listening carefully.

                            RADIO
          Don't want to be stuck here if this chop
          gets much worse.

Hammond reacts with quiet dismay.  Nedry quietly gets up.

                            NEDRY
          Coffee anyone?

He's ignored.  Arnold defers to Hammond who leans to the microphone.

                            HAMMOND
          Hello skipper, John Hammond, how are you
          tonight?  I certainly don't want to
          imperil anyone.  But can you give us one
          more container of food?  Then we'll feel
          comfortable is the storm delays your
          return.  Could you help us out here?  Of
          course, if it looks too choppy just go,
          but you'd be doing us a big favor.

                 
           RADIO
          Well ... we'll do our best, sir.  We'll
          get one more container off. How's that?

Hammond thanks him and signs off.  Arnold looks at the darkening clouds.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, FOURTH TOUR STOP - LATE AFTERNOON

The cars twist through dense vegetation with a GRINDING of gears.  The
first car comes to a jerky stop.

There is a huge TRICERATOPS lying on its side, moving very slowly,
breathing laboriously.  HARDING, the tall, balding park vet, kneels on
the ground.  He peers into the animal's mouth with a large flashlight.

Before the second car can stop completely, Grant leaps out, races to the
trike.  Regis tries to restrain the kids but they chase Grant and Ellie.

Grant joins Harding on the ground.  The trike lets out a low MOAN.
She's too sick to move.  Ellie and Lex squat by the animal.

                            LEX
          I feel so sorry for her.  She's so sick.

                            VET
          We don't know what's wrong with Freda.
          Every six we
eks she gets like this.

                            REGIS
          Oh, she'll be up and around in no time.
          After a big night, I feel the same way.

Grant very gently opens the Trike's mouth.

                            GRANT
          Poor girl.  What's the matter?  Ellie,
          look at this.

A dark purple tongue droops limply from her mouth.  Ellie shines the
light on it, illuminating silvery blisters.  Gennaro turns away.

                            ELLIE
          Microvesicles.  Interesting.

Grant scratches one of the blisters with his ball-point pen.  It oozes.
The kids share a grossed-out look.

                            LEX
          Doesn't she have a mommy and a daddy?

                            HARDING
          We make these dinosaurs in the lab,
          sweetheart.  But they do form attachments.
          Freda has a little one that follows her
          around, thinks Freda's his mom.

Grant starts to look around.

                            ELLIE
          What does sh
e eat?  Where does she feed?

                            HARDING
          Animal this size takes in a minimum of
          six hundred pounds of plants a day.  We
          truck in hay and meadow grasses seven
          times a day.  That's all she touches.

Grant studies the nearby grass and bushes.  Timmy quietly follows Grant.

Ellie lifts a huge eyelid on the triceratops.  A runny eye just stares.

Grant comes up triumphantly with a bouquet of weeds clutched in his
hand.  These weeds have little purple berries.  Ellie looks over.

                            ELLIE
          West Indian Lilacs!

                            GRANT
          These'd give anybody a stomachache.

                            HARDING
          I'm telling you, the animals don't eat
          don't eat that stuff.

Regis keeps a babysitter's eye on the kids.  Timmy comes up with a
handful of smooth stones.  He approaches Grant shyly.

                            TIMMY
          Dr. Grant, sir?  How 'bout these?
          There'
s lots of little piles of these?

Grant fingers one distractedly, then suddenly comes to attention.

                            GRANT
          Hey, Ellie take a look at his.  Good
          work, Timmy.

Ellie gets up, brushes herself off, comes over and examines the stone.

                            ELLIE
          Extremely smooth.  Purple stains, could
          be those lilac berries.

She and Grant smile and each other and nod.  Gennaro is curious.

                            HARDING
          I don't get it.

                            GRANT
          Looks like your trike swallows stones to
          help her digest her food.  Walking
          around, she crushes berries against the
          stones.  And even just a little crushed
          berry is eventually enough,

                            ELLIE
          So, she poisons herself periodically.

                            HARDING
          Bet we tested her saliva for any trace of -

                            GRANT
          But with th
e stones, she swallows them
          and probably bypasses any mucosal
          contact.  Straight to the stomach.  I
          would test her excrement.

                            LEX
          Yo, yuk!

A light RAIN begins.  Automatically, with a soft hiss, the glass roofs
of the cruisers slide shit.  Gennaro taps Regis and indicates the cars.

                            GENNARO
          Hey Regis, where are your rain gods?
          It's gonna pour.  Let's finish our tour.

Grant agrees, heads for the cruisers.  He turns and looks for Ellie.
Ellie stands by the Trike.  She gives Grant a meaningful look.

                            ELLIE
          I'm staying.

Grant smiles at her decision.

                            GRANT
          Soil samples?

                            ELLIE
          You read my mind.
              (confidentially)
          I think she's sicker then they're saying.
          Her skin is dry and flaky.  And her gums
          are pale.  I'm going to talk to Dr. Wu.

        
                    GRANT
          Good idea.  I'll keep my eyes open.

Gennaro climbs in with Grant.  The two cruisers start off and Timmy
turns backward to stare wistfully at Grant.  Regis and Lex wave to the
Trike.  Grant looks back to Ellie who has already begun to work.

ON TRIKE - a mosquito lands on its back.  The trike's tail slaps it dead.


INT  MACHINE ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

With difficulty, Nedry shoves his large body down the crawl space behind
a large rack of electronic equipment.  He stops and uses a suction cup
device to lift a section of the tiled floor.  He gropes among cables and
pulls out a small wireless radio.  He transmits:

                            NEDRY (INTO RADIO)
          Jim, what the hell's with you  ... I know
          a storm's coming, I can't ... it's all so
          tightly planned ... that's not enough ...
          ok, twenty minutes, I'll be there.  Damn!

Nedry returns the radio to its hiding place.  He sucks in his gut to
make the crawl out of  the narrow space.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA - DUSK

The cruisers stop on the rise of a hill.  They over look a forested area,
sloping down to the edge of the lagoon.

                            TOUR
          The mighty T-Rex arose late in dinosaur
          history.  Dinosaurs ruled the earth for a
          hundred and twenty million years, but
          there were tyrannosaurs for only the last
          fifteen million years of that period ...

Farther south, they see the graceful necks of the brachiosaurs standing
at the water's edge.  Their bodies, mirrored in the moving surface,
break apart with the continuing drops of rain.  Hear lightning rhythmic-
ally pulses the sky.  All is quiet except for the soft drone of cicadas
and the tapping of light rain.

Regis calls Grant on the walkie-talkie.

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          You know, Dr. Grant, Hammond likes to
          come here in the evening and just sit.

                            GRANT (OVER WALKIE)
          Where is the T-
Rex?

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          Good question.

ON GRANT - as he takes that in, nodding to himself. Studies the land.

                            GRANT
          Maybe she's down hunting apatosaurs.

OVER WALKIE - Regis laughs, his voice tinny over the radio.

                            REGIS (OVER WALKIE)
          Would if she could, believe me.  Some-
          times she stands by the lagoon and stares
          at those animals, and wiggles those
          little forearms of hers in frustration.
          But the T-Rex territory is completely
          enclosed with trenches and fences.
          Believe me, she can't go anywhere.

                            GRANT
          Then where is she?

They hear A SOFT BLEATING.  In the center of the field, a small cage
rises into view, lifted on hydraulics from underground.  The cage bars
slide down.  A GOAT remains tethered in the field, BLEATING plaintively.

The tour group stares out their windows, expectantly.


BACK ON CONTRO
L ROOM -

Hammond, pleased, watches the giant screen that displays the tour group.
Muldoon limps into the control room.  Arnold looks over.

                            MULDOON
          Just checking in.  Everything ok?

                            HAMMOND
          Look at them.  Leaning out the windows,
          so eager.  They can't wait to see it.
          They have come for the danger.

                            MULDOON
          That's what I'm afraid of.

Muldoon twirls the keys on his fingers and watches the land cruisers.


BACK ON CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA -

Grant watches quietly.

The BLEATING becomes louder, more insistent.  The goat tugs frantically
at its tether, racing back and forth, kicking.

                            LEX
          What's going to happen to the goat?  Is
          the T-Rex gonna come eat the goat?

Grant senses something.  He sits straight up.  Looks out intently.

                            GRANT
          He's here.

The goat is tethered in the middle of the fi
eld, thirty yards from the
nearest tree.  Grant scans the tree for the T-Rex.

The goat senses something too.  It struggles and strains, bleating
frantically.  Suddenly the mechanical SOUND of the cage coming up.  Its
bars surround the goat with safety once again.

                            REGIS
          Looks like the Rex will have its snack a
          little later today.

                            RECORDED VOICE
          The sensors don't see the Rex around.
          She usually comes within five minutes of
          hearing dinner. If she doesn't, that
          means she's sleeping - we might have
          access to her at the picnic area.

Lex and Timmy let out a sigh of relief.  The tension is gone.

                            LEX
          I didn't want to see him get eaten.  I
          liked the goat.


BACK IN THE CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond studies the large video monitor.  He watches Grant and Gennaro.
Their voices are heard in the control room.

                            GENNARO (MONITOR
ED)
          What is a carnivore got out?

                            GRANT (MONITORED)
          There'd be no stopping it.  Huge, with no
          natural enemies, and a suppressed hunting
          instinct.

Hammond glares.  Arnold, aware, shuts off the screen.

                            HAMMOND
          Damn those people.  They are so negative.

                            ARNOLD
          It's natural.  They can't fully
          appreciate that we've engineered the
          animals and the park for total safety.

                            HAMMOND
          They comb this island like a bunch of
          accountants.  They don't experience the
          wonder, the awe of it all.

                            ARNOLD
          You can't make people experience wonder.

Hammond gets up and stands before the big windows overlooking the park.
The quartz FLOODLIGHTS outside their area COME ON with a rosy glow and
the dark jungle is opened again to their inspection.

At his console, Nedry looks at Hamm
ond.  Hammond stares out the window.
The RAIN PICKS UP and bounces off the window.  Hammond speaks to Arnold
without turning.

                            HAMMOND
          It's like the Garden of Eden out there.
          This is the most beautiful time of day.

                            ARNOLD
          Better rout the tour back.  They can
          start again sun-up tomorrow morning.

                            HAMMOND
          Yup.  Call the kitchen.  Those kids'll be
          hungry when they get in.

Arnold picks up the phone.  STATIC.  He glances over at Nedry.

                            NEDRY
          Sorry 'bout that.  I've taken all the
          lines to upload some data.

Hammond's annoyed, but contains it.  Arnold looks at Nedry, who smiles.

                            NEDRY
          I'll clear a couple of lines for you at
          the end of the next transmission, sir.
          Here you go now, this will make it all
          better, Mr. Hammond.

Nedry punches in a code.

CLOSE ON 
- Nedry's fat finger punching a last key.

CLOSE ON - amber video display terminal as a countdown begins.

As the screen counts down from ten to zero, Nedry peers at Hammond with
a steely glint in his eyes.

BACK ON SCREEN - three, two, one, the countdown hits zero.

Nedry's data-filled screen blinks off.  Nedry looks up to the rack of
monitors.  Unnoticed by Hammond or Arnold two more monitors go blank.
Then a third one.


BACK  ON CRUISERS, REST AREA - NIGHT

The electric cars turn up into a scenic area high above the rest of the
park.  HUGE QUARTZ LIGHTS REVEAL a dramatic view down to the ocean.
There the supply ship, the ANNE B, unloads its last crates.

RAIN INCREASES.  On the other side of the road are picnic tables, an
unfinished snack bar and rest rooms.  To the side of this rest area is a
view of the interior of the island.  A guard-rail separates visitors

To the other side of the rest area is a concrete moat and in the back of
this is a tall, electrified fence.  Surrounding the electric fence is a

smaller protective fence.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... enjoy a healthy snack.  This is also
          a good time to ...

                            LEX
          Hey, is that bathroom working?

                            REGIS
          Sure.
              (he uses his walkie)
          Rest stop.

The kids take off towards the bathroom, running through the rain.  Grant
gets out of his cruiser, strides to Regis.  He indicates the fence.

                            GRANT
          Is that still the T-Rex paddock?

                            REGIS
          Yes.  But she never comes here.  I don't
          know why not.  Probably too much
          construction.

GENNARO, jacket over his head against the rain, looks down to the ocean.

GENNARO'S POV - THE ANNE B UNLOADS he last cargo crate.

GRANT LOOKS at the concrete moat.  Studies its deep curve.  He looks up
at the tell electrical fence with its 10,000 volt warning.  He sees
conventional power lines on the opposite sid
e of the road.

CAMERA EXAMINES the empty cruisers.  Inside, the pre-recorded voice is
chatting on.  It slows eerily and stops.  Video SCREENS BLINK OUT.


BACK ON CONTROL ROOM -

Nedry yawns loudly.

                            NEDRY
          Yup!  Looks like a never-ending weekend
          for me.  I'm gonna get a Diet Coke.
          Don't touch my console, ok?  Line will
          be clear in five minutes.

Nedry leaves.  Hammond swings around and growls under his breath.

                            HAMMOND
          Slob!

                            ARNOLD
          Well, at least he knows what he's doing.


INT  UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - NIGHT

Nedry races through the series of security doors.  He ignores the
security x-ray device and just SHOVES each door open with his hand.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

THE QUARTZ LIGHTS GO OUT, leaving the group in shadowy darkness and now
STEADY RAIN.  There's a ripple of surprise from the group.  Regis rounds
them all up and directs them back into the 
cruisers.

                            REGIS
          Everything's just fine.  It's a temporary
          glitch due to the rain.  No doubt,
          they're going to re-rout some circuits
          back at the mainframe.  We'll have the
          power back on in moments.  Let's get back
          in the cruisers, they may start up, and
          I'd like us all to be seated in them.

The cruisers are STILL.  IN THE REAR CRUISER, Gennaro turns to Grant.

                            GENNARO
          I knew we shouldn't have kids here.

A vivid FLASH of LIGHTNING.  IN THE FIRST CAR:  Lex covers her eyes.
Then she looks up at Regis with a frightful face.

                            LEX
          Mr. Regis, are dinosaurs ... nocturnal?

                            REGIS
          No, darling, of course not.

                            LEX
          Mr. Regis?  What's ... nocturnal?

Another LIGHTNING FLASH.  Lex cries.  Regis comforts her.

                            REGIS
          Don't you worry about d
inosaurs.  They're
          all very safe in their paddocks just like
          animals in a big, strong zoo.  They're not
          going anywhere we don't tell them to go.

Timmy looks out the window excitedly.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

All those eggs on tables.  No moving sensors.  Nedry pulls a portable
incubator away from the dozens lined up against the wall.  Its
electrical cord goes flying.  Furiously, Nedry fills the incubator with
eggs, one after the other.

                            NEDRY
          Okay, little ones!  Here we go!

Nedry grabs the handles of the incubator and runs with it.  The
incubator careens on one wheel as he turns the corner and exits.


BACK ON CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond looks out the large window as the LIGHTS EXTINGUISH.  He twirls.

                            HAMMOND
          What's going on, Arnold?  I want those
          lights on.  I don't want my grandchildren
          scared.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus, the computer's gone
 down.

                            HAMMOND
          Well, I want the computer up.  This is
          the wrong weekend for glitches.

Arnold still examines his console.  He looks out with worry.

                            ARNOLD
          That's not the worst of it.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh yeah?  Please tell me what's worse
          than the lights going out?

Wu smashes through the door.

                            WU
          All the security doors are open.  Someone
          has been in my laboratory and the eggs
          have been disturbed.

The camera pushes in on Hammond's face.

                            HAMMOND
          Where the hell is Nedry?  Where is he?
          Did anybody check the damn john?

Hammond storms out.


INT  CORRIDOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION

Hammond enters the hall.  Muldoon, racing from the other direction, yells:

                            MULDOON
          John, the generator's shut down.  Who cut
          the power?

     
                       HAMMOND
          Arnold's on it.  You go out and bring
          back the tour right away.  I don't need
          any of this!

Muldoon is already running back the way he came.


INT  GARAGE - NIGHT

Several electric land cruisers are stored in this shadowy room.  There
is a glassed-in area where Muldoon's weapons are stored:  assault
rifles, tasers, tear gas canisters.

To the side of the garage s Muldoon's red jeep.  In the passenger side
of the front seat is a rocket launcher.

Nedry storms in, wheeling his incubator.  He stop suddenly and listens.
Approaching FOOTSTEPS.

                            NEDRY
          Oh, shit!


INT  BASEMENT STAIRS, VISITOR'S CENTER -

Muldoon runs down a long corridor, stop with a skid and yanks open the
door to the garage.  He runs out.  His boots RESOUND on the concrete.

BACK ON - NEDRY'S PANICKED FACE as he listens to the footsteps.
Wheezing, with great difficulty, Nedry bends his knees and strains.  With
everything he's got, he lifts the incub
ator waist-height.  And holds it.

BACK ON MULDOON - Muldoon's footsteps ECHO as they come closer and closer
to the garage.  Muldoon whips down the curve in the stairs.  His jacket
catches on an incomplete section of banister. Yanks him to a stop.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon's jacket as it RIPS, stays caught.

BACK ON - NEDRY as he tries to heave higher, can't.  Beads a sweat roll
down his brow.

MULDOON FREES HIS caught jacket and then keep going.

Nedry's face drips with sweat.  The incubator slips out of his sweaty
palms.  Catches it with his knee.  Nedry curses and with one forceful
boost, he lifts the incubator shoulder height.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon's feet on long stairwell. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.

NERVOUS, NEDRY BREATHES in a labored fashion.  He looks this way and
that.  He closes his eyes and with one superhuman effort, he heaves the
incubator into the back seat of the red jeep.  Nedry exhales.

At that moment, MULDOON ENTERS the vestibule between stairs and garage.

NEDRY EYES the shadowy figure in the vestibule.  
Nedry's frightened face.

MULDOON STOPS and reaches in his belt.  He pulls out his pistol.  He
takes out long, shiny cartridges.  He loads the pistol.

NEDRY LEAPS in the front of the jeep, pushing aside the rocket launcher,
and zooms into the night.

A moment later, Muldoon enters the garage.  He sniffs at the exhaust
that still hangs in the air.  He looks over and is surprised to see his
jeep gone.  He bends and inspects fresh tread marks. He looks up, his
face straining to understand.


EXT  PARK ROAD - NIGHT

Nedry's red jeep flies down the park road.

CLOSE ON - Nedry's wheel as he turns it.

His tires skid sideways, then regain traction.  The jeep bolts up a
smaller access road.  He skids to a stop at the top of the hill.

Nedry jumps out and looks up.  His high beams illuminate a huge electric
fence prominently labeled:  DANGER!  10,000 Volts!

Two safety fences separate Nedry from the electric fence.  He races to
the first one, pulls out a key chain.  He tries one key, then another,
and another.  It f
its.  Nedry unlocks the gate, swings open the door.

Nedry runs to the second gate.  He slips in the mud.  He slides to the
ground, dropping keys in a muddy pool.

CLOSE ON - Nedry's hand frantically fishing for the key chain in the
muddy water.  Got them!   Unlocks the second gate.

He races to the electric fence.  RAIN PELTS him now.  Water beads on his
face.  Lightning flashes on the 10,000 volts warning.

He grabs the gate with his bare hand and swings it open.

Nedry heads back to his jeep, his fat body strobed by its high beams.
He jumps in the jeep and drives through.  Behind him, the open gates
move recklessly in the stormy night.


BACK ON GARAGE

Ellie and Harding pull in, in their own gas-powered jeep.  Muldoon is
waiting for them.  Now there's a rifle slung over his shoulder.  Harding
jumps out of the jeep.

                            MULDOON
          Get out, get out!  I need this jeep.
          There's a problem with the tour.  Ellie,
          Hammond'll fill you in.

Ellie is concerned, the
n decisive.

                            ELLIE
          No!  I'm going with you, Muldoon.

They race out.


EXT  DOCK - NIGHT

Headlights blazing in the darkness, Nedry's jeep skids to a stop by the
dock where the ANNE B is preparing to leave.  The water is very choppy.

Nedry jumps out and pulls his incubator to the ground.  He begins to
drag it through the mud, toward the ship.  CAPTAIN FARRELL comes to meet
him, along with A COUPLE MEN, who hoist the incubator easily and carry
it toward the ship.

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Good.  Glad to see you.  Were you seen?

                            NEDRY
          Nah.  I'm back in five minutes, they'll
          never know I was gone.
              (yells after the men with the incubator)
          Careful with that thing!  It's worth more
          than the ship.
              (to the Captain)
          When's the copter meeting you?

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          It's not.  The storm's coast-to-coast,
       
   nobody could land on the water.

                            NEDRY
              (totally panicked)
          Shit!  What's the backup?  I don't like
          this.  Maybe we should do it another time,
          I don't like it.  I just don't like -

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Shhh!  I wired Baker, he'll have a man at
          the dock in Puntaremas.  We should be
          able to make that in time.

                            NEDRY
              (somewhat relieved)
          Ten hours?

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Yeah, now relax.  I got a lot riding on
          this too, you know.  No one's going to
          mess up now.  Baker's not going to mess
          up.  His people won't let him.

                            NEDRY
          Ok.  Ok.  Here.

Nedry pulls an aerosol can out of the baggy crotch of his pants.

                            NEDRY
          Look, this is insulating spray.

CLOSE ON - Nedry sprays a big mound of white foam into his
 hand,

                            NEDRY
          In about eight hours, spray down all the
          eggs with this stuff.  It'll keep 'em
          warm but not too warm.  I hope Baker has
          it together with the dock.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

Rain drums down on the cruiser.  Timmy stares out at the dark.  Lex
stares nervously out the side window.  Timmy picks up the night goggles
and snaps them on.

                            TIMMY
          Hey, these thing work great.  I can see
          in the dark and I can see far.

He swivels away from the T-Rex paddock and looks out toward the ocean.
He reaches up and adjusts the knob.

                            TIMMY
          Hey!  I wonder if that boat's still
          there?  It is. I think they're getting
          ready to go.

TIM'S POV - the fluorescent green image of men untying casting lines on
the boat.

Another LIGHTNING FLASH and Lex SCREAMS and covers her face.  She cries.

                            REGIS
          Timmy, can you
 give her the goggles?

Lex clamps her hands over her eyes.  Timmy gently nudges her.

                            TIMMY
          Want to look at the boat, Lex?

Timmy hands her the night goggles. Lex dries her eyes and takes a peek
with the goggles toward the ocean.

                            LEX
          Hey, that fat guy's down there. Is he
          gonna come get us and take us to Grandpa?

LEX'S POV - the picture streaks but clearly reveals Nedry shouting at
the Captain.  Men heave the incubator onto the ship.

                            LEX
          They have one of those things from the
          room with all the eggs - you know, where
          they help the baby eggs grow up.

                            TIMMY
          You mean an incubator?

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          What's the commotion?

                            REGIS
          Let me see.  Give them to men, sweetheart.

                            TIMMY (TO WALKIE)
          Uh, Dr. Grant?

REGIS GRABS th
e walkie talkie and tries to silence Timmy.  He knows he
gets there too late and reluctantly lets Timmy have it back.

                            TIMMY
          We saw that computer guy helping 'em load
          an incubator onto the ship.

                            LEX (TO WALKIE)
          Yeah, he's stealing them, Dr. Grant!
          He's stealing my Grandpa's eggs!

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          Nedry?  With an incubator?  Regis??

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
              (finally acknowledges)
          That's what they saw.

ON GRANT - He looks sharply at Gennaro.

                            GRANT (TO WALKIE)
          We gotta tell Hammond and Arnold right
          away.  How far is it to the mainland?

ON TIMMY - He looks at Regis.

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          Uh, it's a hundred miles to Puntaremas.
          About a sixteen hour voyage in this
          weather.

ON GRANT - He fiddles with the radio in his cruiser.  No r
esponse still.

                            GRANT
          I wouldn't like to see dinosaurs running
          around Costa Rica.

                            GENNARO
          When's the damn power coming on?


INT/EXT MULDOON'S JEEP, OTHER BACK ROADS

Muldoon and Ellie drive into the storm.  Suddenly, he slams on his
brakes.  In front of him, a tree has fallen, completely blocking the
road.  Muldoon curses, swerves around, and skids to a stop.

As Muldoon gets out and assesses the situation, Ellie lodges herself
between the tree and the jeep.  She pushes the tree with her strong legs
and moves it a good five feet. Quickly, Muldoon and Ellie drag the tree.
As they struggle.

                            MULDOON
          Strong legs.

                            ELLIE
          Lot of track in college.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

IN THE FIRST CAR, Regis drums his fingers on the dashboard.  Timmy wears
his goggles and stares into the rain.  Lex shifts her body around,
trying to get comfortable to rest.

 
                           LEX
          I'm hungry.  When can we get going?

                            REGIS
          When the electricity comes back on,
          honey.  These cars run on electric cables
          buried in the road.

IN THE SECOND CAR, Grant tries the radio to no avail.  Gennaro smokes.
Grant looks forward toward the first cruiser.  He can barely make out
the car in the dark and rain.  Occasionally, LIGHTNING reveals all.

TIMMY PULLS GUM out of his pocket.  Feels a tiny shake, looks around.
He puts it in his mouth, chewing quietly.  SUDDENLY, the whole car
VIBRATES.  Regis' sunglasses jump off the dashboard and fall to the
floor.  The kids look at him.

                            REGIS
          Must be turning on the electricity.

Lex sits up, looks around groggily.

                            LEX
          Feels like a vibration.


INT  T-REX PADDOCK - NIGHT

The T-Rex's huge hind feet crash down, one large foot following after
the other in long, powerful strides.


BACK ON CRUISE
RS, REST AREA - FIRST CRUISER

There is a thud, and then a THUD, and then a THUD.   Tim and Lex share a
frightened look.  Now the thud grows LOUDER.  There is a CRASHING SOUND,
the whole cruiser SHAKES.  Then silence.  Then another SHAKE.

CAMERA PUSHES IN TILL CLOSE - Timmy stares out with his night goggles.

TIM'S NIGHTSCOPE POV IN CLOSE - T-Rex paws rest on the electric fence.

Tim takes off his goggles, stares, transfixed.  Regis picks them up.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - of muscular forepaws with pebbled, grainy skin and
thick, curved nails comfortably gripping a thick wire strand.

The T-Rex moves his body forward of the brush, pushes against the fence.


IN THE SECOND CRUISER -

Grant and Gennaro stare out, unseeing in the rain and darkness.


CLOSE ON LEX -

Tears roll down her cheek.  She cries silently with an unknown fear.
Regis pulls the goggles from his eyes, starts to gag, checks it.

                            REGIS
          Jesus Christ.

                            LEX
          Bad language.

     
                       REGIS
          Jesus Christ.  The fence isn't
          electrified.

                            LEX
          Is that bad?

Regis turns, looks out the side window, away from the T-Rex.

Regis is shaking uncontrollably.  Suddenly he throws open his door and
bolts off into the rain, leaving the door open.  No move from the Rex.

Regis races by the second cruiser.  Grant stares out at him.

                            TIM
          Mr. Regis!  Mr. Regis, where are you
          going?

                            LEX
          He just left us.  He just left us all
          alone.  Timmy, Timmy how could he do
          that?  We're all alone!  We're all alone!

FLASH OF LIGHTNING.  FLASH.  The Rex butts his head.

TIM'S POV - The fence bangs down on top of his cruiser.

Timmy and Lex recoil from the scrape  of the wire mesh against the car.


IN THE SECOND CRUISER -

GRANT AND GENNARO'S POV - through the almost obscuring rain they see the
fallen fence.  An unseen weight pulls on it fur
ther, causing its
electric wire to pop like over-tuned guitar strings.


TIMMY REACHES -

out into the rain for the open door handle.

Another LIGHTNING FLASH and the creature is revealed standing between
the two cruisers, atop the crushed fence.  His head turns back and
forth, he's deciding on his prey.  Grant and Gennaro or Tim and Lex?

Timmy slams the door shut.  He looks directly at the Rex, just a few
feet away.  The Rex turns to him, stares back.

Lex SCREAMS and Timmy claps a hand over her mouth.

There is a whisper over Tim's walkie-talkie.

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          Timmy, be quiet. Don't move.


BACK ON GRANT -

He snaps off the walkie-talkie.

HIS POV - The rain runs in rivulets down the pebbled skin of the
muscular hind legs.  The animal's head is out-of-view, above the
rooftops of the cars.  The Rex lifts its huge hind leg.

                            GENNARO
          Holy shit!  Any suggestions what we do
          now?

                            GRANT
        
  Can't think of a thing.

The T-Rex slowly circles Grant's cruiser.


BACK ON TIM -

He watches the beast move.


BACK ON GRANT AND GENNARO -

As they twist and turn, trying to find a circling Rex in dark and rain.
The Rex pauses right next to Gennaro's window.  He lowers his head,
looking for movement inside.

CLOSE ON - the beady, expressionless reptilian eye moving in the socket.

Grant whispers, hardly moving his lips.

                            GRANT
          Don't move.

Gennaro's leg trembles uncontrollably.


IN THE FIRST CRUISER -

Very frightened, Lex discovers a flashlight.  She flicks it on and off,
distracting herself.  The beam shows her eyes full of a quiet panic.

                            LEX
          It's too, too dark out there.

Tim waves his hands in caution.


BACK ON GRANT, GENNARO, AND THE REX -

The Rex bends down, bumps the windshield with his nose.  Just stays
there, breathing heavily.  In the distance, the flashlight goes on
again.  The Rex raises his head suddenly.  Grant g
rabs his walkie.

                            GRANT (TO THE WALKIE)
          Shut that flashlight, Tim!

As the Rex heads off, a casual swipe of his tail SMASHES the side of the
cruiser, throwing Grant and Gennaro across the inside of the car.


ON TIM -

He lunges for the flashlight.  Lex dodges him, keeps it lit.

                            LEX
          No, it's mine.  Please, I need it.

Tim looks up through the sun roof.  The massive head of the
Tyrannosaurus Rex appears.  Tim watches, transfixed.  Lex looks up.
Irrational with terror, she aims her flashlight like a gun.  Blasts him.
Her flashlight beam cuts through the dark and rain - she sees the beast
plainly for the first time and SCREAMS!

The POOL OF LIGHT bathes the Rex's face.  He smashes his head down onto
the Plexiglass bubble.  It crunches, and falls into the car, crushing
the children.  Tim uses his feet to push it to the side.

Above, the Rex displays is gaping maw, drooling toward the opening.


GRANT -

watches the Rex raise his mighty h
ead again, above the kids' cruiser.


TIMMY AND LEX -

have a half-instant of relief.  Then SLAM.  The Rex butts his head
against the cruiser.  The Rex comes back down, tries to discover his
prey inside the cruiser.  Pushes his head close to the glass, looking.

The dinosaur stands in front of the cruiser, his whole chest heaving,
his forelimbs pawing the air.

Timmy whispers to Lex.

                            TIMMY
          Are you ok?  Be quiet and don't move.

Lex barely nods and grabs Timmy's hand.

The Tyrannosaur places his head next to the car.  He begins to shove the
cruiser with his head.  The cruiser ROCKS.  The back window bursts,
shards go flying.

Inside, the kids are THROWN back and forth, SHOVED against each other,
and finally FLUNG against the top of the car as the cruiser FLIPS.

The whole world TILTS CRAZILY - trunks of palm trees slide by, the
ground above, the blazing eye of the rex, the tops of palm trees.

The cruiser SLAMS DOWN on its side, the windows splat in the mud.  Lex
falls he
lplessly against the side window and lies motionless.  Timmy
falls beside her, banging his head.  He reaches for Lex.

                            TIMMY
              (softly)
          Lex?  Lex?

SILENCE.  No movement from Lex.

THE ANIMAL toys with the cruiser.  Like a dog with its bone, the
dinosaur pushes the cruiser along with his head.  He pushes it past the
picnic tables toward the ripped fence and the embankment.  Each shove
sends the children flying again.

The cruiser is pushes closer and closer to the unprotected embankment.
The cruiser slams to a stop completely upside-down.  The T-Rex steps
right on the cruiser, crushing the roof against the ground.

INSIDE - the children crawl for their lives as the car crushes further
down from above and a tidal wave of mud oozes in from the sides.

THE REX - gnaws at the car, grabs a tire with his teeth,  It ruptures
with a pitiful pop.  The Rex grabs at the axle with his teeth, begins to
drag the car back.  THe kids, half-outside, are pulled with the car.



GRANT DANCES -

with a flare!  The Rex is distracted.

CLOSE ON - the Rex as he ROARS.  The flare gleams in his eyes.

The Rex starts toward Grant.  He tosses the flare over the half-standing
part of the fence.  The Rex lunges after the flare.

GENNARO has reached his limit.  Terrorized, he leaps out and SCREAMS:

                            GENNARO
          Extinct animals should stay extinct!

He bolts.  The Rex sees him and starts after him, THUNDERING by Grant,
who stays frozen in place.

Gennaro sprints for his life.  He's not even a distant match for the T-
Rex jogging behind him.

Gennaro dives into the LADIES ROOM.

INSIDE - he slams the door and shoves the trashcan against the door.
POUNDING FOOTSTEPS APPROACH!  Gennaro backs up into one of the stalls.
LOUDER POUNDING, THE WALLS BEGIN TO VIBRATE!  Gennaro assumes a 'tuck'
position.

ON THE INTERIOR DOOR - The Rex smashes right through the steel-clad
door.  Pieces go flying.

Gennaro hides amidst the wreckage as the Rex sniffs around.


GRANT RUNS BA
CK -

to check on the kids.  He reaches a hand underneath the flipped car,
sitting in the mud.  Lex's soft voice can be heard.

                            LEX (OFF)
          Dr. Grant!

Grant fishes under, finds Lex's hand, drags her out.  He quickly checks
her for broken bones.

                            GRANT
          Lex, are you okay?

                            LEX
          Timmy's unconscious, he won't move.

Lex SCREAMS.  Grant turns to see the Rex return.  He squeezes Lex tight.
The animal goes right past them, back to his toy - Tim's land cruiser!

The Rex BELLOWS a huge cry.  Timmy awakens and sees the Rex above him.
He SCREAMS.

Lex, squeezed in Grant's arms, sees her imperiled brother.

                            LEX
          Timmy!

The Tyrannosaur looks up, GROWLS across the upside-down cruiser, opens
its huge jaws menacingly, all the time staring at Grant and Lex.

INSIDE THE CAR - Timmy tries to unwedge himself.  A thin trickle of
blood runs down his forehead.  He's jammed between the
 crushed roof and
the bent bench seat.  He can't free himself.

The Rex begins to SHOVE the cruiser toward Grant and Lex.  They back up
but they have very few feet left - they're almost at the embankment.
But if they don't move, they'll by crushed by the oncoming car.

Grant slings Lex onto his back.  She grabs her hands around his neck and
digs her feet into his sides.  Grant begins to climb over the downed
fence and into the embankment - it's a huge drop!

Grant grabs a broken cable and lowers himself and Lex over the side of
the embankment.

Just in time as the Rex SHOVES the cruiser further.  Now, the cruiser
TEETERS right on the edge, turning again on its side.  Tim hangs halfway
out of the car, unable to get out further.

Grant, with Lex on his back, slides down the cable, rappelling down the
embankment.  ABOVE, the car looms over them, rocking on the edge.  Lex
looks up and grabs Grant so tightly, she chokes him, unknowingly.

Grant, eyes bulging, sees the danger from above.  He pushes off the wall
and
 swings them toward the next hanging cable.  He reaches out and -

- GRABS THE NEXT CABLE just as -

- the T-Rex BELLOWS and lowers her head, and gives a final shove.  Timmy
and the cruiser SAIL INTO SPACE.  Timmy SCREAMS!

Grant and Lex swing out of the way as the cruiser sails past them.  Lex
SCREAMS, squeezing Grant's neck even tighter!   They watch helplessly as
the cruiser BOUNCES off the wall and CRASH-LANDS into the top of a tree
at the base of the wall.

Grant and Lex stare down at the wreck in the tree.  Timmy can't be seen.
Grant, choking from Lex's grip, grabs her fingers.

                            GRANT
          Let ... go ... please.

The Rex ROARS above.  They look up.

THE REX paws the air, GRUNTS in frustration and STALKS off, LIGHTNING
FLASHES.


EXT  NEDRY'S JEEP, BACK ROADS -

Nedry speeds along the rain-slick road, fish-tailing as he goes.

CLOSE ON - Nedry at the wheel.

NEDRY'S POV - the dark, wet road running alongside a ten-foot chain-link
fence.  Suddenly, a beast-like visage blur
s across the road.

Nedry swerves.  The jeep skids.  Nedry tries to over-steer, can't bring
the careening jeep under control.

The jeep crashes though the fence, bounces down a cement culvert, and
dives into a raging gully.

Nedry curses.  He spins the wheel.  The tires spin and spray.  The
jeep's hopelessly stuck in the gully.  From Nedry's seat in the jeep, he
cranes his head around, examining his situation.

NEDRY'S POV - On the opposite side of the gully, there is an equipment
graveyard.  By the titled jeep headlights, steely monsters all around
can be seen - discarded earth movers, graders, and tractors.

Nedry gets out of the jeep, grabs the winch from the jeep's back end.
and wades over to an abandoned tractor.

                            NEDRY
          Shit. I'm going to have to change clothes.

He loops the winch around the tractor's base.  Suddenly, he stops and
looks around as he hears a gentle HOOTING.  He squints, looking at the
strange steel graveyard lit by the bright beams of the jeep headli
ghts.

HOOT!  HOOT!  A distinctive HOOTING.  Nedry looks up in fear.  SILENCE.

Nedry starts moving toward his jeep.  Again, the HOOT!  Nedry stops,
looks right, looks left.  A RUSTLE in the trees.  Nedry's head cocks.

Looking through trees, lit by the strong beams, Nedry sees a SPITTER in
the eerie mist.  Now it's gone.  Now it's back.  It circles Nedry
warily, hunting him.  Nedry stares.

                            NEDRY
          I hope this is one of them herbivores.

Nedry scrambles the other way, full-tilt.  Hop, hop, and the Spitter
drops in front of Nedry from the other side.  HOOT!

Nedry jumps back, lands on his butt.  The Spitter zips in from the side
- HOOT!

Nedry doubles back, racing through the abandoned equipment, ducking and
rolling under a cement mixer, spinning past a tree.  He splashes down
the embankment, trying to get to his jeep.  He uses the winch line to
steady himself again the raging current.  He finally reaches the jeep,
swings open the door - and, surging out of the water like a
 demonic
apparition, is the SPITTER!  Nedry backs away, directly into the glare
of the headlights!

CLOSE ON - the Spitter.  It's plume opens, bright orange gills swell out
like an umbrella around its neck.  Something squirts beneath its jaws.

A big glob SMACKS Nedry on the arm.  He brushes it off.

                            NEDRY
          Gross.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - the Spitter's head.  The jaws puff, the hood flares
out, the neck snaps forward.  And - it spits.

This glob misses Nedry, splashes off the steaming headlight.

VERY EXTREME CLOSEUP - The Spitter's swollen poison sacs are inflated.
They fire!

This glob hits Nedry in the eyes.  He SCREAMS.

                            NEDRY
          I'm blind, I'm blind.

He falls against the jeep, rubbing his eyes.  The Spitter calmly hops to
the embankment and watches the blinded Nedry weave drunkenly in the
water.  Nedry grabs onto the jeep and pulls himself along toward the
driver's door.  The Spitter stalks, watching him.

Nedry pulls open the jeep door, 
thrusts his head in, slams it against
the door frame.  Now Nedry heaves his whole body into the jeep.  The
Spitter's long ostrich-like legs stretch and bend in an easy gait as it
closes it on Nedry.

Nedry sits behind the wheel, unseeing as the Spitter watches patiently
turns his blind eyes that way.

A long beat.  The Spitter leaps forward, the CAMERA PULLS BACK WIDER AND
WIDER.  Nedry lets out an ear-splitting SCREAM and the car horn BLARES.


INT  TIMMY'S CRUISER

Timmy lies against a spidered side window, his head pressed against the
door handle.  He pushes himself up on one elbow, opens his eyes, and
tries to focus.  Rain has nearly stopped but a light drizzle hits him

Timmy tries to straighten up, but he's too dizzy.  He stops and hears A
CREAKING and feels the whole car gently swaying back and forth.  With a
further effort, he raises his body so that he's standing with his feet
on the window frame and looks out the broken roof.

TIM'S POV - Dense foliage, moving in the wind, hard to see through.  An
o
pen space and - THE GROUND, FORTY FEET AWAY!


INT/EXT  CRUISER - CONTINUING ACTION

Tim's cruiser is lying on its side, stuck in the higher branches of a
tree on the hillside.

                            TIMMY
          Oh shit!

Timmy pulls his body up carefully, trying to get a better view.  He
grabs the steering wheel for support and it spins free in his hand.

CRACK!  The cruiser slips a few inches down the tree.  Timmy grabs the
window frame and freezes.  The car sways in the wind.

CRACK!  The car slips a quick and rocky two feet.

                            TIMMY
          Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

Timmy hears something.  He raises his head very carefully.  Climbing up
the tree, pulling himself on a nearby branch, is Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          Timmy.  Are you ok?

                            TIMMY
          Thank God you're here.  Where's Lex?

                            GRANT
          Below.  She's fine.  Let's get you down.

Timmy nods.

Grant peers throug
h the broken roof of the cruiser, analyzing Timmy's
predicament.  He cranes his head back to examine how the cruiser is
supported in the tree.  Grant turns back to Timmy.

                            GRANT
          Try the door you're leaning against.
          Nice and slow.

Timmy places his weight on the two sides of the door frame and reaches
between his legs, trying to open the door handle.  Stuck.  CRACK!  The
cruiser drops another foot.

Grant scrambles down a couple branches until he is even with the cruiser
again.  He motions for Timmy to hold still.

Grant reaches across to the other car door and tries the outer door
handle.  This one opens and very slowly, he pushes open the door.  Grant
gingerly holds it half-open in mid-air.

                            GRANT
          Crawl this way.  Slowly.

Carefully testing his weight with each step, Timmy lowers his body down.
He pushes his legs out the door.  They kick in the air and slowly come
to rest on a lower branch.  He lets himself down.  Now he si
ts on a
branch, a few feet below the cruiser.

CRACK!  The cruiser drops.  Grant still hangs onto the door but now his
footing on the branch is gone.  His legs hang in space.  The cruiser
hangs precariously above Timmy.  They're all twenty feet in the air.

                            GRANT
          We're going to have to make a jump for
          it, Timmy.  Okay?

Timmy agrees.

                            GRANT
          One, two, three, jump.

Timmy lets go and DROPS.  Grant follows.  So does the cruiser.  It's
hurtling right at them.

Timmy BANGS against the wet tree-trunk and slides down.  Branches WHIP
against his face, his hands SCRAPE against the trunk.  Grant BOUNCES
them.  They scramble down as quick as they can.

Timmy pulls his hands along the sap-sticky surface of the tree.  CRACK!
Grant is stopped for a terrible instant - doubled over a branch, he
flips himself over, dropping further.  The cruiser jolts along, just a
half-step behind them.

Timmy dives the last six feet and HITS the wet earth 
with a THUD!  Grant
CRASHES next to him.  Before they can roll out of the way, the cruiser
keeps coming.  Grant and Timmy look up at it.

GRANT'S POV - The cruiser dropping, dropping toward them.  And finally
stops, just inches away, its dented grill grinning at them, its cracked
headlight glaring.

Oil drips down on Grant.  He grabs Timmy, who grabs the night goggles.
The two roll away.  That second the cruiser SMASHES to the ground.

Grant brushes himself off painfully, extends a hand to Timmy.  Timmy
slowly reaches up and pulls himself standing.

                            TIMMY
          Thanks, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          You owe me one.

Grant turns around in a slow, fluid circle, checking out the forest.

                            GRANT
          Where'd Lex go?

They hear a faint WHIMPERING.

                            TIMMY
          There's Lex.

He runs.  Grant follows.


INT  DRAINPIPE -

Lex is curled up inside the drainpipe.  Her baseball glove is in her
mouth and
 she is rocking back and forth, rhythmically banging her head
against the back of the pipe.  She WHIMPERS.

ON THE HILLSIDE -

Grant and Timmy arrive at the drainpipe and stare in at Lex.

                            GRANT
          Come on out now, Lex.

Lex continues to band her head.  Timmy tries again.

                            TIMMY
          It's your turn to wear the goggles, Lex.

She shakes her head.  He holds up her baseball but she doesn't look.

                            TIMMY
          I found your baseball.

                            LEX
          You did?

But she doesn't move.  Grant speaks encouragingly.

                            GRANT
          Cone on, Lex, it must be cold in there.
          And tight.  Why don't you come out?

                            LEX
          I'm afraid of the "animals".

                            TIMMY
          The "animals" are gone.

                            LEX
          Where did it go?

                            TIMMY
          I don't kno
w but it's not here now.

                            LEX
          Are there any grownups out there?

                            GRANT
          I'm a grownup, Lex.  Come on out.  Gimmie
          you hand, come on, here you go.

                            LEX
          I'm hungry.

                            GRANT
          Me, too.  We've got to get ourselves back
          to civilization.


EXT  ROADSIDE

Regis slowly crawls out from between a couple large boulders.  He looks
around carefully.  He peels mud off his face and rubs his neck.

He touches his cheek.

CLOSE ON Regis' swollen cheek.  He rubs it with his finger.  Suddenly,
he swats at his own mouth.  He reaches in and pulls out a leech fat with
blood.  He hurls it to the ground, spitting.  He grabs another off his
arm and rips if off, leaving a bloody streak.  He digs in his pants and
pulls out another.  He SCREAMS.

As soon as he has done so, he knows he's made a mistake.  He looks
around frantically.  Sees the Rex trot down the road toward 
him.

                            REGIS
          Noooooo!


BACK ON HILLSIDE -

Grant and the kids crest the hill.  Grant puts on the night goggles and
adjusts the dial and looks toward Regis.  The kids can't see that far.

                            TIMMY
          What's going on?

Grant's green POV - Regis and the Rex bounding after him.  Regis hugs a
tree, unmoving.

Grant whispers to the kids.

                            GRANT
          It's Regis and the Rex is after him.  But
          it's okay.  Regis knows the Rex can't see
          him.  Evidently, he can only see move-
          ment.  Regis'll be ok if he stays still.

AFTER A LONG MOMENT, the tyrannosaur walks away, disappears into the
shadows.  Regis waits another long moment and releases his tree.

GRANT'S POV - The tyrannosaur leaps out of the shadows and knocks Regis
to the ground.  Regis jumps up and backs off.  The animal knocks him
right back down.  Regis jumps up again and screams at the beast.

                            REGIS
    
      You don't want to hurt Mr. Regis.  Go
          away.  Ed's your friend.  Back off!

THE REX watches him dance around.  It goes toward him.  This time its
jaws are open.  Regis SCREAMS and in the middle, the scream cuts off.

Grant lets the goggles fall off his face.  They hit the ground with a
METALLIC CLINK.  The Rex turns toward Grant and the kids.

                            GRANT
          Let's go!

Grant grabs both the kids' hands and they begin to run.


BACK ON  TOUR REST AREA -

Drops of water splat on a big fern.  Light swims in the little puddle.
In the sky above, clouds hurry by, intermittently revealing a half-
obscured moon.

The torn fence lies in a crumpled, twisted mess.  The wheel of a Land
Cruiser spins.  A little lizard runs in place on it.

The SOUND of the jeep's engine.  It's Muldoon and Ellie.

THEIR POV - a single cruiser lies on its side in the middle of the road.

                            ELLIE
          Oh, My God!  Where's the other one?

Before the cruiser stops, she j
umps out.   Muldoon shouts a whisper.

                            MULDOON
          Ellie!

Ellie turns in the headlight beams.  Muldoon tosses her a flashlight.

                            MULDOON
          Wait up.

Muldoon skids to a stop, leaps out of the car.  He catches up to Ellie.

They share a frightened, apprehensive look.  Muldoon gets on his knees
and and touches a muddies area.

                            MULDOON
          T-Rex tracks.

Ellie looks out into the forest.

                            ELLIE
          Then they must be out there.  They must
          be out there.  I know it.

                            MULDOON
          Perhaps.

                            ELLIE
          No!  They're out there.

                            MULDOON
          I've seen a lot of animal attacks in the
          bush.  It's not as gory and horrifying to
          see as you'd think.  No pools of blood or
          exposed bones.  There is usually little or
          no evidence left behind.  And if
 victims
          are small, a predator can kill by just
          shaking the little thing to death, eating
          it, and leave not so much as a button.

A definite RUSTLING in the brush.

Ellie jumps and SCREAMS.  Muldoon puts his hand over her mouth and
pushes her down.  They both squat by the cruiser.  SILENCE.  Ellie
swallows.  Muldoon slowly gets up.  Ellie follows.

Their flashlights swing back and forth in the night.  Twigs crack under
their feet.

Ellie hears the RUSTLE at the edge of the forest.  She shines her light
into the brush.  She catches her breath.  Her hand shakes.

Ellie flashes her beam right, left, up, down.  Jumps.  Something is
coming at her, rolling at her.  She gasps, steps back.  It's too late.
It's Gennaro.  His limp body stops at her feet.  She covers her mouth.
Muldoon runs to her.

Gennaro is face-down.  Muldoon takes his pulse.

                            MULDOON
          Thank God.  (beat)  We have to carry him.
          First I have to ...

He stands and removes his 
jacket.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon tears the jacket into long strips.

He wraps Gennaro's wounds.

                            MULDOON
          He's losing a lot of blood.  Help me.

Muldoon and Ellie carry Gennaro to the jeep.  They lay him on the back
seat.  Muldoon jumps in back with him.  He keeps wrapping the wounds.
Ellie starts the engine, looks back at him.

                            ELLIE
          Looks like you've been through this
          before.

Muldoon looks up.

                            MULDOON
          I told you I've seen big game attacks in
          Africa.

She starts the engine.

                            ELLIE
          Right.

Ellie skids out of there.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

The dark room is lit with two outdoor torches.  Light flickering on
their faces, Arnold and Wu stare at the console screen.

                            WU
          Why?

                            ARNOLD
          Because Nedry messed with the code.
          That's why I'm checking it.

              
              WU
          But that could take weeks.  What would be
          faster?  Try keychecks.

Arnold snaps his fingers, grabs Wu,

                            ARNOLD
          That's true.  Keychecks will give me a
          record of every button Nedry pushed.

With a rapid series of keys, Arnold initiates "keystrokes".  The
computer displays a short series of commands.  Arnold runs his finger
down the screen.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus, that's all he did all afternoon?
          He was just dicking around, maybe waiting
          to get his nerve up.

Wu points to a line.  It reads:  WHTE-RBT.OBJ

                            WU
          What's that?

                            ARNOLD
          Some sort of object.  Let's see if we can
          trace it.

Arnold types FIND WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  Nothing.  He tries DEFINE WHTE-RBT.OBJ.
Still nothing.  LIST WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  The screen fills with data.  Each
line defines another security system that has been shut off:  SECURITY
PERIM
ETER FENCES OFF/   SECURITY - INTERIOR FENCES OFF/  SECURITY -
LABORATORY DOORS OFF/, etc.

                            WU
          What's it mean?

                            ARNOLD
          It wasn't a bug.  It was a trap door that
          fat bastard left for himself.  When he
          hit WHTE-RBT. OBJ, it initiates a set of
          commands that turned the whole goddamn
          park off.  Hammond was right about him.

                            WU
          If I did that I'd leave a way to turn it
          back on.  In case I had to.  I'm sure
          Nedry did.  You're find it.

Arnold nods grimly.


INT  CAFETERIA - NIGHT

Hammond sits quietly in the deserted cafeteria, calmly spooning ice
cream into his mouth.  This room is lit by dozens of candles.

Muldoon walks in, stares at Hammond in the semi-darkness.

                            MULDOON
          We found Gennaro.  He'd badly injured.
          Harding's tending to him in your
          quarters.  He'll be all right if we can
    
      radio for help.  Your grandchildren and
          Grant are somewhere in the park.  I
          believe they're alive but I don't know
          where they are.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm sure you'll find them.

                            MULDOON
          I certainly hope so.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm sure we will.  After all, I keep
          telling everyone, this park is made for
          children.

                            MULDOON
          Just so you understand that they're
          missing, sir.

                            HAMMOND
          Missing?  Of course I know they're
          missing.  You just said that.  Look, Bob,
          let's not get carried away.  We've had a
          little breakdown from the storm or
          whatever, and as a result we've had a
          regrettable, unfortunate accident.  And
          that's all that happened.  We're dealing
          with it.  Arnold will get the computers
          cleaned up, and
 the radio and phone lines
          open.  You'll find those kids and my good
          friend, Dr. Grant.  I'm sure they'll want
          some of this ice cream.  It's very good.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

Dark.  Ellie helps Harding get Gennaro comfortable on Hammond's couch.
Blood from Gennaro's injuries stain the rich leather.  Gennaro babbles.

                            GENNARO
          That Rex didn't even give me his full
          attention.  That's what hurts.  I was
          just an afterthought.  I gave him my full
          attention.

                            HARDING
          He's had a lot of morphine.

                            GENNARO
              (sings)
          Not enough.

                            ELLIE
          I need to find Wu.  I have to run a few
          tests in his lab.

                            HARDING
          He's probably in the control room, get-
          ting in the way while Arnold tries to put
          things together.

As Ellie leaves, Genna
ro is singing a shanty in his morphine stupor.

                            GENNARO
          Yo ho, I'll close this place down ...


EXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - NIGHT

The ship is tossed around on a stormy sea.

                                                     MATCH CUT TO:


INT  STATEROOM -

The eggs are tossed around in the womb of the incubator.  The swell
settles but the rocking of one egg doesn't stop.  The egg cracks, a
silvery line runs down its side.


EXT  PARK - NIGHT

Somewhere in the dark park, laced by low fog, Grant, Timmy and Lex walk.

                            LEX
          I'm tired.

                            TIMMY
          You're too big to be carried.

                            LEX
          But I'm tired-tired.

                            GRANT
          Okay, Lex.

Grant picks her up.

                            GRANT
          Oof!  You're heavy.

The full moon is blurred by drifting clouds.  Their blunted shadows lead
the three across an open field toward dark woods beyond
.  Grant is lost
is thought, trying to decide where to go.

                            GRANT
          I think we're still in his paddock.

Lex's heavy eyes open.  Her eyes grow big.  She taps Grant's shoulder.

                            GRANT
          What?

                            LEX
          Don't you see?  Don't you see?

                            GRANT
          What?

                            LEX
          The fence.

                            GRANT
              (squinting)
          No.

                            TIMMY
          Oh I do, right there!

Lex lets herself slide off Grant and runs into the woods.  Timmy
follows.  Grant follows, squinting.  Finally, he sees.  A big smile.

The kids look up at a twelve foot high electric fence.  Timmy gulps.

                            LEX
          Timmy's scared of heights.

Timmy spins in fury.

                            TIMMY
          Shut up.

Lex and Timmy stare at each other.  No fighting - now.  They relax.

                   
         GRANT
          Okay with the fence, Timmy?

Timmy eyes it.  Nods hesitantly.  They start to climb.  Lex climbs easily.

                            LEX
              (mumbles quietly)
          'Fraid of heights.

Timmy climbs tentatively.  A dinosaur ROARS in the distance.

CLOSE ON - Timmy's foot loses its grip.

Timmy hangs for a moment, held only by his straining hands.

All three stop.  Wait.  Timmy regains his balance.  Slowly, they proceed
up and over.

On the other side, Grant looks around.  More high trees.  Beyond a field.

                            GRANT
          A herbivore grazing area.  Excellent.

Grant starts to walk toward it.  Timmy stops.  Lets sits on a tree root.

                             TIM
          We gonna walk all night?

Grant looks at his watch.

                            GRANT
          Twelve hours before that ship reaches the
          mainland.

                            TIM
          We need sleep.

True, and Grant's thinking the same thing.  He looks aro
und, surveying
the misty forest.  He looks straight up into the beautiful, tall trees
that ring the wide-open grassy meadow.

                            GRANT
          Up there.

                            TIM
          Climb?  Again?  I can't climb again?

Grant smiles.

                            GRANT
          Sure you can.

Grant checks out and rejects tree after tree.  Near the meadow he finds
it.  A good, basic climbing tree.


EXT  UPPER BRANCHES OF THE TREE

Grant helps Lex get comfortable on his lap.  Timmy tucks himself in
between Grant's outstretched legs.  Grant looks out.  Back to kids.

Timmy and Lex are already snoring.  Lex turns and hugs Grant close to
her.  She murmurs in her sleep.  Grant starts to pat her shoulder when
Timmy, without waking, reaches to her and strokes her hair.

                            TIMMY
              (mumbles)
          It's ok, Lex.  Everything's gonna be okay.

                                                       CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - amoeba-like creatures 
swimming in a pool.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

Ellie lifts her head away from the powerful microscope.

The dark room is lit by flashlight.  Battery packs power the microscope.
Wu paces the room, regarding his eggs with dismay.  Sitting on their
long tables with no moving wands above them - no thermal sensors.

                            WU
          What is taking Arnold so long?  This room
          is too cold.  My eggs will be damaged.

Ellie swings the lens to Wu.  Not so interested but peers in politely.

                            ELLIE
          No sign of those berries.  Really
          interesting.  There are indications of a
          similar virus in every tissue sample.
          But it's not in the ground.  Could I look
          at some of the discarded embryos?

Wu reluctantly agrees.  He opens a cabinet and brings her samples.

                            WU
          I'm sure you'll find your virus ... or a
          similar one.  All animals carry many
          viruses 
in a dormant condition.  It's
          almost impossible to say with certainty
          which are the same strains.

Ellie begins a test on a sample.  She adds a reagent and marks up a
slide.  As she works:

                            ELLIE
          And yet from what Harding tells me, many
          of you animals have similar symptoms -
          besides the microvesicles, a lack of
          hunger, loss of reproductive urges, sores
          in the mouth and gums.

Wu waves his arms.

                            WU
          What the hell does Harding know?  He's a
          veterinarian, not a pathologist.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Arnold pushes his chair away from his console and claps his hands as
Muldoon walks in.  Muldoon asks hopefully.

                            MULDOON
          What is it?

Arnold points to the screen.

                            ARNOLD
          That's it.

Muldoon comes closer.

                            MULDOON
          That's what?

                            ARNOL
D
          I found the command to restore the
          original code.  It resets the linked
          parameters.

                            MULDOON
          The fences and the power?

                            ARNOLD
          Right.  And it does something else. It
          erases the code lines that refer to it.  It
          destroys all evidence it was ever there.

                            MULDOON
          Nedry could steal the eggs, get back and
          reset the whole show.  No one would ever
          miss him.

                            ARNOLD
          Watch this.

Arnold types in a command.  The screen flickers and changes.  Arnold and
Muldoon look out the window as lights come on through out the park.

                            ARNOLD
          Hot damn!

                            MULDOON
          Are the fences back on?

                            ARNOLD
          You bet they are.  It will take a few
          seconds to get up to full power, because
          we've got fift
y miles of fence out there,
          and the generator has to feed the
          capacitors along the way.  But in a half
          a minute we'll be back in business.

Arnold points to the transparent map of the park.  On it, bright red
lines snake out, moving throughout the park, as electricity surges
through the fences.

                            MULDOON
          Motion sensors?

                            ARNOLD
          Got them too.   It will be a few minutes
          while the computer counts.  Then I'll
          tell you where Grant and the kids are and
          you can go and get them.  But every-
          thing's working.  Half past ten and we've
          got the whole thing back up and running.

Muldoon picks up a phone, shakes his head.

                            MULDOON
          Just hiss.


BACK ON  GRANT AND KIDS IN TREE -

Grant snores.  A mosquito buzzes around him.  He waves him away and
continues to sleep.

In the distance, a tiny BEEPING. Below the towering tree, across the
f
ield, a sensor beeps, it's green light blinks, and the beeping stops.

IN THE HIGH TREE, the branches sway.  Grant and the kids sleep on.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

The glowing, glass map.  Arnold and Muldoon stare at it.

                            MULDOON
          What is taking so damn long?  Where are they?

                            ARNOLD
          There's a lot of extraneous movement out
          there.  Branches blowing, birds, back-
          ground movement.  It may take, ah, okay,
          count's finished.

Muldoon looks at Arnold anxiously.  Arnold looks down.

                            ARNOLD
          Hmmmm.  I don't see them.  Maybe they're
          out of range of a sensor.

                            MULDOON
          Shit.  I don't know where they are.  I
          wish I could go out there   But I haven't
          got anything to use on the Rex.  My
          rocket launcher's in the jeep Nedry
          stole.  And going out with a big gun in
          the dark would be suicide
.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

Brightly lit again.  Ellie performs tests with a centrifuge.  She looks
at Wu, who sits across from her in a high stool, stifling a yawn.

                            ELLIE
          Why don't you get some sleep, Dr. Wu?
          I'm just going to run a couple more tests
          and then I'm going to turn in myself.

Wu doesn't need to be told twice.  He climbs off his stool.

                            WU
          No point in everyone being exhausted.

He starts to leave.  He comes back and speaks consolingly at Ellie.

                            WU
          I'm sure Muldoon will find Dr. Grant as
          soon as there is light.

Ellie appreciates his effort, nods seriously, goes back to work.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


EXT  OCEAN - JUST BEFORE DAWN

Beautiful dark ocean.  The sky is a rich blue.  A morning star fades as
the sky lightens.  The Anne B is a small dot on the massive ocean.


INT  STATEROOM, ANNE B 
-

Eggs sit in the incubator.  A hand sprays them with foam.  Leaves.
CAMERA EXAMINES the eggs as the foam disperses.  More cracks.  One egg
jumps with a bolt from within.  It settles.  Jumps again.

                                                      CUT TO:

ESTABLISHING AERIAL - the primordial beauty of Isla Nublar at dawn.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAWN

Muldoon drives out into the park in Harding's jeep.  THREE WORKERS
travel with him.  Each carries a rifle.


EXT  GRANT'S TREE - DAWN

CAMERA LOOK DOWN on Grant, Lex and Timmy still sleeping in the tree.  A
large shadow falls on their quiet faces.  Lex opens an eye. She SCREAMS.

Grant and Timmy wake up with a start.

THEIR POV - AS THE CAMERA LOOKS THROUGH THEIR LEGS AND TILTS UP right
into the huge face of A DUCK-BILLED HADROSAUR, a gigantic dinosaur with
cow eyes.  Its head moves up through the canopy of the trees.  Then the
head swoops way down below.  And returns to Grant's level and stares at
his shoe.

The hadrosaur tastes Grant's shoe.  The kids
 press tightly into Grant.

                            LEX
          He gonna eat us?

                            GRANT
          I don't think so.  She's a ...

                            GRANT AND TIMMY
          ... herbivore.

The hadrosaur HONKS.  Lex covers her ears.  Grant smiles and motions to
Lex.  He picks a big fruit off the tree and tosses it into the
hadrosaur's mouth.  CHOMP.  He feeds it again.  Lex and Timmy toss a few.

CHOMP!  CHOMP!  HONK!  HONK!

The hadrosaur's big head swoops way down, momentarily gone.

When she returns, all three quickly gather fruits and throw them into
her mouth.  The hadrosaur pulls back with her giant mouthful of fruit.
She pulls further and further back and then her huge head turns and
moves down.

Grant, Lex and Timmy strain to see through the branches.

THEIR POV - The hadrosaur is feeding four scampering, baby hadrosaurs.
Letting the fruit tumble from her mouth into theirs.  Lex YELLS:

                            LEX
          Come here, babies!  Get your b
reakfast!

The babies run to the base of the tree.  The kids toss fruits right down
to them.  Lex and Timmy climb lower to feed them right from their hands.

Grant and the mother hadrosaur stare at each other.  She sniffs his
foot.  He moves closer, straddling a branch.  He lifts up her lip and
examines her gums.

CLOSE ON - a ripped piece of fence stuck in her teeth.

Grant yanks it out.  He lets it drop to the ground.  He take a large
leaf and rubs her teeth with it.

CLOSE ON - her mouth as Grant's hand touches the side of her tongue.  He
sees little tiny bumps.

The hadrosaur lets out a low groan.   Grant is puzzled, rubs harder.

                            GRANT
          Like the trike.  Maybe it's not the stones.

HONK!   She pulls her mouth away.  The baby hadrosaurs turn to the
honking adult.  She is leaving quickly.  They follow quickly behind her.
The small herd leaves, casually trampling trees as they go.


EXT  BACK ROADS, PARK - MORNING

Muldoon and workers drive rapidly in the jeep.  Suddenly,
 Muldoon slams
on the brakes.

MULDOON'S POV - ABOUT TWENTY PROCOMPSOGNATHIDS (COMPYS), small chicken-
sized scavenging dinosaurs, scramble across the road.

                            MULDOON
          Where the hell are they going?

Muldoon watches them cross.  He thinks it over.  Spins the wheel and
follows them off the road.

                            MULDOON
          Let's see what's up.


EXT  BELOW THE TREE, PARK - MORNING

Timmy bravely jumps from a very low branch.  He smiles and looks at
Grant, who's already on the ground.  Grant looks off in the distance.

                            GRANT
          Tim, I think there's a motion sensor
          across the field and down there.

                            TIM
          Where's Lex?

ALONE IN THE BUSHES -  Lex kneels.  She holds a big fruit and calls:

                            LEX
          C'mere boy, c'mere.

She tosses the fruit.

CLOSE ON - the fruit rolling away.

Lex gets up and follows the rolling fruit.  She picks it up.

           
                 LEX
          It's very, very good.

She tosses it again.

                            LEX
          C'mere boy, c'mere.

Lex's eyes scan the bushes, then stop.  She smiles.

LEX'S POV - hidden in the brush, a baby triceratops' eye peeks at Lex.

Lex pushes the fruit closer.  The BABY TRICERATOPS comes out of the
brush, squeaking as it goes.  It nibbles the fruit.  Lex rolls another.

BACK ON GRANT AND TIM - They look around.  Timmy stops, mouth open, YELLS:

                            TIM
          Dr. Grant, Dr. Grant, look.

Grant turns, looks OFFSCREEN.  He's astonished by when he sees.

HIS POV - a row of shrubs, which Lex seems to soar above.  As a break in
the shrubs, it's clear that she's riding the baby triceratops.  Loving it.

                            LEX
          Whoa!

With a whoop, Grant and Timmy chase after Lex on her triceratops.

Lex rides through low brush, ducking down as she goes.  Then beneath the
tall trees as she enters the forest.  She crosses a stream on a log
b
ridge.  Light showers down through the branches.  The water shimmers.
Lex in is paradise.

Behind her, Grant and Timmy shout for her to stop.  She waves, kicks the
triceratops like it's a horse and YELLS:

                            LEX
          Giddyup!

The trike takes off, in a rush.  It trips over a fallen tree, downed by
the storm.  The trike takes a spill and Lex goes flying.

                            LEX
          Whoa!!  Take is easy!

She passes over the trike's head, in the air, and SCREAMS as she flies:

                            LEX
          I can't swim!

She SPLASHES into the stream.

Timmy, first to arrive on the scene, dives in heroically.  He comes up
sheepish and muddy - and sees Lex standing in a foot of water.

The baby dinosaur rolls to a stop, mowing down a patch of saplings as
she goes.  It stands up, dizzy and out of breath.

Timmy wipes mud off himself.  Grant helps the kids out of the water.
The baby triceratops follows them.  Grant yells to the baby trike.

                 
           GRANT
          Go home now.  Home to Freda!

                            LEX
          Oh, let him stay.  He likes me to ride
          him.  He could carry me instead of you,
          Dr. Grant.  Please, let him stay,

Grant shakes his head,

                            GRANT
          Go!  Go away.  Go!  Get out of here!

The trike whimpers and watches the three of them walk on.  Lex is
heartbroken.

                            LEX
          Will I ever play with him again?

Grant looks across the field, abundantly beautiful in the early morning.
He has to keep them going.   He points across the field.

                            GRANT
          We gotta get to that motion detector.
          It's still a ways.

Lex looks behind her.  In the distance, more hadrosaurs join the herd
eating from the tall trees.  Some cool off in a shallow lagoon.  They
drink, lowering their flat heads, meeting their own reflections in the
still water.  When they look up again, their heads swivel.  At the
water's 
edge, a baby hadrosaur ventures out, squeaks, and scrambles back
while the adults watch indulgently.


EXT  OFF ROAD, PARK - MORNING

Muldoon and his workers now follow the compys on foot.  The compys trail
off in different directions.  Muldoon and his workers break apart to
track the different groups.

A BEARDED WORKER follows his party of compys.  He looks ahead and sees a
small group stopped ahead.  Their heads are bent to the ground.

A BALD WORKER has reached another cluster of compys.  Kicking, he
scatters them.

Muldoon's tracking leads him to the equipment graveyard where Nedry was
lost.  He sees his stolen red jeep.  He rushes to it.  On the passenger
side still sits the rocket launcher.  He opens the door to retrieve it.
When he leans in, his eye catches the tilted side-view mirror.  The
image is of many compys bent over the ground.  He comes around, YELLING.

                            MULDOON
          I found Nedry!

In the distance, the call is ECHOED.

                            BEARDED WORKE
R (OFF)
          I found him!

                            BALD WORKER (OFF)
          Found him!


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY

Hammond peeks in the door and sees Gennaro, heavily bandaged, dozing on
the couch.  Gennaro's eyes flutter and Hammond enters and smiles.

                            HAMMOND
          He, Donald.  Glad you're awake.  I hope
          you're not going to take this little
          mishap you had and hold it against my
          park.  It would be terrible if the
          finishing funds were in any way held up.

Gennaro just grins and shakes his head.  He's very high on morphine.  He
wants to speak but Hammond keeps talking.  After each sentence, Gennaro
enthusiastically agrees with a nod.

                            HAMMOND
          You really shouldn't have gotten out of
          the vehicle.  The park is actually quite
          safe.  A disenchanted worker sabotaged
          some equipment.  Arnold, Muldoon, and Wu,
          all loyal employees, are righting damage
    
      as we speak.

                            GENNARO
          Oh good, 'cause I love the park!  It's
          more than we ever dreamed!  Those
          brachiosaurs are so big!  And those
          Spitters -
              (he spits)
          - incredible!  I only have one problem.
          Aren't we going to have pterodactyls?
              (he frowns, smacks his forehead)
          Oh, they'd fly away!

Gennaro looks off, watching the imaginary pterodactyls fly away.
Hammond takes out a bag.

                            HAMMOND
          Take a look at these, Donald.  Have you
          seen these?  These are great.

Hammond dumps things out of the bag.  They are souvenirs of the park.

                            HAMMOND
          Wind-up toys.  Spitter umbrellas.

Gennaro is thrilled.

                            HAMMOND
          I got some great t-shirts.  Dinosaur
          bingo, hey ...

Hammond leans closer.

                            HAMMOND
          Wu says he can make a foot high
    
      triceratops.  We'll sell pets as living
          souvenirs.  Bio-engineered to eat only
          food we sell, of course.

Gennaro can't take it.  Great idea!  He high-fives Hammond repeatedly.

Harding enters and gently taps Hammond on the shoulder.

                            HARDING
          You'll have to bear with him, Mr. Hammond.
          He's doped to infinity and back.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - DAY

Sunlight pours through the windows.  Ellie sits with her head in hands.
She looks around and wanders the lab.  Notices a drawer, slides it open.

X-rays.  She shuffles through, finds some marked: FREDA.

Ellie snaps on a viewing light at her lab station.  She studies the X-
ray.  She looks up in surprise.   Studies it again.

The viewing light is snapped off.  Ellie looks again.  Wu stands there.

                            WU
          Who gave you permission -

Ellie attacks back.

                            ELLIE
          I'm here to investigate this park. And
          there's
 plenty you haven't told me.

                            WU
          That's absurd.

                            ELLIE
          These bones aren't fully formed.

                            WU
          You're qualified to interpret x-rays of
          living dinosaurs?  I doubt it.  It took
          me many months to learn.

                            Y
          I'll tell you something else, Freda isn't
          an adult, just a huge juvenile.

                            WU
          You're making a lot of assumptions here.

                            ELLIE
          Right.  What the hell is going on, Wu?

They stare at each other in the bright sunlight.

                            HAMMOND (OFF)
          Growth hormones.

The two swing around.  Hammond stands in the sharp shadows of the room.

                            WU
          She didn't have a right to explore my lab.

                            HAMMOND
          Let's not argue, Wu, we have a serious
          problem.
              (to 
Ellie)
          These animals don't last.  There is a
          regularity, a predictability about when
          they die.  It's always ... very young.
          We don't know why.  Given time, I'm sure
          Wu will figure it out.  It's just ...

                            WU
          Just some adjustment in the code is
          required.

                            HAMMOND
          But there are deadlines.  The park opens
          next summer. And it requires full-grown
          specimens.  So Wu uses growth hormones to
          achieve the desired size in a short
          amount of time.  But they all keep dying
          and we don't know how to stop it.

Ellie and Wu stare at Hammond.  He steps forward.  The light is so hot
behind him that his appearance is like an apparition.

                            HAMMOND
          I was going to tell you all this myself,
          Dr. Sattler, after Gennaro stopped
          breathing down my neck.  That's why I
          wanted you and Dr. Grant 
here on my
          island - you have to help me keep the
          dinosaurs alive.  Won't you please help
          me?

                                                      CUT TO:

IN THE SKY, the sun momentarily burns through the clouds -


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY


Ellie enters.  On the couch, Gennaro snores lightly.  In a chair nearby
Harding sleeps, a roll of gauze grasped in his hands.

Ellie walks over to the large model of the park that Hammond revealed.
She looks at the miniature dinosaurs that sit in different sectors of
the park.  She picks up the plastic Rex, examines it, drops it back in.

She brushes by Harding and studies Gennaro's pasty, sleeping face.  Air
blows in and out of his dry lips.  She examines the gauze wrapped around
his wounded leg.  It seeps with blood.


INT CONTROL - DAY

Arnold works at his console.  Hammond and Wu lean over his shoulder.
Ellie bursts in, very agitated.  Hammond looks up.

                            ELLIE
          Gennaro's losing a lot of blood. 
 He
          needs transfusions.  We gotta get a
          rescue helicopter.  Arnold, what's with
          the phones?

                            ARNOLD
          Ah hell. I just can't find it.

He sips his coffee and stares bleary-eyed at the screen.

                            ELLIE
          Find what?

                            ARNOLD
          Nedry jammed all the communication lines.
          He inserted some command, a lockout into
          the program code.  I can't find it,
          because I gave that restore command and
          it erased part of the program listings.

                            WU
          So?  Just reset - shut the system down
          and you'll clear the memory.  Everything
          will be in the normal wakeup mode.

                            ARNOLD
          Shut the system down?

                            WU
          And reset.

                            ARNOLD
          I've never done that before.  And I'm
          reluctant to do it.  Maybe it's tr
ue, all
          systems will come on, but maybe they won't.

                            ELLIE
          Look, there is a sick man here who needs
          medical attention or he'll die.  Four
          people are out there, missing in your
          park.  We need search teams.  We have to
          have a phone or radio.

Arnold still hesitates.

                            ELLIE
          Well?

                            ARNOLD
          Well, it's just that the safety systems
          don't function with the computer shut
          down and -

Ellie boils over.

                            ELLIE
          - turn the goddamn safety systems off!
          Can't you get it through your head that
          we have no choice?

Arnold looks at Hammond, who now stares out into the park.  Without
turning, Hammond nods his consent.

                            ARNOLD
          Okay.

Arnold gets up and goes to the main panel.  He opens the doors and
uncovers the metal swing-latches over the safety switches. 
 He pops them
off, one after another.

                            ARNOLD
          You asked for it.  And you got it.

He throws the master switch.

The control room goes black.  All monitors go black.  Arnold, Wu and
Ellie stand in the dark.

                            ELLIE
          How long do we have to wait?

                            ARNOLD
          Thirty seconds.


EXT  FIELD IN THE PARK -

Grant and kids walk through a clearing.  Lex stops.

                            GRANT
          What is it?

                            LEX
          I hear something.

                            GRANT
          Come on.

Timmy looks around. The morning is still and peaceful. Branches are
motionless.  Only a little bird jumps from one branch to another.

                            LEX
          Hear it now?

                            TIMMY
          You're hearing things.  Come on, we gotta
          get back and warn them about the boat.

Lex hesitates but doesn't want to be left behind.  She runs betw
een
Grant and Timmy.  Then they all hear it.

HONKING.  It comes from the herd of duck bills behind them.  First the
honking of a single animal, then another animal joins in, then another
and another, until the whole herd has taken up the honking cry.

                            TIMMY
          What's going on?

                            GRANT
          They're agitated.

The duckbills twist and turn.  They hurry out of the water, circling the
young ones to protect them.

With a ROAR, the T-Rex bursts from the trees, just a hundred yards away
straight toward the hadrosaurs.

                            LEX
          I told you I heard something!

The earth SHAKES.  A low rumble is heard and felt as the hadrosaurs begin
to run  in a parallel direction to the course of Grant and the kids.

                            GRANT
          Outta the way, kids! Run!

Grant grabs Lex, lifting her bodily off the ground, and carries her like
a football.  Timmy runs beside them.

Hadrosaurs run alongside of them.  Grant
 hears the crashing of trees.
He takes a glance over his shoulder.

GRANT'S POV - a flurry of flamingos takes flight and spooks the herd
into changing direction.  The hadrosaurs swerve and charge right into
the path of Grant, Lex and Timmy.  They all SCREAM.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

The quiet black room.  Hammond stands by the big window.  His pensive
presence affects all in the room.

Arnold looks at his illuminated watch.

                            ARNOLD
          Memory should be cleared by now.

He pushes the main switch back on.  Nothing on.

                            ARNOLD
          Damn.

Arnold pushes the switch off and then on again.  Still nothing.  He
glances at Hammond's back.  Sweat forms on his brow.

                            ELLIE
          What's wrong?

                            ARNOLD
          Oh hell!  I have to turn the safety switches
          back on before I restart the power.

Arnold flips on three safeties, and covers them again with latch covers.
Holding his breath, he
 turns on the main power switch.

First, there is the computer beep.  Ellie jumps.  Then relaxes.  The
lights come on.  The screens hum.  Hammond's shoulder twitches slightly.

                            ARNOLD
          Thank God!

The room is jubilant.  Hugs and cheers.  Ellie picks up a phone.

                            ELLIE
          Arnold!  They're still not working.

                            ARNOLD
          No, it sounds dead but after a reset, all
          system modules have to be brought on line
          manually.

Arnold quickly goes back to work at his console.  Hammond turns.

                            WU
              (to Hammond)
          Arnold's about to get the phones up.

Arnold pushes the chair back.

                            ARNOLD
          Okay, we're up again!

Ellie grabs the phone back up.

                            ELLIE
          No we're not.  Phones still dead.

Arnold swings her way.

                            ARNOLD
          Can't be -

                    
        HAMMOND
          My God, look at this, Arnold.

Hammond points to the transparent map.  A tight cluster of dots by the
lagoon move in a coordinated way.  Moving fast, in a kind of swirl.

                            ELLIE
          What's happening?

                            ARNOLD
              (tonelessly)
          The duckbills.

                            WU
          My good God.

                            ELLIE
          What?

                            ARNOLD
          It's the Rex ...

                            HAMMOND
          They've stampeded ...


BACK ON  THE HADROSAURS - LOW ANGLE ON THE STAMPEDE -

Grant and kids run for their lives.  Behind them the duckbills charge
with surprising speed.  Their enormous bodies charge in a tight group,
kicking up dirt, rocks, whole trees as they thunder along.

CLOSE ON - a charging duckbill as he HONKS, eyes wild with fear.

A horrible ROAR of the T-Rex sends a duckbill infant squealing and
struggling to stay out from underfoot.

CLOSE ON
 - A huge adult foot almost tramples the infant.

Frightened and confused the infant scampers even deeper into the
maelstrom.  The frenzied herd raises a great cloud of yellow dust.

GRANT AND LEX AND TIMMY run wildly.  The stampede is very close behind
Grant and the kid's faces are covered with sweat and dust.

Another deafening ROAR of the T-Rex.

Grant leads them toward a rocky outcrop with a stand of big conifers.
The animals continue to close.

CLOSE ON - the running feet of the stampeding animals.  The ground
VIBRATES every time it is struck by the huge feet.

GRANT AND THE KIDS scramble onto the rocks.  They frantically tuck in
between big boulders as the the herd reaches them.  Lex shields her
dusty face with her hands as she wedges deeper between the rocks.  Grant
pushes her down deeper and looks up from between the rocks.

GRANT'S POV - the immense legs of the first hadrosaur to pass.  Another
slams its big tail against the rocks, leaving a splash of hot blood.

Stampeding legs send clods of dirt fl
ying in the air.  Above, even the
birds are running.  Disoriented, they fly frantically along.

GRANT AND THE KIDS are enveloped in dust.  Just shadows of huge bodies
with giant limbs.  BELLOWS of pain as animals wheel and circle.

A boulder is dislodged and it rolls toward Timmy.  He dives out of his
rocky hiding place.  The boulder continues on toward Grant and Lex.
They dive after Timmy.  The group buries itself anew in a group of thick
roots tangled amidst smaller rocks.  The boulder continues on, SMASHING
the rocky enclave they have just left.

Grant and the kids huddle and watch the last under-bellies oscillate
above them.  The stampede goes past.  They lie there, unable to move.
They watch the herd trample on.


CLOSE ON - The Rex's foot as it crushes a motion sensor.

Lex SCREAMS.  Grant and Timmy cover her mouth.

The T-Rex hunts down the herd.  He targets his prey.  A young hadrosaur.

As the hadrosaur gallops into the shadowy treeline, the Rex lunges
fiercely.  The Rex and its victim are enveloped 
in dust.

Grant holds Lex close.  She watches the terrible cloud with a quiet
horror.  Timmy makes the first move to leave.

                            TIMMY
          Let's go.  Now!

The herd's remainder gallops off into the safety of the deep jungle.

Grant, Lex and Timmy run in the opposite direction.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond, Arnold, Wu, and Ellie watch the monitor as the dust slowly
clears.  Hadrosaurs scatter.

Now the Rex is calm and quiet.  BACK TO CAMERA, he gnaws on something.

                            HAMMOND
          No!  Oh no!  He make a kill.  He killed
          one of my animals!  Where's Muldoon?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm sorry, Mr. Hammond.

                            HAMMOND
          My animals!  My animals!

Muldoon enters, limping in.  Hammond is very upset.

                            HAMMOND
          Where have you been?  My Rex killed a
          hadrosaur.  You should be out there,
          doing something.

                            MUL
DOON
          I just came to tell you - you're minus
          one computer expert.


EXT  BY THE RIVER, PARK - DAY

The water rushes a few hundred yards away.  Grant and the kids have
finally rested enough.  Grant nods to Timmy.

                            GRANT
          We'll walk by the river.  That leads back
          to the Visitor's center.

                            LEX
          Not me.  I'm not walking anymore.

                            TIMMY
          Come on Lex, I'll carry you.

                            LEX
          Nope.  Too scared.

Timmy looks up at Grant.  Grant kneels down by Lex.  Lex embraces Grant.

                            GRANT
          You ready?

She wipes her tears.

                            LEX
          Can we go on the raft?  Then we don't
          have to walk so close to the animals!

                            GRANT
          What raft?

Lex points to a low concrete maintenance building with bars.  It is
twenty yards away.

                            LEX

          Where I found Freda's baby.

Grant start to stand.  He's thinking.

                            GRANT
          It's still mid-morning.  I bet we have at
          least ten miles to go.  If we take the
          raft along the river, we can make much
          faster progress.

                            TIMMY
          Let's do it.


INT  MAINTENANCE BUILDING -

Grant stumbles deep in the gloomy recesses of the building.  He pushes
past drums of herbicide, tree-pruning equipment, spare tires, coils of
cyclone fencing, huge fertilizer bags, stacks of ceramic insulators,
empty motor-oil cans, work-lights and cables.

                            GRANT
          Lex, I don't see any raft.

Timmy looks at Lex.  Where is it?  Lex doesn't know.

                            TIMMY
          Keep going.

Grant keeps pushing through bags of cement, lengths of copper pipe,
piles of green mesh.  Two plastic oars hang on the concrete wall.

                            GRANT
          Bullseye!

Timmy is reliev
ed.  Lex smiles.

                            LEX
          Told you!

Grant grabs them.  Looks around, still -

                            GRANT
          No raft. Where did you see it, Lex?

                            LEX
          Actually, I never really saw one. Just
          assumed.

                            GRANT
          Assumed?

She nods.  Grant and Timmy resume looking.

IN THE REAR OF THE BUILDING - Lex walks below a barred window.  Slats of
light fall on her back.  She sees a dark closet door ajar.  She brushes
the handle.  It swings opens and two bright orange life preservers fall
on her, knocking her to the ground.

LEX SCREAMS, frantically pushing the life preservers off.

Grant's head pops up.  Timmy runs to her side.  She is wrestling
irrationally with the life preservers.  Timmy drops to the ground.

                            TIMMY
          Lex!  Lex!  You're okay, you're okay!

Lex is overcome with fear.  Timmy grabs a preservers and puts it on.

                            TIMM
Y
          Look, Lex!  Look!

She looks at him, realizes, and bursts out laughing.  Timmy laughs with
her.  Grant joins them.  He sits on a box and laughs.

                            GRANT
          I'm afraid there's no raft.

Grant gets up.  He reaches for the hands of the kids.  Timmy sees it -
the box Grant sat on is labeled: RAFT STORAGE.  Timmy smiles..


AT THE RIVER'S EDGE -

Grant pulls a cord.

With a LOUD HISS, the rubber begins to expand uncontrollably, jerking
and jumping like a wild marionette.  Then, with a whopping HISS-WHAP! it
pops fully open on the deck: a large bright yellow rubber raft.

Timmy and Lex climb in, wearing the life preservers.  Grant gets in and
pushes off with his oars.

The small disturbance causes the cicadas to ROAR.  The raft drifts out
into the lagoon.  Grant fixes his oars into the oarlocks.

Grant surveys the river.

                            GRANT
          Looks pretty calm.

THUMP.  The raft stops moving.  They are aground.  Lex looks overboard.
She reaches in
 about elbow deep.

Grant stands and puts the oars in the water.  He pushes with all his
might.  There is a long scraping sound of the raft against the mud
floor.  But it moves.  And the raft goes into deep enough water.

A general sigh of relief as they gently float downstream.


A WIDE AREA OF THE RIVER -

Grant energetically works the oars.

CLOSE ON - Lex lets her hand trail in the water.

                            LEX
          I'll row, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          No.

But he's sweating and takes a moment to rest.  Lex looks down at her
hand in the water.  It still trails.

                            LEX
          Hey, we're still moving.

Grant looks into the water.  She's right.

                            GRANT
          There's a current.

Grant lays back against the rubber gunwales, closes his eyes.  The two
kids look at him.

                            LEX
          You can't sleep.

                            GRANT
              (eyes closed)
          I'm not sl
eeping... yet.

                            LEX
          I'll do it!

Lex picks up the oars and begins.

                            TIMMY
          We gotta warn them about the boat.

Grant opens one eye and looks up at the sun in the sky.  He sighs and
takes up the oars again.  He rows powerfully with the current.


A BEND IN THE RIVER -

Current picks up speed.  The water begins to rush and ROAR.

                            TIMMY
          Cool!

White foam crashes on the raft and sprays the kids.  They burst out
laughing.  Grant smiles at them, but there is concern in his eyes.


ANOTHER BEND -

Now the raft is really racing.  The kids hold on tightly as the raft is
rocked.  White water crashed over, drenching the kids.  When Grant takes
a moment to look, he is soaked by a huge wave.

The raft tosses right and left.  Timmy holds the rubber grips.  He's
yanked to one side.  He's knocked to the raft floor.  Quickly gets his
grip again.  SHOUTS to Grant.

                            TIMMY
          Thought
 is looked calm?

                            GRANT
          Guess I was wrong.

Grant looks ahead.  The river widens.  The raft really starts to fly.

Lex, gripping very tightly, looks out.  Water sprays her again and
again.  Her face is serious.

                            LEX
          I can't swim!

Grant grabs the raft's tie line and pulls it out of its rubber rings.
He lashes it around Lex and Timmy.  Then he ties it around one of the
rubber grips.

                            GRANT
          Hold on real tight.

They go flying down the river.  The ROAR deafens.

The raft lifts out of the water.  And crashes down, rocking every way.

Jagged rocks appear.  Grant uses his paddle as a club to push off the
rocks and the rushing shoreline.  The kids duck from sudden overhanging
trees.

Grant looks ahead.  He blanches.

HIS POV - the surging edge of a tumultuous waterfall.

They're almost there.  At the huge waterfall, water rushes violently,
heaving over the magnificent precipice.

Timmy tries to tighten L
ex's vest but is thrown back down .  He YELLS:

                            TIMMY
          Hold my hand.  Hold my hand when we go.

The raft spins in the rushing water.  Everyone is thrown around.

The rope holding the kids to the raft tautens. The oars are wrestled out
of Grant's hands and go flying through the air, spilling over the edge.

At the last moment, Grant spots a tree branch arching over the cascade.
With all his might, he stands and holds his balance long enough. to let
his hands smash into the overhanging branch.

They stop right at the waterfall's edge.

Grant struggles mightily to hold onto the branch.  But the water keeps
rushing.  His strength ebbs.

                            TIMMY
          Don't let go!

Grant's veins pop out in his arms.  His hands start to slip off the wet
tree bark.  Lex watches his hands slowly lose their grip.

The rubber raft jumps and leaps below him.  Water pours into the raft.
Lex tries fruitlessly to let it out.  Timmy holds down Grant's feet.

               
             TIMMY
          You can do it!

                            GRANT
          I'm trying.  I'm trying ... Ooooo!!! ....

His hands slipping, slipping ...

                            GRANT
          No!!!!!

                                                      CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - The T-Rex, face down in the mud.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Arnold, Wu, Muldoon, and Ellie stare raptly at the monitor.

                            MULDOON
          Son-of-a-bitch.  He's taking a nap.
          Hasn't been this well fed ... ever.

Hammond is above, in his throne.  He calls down:

                            HAMMOND
          Could he drown in that position?  That's
          a very valuable animal.

                            MULDOON
          I know it's a valuable animal.

Muldoon takes a step up toward Hammond's throne and the two argue
quietly back and forth.  In the foreground, Wu calls Arnold over.

                            WU
          What's that, John?

Wu points to the screen behind 
Arnold's head.  In the upper right-hand
corner, it blinks a yellow warning:  AUX PWR LOW!  Ellie regards it.

                            ELLIE
          You running on auxiliary power?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm not.

                            WU
          Looks like you are.

                            ARNOLD
          Can't be.

                            WU
          Print the system status log.

Arnold nods and rapidly strikes keys.  In the corner, a printer whirs to
life.  Moments later, it spins out a single page.  Arnold tears it off.

Ellie continues to stare at the screen.  It now flashes red:  AUX PWR
FAIL!  An alarm klaxon BLARES.

Hammond holds his ears against the noise.  He stands up.

The room lights begin to FLASH.  They're reflected in Hammond's eyes.
Hammond ROARS above the chaos.

                            HAMMOND
          What the hell is going on?

Onscreen, numbers begin to count backward from ten.  Hammond lurches.
At zero, the lights go off, the monitors,
 even the computer.  Just the
alarms keep screaming.

                            HAMMOND
          You're ruining my ordered, precise park!

Arnold ignores him, keeps pressing buttons.  Hammond rushes toward
Arnold.  Arnold looks over his shoulder in surprise.  Hammond SCREAMS.

                            HAMMOND
          Fix my park, Arnold!  Fix it!

Arnold crosses his hands in front of his face, blocking Hammond's
attack.  Hammond grabs Arnold's wrists and the two twirl to the ground.
Breathing heavily, Hammond clutches his hand to his own chest.

Arnold stands up, brushes off.  He puts himself together, looks at
Hammond.  He SHOUTS over the siren:

                            ARNOLD
          I know it's hard, I know it's hard, but
          I'm going to put it all back together for
          you - I promise.  I will


BACK ON RAFT AT WATERFALL -

Grant still clings to the overhanging branch, holding the raft from
toppling over the crashing waterfall.  Lex and Timmy hold onto his legs.

The ROAR of the
 water diminishes.  And the flow subsides from a raging
current to a rolling river.  And then to a gentle stream.  A trickle.
Nothing.

Grant slowly relaxes, lets go.  So do the children.  Around the raft,
the water level begins to drain.  Gradually, Grant and the kids are left
in the raft sitting in just a few puddles of water.  Around them,
various pumps and other equipment is exposed where it was once covered
by rushing white water.

                            LEX
          The waterfall stopped.

                            TIMMY
          Waterfalls aren't supposed to stop.

                            GRANT
          I think they cut the power.  Hey -

He points and the three of them look over the edge where the waterfall
once poured.  There's a shimmering rainbow and beyond that, in the mist
is the visitor's center.

                            GRANT
          Well, there's our pot of gold.  Let's go,
          kids.

They grab his hands and clamber out of the raft, running toward shore.


BACK ON CON
TROL ROOM -

Muldoon pulls open the blinds and the hot sun filters in, so the room is
alternate patches of bright and dark.

In a hot corner, Ellie squats over a prostate Hammond, mopping his brow
with a cool cloth.  He murmurs, only barely intelligible.

                            HAMMOND
          Told him, fix my park, fix my park.

Wu brings the printout to Arnold.  The printout is a chronological
rendering of control room events since the restart.  It is clear they
have been running on auxiliary power.  Wu yells above the alarm:

                            WU
          You shut down as six thirty-four this
          morning, and when you started back up, it
          was with auxiliary power.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus.  The auxiliary generator fires up
          first and then that's used to start the
          main generator because it needs a heavy
          charge.  The main generator has to be
          manually reset.

                            WU
          Outside?  In
 the generator building?

Arnold nods.  Muldoon points to a line in the printout:

06:35:22   WARNING: FENCE STATUS (NB)  OPERATIVE - AUX POWER

                            MULDOON
          This doesn't mean the fences have been
          off since six-thirty, does it?

Arnold grabs the paper, looks at it, slams it down.

                            ARNOLD
          Backup power doesn't generate enough
          amperage to power the electrified fences,
          so they were automatically kept off.
          That's also why we had no phones or
          radio.

                            MULDOON
          All of the fences?

                            ARNOLD
          Yes.

                            MULDOON
          Including the velociraptor mesh?

                            ARNOLD
              (disgusted, exhausted)
          Yes, yes, yes.

In the corner, Hammond lifts his head and Ellie gently helps him to a
sitting position.

                            HAMMOND
          Do you mean those raptor
s could be loose?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm afraid so.

                            MULDOON
          No, no way.  Last time, it took 'em two
          days to chew through that mesh.  But give
          'em enough time, they'll get out.  We
          better get that power on now.

                            HAMMOND
          Regardless, check the pit.  Make sure
          there' five of them there.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - AFTERNOON

Muldoon and Arnold run across the lawn.  Muldoon carries his rocket
launcher at a ready position.  In the distance, the alarm still SOUNDS,
lights FLASH a continued warning.

They reach the maintenance building where the generator is housed.  Its
familiar him has been replaced by its own alarms.  The closer they
approach, the louder and brighter these alarms are.  Grey steam pours
out of the vents of the building, obscuring everything.

                            ARNOLD
          What's that steam coming out of my
          generator room?

           
                 MULDOON
          Relax, it's just refrigerated air.
          There's a leaky cooling pipe.  I fixed it
          a couple times before but the original
          installation was at too sharp an angle.

Arnold accepts this.  He is about to enter when Muldoon instructs him.

                            MULDOON
          Just go and turn on your generator, then
          get right back to the control room.

Arnold lights a cigarette and disappears into the steam-shrouded door.


EXT  RAPTOR PIT - AFTERNOON

Muldoon inspects an extremely discouraging sight.  The thick mesh that
covered the pit has been chewed through and ripped open.  With heavy gun
in one hand, Muldoon shines his flashlight into the pit.  It's empty.

Muldoon looks up.

MULDOON'S POV - the dense forest surrounding the Visitor's Center.

Muldoon examines the ground.  He locates the raptor prints leading away

Muldoon breaks into a run.


INT/EXT  GENERATOR ROOM - AFTERNOON

Muldoon comes back to the generator room still runnin
g full-tilt.  He
kicks open the door.  Steam pours out.  Standing in the thick steam,
Muldoon yells for Arnold.  No answer.  He steps in the doorway and
shines his flashlight around.

MULDOON'S POV - Only the dark abstract shapes of rakes and coiled ropes
and small machinery can be seen in the steam.

Muldoon yells again.  No answer at all.  Muldoon curses and leaves.

As soon as Muldoon is gone, there is movement.  Even above the sirens,
an animalistic breathing, grunting can be heard.  Obscured by steam and
flashing lights, a reptilian claw clutches a shadow.  A pack of
cigarettes falls to the ground, spilling out on the floor.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Muldoon enters and confronts Hammond, Ellie, and Wu,

                            MULDOON
          Raptors chewed their way out.  All five
          are out there.

                            ELLIE
          Arnold's not with you?

Muldoon looks around grimly.  He shakes his head.

                            MULDOON
          I was hoping he was ba
ck here already.

Hammond takes charge.

                            HAMMOND
          This is why my quarters were specially
          fortified.  To assist in an emergency just
          like this one.  Let's go.  Muldoon, round
          up the workers.  They'll go with us too.

Muldoon stares at Hammond, then drops it.  They prepare to go.

                            ELLIE
          Wait.  What about Arnold?


EXT  HILLSIDE, PARK -

Grant and the kids come over the hill.  Timmy sees the big fence and the
Visitor's Center close behind.

                            TIMMY
          We're home!

Lex and Grant happily run down the hill.


EXT  ELECTRIFIED FENCE IN PARK - AFTERNOON

Grant and the kids stand in the long shadows of the electric fence.
This huge fence is much higher than what Timmy has had to climb.  Grant
turns to him apologetically.

                            GRANT
          Sorry, Tim.  We gotta climb up.

                            TIM
          That's all right, Dr. Grant.  You owe me
   
       one.


EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - AFTERNOON

Wu stands at the open sliding gate of the perimeter fence surrounding
Hammond's quarters..  Next to him is Ellie.  Behind both of them,
launcher at the ready, is Muldoon.  Watching from the window above,
Hammond waves.  Ellie and Wu wear radio headsets.

                            MULDOON
          Okay Wu, I'll have you covered at every
          moment.  But this shell carries quite a
          punch, so if you're too close, it'll take
          a piece of you.  Ellie's on the headset
          with you.  If another ones come at you,
          let her know.  Then Ellie - you start
          jumping and yelling.  The buggers are
          easily distracted.  They'll come running
          and let Wu get that power on.  Then both
          of you, get behind this fence as quick as
          possible.

Wu and Ellie nod seriously and test radio contact.  We starts his way
across the lawn, Muldoon limps behind with his launcher.  Ellie stands
ready at the open 
gate.

Wu takes slow steps.  Muldoon follows.  Wu is just five feet away from
the door to the generator building.

CLOSE ON - Wu's tense face.

THE ATTACK is sudden and fierce.  It comes from the brush.  The raptor
leaps onto Wu in an instant.  Wu and the raptor roll on the ground.  Wu
struggles for his life.  Muldoon can't get a safe shot.  He SCREAM:

                            MULDOON
          Wu, get away.  Give me room to shoot.

Ellie comes running away from the safety of the gate.  She jumps up and
down, waving her hands, and SCREAMS:

                            ELLIE
          Hey you cretaceous dromaeosaur, you can't
          catch me.  Hey, come and get me, you
          flat-snouted Mongolian beast.  Hey!

The Raptor is distracted by this.  He lets Wu go for a moment, shaking
him loose from his bloody jaws.  Instantly, Wu rolls away.  Muldoon
fires the rocket launcher.  With a SIZZLE, the missile fires.  BOOM!
Direct hit!  The raptor is blown to tiny pieces.

Muldoon grabs Wu and pulls the inju
red man to safety.

                            MULDOON
          You ok?

In reply Wu gets to his feet, looks where the Raptor was.

                            WU
          Now, there's four.

Muldoon helps Wu back inside the fence.  He waves for Ellie to come in
and join them.

Ellie takes off toward the generator building.  She YELLS:

                            ELLIE
          I'm going in.  Muldoon, cover the door
          after I go in.  Wu, guide me!

Muldoon yells for her to wait but stops when he realizes that this may
be their best plan.

Ellie races like a gazelle across the open lawn.  She's very fast and
graceful.  She ducks into the generator building.

Above it all, Hammond watches at the small viewing window.


BACK ON - GRANT AND KIDS AT FENCE

The three are at the top of the fence now.  Grant carefully lifts Lex
above the barbed wire and she grabs onto the other side of the fence to
begin the climb down.  Grant grabs Tim and lifts him next.  Tim's tense
face is a river of sweat.


INT  GE
NERATOR BUILDING -

Ellie finishes the stairs and feels her way along the basement wall.
Her face is lit by a flashing yellow light.  She bangs her head on a
pipe.  She rubs her head.

                            ELLIE
          Damn, I banged my head.

                            WU (OVER RADIO)
          Oh that's good, that must be the water
          pipe.  You're really close now, there's a
          cabinet just above your head.  Reach up
          and open it.  The handle turns to the
          left.

Ellie turns the handle.  The cabinet opens.

                            WU (OVER RADIO)
          It's a large throw-switch.  Pull it down,
          count to three, and push it back up.
          That's all there is to it.

Ellie throws it down.  She counts:

                            ELLIE
          One -


BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -

Just a few feet from the bottom of the fence.


BACK ON ELLIE -

                            ELLIE
          Two -


BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -

Grant and Timmy jump down. 
 Lex is just behind.  Her sneaker catches in
the fence pattern.  She pulls on it.


BACK ON ELLIE -

                            ELLIE
          Three!

She throws the large switch back.


BACK ON LEX -

She jumps off the fence.  Her sneaker comes off, falls to the ground.

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON LEX - it celebrates her narrow escape.

Grant casually leans against the fence to help Lex with her shoe.
NOTHING!  STILL NO ELECTRIC FENCES!

The Visitor's Center is in sight.  They all turn to each other.  Elated.

                            LEX
          We did it!

                            TIM
          We made it!

Lex jumps up and down.  Grant smiles, high-fives Timmy.


BACK ON ELLIE -

The siren and the flashing lights stop.  The room lights go on.  Ellie
turns to go back upstairs.  Her foot slips, she falls to the ground.
She has slipped on a pool of blood.  She jumps up, recoils.

It's Arnold.  She squelches a SCREAM, covering her own mouth.

SMASH!  Ellie SCREAMS as a raptor lunges at her.   He jumps down
 from
above the water pipe Ellie banged her head on.

Ellie turns and races toward a ventilation shaft.  She dives into it.
The raptor gets there a second late and smashes against the shaft wall.

Ellie pushes herself against the shaft wall and, using her legs to push
against the wall, begins to climb up.

The raptor smashes against the shaft again and gets inside.  Ellie
scrambles up.  The raptor snarls and spits but it is momentarily pinned.

Ellie continues her scramble up the shaft.  At ground level, she slams
her feet hard against a vent, popping it open.  Scraping the wall and
banging against pipes, she races toward the door.


EXT  GENERATOR BUILDING - CONTINUING ACTION

Ellie runs full-tilt toward the fence surrounding Hammond's quarters.
Wu, injured, lies within the safety of the fenced area.  Muldoon stands
with his rocket launcher just outside the fence waiting for Ellie.
Ellie screams to him as she speeds across the lawn.

                            ELLIE
          Raptor!

The raptor EXPLODES th
rough the door of the generator building after
Ellie.

Muldoon fires at the raptor. Misses.  No time to reload.

The raptor gains on Ellie.  Muldoon ducks inside the fence's heavy gate.
He slides the gate half-shut, waving Ellie on.

Ellie dives inside the safety of the fence, losing her headset as she
goes.  The gate is almost closed.  The raptor lunges.

Muldoon slides shut the heavy gate, bashing the raptor's head with all
his might.  The raptor shudders, caught in the gate.  Stunned, for a
second, it doesn't move.

Ellie and Muldoon run to the building.  They push open the steel-clad
security door and dive inside.  Wu limping, chases after them.  With a
curse, Muldoon pushes the door back open, waves for Wu.

ELLIE AND MULDOON'S POV - Wu runs frantically.  The raptor jerks out of
the gate, inside of the fence.  He races after Wu.

                            WU
          Keep it open!  I'm coming!

Wu runs faster.  The raptor gains on him.  Wu screams, runs spastically.
Wu and the raptor are neck-and-neck
, equally close to the open door.

                            ELLIE
          Come on, Wu!  Come on!  Run!

The raptor is inches from Wu.  Both are closer and closer to the door.

                            ELLIE
          They're coming inside!

                            WU
          Help!

Wu and the raptor are at the door.

                            MULDOON
          No they're not, Ellie.

Muldoon slams the door shut on Wu and the raptor.  Wu's screams are
horrific.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - CONTINUING ACTION

Ellie drops to her knees, her chest heaving, pulls her headset off with
a bleeding hand.  Muldoon, affected, turns to her.

                            MULDOON
          I couldn't compromise everyone's safety.

Ellie nods, catches her breath.

                            ELLIE
          Why didn't the power go on?

                            MULDOON
          You just reset the power.  Now the
          computer has to be booted.

Muldoon looks out the tiny barred window of the security do
or.

MULDOON'S POV - There is already almost no sign of Wu.  The gate to the
perimeter fence slides shut.  The raptor looks up.  He is trapped within
the perimeter fence of Hammond's quarters.

CAMERA SLOWLY TILTS to the viewing window above.  Hammond stares down.


INT  VISITOR'S CENTER -

Grant and kids walk through the open security doors.  All is empty and
quiet.  They call out but there are no answers.

                            LEX
          Where did everybody go?

Grant thinks.

                            GRANT
          Probably your grandfather's quarters.
          Let's go.

A DISTANT BELLOW.  Grant reconsiders.

                            GRANT
          Actually, stay here.

He corrals the kids into the half completed enclosure of the Gift Shop.

                            LEX
          No, I want to stay with you.

Grant looks around tensely.

                            GRANT
          No, keep an eye on things round here for
          me.  I'll be back with the others.

                 
           TIMMY
          What about -

Grant looks at Timmy.

                            GRANT
          I'll radio the ship as soon as I find
          somebody.  (beat)  You're in charge now.
          Don't move from here ... unless you have
          to, ok?

Timmy nods.  Lex is happy, sinks to the floor.

                            LEX
          Goody!  I'm gonna rest.

She finds a box of wind-up dinosaur toys. She winds one. Sends it
walking to Timmy.

                            TIMMY
          Tired!  He carried you the whole way.

Grant slips off into the concealing shadows of the skeletal display of
the T-rex and raptor in combat.  He looks back above his own shoulder
into the menacing jaws of the skeletal raptor.  He shouts back.

                            GRANT
          Be right back.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

It's a madhouse in the crowded baronial quarters of Hammond.  Gennaro is
singing at the top of his-lungs while Harding tries to restrain him.
Scared Workers huddle together, many a
re injured.  Hammond sits on the
floor, in a meditative trance.

Ellie and Muldoon stare out the window.

THEIR POV - The raptor is jumping in the air.  With every jump he comes
closer to leaping onto the roof of their small building.

Muldoon regards his rocket launcher ruefully.

                            ELLIE
          Why don't you just nail that bastard?

                            MULDOON
          No more ammo.  I requisitioned six
          charges but the bean-counter -
              (he thrusts a finger at Hammond)
          - cut it down to two.

Ellie looks up to the ceiling.  There is a large glass skylight with
crisscrossing iron bars casting an ominous shadow in the sun.


EXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - DAY

The ship continues along smooth sunlit sea.  Land is in distant sight.


INT  STATEROOM -

The cracked egg is nudged open.  The cute scaly head of a six-inch baby
raptor nuzzles its way out of the shell.  It shakes off a few pieces of
clinging shell and immediately begins to devour one of the
 remaining eggs.

                                                      CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - The wind-up dinosaur skitters across the polished floor.  It
bands against the  the wall again and again.

Timmy looks down at it and smiles at Lex.

                            LEX
          Any candy behind the counter?

                            TIMMY
          Hungry?

                            LEX
          Starved.

Timmy looks behind the counter.  He sees boxes of goods.  He moves a
stack of umbrellas out of his way.  Lex gets up and pulls one out.

                            TIMMY
          Nothing.

                            LEX
          Let's go to the kitchen.

She smiles and pops to her feet.  Timmy's not sure.

                            TIMMY
          Dr. Grant said -

                            LEX
          - let's go.  We'll come right back.

CLOSE ON - Timmy's torn face.  He's hungry, too.

He makes the right decision.

                            TIMMY
          Nope.  We're waiting here t
ill Dr. Grant
          gets back.  He'll help us get some -

Interrupted by A SOUND.  A rhythmic, horrible BREATHING.   Now some
light and rapid STEPS.  And a SNIFFING.  It's definitely an animal.

Lex backs off in a hurry. She knocks the umbrella over.  It skirts
across the floor.  It spins and opens by itself.  Printed on it is the
ferocious face of the Spitter, the sides of its bright poisonous gills
spinning to a stop.

The breathing gets closer and closer.  The children huddle together in a
corner of the gift shop.  They SCREAM.

It's A RAPTOR, lean and ferocious.  More like a cyborg than a hunter, it
studies the kids from just outside the gift shop entrance.  His eyes
flick back and forth between the two pieces of meat.

Timmy grabs the box of toy dinosaurs.  He winds one up and sends it off
across the hall.  The raptor glances over at the moving toy.  Timmy
grabs another, whispers as he winds it.

                            TIMMY
          Start winding now!

Lex and Timmy wind toy after toy, send th
em across the hall.  The raptor
leaps, crushing one in its jaws.  Others waddle by.  The raptor dodges
and darts, grabbing this one, smashing that one.

The kids go running out into the hall.  They race down the Visitor
Center corridor.  Timmy pulls Lex behind him toward the restaurant.

                            LEX
          Where are we going?

                            TIM
          The kitchen!


INT/EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

With a huge leap, the raptor finally makes it to the roof of Hammond's
quarters.  He jumps lightly onto the skylight.  Glass shatters over the
assembled guests and workers below.  Total commotion and SCREAMS.

The raptor immediately begins to gnaw at the iron bars that block the
skylight.  Below, they shake off shards of glass and huddle in the
corners.  Ellie turns to Muldoon.

                            ELLIE
          How long?

                            MULDOON
          Well, they seem to be getting faster all
          the time. I would say - fifteen minutes.

Ellie no
tices something out the window.  It's Grant approaching the
gate.  She hammers on the glass.

Grant's hand reaches for the knob.

The raptor stops gnawing, its ears perked up.

Ellie screams and screams.

Grant notices some of Wu's remains inside the gate.  He stops and looks
up.  At the window, Ellie waves her arms, warning him not to enter.
Grant stops.  He sees Wu's headset on the grass, reaches through the
fence, grabs it, puts it on.

Ellie jumps up and gets her headset.  She barks into it.

                            ELLIE
          There's a raptor on the roof of this
          building.  Open that gate and you're a
          dead man.

Grant stares up at Ellie in the window.  He waves.  She presses her hand
to the glass.

                            GRANT
          Ellie, I'm go glad -

                            ELLIE
          Shut up and listen.  We have about
          fifteen minutes here.  The computer has
          to be rebooted.  That'll turn on the
          electric fences.  Besides the r
aptor
          stuck in here with us, there are four
          more ...

Grant races back to the Visitor's Center as she continues to fill him in.


INT  KITCHEN, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION

The kids hurtle through this huge, industrial kitchen.  The kitchen is a
maze of turns, from the hot lamp pickup area to the rows of stainless
steel burners to the chopping blocks to the potwashing area.  The kids
dart and duck from one area to the next, taking shortcuts under tables,
crawling behind counters, scattering pots and pans behind.

Relentlessly, with a casual speed, the raptor stalks them.  It avoids
their obstacles with a casual grace and when it cannot fit through their
shortcuts, it just continues around.

Timmy pulls open the large silvered door of the freezer.  Lex starts to
hurry inside.  Timmy grabs her.

                            TIMMY
          We'll freeze to death in there.

                            LEX
          He's going to eat us!

Timmy reaches into the freezer and grabs a pile 
of steaks.  He tosses one
toward the raptor.  The raptor gobbles it in one bite.  Timmy shoves Lex
out of the way and begins to toss the steaks on the floor.  One after the
other, he tosses them, in a row, closer and closer to the open freezer.

The raptor mechanically gobbles the steaks, following their path.  He
continues right into the freezer to grab the last of Tim's bait.

Tim leaps and slams the heavy freezer door shut.  Lex comes running and
throws her small weight alongside of Timmy's.

                            TIMMY
          PUSH!

The heave and the lock catches on the door.  From inside, there is a
strangled CRY and the door is slammed repeatedly.  The metal panels of
the door buckle but they do not break.  The door hinges bend and curve
but they do not give.

The kids collapse in relief on the kitchen floor.  In just a moment,
Timmy is back on his feet.

                            LEX
          What is it, Timmy?

                            TIMMY
          I just remembered something.  Rapto
rs are
          born in large litters.  There's probably
          more coming.  We gotta hide.

He grabs her hand and they run out of the back entrance of the kitchen.
There's a stairway and they race up.


INT  GIFT SHOP -

Grant, wearing his headset, calls for the kids and looks around the gift
shop with concern.  He sniffs the air and examines the crushed windup
toys.  He sees some animal scales on the floor.  He hears a NOISE above
and begins to run.


INT  UPPER FLOOR HALLWAY, VISITOR'S CENTER -

The kids hear this NOISE too and it's closer to them.  They bust into -


INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY -

The kids knock over trays of stones as they rush through this room.


INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY -

Automated drills whir as Tim and Lex crash through, knocking equipment
to the ground.  The drills still whir on the ground.


INT  GENETICS ROOM -

The Hamachi-Hood sequencers explode in a heap of punch cards and
magnetic tape as the kids race by.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY -

The kids slide int
o this room.  They race to its far corner, past
incubators and display cases of chemicals.  They look back and see -

KID'S POV - A raptor happily gorging itself on a table of eggs.  He's
been in this room, their place of refuge, the whole time.

CLOSE ON - The raptor's glistening eyes register the children.

He begins to stalk.  The kids SCREAM.  This time there is nowhere to go.

The raptor closes in on the kids.  Timmy feebly stands in front of his
younger sister.

CLOSE ON - The raptor licks its lips, lizard-like.

At the other end of the room, GRANT ENTERS quickly.  He surveys the
situation.  Quickly, he grabs an egg off a table.  He reaches into one
of the chemical cabinets with POISON WARNINGS prominently displayed.  He
comes out with a syringe and a vial.

The raptor is almost on the kids.  Grant coughs conspicuously.  The
raptor whirls, studies Grant.  He looks back at the children.

Grant speaks into the headset.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Talk, Ellie, just keep talking.

He tosses the headset on the ground.  Ellie's voice crackles out.  The
raptor studies it, transfixed.

Grant injects the egg, then gently rolls it on the ground.  The raptor
forgets the headset.  He comes forward and sniffs the egg, then sucks it
up, swallowing it whole.

The raptor turns back to the kids.  He takes two steps toward them,
tenses to pounce - and keels over.  DEAD.

The kids race around the dead raptor to Grant.  Grant grabs his headset
as the three run out of the room.  Grant addresses Timmy as they run.

                            GRANT
          Timmy, you know anything about computers?

                            TIMMY
          Well, I just got an XT at home.  I told
          my Dad I wanted a 386.

                            GRANT
          Ok good, you're elected.


INT  CONTROL ROOM -

Grant and Tim and Lex study the quiet room.  Grant speaks calmly into
his headset.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Okay, we've reached the computer room.
          Who can te
ll Timmy how to reboot?

                            ELLIE (OVER RADIO)
          Ah, Alan, nobody here knows how to boot
          the computer.  Please hurry, we've only
          got a couple minutes left.

                            GRANT
          Tim, you got to book the system.  They
          reset the power and there are no phones.
          We gotta turn on the fences and we gotta
          stop that ship.

                            LEX
          Are they going to be ok?

                            GRANT
          If we can get help very soon.

                            TIMMY
          Sshh, you guys, I'm thinking.

He studies a grid on a large console.  He reaches out and touches a part
of the screen.  There is a beep and a warning sign - INVALID ARGUMENT.
PLEASE TRY AGAIN.


BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

The raptor has chewed almost all the way through the bars.  Panic below.
In the middle of it all, Ellie is focused, listening on her headset.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Timmy tries somethin
g else.  BEEP.  Lex raises a hand.  Grant stops her.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Ellie, we're working as fast as we can
          here.

Timmy tries a screen section.  BEEP.  Again. BEEP.  Again.  BEEP.  BEEP.

Timmy shakes his head.  In desperation he stabs at the keyboard below
the touch screen.  He punches the ESCAPE button.

The screen lights up a new message - SYSTEM RESET COMPLETED.  ALL
SYSTEMS NORMAL.


BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

The raptor has just chewed through.  He squeezes his body into the space
as the bars ELECTRIFY.  Spastically, the raptor jerks back and forth as
the current flows through him.  He can't get out.

Finally, with a WHIMPER, he stops struggling and slides through the
space he created.  With a THUMP, he drops to the floor below.

Ellie, Muldoon, Hammond and the workers look on in shock.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Grant cheers and hugs Timmy.  Lex whoops.

                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)
          Ok, we're all right here for now.
      
    Thanks.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Don't mention it.  It was Timmy.

                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)
          But there's still one more raptor.  So be
          careful.

Timmy is pushing menus and submenus on the touchscreen now.
COMMUNICATIONS - RADIO - VEHICULAR ...  He gets the one he wants.

He indicates the radio-mike to Grant.

                            TIM
          I think this is the boat.  They called it
          the Queen Anne or something.

Grant grabs the mike.

                            GRANT
          Queen Anne, do you read me?  Queen Anne?

The radio crackles to life.

                            RADIO
          This is the Queen Anne B?  I copy.
          What's up?

                            GRANT
          Report your position!

                            RADIO
          Ah, we're just about to dock here in
          Puntaremas.  Who wants to know?  Please
          identify yourself.

Tim punches the screen which displays FARRELL, F
REDERICK D. (CAPT.)
Grant reads it and nods.  His voice is tough as nails.

                            GRANT
          Try this for identification, Captain
          Farrell.  You are in possession of stolen
          biological materials.  If you don't turn
          that boat around and return to Isla
          Nublar immediately with your contraband
          cargo, you will be found in violation of
          Section 509 of the Uniform Maritime Act,
          you will be subject to revocation of
          license, penalties in excess of fifty
          thousand dollars, and five years in jail.
          Do you copy?

SILENCE.

                            GRANT
          Do you copy, Captain Farrell?

                            RADIO
          I copy.  All ahead stern.

A blinking light on a map indicates that the ship is pulling away from
the harbor.  Grant nods to Timmy who terminates the radio contact.

                            TIMMY
          What's the Uniform Maritime Code?

                     
       GRANT
          Who the hell knows?

Grant and Timmy start to celebrate again when Lex interrupts.

                            LEX
          What good does that do?  To have the ship
          turn around?

Grant turns to her seriously.

                            GRANT
          Well it gives us ten more hours.
              (to Timmy)
          Let's see if we can raise the Costa Rican
          Coast Guard on that thing.

The last raptor smashes into the control room through Hammond's viewing
window.  Glass goes flying.  Grant and kids go running into the hallway.


INT ROTUNDA -

With the raptor in hot pursuit, the kids and Grant come flying.  Tim and
Lex jump over the railing, leaping onto the skeletal display.  Grant
goes for the stairs, jumping down them three at a time.

The raptor goes after the kids, scrambling over the balcony onto the
display.  The kids scamper down the display, knocking paint cans and
tools off the scaffolding as they go.  The raptor is just one beat
behind, and his snar
ling face is splashed with red paint as he chases.

The kids burrow into the rib cage of the Rex.  They break off floating
rubs and hurl them back at the raptor.  The raptor is undeterred,
closing the gap on the kids.

The kids are stuck at the end of the rib cage - it's closed off by the
skeleton and they can't break through.  They're imprisoned.  The raptor
is pushing through the rib cage, bones crackling as it goes.

Grant leaps up the scaffolding, grabs a beam, swings his weight onto it,
and slams it into the T-Rex's neck.  The neck shatters and the massive
head of the T-Rex drops free.

It falls directly onto the last raptor, squashing him flat.  Dead.

                            GRANT
              (grimly)
          And then there were none.


EXT  HELICOPTER PAD - DUSK

Muldoon leads his workers onto an army helicopter.  Two workers carry
Gennaro on a stretcher.  Ellie boards with the kids on each side of her,
holding her hands.

Grant and Hammond walk together, toward the helicopter.

              
              HAMMOND
          Dr. Grant, don't abandon this beautiful
          place.  I need a man just like you to
          help me get my park back on its feet
          again.  And it will be on its feet again.

                            GRANT
          We have to leave now.

Hammond stops.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh you don't know.  There are wonderful
          plans in the works, sites already
          purchased for Euro-Jurassic and Jurassic
          Japan.

Grant is unimpressed.  He holds a hand out to Hammond.  Hammond tries a
new approach.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't you see I've exalted human
          potential here?  You must see it.  You
          must feel it.  I called back a life form.
          Listen, Dr. Grant, don't go.  Be a part
          of this.  I'm inviting you to do just
          that - let the others go, if they want.

                            GRANT
          You interrupted natural law.  There are
          regulations,
 rules that nature follows
          that make her knowable.

                            HAMMOND
          You mean there are rules that nature
          follows that create barriers to our
          knowledge.

                            GRANT
          Barriers?  Like the seasons?  The earth
          spinning, orbiting the sun?  The entire
          solar system in interlocking motion.  Our
          own beings in biological step with it
          all.  Mr. Hammond, you've disrupted the
          pattern and look what it's done!

                            HAMMOND
          I know what it's done.  I've made
          triceratops and gallimimus and a T-Rex.
          I've got a batch of iguanadons being born
          on Tuesday.  What do you say to that?

                            GRANT
          Don't count on it.  Now get in.

Grant jumps in the copter, holds out a hand to Hammond.

                            GRANT
          You created mutant forms that you further
          mutated to create amus
ement attractions.
          You made biological puppets with
          heartbeats and an early death sentence.

                            HAMMOND
          I created genetic miracles!

                            GRANT
          You created a park to generate a profit-
          making merchandising operation.

                            HAMMOND
          The merchandise is just a by-product.
          Souvenirs for people to reflect on the
          wonder.  You fainted when you saw the
          brachiosaur.  Alan, look, let's not
          argue.  The problem is that my employees
          were not up to par with my dream.  They
          failed me.  The park, I promise you, is
          safe.  It really is.

Grant grabs Hammond's arm, starts to tug.

                            GRANT
          You park is doomed.  Now come with me.
          
                            HAMMOND
          It is not!  It's blooming!  In the throes
          of labor!  You are one more more negative
          voice in a 
universe of negativity.
          You'll amount to nothing.  You'll be a
          bone-brusher all your life.  I pity you.

Hammond pulls his arm away and strides away from the helicopter just as
the ROTORS START UP.  Hammond's suit whips in the wind.  Grant calls to
him, reaching out his arm.

                            GRANT
          Come back, Mr. Hammond!  It's over!

Hammond keeps walking.  He disappears over a grassy knoll.

Grant's outstretched hand drops to his side when THE ATTACK comes.

With a huge bellow, the T-Rex comes charging at the helicopter.  THE
PILOT screams for all to board as he starts to lift off.

The Rex bites onto the copter skid as the copter tries to escape.  The
copter angles dangerously as the Rex holds on.

Ellie fires a fire-extinguisher into the furious face of the Rex and its
jaws relax.  The copter escapes and starts to climb high into the sky.
The Rex paws after it, then drops down to four legs and gives the copter
a final swipe with its tail.

The tail SWISHES through 
the air and CRACKS against the plexiglass
windshield which fissures and pops.  The pilot struggles to maintain
altitude and manages to keep the craft in the air.

With a ROAR of its own, the copter breaks into the blue sky and soars.
away, leaving an angry T-Rex alone.  Unnoticed by the frustrated Rex,
Hammond slips away and walks into the jungle.


IN THE COPTER -

SLOWLY PAN the exhausted faces of Muldoon and his workers, Lex and Timmy
holding onto each other, and Grant huddles next to Ellie.  He reaches
out and puts an arm around her shoulder.  She reaches up and pulls his
arm close.

                            ELLIE
          They're so beautiful.  They're condemned,
          aren't they?  Even those embryo fragments
          had the same viral contamination.

                            GRANT
          I have a theory.

Ellie looks up in surprise.  She give him a big smile.

                            ELLIE
          You have a theory?

Grant smiles back at her.

                            GRANT
   
       I think that they could never completely          
          isolate the dinosaur DNA.  There was
          always some microscopic mosquito
          contamination.  But at the molecular
          level, that was enough.  Every dinosaur
          received the same genetic massage, the
          encoding that every mosquito gets to
          terminate life after a season.

                            ELLIE
          So the very process itself was flawed.

She's sad.  Grant hugs her.  Over her shoulder he gives a parting glance
to the island.  A green jewel in a blue sea.  Suddenly it is obliterated
by clouds.

CAMERA PANS AWAY AND SWOOPS DOWN from the copter.  IT CROSSES the sky.
THE CAMERA DESCENDS to Isla Nublar, slowly reveling in its natural
beauty and finally coming to earth in the midst of the verdant jungle.


IN THE JUNGLE - MAGIC HOUR

Hammond slowly climbs a steep hill covered with creeping growth.  He
almost reaches the top when he slips.  He falls to the soft ground and
rolls. He tumbles he
lplessly, rolling and spinning down the sharp drop,
finally coming to a complete stop in a shallow pool of water.  Face
down, his head splashes into the puddle.  No movement. Just the sound of
labored breath.

CAMERA PANS to Hammond's hand, half-submerged in water.  CAMERA MOVES
INTO EXTREME CLOSEUP as a mosquito lands on his hand.

                                         RACK OUT AND DISSOLVE TO:


EXT  OCEAN - NIGHT

The army copter circles lower and lower as it finds the Queen Anne B,
slowly drifting across the moonlit water.

                                                      FADE OUT.

	Illegal Costa Rican parasail operator ENRIQUE CARDOSO helps
	Americans BEN HILDEBRAND and twelve-year-old ERIC KIRVY --

	person PARASAIL HARNESS.


3 	EXT. BOAT - DAY 							3

	Ben and Eric clamber onto a makeshift PLATFORM that hangs over
	the back of the board. Dangling from Ben's neck is a CAMCORDER.

				BEN
		You make sure to get us as close as you can,
		okay? If it's a good trip, I'll give you a

				ENRIQUE
		Don't worry. I take you close. But not too

		You don't want them to eat you.

	Enrique heads toward the driver's seat and a large SECOND-HAND
	WINCH bolted to the deck.

				ENRIQUE (CONT'D)
		Ready, amigos?

	Ben and Eric nod excitedly and give the thumbs up. Ben lifts the
	camcorder to the record the action.

	Enrique jams the down the throttle down, and with a loud RAOR, the
	speedboat shoots forward. Soon the boat is whipping across the 
	rolling ocean.

	Strapped together, Ben and Eric lean back over the passing
	water, intently watching for Enrique's signal.

	As the boat picks up speed, Enrique eyes the speedometer.

	Ben grabs the end of the RIPCORD attached to the harness. He and
	Eric braces themselves.

	Enrique finally signals with a pulling motion. He pulls
	the winch, Ben yanks the cord and - 

	WOOOSH! A brightly colored PARASAIL blossoms behind the boat,
	hoisting Ben and Eric aloft. In a big BLOCK LETTERS on the
	parasail is stitched "DINO-SOAR."

	THE TOWNLINE unsold rapidly from its enormous reel.

	BEN AND ERIC climb higher and higher.

	ENRIQUE keeps an eye on the clients. When they reach a certain 
	height, he LOCKS OFF the reel.

	High overhead, Ben and Eric are floating in wonderful, quiet
	splendor. The motor of the boat now sounds strangely distant.

	Down below, the boat enters a think blanket of FOG.

	Eric points excitedly at the islands as Ben films him with the
	camera.

	Then, a sudden TUG on the thing line cause Ben to drop the camera,
	which now dangles from his neck.

				ERIC
		What was that?

	A second tug...and now the faintest of screams.

	Ben and Eric look down to find that the boat has disappeared
	into the low bank of FOG.

	By the time the boat emerges on the far side of the mist...THEIR
	IS NO SIGN OF ENRIQUE. The deck is splattered with blood.

	As Ben considers the driverless boat...

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Ben!

	Ben glances over at Eric, staring in horror at something 
	below. Following his gaze, Ben finds that their boat is only
	moments away from crashing into A LARGE REEF.

	Sticking out of the water, the imposing reef is being battered
	by waves.

	AS THE BOAT SMASHES INTO THE REEF, it splinters into a
	number of pieces.

	A panicked Ben turns to Eric.

				BEN
		Unclip your line!

	Eric and Ben frantically unclip their lines. Catching an
	updraft, the parasailers float upward.

	A strong wind sends them wafting over the daunting cliffs
	of ISLA SORNA...


4 	EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - DAY 					4

	TWO PLASTIC DINOSAURS enter the frame and do battle accompanied
	by a child's ferocious sounds.

				CHILD (O.S.)

		RRRRROW! GRRRRRR!

	WINDER TO REVEAL -

	CHARLIE, a three-year old boy, plays in a sandbox with his
	favorite toy dinosaurs. ALAN GRANT squats next to him and
	watches with great delight.

	ELLIE SATLER stands over them, an INFANT in her arms -- a
	picture of the perfect family.

				GRANT
		Oh, actually, Charlie, those two are
		herbivores. They wouldn't be interested in
		fighting each other. But these...
			(picking up two other dinosaurs)
		See, these are carnivores. And this one here
		-- see its claws -- this one here uses its
		claws to gouge at the throat of its opponent

	As Grant demonstrates with some GRUNT and GROANS of his
	own, he only succeeds in frightening the boy.

				ELLIE
			(interrupting)
		Uh, Alan?


				GRANT
		Hmm?

				ELLIE
		He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a
		little older?


				GRANT
		Oh, right.
			(back to Charlie)
		Happy dinosaurs.

	He bounces them along the sandbox edge.

	Then, the sound of a CAR ENGINE turning off and a door
	SLAMMING is heard.

				ELLIE
		That must be Mark.
			(calling out)
		Mark, were back here!

	Ellie and Grant turn to see --

MARK DEGLER coming through the gate carrying a briefcase. He's their age, handsome but not annoyingly so, with a friendly,
	balance demeanor.

	He and Ellie kiss tenderly on the lips.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		Good day?

				MARK
		Keeping the world safe.
			(re: baby)
		Here, let me take her.

	Ellie hands off the baby.

				ELLIE
		Mark, this is Alan Grant.

				MARK
		Nice to meet you, Alan. I've heard a lot about
		you.

	The two men shake hands, and we now realize it is Grant
	who is the stranger in this household. Little Charlie runs to
	his father, showing his dinosaur.

				CHARLIE
		Daddy, this is a herbabore.

	Grant smiles uncomfortably, a third wheel.


5 	INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 					5

	WINDEN to a PARROT in a large cage. Grant is teasing 
the bird with a cookie, holding a it just out of reach.

				GRANT
		What's my name? Come on, Jack, say it. Is my
		name Alan? Say my name.

		The bird doesn't respond.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		He used to know me.

				ELLIE
		Sorry, Alan it's been six years.

	Grant shrugs, gives Jack the cookie, and heads towards the table.
	The three adults are finishing their dessert and coffee. The
	The children have been out to bed.

	An awkward moment of silence. Uncomfortable smiles. Then --

				MARK
		More coffee?

				ELLIE
			(relived)
		Yes. Great.

	Mark stands and collects their cups.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		So, Mark's working at the State Department
		now.

				GRANT
		Really? 
(To Mark)
What do you do there?

				MARK
			(with mock bravado)
		I could tell you about it, but than I'd have to
		kill you.

				GRANT
		Indeed.

	Mark smiles, nodding. Then he goes into the kitchen. Another
	uncomfortable silence.

				ELLIE
	So what are you working on now?

				GRANT

	We have a new site in Montana. At least until
	the money runs out.

				ELLIE
		Anything good?

				GRANT
		Raptors, mostly.

				ELLIE
		My favorite.

	Grant leans forward, realizing Ellie's one of the few people he
	can talk to about this.

				GRANT
		You remember the sounds they made?

				ELLIE
		I try not to.

				GRANT
		We've done cranial scans, and raptors
		actually had a quite sophisticated
		resonating chamber. I have a theory that
		their ability to vocalize is the key to their
		social intelligence. The way they can work
		together as a team.

				ELLIE
		You think they could talk to each other?

				GRANT
		To a degree we never imagined.

	And from the cage in the corner of the room...

				JACK
		Bullshit!

	Both look back at the parrot. ELLIE smiles.

				ELLIE
		You taught him that.


6 	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 					6

	Ellie and Grant head toward the rental car parked in the
	driveway.

				ELLIE
		Good luck with the fund raising.

				GRANT
		It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park,
		you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils
		are out. Everyone wants to see a real live
		dinosaur.

				ELLIE
		Times change Alan. But you're the still the
		best. I mean that.

				GRANT
		The last of my breed.

	A long moment passes between them as both consider where
	they've ended up.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		I'd better get going.

				ELLIE
		Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad
		about asking for help, but please ask me.
		Anything, anytime.

				GRANT
			(deep down knowing he never
			 will)
		Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.

				ELLIE
		Goodbye, Alan.

	Not sure what the right thing to do is, they finally end up with
	a friendly hug. They keep it short.

	Grant gets in his car. Starts the ENGINE.

	He's about to pull off when Ellie knocks on the window. He rolls
	it down.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		When I met you, I thought that one day
		millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs
		became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me
		otherwise. When conditions changed,
		dinosaurs changed. They became other things.
		They evolved.

				GRANT
		A well-accepted theory.

				ELLIE
			(simply)
		Alan don't be afraid to evolve.

	Grant hears her, but Ellie knows it didn't really get through.
	A forced half-smile, than Grant waves goodbye.

	Ellie watches as he drives off.


7 	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY 						7

	The last stop on Grant's fund-raising tour, it's a public
	lecture hosted by some foundation. There are SCIENTISTS and
	STUDENTS here, but also a lot of DINO-FANS, some even with
	costumes.

	Grant finishes his speech to what was a full house -- some
	ATTENDEES are grabbing their coats and sneaking out. This
	wasn't the exciting guest speaker they were all expecting.

	A new slide comes up. Just black and white, and indecipherable.

				GRANT
		It's through the painstaking study of the
		Interior chamber in multiple specimens that
		we can determine this exciting correlation
		between the larynx and the upper plate. That
		lets us theorize -- theorize, mind you -- that
		the raptor might have been capable of bird-
		like vocalizations. Which as you can
		imagine, would be a tremendous breakthrough.

	He's finished, but no one seems to notice at first. Then the
	SYMPOSTUM LEADER stands up, leading a smattering round of
	APPLAUSE.

				SYMPOSTIUM LEADER
		Thank you very much Dr. Grant. Now does
		anyone have a question?

	Nearly every hand goes up. Grant doesn't seem surprised.

				GRANT
		Does anyone have a question that doesn't 
		relate to Jurassic Park?

	Quite a few hands go down.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		Or the incident in San Diego, which I'll
		remind you, I did not witness.

	Now most of the hands are down. Picking one of the few
	remaining...

				MALE STUDENT
		Your theory on raptors is good and all, but
		isn't all this conjecture kind of moot?

	The STUDENT'S BUDDY nods in agreement.

				MALE STUDENT (CONT'D)
		I mean, once the U.N. and Costa Rica and
		everyone decides how to handle the second
		island, scientist will just go in and look
		for themselves.

				TOO-CLEVER SCIENCE REPORTER
		Isn't paleontology itself in danger of
		extinction?

	Recognizing those as fighting words, the symposium leader is
	about to step in. But Grant will take this himself.

				GRANT
		No, and let me be perfectly clear on this
		point. Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago.
		What's left of them is fossilized in stone
		the actual scientists spend years to
		undercover.
								   (MORE)

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		what John Hammond and InGen created are
		theme park monsters. Nothing more, nothing
		less.

		The class clearly disagrees with his assessment.

				ANOTHER STUDENT
		You're saying you wouldn't want to study
		them if you had the chance?

				GRANT
		No force on this earth or in heaven could get me on
		that island.


8 	INT. DERELICT COCKPIT - DAY 					8

	Looking through the cracked windshield of a junkyard plane, we
	see someone spray painting red circles on the outside of the
	glass.


9 	EXT. AIRCRAFT GRAVEYARD - DAY 					9

	NASH, a wry, intelligent mercenary pilot and soldier, is
	painting huge eyes the windows of a wrecked plane. Finished, he
	tosses the paint can through the open windows and walks quickly
	away from the plane.

	We now see that RED TEETH are painted on the craft's nose. It
	looks absurdly like some angry beast.

	We are one the edge of a dry lake bed, part of an aircraft
	graveyard. Wrecked planes lie all around.

	We hear a phone RINGING...


10 	INT. CARGO PLANE - DAY 					       10

	A RINGING satellite phone rests on a stack of gun cases.

	UDESKY, the leader of this crew, answers it. 

				UDESKY
		Udesky.
			(beat)
		Yes sir. we're good to go. I'll lock it down as
		soon as you drop me the payment.

	With the phone still to his ear, Udesky wanders out of the
	craft...


11 	EXT. CARGO PLANE - DAY 					       11

	Udesky looks over at Nash and COOPER, another mercenary.

	Cooper's the quiet muscle of the bunch, a weapons specialist. He
	finishes loading a massive gun, essentially a hand-cannon. It's
	aimed at Nash's grimacing aircraft.

				UDESKY
		That's right, two of the very best I could
		find. No, I haven't worked with them
		personally, but they come with the highest
		recommendations.

	Then --

	Cooper FIRES at the grimacing aircraft. A projectile rockets
	into the plane and EXPLODES with a fireball.

	Nash and Cooper exchange a satisfied smile.

				UDESKY (CONT'D)
		You've got nothing to worry about, sir. This
		is going to be a piece of cake.

	Pieces of the demolished craft come raining down.


12 	EXT. EXCAVATION BASE CAMP, PT. PECK LAKE, MT - DAY 	12

	CLOSE ON a man's hand, carefully scraping the stone away from a
	dinosaur fossil. We follow his hand back as he wipes off his
	sweaty brow, revealing him to be BILLY BRENNAN, 25, an
	associate professor and site manager. He's a charmer.

	Looking past him, we see CHERYL, 21, a junior at junior of State. She's one
	of a dozen COLLEGE STUDENTS working at the site, and the one
	most smitten with her supervisor.

				CHERYL
		Billy? I don't think I'm doing this right.

	He scoots over, lying down beside her. Checks her work.

				BILLY
		You need to go slowly. See, just take it little
		at a time.

	She's not listening, just watching his eyelashes.

				CHERYL
		I can never tell what's bone and what's rock.

				BILLY
		Technically, it's all rock. The calcium in the
		bones is replaced during fossilization. But
		you can feel the difference. See? Rough,
		smooth. Rough, smooth.

	He runs her bare fingers over the two different patches, showing
	her. After a pause, she runs her finger along his
	stubbly chin...

				CHERYL
		Rough.

	...and along his lips.

				CHERYL (cont'd)
		Smooth.

	Billy may not have started this flirtation, but he's not ending
	it either. It's then that a

	SHADOW

	falls across them. Billy looks up to see...

				BILLY
		Dr. Grant!

	Grant has just returned, a bag over his shoulder.

				GRANT
		Mr. Brennan.

										CUT TO:


12A	EXT. WALKING TO THE MAIN TENTS - DAY 			12A

	Billy takes one of Grant's bags, talking as they go.

				BILLY
		How was your trip? Profitable?

				GRANT
		We'll be broke in four weeks.

				BILLY
		Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.

	The cross into one of the tents, which only has two "walls". On
	a dust-taped table, a dusty Macintosh is feeing data into a
	strange machine the size of a dorm refrigerator. A mechanical arm sweeps
	back and forth across a tray of fine sand.

				GRANT
		You rented an automated litter box.

				BILLY
		It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan
		data from the raptor skull, than the computer
		breaks it into thousands of slices which this
		thing prints, one layer on top of the other.
		It's the future of paleontology.

				GRANT
		Not if it can't dig.

	The arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes, dropping
	through holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of 
	a person's fist.

				BILLY
		I give you a raptor's resonating chamber.

	Grant hates technology, but he can't help but be amazed by the
	result. He lifts the strange object up, shaking out the
	remaining sand.

	Billy puts it to his lips and blows through it like a conch shell.
	The resulting SOUND is unique and piercing, the cry of an 
	non-existent animal. Grant is speechless with excitement. And so he
	uses it again and again, producing different SOUNDS and
	variations.

	In the distance, flocks of birds rise to the sky and fly off.

	Billy looks up to see a MAN and a WOMAN getting out of 	
	a Cadillac. Cheryl is pointing them in the direction of the 		
	tent. 									

				BILLY (cont'd) 				
			(falsely casual) 					
		Oh, I forgot to tell you. Some visitors 			
		wanted to come by and talk	to you. I 
told them you'd be happy to see them. 
		maybe even have dinner with them. 						

				GRANT 					
		Absolutely not. 						

				BILLY 						
		They're here. 							

				GRANT 					
		What? 								

	Only now does Grant realize these two people
Who were walking up to them.
Putting on a friendly smile, Billy goes up to them.				

				MAN 						
		Dr. Grant? 							

				GRANT 					
		Yes? 								

				MAN 						
			(extending his hand)					
		Paul Kirby. Kirby Enterprises				 	
			(reaching into his pocket) 	
		My card. 							

	PAUL KIRBY is a talkative optimist with				
	no "off" switch. His wife AMANDA KIRBY, just
as friendly, is harder to read. There seems to be			
	exhaustion behind her eyes. 					

				GRANT 					
		What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby? 				

				PAUL 						
		Well sir, I am a great admirer
of yours, and I have an extremely interesting 
proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife 
and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.					

				GRANT 					
		You know, I've been traveling and I'm very 		
		tired. Maybe some other time. 				

				PAUL
		I guarantee it'll be worth your while.

	Behind Kirby, Bill furtively rubs his thumb and fingers
	together, indicating the guy is loaded.

	Grant musters a weak smile.

				GRANT
		It's be my pleasure.


13 	INT. HELL CREEK BAR AND GRILL, JORDAN, MT - NIGHT 	13

	Theyre only halfway through the entree, but Grant is ready to
	bolt. It's only Billy who's keeping him from being rude. They walk
	over to Paul and Amandas table and sit down.

				PAUL
		First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts,
		Amanda and I have admired your work for
		years.

				AMANDA
		It is truly, whats the word? Inspiring.

				GRANT
		Thank you.

	It's everything Grant can do just to be polite. He desperately
	wants to leave and get back to his dig.

				PAUL
		Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors.
		Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure
		tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2,
		the Nile...

				AMANDA
		We even have two seats reserved aboard the
		first commercial moon flight.

	Billy nudges Grant.

				GRANT
		Hmmm.

				PAUL
		Now, for our wedding anniversary this year
		we wanted to do something really special,
		something...

	He places his hand on his wife's.

				AMANDA
		...once-in-a-lifetime.

				PAUL
		We've arranged for a private airplane to
		take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want
		you to be our guide.

	The Kirby's look to Grant as if they've offered him an amazing
	gift. But Grant just sighs and smooths the tablecloth.

				GRANT
		That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm
		afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can
		refer you to a number of highly qualified...

				PAUL
		No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've
		seen these animals in the flesh. No one else
		has come close to you.

				GRANT
		I'm flattered, but I've taken this little
		adventure tour. And with the air
		restrictions they've imposed after the
		incident in San Diego, you cant fly low
		enough to see anything of interest.

	Paul is momentarily stymied, but Amanda rallies.

				AMANDA
		You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I
		have special permission to fly low.

				BILLY
		How low?

				PAUL
		Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do
		know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone
		else.

				AMANDA
		From what I understand, it's pretty much
		whatever we want.

				GRANT
		That's hard to believe.

				PAUL
		Let's just say that through my business --
		imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've
		made some friends in high places. In this
		case, the Costa Rican government.

				AMANDA
		Dr. Grant, you don't know how important it is
		for us to have you come along. It would make
		all the difference.

	Grant is trying to find another way to say no, when Paul pulls
	out his checkbook.

				PUAL
		And of course, we're prepared to make a
		sizeable contribution to your research here.

	Billy looks at Grant. Don't say no.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		I can write all kinds of numbers on this
		check. Just tell me what exactly it would
		take.

	We HOLD ON a conflicted Dr. Alan Grant.

		  		  CUT TO:

14 	EXT. SKY - DAY 							14

	NNNNNRRRRRRNNNNNRRRRR...

	A SMALL AIRPLANE - a Beechcraft Kingair 200 Turboprop, to be
	exact - cruises through clear blue skies.


15 	INT. PLANE - DAY 							15

	Grant re-settles, trying to get comfortable. Billy is across
	from him, finishing cleaning his camera lenses before putting
	them back in the ragged case.

				GRANT
		Even with what I pay you, you could get a
		better bag.

				BILLY
		No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago
		some buddies and I went hang gliding off
		these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me
		right into the side. BOOM!

				GRANT
		That does sound lucky.

				BILLY
		It was this strap alone that saved my life.
		Got caught on a rock as I was falling.

				GRANT
		Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most
		idiotic.

	Because he hasn't really said it...

				BILLY
		Listen Alan, I really appreciate you
		bringing me along.

				GRANT
		The bones will be there when we get back.
		That's the nice thing about them. They never
		run away.
			(beat)
		And besides, you got me into this. I don't
		intend to be alone with these people.

	ON PAUL AND AMANDA

	sitting near the front of the plane. Paul draws a long, nervous
	breath and looks at Amanda. She seems just as tense.

	Finally finding a comfortable position, Grant puts his hat over
	his eyes, ready to take a nap.

	Done with his camera, Billy turns to someone just off screen.

				BILLY
		So how do you know the Kirby's?

	and we reveal...

	Mercenary Cooper, the weapons specialist we met earlier. He's
	wearing sunglasses so dark you can't tell whether he's staring
	at you or fast asleep.

	He doesn't answer. Did he even hear? And then --

				COOPER
		Through our church.

				BILLY
		What Religion?

				COOPER
		Uhthe one that worships God and believes in being
		Good. 



16 	EXT. SKY - DAY 							16

	The plane continues onward.


17 	INT. PLANE - DAY / HOURS LATER 					17

	Grant slowly wakes in his chair, groggy. All the other
	passengers are fast asleep. Then Grant turns to his right.

	A RAPTOR

	sits besides him. The dinosaur eyes him curiously, then opens
	his mouth...

				RAPTOR
		Alan.

	And than it STRIKES.


18 	INT. PLANE - DAY 					       		18

	Grant wakes up with a start, disoriented. Billy is leaning over
	him.

				BILLY
	Alan. We're almost there.

	The adrenaline still surging through him, Grant turns and looks

	THROUGH THE WINDOW.

	Clouds obscure the view, than parts reveal

	ISLA SORNA

	rising majestically out of the water.


19 	EXT. SKY - COUNTINUOUS DAY 					19

	We watch the plane descend sharply to the island.


20 	INT. PLANE - COUNTINUOUS DAY 					20

	In various combinations, Grant and Billy, Paul and Amanda look
	out the windows at the amazingly green island.

	Cooper looks out through a window of his own.


21 	INT. COCKPIT - COUNTINUOUS DAY 				21

	Here we find the rest of the crew from the junkyard. Nash is
	piloting.

	A VOICE comes over their radio headsets.

				RADIO VOICE
			(Spanish accent)
		Unidentified aircraft approaching Isla
		Sorna, this is San Juan approach. You are
		flying in restricted airspace. Immediately
		turn to the coordinates two-zero-zero. I repeat
		redirect to...

	A look from Nash then Udesky switches off the radio.


22 	EXT. PLANE - COUNTINUOUS DAY 				       22

	The plane now descends to a mere hundred feet above the
	treetops.


23 	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS DAY 				       23

	Paul puts his hand atop Amanda's as they stare intently out the
	window.

	Billy looks to Grant.

				BILLY

		Admit it. You're excited.

	Grant will admit nothing.

	Calling back from the cockpit...

				UDESKY
		Cooper! Yell up if you see anything!

				COOPER
			(yelling back)
		No, I thought I'd keep it to myself.

	Suddenly Grant spots...

				GRANT
		There. There! An Apatosaur. Look at the
		coloration.

EXT. ISLA SORNA  GRASSY FIELD  CONTINUOUS DAY

	An Apatosaur is grazing on the grass.

INT.  PLANE  CONTINUOUS DAY

				BILLY
			(amazed)
		I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see
		skin.

				GRANT
		Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right
		you can see...

	But Paul just waves him away with a hand, staring intently out
	his window. We HOLD ON Grant a moment, thinking that odd.


24 	INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS DAY 				       24

	Udesky puts down his binoculars.

				UDESKY
		South shore is clear. The rest is rock.

				NASH
		Are we on?

				UDESKY
		We're on.


25 	INT. MAIN CABIN - CONTINUOUS DAY  			       25

	Looking out the window, Grant notices they're flying awfully
	low. Just then, he hears a MECHANICAL HUM and a LOW RUSH from
	outside. Now wanting to believe --

				GRANT
		That's not the landing gear?

	Paul, Amanda and Cooper don't respond.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		What you're...
			(realizing)
		You can't land.

	Paul turns back to him.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll
		explain this all in a jiffy.

				GRANT
		This plane can not land!

				AMANDA
		It's going to be all right. Just...

	Grant is out of his seat, heading for the cockpit. He'll wrestle
	the controls if he has to.

	Cooper grabs him, pulling him back. Grant starts to struggle,
	but he's certainly no match. A well-practiced fist hits him
	dead on.

	CUT TO BLACK.


26 	OVER THE DARKNESS 						26

	we hear Amanda's voice, strangely distant but amplified.

				AMANDA
		Eric! Eric! Are you there honey? Ben!
		Erriccc!

	Her calls continue as we FADE UP to...


27 	INT. PLANE - DAY 							27

	GRANT'S P.O.V. -- blurry and disorientated. He finds himself lying
	on the floor of the plane.

	Seeing him come to, Billy helps him slowly get up. Grant's head
	is pounding.

				GRANT
		Tell me we didn't land.

	By his expression, we see Billy would have to lie.

				BILLY
		I think they're looking for someone.


28 	EXT. LANDING STRIP, ISLA SORNA - DAY 			       28

	The jungle has almost reclaimed this patchy vine-covered
	runway. The airplane is parked at one end.

	Nash, Udesky, and Cooper are checking their weapons.

	Amanda is at the edge of the tarmac calling into the jungle on a
	BULLHORN.

	Billy and a groggy Grant emerge from the airplane. Paul trots
	over.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant, are you alright? I'm sorry we
		had to be so...

	The three mercenaries are now walking into the jungle with
	their guns.

				GRANT
		What the hell is going on? What are they
		doing?

				PAUL
		Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe.
		These guys are really good. One of them was a
		Green...

				GRANT
		Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is
		no such thing as safe. We have to get back in
		this plane...

	Grant looks to Amanda, who shouts through a bull horn.

				AMANDA
			(on-bullhorn)
		ERRR-IIIC!

				GRANT
		And tell your wife to stop making so
		much noise! We're food to these damn 
animals.

				PAUL
			(yelling)
		Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad
		idea!

				AMANDA
			(on the bullhorn)
		What?

				PAUL
			(pointing broadly at Alan)
		He says it's a bad idea!

				AMANDA
			(on the bullhorn)
		What's a bad idea?

	As in on cue, there is a DEAFENING ROAR from the jungle.

	Everyone turns toward the sound and freezes.

				PAUL
			(to Alan)
		What was that?

	Grant doesn't answer, still listening to the reverberations. 
Then a couple shots are heard.

				BILLY
			(low)
		Is it a rex?

				GRANT
		I don't think so.

	Billy and Paul breathe a small sign of relief.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Sounds bigger.

	Nash and Udesky come RUNNING out of the jungle, headed for
	the plane.

				UDESKY
		We gotta go, now!

				PAUL
		What's the problem? Can't you guys...?

	As Udesky and Nash sprint past Paul in interrupted by a
	second, closer, DEAFENING ROAR. He pales.


29 	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 				       29

	Udesky waits by the door, hustling everyone inside. Nash
	hurries into the cockpit. Everyone scrambles to a seat. Amanda
	climbs next to Paul.

				AMANDA
		We can't just...

				PAUL
		Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and
		come back.

	Udesky closes the door.

				BILLY
		What about the other guy?

				UDESKY
		Coop's a professional. He can handle himself.

	A blood-curdling SCREAM echoes through the jungle followed by
	MACHINE GUN FIRE.

				NASH
			(yelling back)
		We're going!

	Udesky climbs into the copilot's seat, and Nash revs the engine.


30	EXT. RUNAWAY - DAY						30

	The plane starts down the runway.


31	INT. PLANE - DAY							31

	The passengers bounce in their seats as the plane picks up
	speed down the overgrown strip.


32	EXT. RUNWAY - DAY							32

	Suddenly, two hundred yards ahead of the plane,

	COOPER

	emerges from the jungle. He stands in the middle of the runway.
	waving one arm wildly. His second, badly injured arm hangs
	limp by his side.

				COOPER
		Come on, Nash. Slow down, buddy.


33	INT. THE COCKPIT - DAY					       33

	Nash spots Cooper, shoots a glance at the airspeed indicator.

				NASH
		Coop, you know I can't do it pal.

	He slams down full throttle in an attempt to reach flying speed.

	Seeing that Nash has no intention of stopping, Paul shouts from
	the cabin.

				PAUL
		What are you doing? That's Mr. Cooper!


34	EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY				34

	We are looking down on Cooper from behind. As the plane
	approaches,

	A SHADOW

	falls over the injured mercenary. Then with brutal speed, an
	ENORMOUS BEAST seizes him in its massive jaws and lifts him
	into the air.

	From this angle we get only a glimpse of a long crocodilian
	snout, powerful clawed forearms and spiny sail rising from the
	creature's back.


35	INT. THE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS - DAY			       35

	All eyes are on the creature as it devours Cooper. Amanda turns
	away in horror.

				AMANDA
		Oh, my God! Paul, my God!


36	INT. THE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS - DAY			       36

	Looking through the windshield, we see the creature is directly
	in the path of the plane.

	Nash pulls back on the stick. The plane rises.

	The left propeller clips the flank of the enormous
	dinosaur, SNAPPING the blade.

	Blood sprays the windshield and side windows.


37	EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY 				37

	The turboprop banks into the jungle, out of control.


38	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 					38

	The passengers are thrown about as the craft CRASHES through
	trees, tearing off a wing and pieces of the tail.

	Finally coming to rest in the jungle canopy, the plane settles
	in the trees.

	SILENCE.

	The passengers slowly recover and have a look around. Foliage
	blocks most windows, making it impossible to see out.

				BILLY
		Is anyone hurt?

	Checking themselves, everyone seems pretty much intact.

	Still thinking of himself as in charge...

				UDESKY
		Quiet! We're okay. Let's everybody just stay
		put.

	He attempts to turn on the cockpit radio, but it's dead.

				NASH
		Who's got the sat-phone?

				PAUL
		Right here!

	Paul hands the bulky phone up to Nash, who dials out.

	Grant unstraps himself, climbs to the back to the side door and shoves.
	The door opens a few inches before hitting a branch.

	He looks out the and lets out a quiet gasp as the ground reels

	THIRTY FEET BELOW.

	He quickly shuts and latches the door.

	CLOSE ON the sat-phone. pressed against Nash's ear.

				RECORDED VOICE
		We're sorry. All circuits are busy. Please
		try your call again later...

				NASH
		Shit!

				PAUL
		What is it? What's the matter?

	Amanda SCREAMS.

	A huge reptilian face appears in the cockpit window. Everyone
	else SCREAMS now.
	
	The plane LURCHES - and we hear a deep GROWL.
	
	The passengers hold tight, paralyzed. Nash buckles himself into
	his seat.

	Suddenly, the plane is YANKED from the side to side. Battered this
	way and that, the terrified passengers tightly grip their 
	seats.
	
	Finally, the horrible sounds of WRENCHING METAL as the nose of
	the plane is RIPPED RIGHT OFF.

	Nash and Udesky are suddenly sitting in open air. The nose of
	the plane is tilting downwards, the jungle floor far below.

	The passengers hang almost vertically in their seats,

	Debris tumbles out the open end of the plane, some of it
	striking Nash in the head.

	Udesky unbuckles his seat belt and climbs back up into the
	cabin. Nash follows.

	Suddenly, a long snout with dagger-like teeth pushes past the
	cockpit seats, opens wide, and

	CLAMPS DOWN

	on Nash's legs.

	The pilot CRIES OUT in agony. The others passengers grab onto
	his arms, trying to pull him back. But it's no use. The dinosaur
	rips Nash out of their grasp and down the aisle.

	Nash desperately grabs on to the seat cushion, then watches in
	horror as the fabric RIPS AWAY. He's pulled out of the plane and 
	dropped to the ground. A giant foot steps in the way as the snout
	of the creature reaches down and quickly devourers the screaming
pilot.

	It's horrifying sight, but no one can turn away.

	Pleased with the appetizer, the creature comes back for the
	main course.

	Grant tries to force open the jammed rear door. Billy tries to
	help, but the door won't budge.

	The dinosaur JAMS its snout into the fuselage and lunges for
	Amanda in the first row. She yanks her legs back as the jaws
	SNAP SHUT.

	Behind Amanda, Billy reaches forward, UNSNAPS her seat belt
	and pulls her into the next row back.

	The others unstrap their belts and crowd into the rear of the
	passenger compartment.

	The shift in weight sends the fuselage tipping backwards.


39	EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS - DAY				       39

 	The plane breaks free of the tree limbs and DROPS tail-first to
	the jungle floor.

	It SLAMS hard, then flips over onto its roof.


40	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY				       40

	The passengers are prowled on the ceiling of the plane, dazed
	by the impact. Everyone is cut and bruised.

	Out of the open cockpit, they see two approaching dino feet.

	A window near Amanda fogs over with condensation. when it
	clears, she finds herself looking right into enormous eyes.

	Then all hell breaks loose as the plane is SLAMMED across the
	jungle clearing.

	The passengers are hammered against the walls of the plane,
	tumbling like socks in a dryer. Debris, seats and luggage fly
	everywhere.


41	EXT. JUNGLE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY			41

	The plane comes to an abrupt halt as it SMASHES into a tree.

	A gargantuan FOOT steps on the fuselage and FLATTENS it like a 
	paper tube.


42	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY					42

	Inside, windows EXPLODE, raining glass over the passengers. As
	the walls compress, Udesky becomes trapped in the rear of the 
	plane, the others in front.

				BILLY
		Over here!

	Udesky dives into the narrowing gap, and Billy pulls him the
	rest of the way through.

	Billy is as terrified as the rest of them, but he thrives under
	this rush of adrenaline.
	
	Then a huge CLAW digs into the skin of the fuselage and begins
	to slowly PEEL the plane open. Grant looks up in dread at the
	widening tear.

				GRANT
		This way!

	Grant leads the group out the open end of the cockpit. They
	make a mad dash for the jungle.

	A tremendous ROAR causes Billy to look behind him. He can't
	help but steal a glimpse of this terrifying, but utterly
	fascinating, animal.

	Grant yanks him forward.


43	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY						       43

	With Grant in the lead, and Udesky taking up the rear, the group
	tears through the jungle.

	Concealed by the dense undergrowth, the unseen dinosaur bears
	down on them -- mowing down the young trees which TOPPLE all
	around them.

	Grant spots a grove of

	HEAVIER TREES

	and leads the group into it.

	The dinosaur cannot fit between the trunks. It ROARS at
	the fleeing humans, searching desperately for a route after
	them.

	The group continues their relentless pace, putting as much 
	distance as they can between themselves and the beast. Paul
	Kirby looks like he's about to have a heart attack. Even Billy
	is gasping for air.

	They stop, thinking they've outrun it.

	Grant directs the group through some underbrush and into --


44	EXT. CLEARING - CONTINUOUS - DAY				44

	Our friends stop dead in their tracks. Amanda stifles a cry.

	Before them lies an immense unmoving SAUROPOD.

				GRANT
		Don't worry. It's dead.

	Then a full-grown bull

	TYRANNOSAURUS

	rises up behind the carcass. It was feeding, its mouth mottled
	with blood and carrion.

	Grant FREEZES.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Nobody move a muscle.

	Remember: the T-Rex tracks motion.

	Obeying, the group FREEZES for a few long beats. Then Udesky
	takes off running.

	And T-Rex ROARS.

	Everyone runs. T-Rex is right behind them.


45	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							45

	Dashing back the way they came, the group suddenly comes face
	to face with --

	THE FIRST MONSTER.

	We now get our first full unobstructed view of the gigantic
	creature, SPINOSAURUS AEGYPTICUS. Over forty feet long and
	twenty-five feet high, the dinosaur has a bony sail along its
	back. Its head is crocodilian with rows of long, curving teeth.
	Sinewy six foot arms terminate in three fingers hands with
	fourteen inch claws.

	Nowhere else to run, the group scatters into the brush as the
	two behemoth predators rush forward, their ROARS thunderous.

	Paul and Amanda scramble into one direction, Billy and Udesky in
	the other. But Grant can't go anywhere - his foot is stuck 
	between two branches.

	He manages to free himself as the two dinosaurs approach.
	They'll have to deal with each other before eating the humans.

	Grant dives down between two fallen trees as the Spinosaurus and T-
	Rex circle one another like gladiators, each searching for the
	other's weakness.

	Laying flat on his back, Grant lets out a terrified GASP as the
	giant foot of Spinosaurus lands across the two trunks mere
	inches from his face.

	Spinosaurus lunges forward, powerful jaw open wide.

	T-Rex sidesteps the assault, its tail knocking down small
	trees as it spins out of the way.

	In the tress, Paul and Amanda scurry again for cover.

	Between the fallen trunks, Grant attempts to get away on his
	hands and knees.

	T-Rex presses the attack, slamming its tail into the flank of
	its adversary. Spinosaurus is knocked back, and Grant is again
	forced to duck for cover.

	As Spinosaurus struggles to regain its balance, T-Rex dives
	forward. Spinosaurus is driven backwards as T-Rex tries to
	grip its throat.

	Amanda yanks Paul out of their path. They Scramble over to
	Billy.

	Now on its side, Spinosaurus fights back ferociously. It slashes
	at T-Rex with its long arms and razor sharp claws, then finally
	kicks the animal with one mammoth foot.

	Tyrannosaurus staggers back, wounded.

	Down below, Grant is splashed by the blood pouring from the
	dinosaur, as he slowly makes his way towards his fellow humans.

	Spinosaurus lunges for the T-rex with gaping jaws and manages to
	topple T-Rex off its feet and sends the falling dinosaur to the
	ground.

	With an earth-shuttering CRASH, the dinosaur lands between
	Grant and the rest of the group.

	The companions scurry out of the way, but as they do so, the
	head of the T-Rex now lands almost directly on top of them.

	Plastered against an immense tree, the group watches in horror
	as T-Rex starts to rise but is thrown back down as Spinosaurus
	latches onto its throat.

	Spinosaurus crushes the life out of its adversary, and T-Rex
	opens and closes its jaw a mere inches from our terrified 
	friends.

	Finally, Grant reaches the others.

				GRANT
		Come on!

	Spinosaurus lets out a victorious HOWL, and the blood-drenched
	professor leads the group through the undergrowth.


46	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							46

	Winded from running, Paul is caught off-guard as a furious
	Grant slams his back against a tree. Only one thing he wants to
	know --

				GRANT
		Why did you bring us here?

	Paul is too startled to speak. Udesky tires to step in, but
	Grant gives him back a look.

				AMANDA
		Our son is on this island. We need your help
		to find him.

	Still crunched against the tree, Paul pulls out a photo from his
	shirt pocket.

				PAUL
		This is him. Eric. Hes thirteen now. He's
		just about the greatest kid in the world.

	Letting go of Paul, Grant takes the photo, a Sears-style
	portrait of the boy we saw Parasailing at the beginning. He
	shakes his head, disbelieving. He hands the photo to Billy.

	The group splits into two sides -- Paul and Amanda, Grant and
	Billy -- with Udesky stuck between. Dialogue overlaps in
	places.

				AMANDA
		He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.

				BILLY
		Who's that?

				PAUL
		Her new boyfriend.

				AMANDA
		A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted
		to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben
		found a guy who would take them parasailing.
		They never came back.

				PAUL
		We called everyone, did everything we could.
		Because of all the controversy over this
		island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says
		it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault.
		Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy --
		said we should "accept the inevitable." You
		believe that?

				GRANT
		So you hired these mercenaries.

				UDESKY
		We prefer "recovery specialists." We do
		overseas custody issues and...

				GRANT
			(interrupting)
		Then you duped us into coming here.

				PAUL
		We needed somebody who knew the lay of the
		land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.

				GRANT
			(disbelieving)
		I have never been on this island!

				PAUL
		Sure you have. You wrote that book...

				BILLY
		That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna.
		The second island.

				PAUL
			(low, to Udesky)
		I didn't know, there were two islands.

				AMANDA
		Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You
		saved those kids.

				GRANT
		A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we
		were better prepared and better armed.
			(finally)
		How many days have they been missing?

	A look between Amanda and Paul.

				PAUL
		Eight weeks.

	Grand and Billy are speechless. It might as well be eight years.

				GRANT
		After what you've seen today, you really
		think your son could be alive?

				AMANDA
		He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much
		about dinosaurs.

	Before anyone else can talk, Grant puts his hand out. He wants
	everyone to shut up while he plans their next move.

				GRANT
		No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we
		can from the plane. Then we head for the
		coast. There may be a boat left, something to
		get us off this island.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.

				GRANT
		You can stick with us, or you can go and look for
		him. Either way you're probably not getting
		out of here alive.

	With that he leaves, A beat later, Billy follows. He has
	genuine sympathy for the Kirby's, but he's logical enough to
	know Grant is right.

	BACK WITH PAUL AND AMANDA

	They look to Udesky.

				PAUL
		What do we do?

	Udesky is clearly at a loss, but for everyone's reassurance he
	tries to mutter some brio.

				UDESKY
		Well, I think we should start searching for your
son. In the direction they're going.

				PAUL
		Excellent.

	They follow after Grant and Billy.


47	EXT. PLANE CRASH SITE						47

	The five survivors search through the wreckage, trying to find
	anything useful. The task is grim. Mindful of Grant's 
	warnings, they move quickly and quietly.

	Udesky picks up a gun out of the swampy water. The barrel is bent
	almost 90 degrees, unless.

	Billy finds his camera, intact.

	Digging a change of clothes out of his suitcase, Paul steps
	around the side of the plane to change. He's in his underwear
	before he notices Amanda is also there changing.

				PAUL
		Sorry.

				AMANDA
		Nothing you haven't seen before.

	A beat. Amanda looks over as they get dressed.

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		How much weight have you lost?

				PAUL
		Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been
		swimming at the Y.

				AMANDA
		You hate to swim.

				PAUL
		People change.

	A nod to mean, that's the truth.

				PAUL (CONT'D)
		You look good.

				AMANDA
		So do you.

	They make brief eye contact, which Amanda breaks.

	Around the side, Billy is taking photos of a giant footprint the
	dinosaur left in the mud during its attack on the plane. Grant
	looks over.

				GRANT
		How would you classify it?

				BILLY
		Obviously a superpredator.
			(best guess)
		Suchimimus. that snout.

				GRANT
		They never got that big.

				BILLY
		Baryonyx?

				GRANT
		Not with that sail.
			(Billy gives up)
		Spinosaurus Aegypticus.

				BILLY
		I don't remember that on InGen's list.

				GRANT
		That's because it wasn't on their list. Who
		knows what else they were up to?

	Billy looks past Grant to see Paul approaching. He's struggling
	with the straps on his backpack. turning in circles.

	Billy regards him with suspicion.

				BILLY
		So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2,
		did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?

				PAUL
		Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.

				BILLY
		About a thousand feet above it, actually.
			(closer)
		Most mountain-climbers remember how tall
		that mountains were.

	Paul knows he's caught.

				GRANT
		There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?

				PAUL
		There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint
		and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate
		Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The
		"plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces
		accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like 
		that.

				BILLY
		I don't suppose that check you wrote us is
		any good.

				UDESKY
		He paid us half up front. Cash.

				PAUL
		Mortgaged everything we had to do it. Even
		the store. and if we make it off this island
		with my son, I swear, I'll make good on the
		money I owe you. I don't care if it takes me
		the rest of my life.

	Grant and Udesky exchange a dubious glance.

				UDESKY
		However long that is.


48	EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY						48

	Amanda, Paul, Billy, Udesky and Grant walk through the jungle.

				AMANDA
		Eric!

				GRANT
		Quiet!

				PAUL
			(loud whisper to Amanda)
		Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous
		territory.

				AMANDA
		Well we should split up or something. We can
		cover twice the area.

				PAUL
		No, Dr. Grant says...

				AMANDA
		Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...

				PAUL
		Well what's the use of hiring an expert if
		your not going to listen to him?

				AMANDA
		Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric.
		Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.

				PAUL
		Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after
		you, don't come crying to me.

				AMANDA
		Oh, don't worry about that.

				PAUL
		What?

				AMANDA
		Nothing.

				PAUL
		What did you say?

				AMANDA
		Nothing.

				PAUL
		What did you say!

				AMANDA
		Just drop it Paul!

	The Kirby's conversation trails off into the jungle. Udesky
	moves up next to Grant and Billy.

				UDESKY
		If they split up, I'm going with you.

	And as they continue forward, Billy spots something in the
	trees ahead.


49	EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY					49

	A parasail chute is caught in the branches of a tree. A yellow
	life vest hangs limply from a branch.

	Paul rushes over, unsnags it, and examines the label.

				PAUL
		Young adult.

				AMANDA
		Eric...

				UDESKY (O.S)
		Hey. Got something here.

	All turn to see Udesky holding up a camcorder encased in a
	waterproof shell.

				AMANDA
		That's Ben's!

	She grabs it from Udesky and pops open the housing. She tries
	the power switch on the camcorder, but the battery's dead.

	Udesky pull out a flashlight from his pack and looks to Amanda.

				UDESKY
		Here, give that to me.

	And as Udesky fiddles with the flashlight, Grant and Billy
	consider the parasail.

				BILLY
		It looks intact.

				GRANT
		We should take it with us to signal any planes.

				UDESKY (O.S)
		I think I've got it.

	Udesky has rigged the wires on the flashlight so that the
	batteries can be used to power the camcorder.

	He brings a live wire to back of the camcorder. A red power
	light comes on.

				AMANDA
		It works!

				UDESKY
		I don't know for how long.

	Udesky swings the tiny screen out and pushes play. The others
	crowd around.

	ON THE SCREEEN

	Eric and Ben play frisbee on the beach.

				PAUL (O.S.)
			(excited)
		That's him. Thats Eric!

				AMANDA (O.S.)
		I filmed this the morning they left.

	Ben catches the frisbee, checks his watch and motions to Eric.

	Eric runs over, and Ben puts his arm around him as they run to
	the camera.

	Paul reacts to this image but holds his tongue.

	THE VIDEO SCREEN -

	The image now CUTS to a shot from aboard Enrique's boat
	speeding towards ISLA SORNA -- the start of the movie. Eric
	points excitedly at the island and smiles at the camera.

	We replay the opening moments of the movie from Ben and Eric's
	perspective, soaring high until...

				ERIC
		Ben!

				BEN
		Unclip the line!

	THE JUNGLE -

	A PAN from face to face of all watching this tape with a
	mixture of hope and nausea.

	ON SCREEN -

	Angle again with Ben's legs in the foreground. Falling fast.

				BEN (CONT'D)
		Hand on! Hang on buddy!

	Now the camera penetrates the jungle canopy and the picture
	and sound become complete chaos: SCREAMS from the both,
	branches BREAKING, flashes of Ben and Eric's frightened faces
	as the camera is buffeted in all directions.

	With a lurch the terrifying descent in finally over, and the
	jungle floor is just ten feet away, swaying back and forth
	beneath Ben and Eric's feet.

				BEN (CONT'D)
		Are you ok, buddy?

	There's GURGLING to his voice. Ben may be more hurt than he's
	letting on.

				ERIC
			(through his sobs)
		I don't know. I think so.

				BEN
		We're okay. It's going to be okay. Here, get
		ready. I'm going to unhook you.

	The sound of PUMPLING is followed by the sight of Eric DROPPING		
	into the frame, landing on the ground rolling. He stands and
	looks back up at Ben.

				ERIC
		I'm all right

				BEN (O.S)
			(weaker)
		We're going to get out of this, pal.

	And on that, the power and picture fade away.

	BACK ON PAUL AND AMANDA - overjoyed.

				PAUL
		See? He's okay. He's alive! Everything's
		going to be all right now.

	Amanda brings a hand to her mouth, silently nodding her head.

	Grant and Billy exchange a dubious look, than begin pulling the
	parasail out of the tree. As they do so, the sail gets caught on
	a branch.

	They pull harder. The branch bends, but the sail won't come
	loose. One last tug and than, SNAP. The branch breaks, the chute
	falls away to reveal

	A SKELETON.

	It swings down directly at Amanda. She SCREAMS.

	Finally, the others are able to pull her away. As they untangle
	the lines, the men are able to get the first view of the remains
	of Ben Hillenbrand, still caught in his harness.

	Amanda's knees buckle. Regaining her balance, she runs off into
	the jungle.

	Paul quickly follows.

				PAUL (CONT'D)
		Amanda!


50	EXT. THICKNESS - DAY						50

	Reeling, Amanda comes to a stop in an area with thick
	undergrowth. It's danger here, very still and quiet.

	She tries to calm herself, but each effort to suppress just
	makes her more emotional. She's surprised as Paul wraps an arm
	around her to comfort her. But she doesn't fight it.

				PAUL
		I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for
		the things I said about him.

				AMANDA
		No, it's...

				PAUL
		I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...

				AMANDA
			(frustrated)
		Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out
		here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.

	Saying it aloud, the reality sinks in for both of them

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		I guess I was hoping that with Ben around,
		there'd be someone to keep him safe.

	Checking in on clients, Udesky stops at the edge of the
	thicket. Something raises the hairs on the back of his neck.

				UDESKY
		Dr. Grant!

	He nods for the others to take a look at this. They head over,
	Grant at the rear.

	As he approaches, Billy is packing up the rest of the chute in a
	backpack. He stops short from what he sees.

	Looking down, we CIRCLE across the jungle floor. Here we find a
	strange, hollowed-out construction made of sod and branches.
	Maybe six feet around.

	Just now noticing the others' stare, Paul looks down into one
	of the bowls at his feet, a half-buried nest. It's filled with
	football-sized eggs, laid in a spiral.

	And this isn't the only nest. Amanda counts twelve in all, laid
	out in an oddly symmetrical pattern.

	The last to arrive, Grant identifies the species in a horrified
	instant.

				GRANT
		Raptors.

And as he says the words, off in the distance, we hear
	the cry of some herbivores, around by the chorus of
	snarls.


							SMASH CUT TO:

51	EXT. FUTHER IN THE FOREST - DAY				51

	The party blasts through the forest, trying to keep up with
	Grant. They haven't even had time to ask --

				AMANDA
			(to Paul)
		Whats a raptor?

	Paul has no idea.

				UDESKY
		They don't look that big. I mean,
		comparatively.

				GRANT
		If we came across one, we might live.

				PAUL
		Well that's good.

				GRANT
		But you never came across just one.

	From the back --

				AMANDA
		Wait! Where's Billy?

	They all stop. The only one not there is --

				Grant
		Billy! Billy!

				AMANDA
			(almost sotto)
		I thought we weren't suppose to yell.

				BILLY (O.S)
		Here!

	He comes in from the left. Excited, he explains to Grant --

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		I got some great pictures of the nest. You
		know this proves raptors raised their young
		in colonies.

	Furious with his student. Grant just keeps moving. There's no
	time to stand around and argue.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		This speaks to a larger social structure, the
		possibility of Darwinian altruism. It
		changes everything.

	A beat. Trying not to sound presumptuous --

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		We could co-write a paper.

				GRANT
		Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish
		or perish.


52	SCENE PREVIOUSLY OMITTED					52


53	EXT. RIDGE - DAY (HOURS LATER)					53

	Much fatigued, the five now mach upward towards a crest.

	Panting and flushed, they reach the top of the ridge and gaze
	into the distance.

	A jungle valley stretches before them. Not far off in A VAST
	COMPOUND - comprised of several buildings. One building alone
	seems to cover several acres.

	The weary group breathes a sigh of relief.

				PAUL
		I bet there's a very good chance Eric's in
		there. I'd bet my bottom dollar.

	Udesky and Grant share dubious looks and continue down into
	the valley.


54	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - DAY					54

	The group emerges from the jungles and enters the compound.
	They walk through an overgrown parking lot, littered with
	abandoned vehicles. Some are lying on their side. Others are
	overturned completely.

	They're not going to be driving anywhere.

	A troubled Grant peers through a windshield, partially caved
	in, like some giant head butted the glass. (Think back to Lost 
World)

	And the group finally approaches the front doors of an
	enormous building. As they head up the front steps, we see
	something in the distance behind them:

	CAT-LIKE MOVEMENTS

	on the high ridge. To fast to see what it was. But too ominous
	to dismiss.


55	INT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY					55

	Our friends now find themselves in a sparse, one quietly
	opulent corporate lobby now in the process of being reclaimed
	by the jungle/ Roots and ivy poke through the floor and walls.

	In the waiting area, the cushions of a sofas and chairs have been
	gnawed at and pulled apart. Dusty coffee mugs and filled
	ashtrays lie on the table. The water has turned brackish in a
	near by cooler.

	Sudden FLAPPING. We look up and see BIRDS nesting in the
	rafters. It is an eerie, haunted place.

				PAUL
			(calling out)
		Eric! Are you here?

				AMANDA
		Eric!

	All listen for a response. Nothing. Paul and Amanda exchange a
	despondent look.

	Sitting on the reception counter is an official-looking
	telephone. Everyone has the same thought, but no one dares.
	Finally -

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		What the hell.

	Amanda puts the receiver to her ear. Nada.

	With Grant in the lead, they head deeper into the building.

	Unseen by the group, a fleeting SHADOW flits across the lobby's
	dirty windows with terrifying speed.


56	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY						56

	A couple vending machines stand at the one end of this long
	hallway covered with vines.

	Paul notices them and pulls change from his pocket.

				PAUL
		Let's see. I've got about a dollar seventy-
		five. How about you guys?

	Billy SMASHES IN the window of one machine with his boot.
	Picking through the glass, he pulls out some candy bars and
	chips. He checks the expiration date. 	


	CONTINUED:								56

				BILLY
		Thank God for preservatives.

	He tosses the food to the others.

	Paul now turns to his own vending machine and SMASHES it with
	his heal. The glass refuses to break.


57	INT. HATCHING LABORATORY					57

	Grant and Billy push through a set of doors to see
	
	A CAVERNOUS HATCHING FACILITY

	filled with much of the same equipment we recognized from the
	first island, although the sheer size of this place dwarfs any
	of the facilities seen previously.

	As the group walks down the ramp and onto the floor, they begin to
	absorb the incredible array of technology: enormous cryonic
	freezer, their plug pulled years ago; empty incubators; tanks
	of formaldehyde with dinosaur fetuses and body parts.

	Machines with intricate tubing and wing arms stand beside
	conveyer belts cris crossing the room at different levels.

				AMANDA
		This is how you make dinosaurs?

				GRANT
		This is how you play God.

	Billy looks around the lab. He can't help but be impressed.

				BILLY
		Okay if I take pictures?

	Grant nods.

	Billy sets his lucky camera back down on the worktable. Two years
	from now, astute observers of the DVD will not that Billy
	doesn't actually take his camera from the bag; he was carrying
	it because there wasn't any room inside.

	Billy pulls a new roll of film from the bag and zips it shut.

	ACROSS THE LAB

	Amanda is passing a large cylindrical tanks with half-formed
	embryos floating in formaldehyde -- genetic experiments gone
	awry. Finally she reaches

	A GIGANTIC MANIFIED RAPTOR HEAD

	floating in the one tank.

	Something about this specimen catches Amandas attention. She
	bends forward, getting very close to the glass. She peers right
	into the eyes of the nightmarish creature. Then --

	AN ACTUAL RAPTOR

	lunges at her form behind the tank. She SCREAMS.

	Fortunately the raptor can't get between the closely spaced
	tanks. Amanda runs.

				PAUL
		Amanda!

				GRANT
		Back out! Move!

	And as the group races through the lab the Raptors find a
	larger gap between the tanks.


58	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY				58

	Paul leads the way, checking the door for possible escape
	routes or hiding places. Twenty feet behind,

	THE RAPTOR

	rounds a corner, bolting after them. Paul ducks in the closest
	door.

				PAUL
		In here!


59	INT. DINO KENNEL - CONTINUOUS - DAY				59

	The group slams the door behind them and quickly takes in the
	room.

	There are several rows of oversized steel cages, apparently
	used for containing young dinosaurs. Many of the cage doors are
	standing open.

	The group races down a lone aisle. Close behind, the raptor
	BURSTS into the room, ROARS.

	As the Raptor gains ground, Udesky and Billy run into one of the
	open cages, SLAMMING the door behind them.

	Grant, Paul and Amanda duck into another. Before they can
	swing the cage door shut behind them, however, the raptor SLAMS
	into it, driving the door into the cage.

	They are forced back against a chain-like wall, trapped in a
	small triangle space by the advancing door. The angry
	Raptor is now inches away through the cage door.

	Then, suddenly, the raptor looks up. We follow its gaze. The top
	of their triangular enclose is wide open.

	The eager raptor climbs up the chain-like door. Catching the
	tail of an idea, Amanda grabs the door and nods to the others.

				AMANDA
		Push!

	They push hard on the cage door, swinging it and the raptor
	right through the opening of the cage.

	Now the raptor is trapped in a small triangular space, the door
	going right to the ceiling.

	Amanda slides the door's bolt through the chain like wall,
	temporarily trapping the dinosaur.

	The raptor struggles desperately, GRAWLING AND SNARLING, but
	the cage door seems to be holding.

	As everyone rushes back to the door.

	The raptor begins to make a LOW, HAUNTING MOAN.

	As the others head for the door, Grant lingers a step, listening
	to the beast's simple melodic cry. It has the same tones as
	came from the model resonating chamber.

				GRANT
		She's calling for help.


60	EXT. COMPOUND - DAY						60

	The group exits the rear of the lab building and finds itself in
	a large equipment yard. The CALL of the raptor is still audible
	as they head for the tree line.

	Now they moan is ANSWERED from distant jungle quarters.

	The responses quickly MULTIPLY. To the group's dismay, they
	soon find themselves virtually SURROUNDED by raptor CRIES both
	distant and near.

	Grant looks around with amazement. It's vindication of his
	theory on raptor communication, but it couldn't come at a worse
	time.

	Responding to the growls, a herd of grazing HADROSAURS suddenly
	flees across the open space. Then, in the distance behind the
	herd

	A PACK OF RAPTORS

	emerges from the jungles, coming their way.

				GRANT
		Head for the trees!

	From the lab building, the raptor we left imprisoned now BURSTS
	out one of the doors and HOWLS to the pack -- the same cry we
	heard in the lab.

	The raptor pack moves into the hunting formation. One ALPHA-MALE
	RAPTOR. slightly larger than the others, leads the charge up the
	middle.

	Grant risks a looks back. But doesn't stop running.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		THIS WAY!

	In an effort to escape the oncoming raptors, Grant leads the
	group right into the stampeding heard of hadrosaurs.

	Suddenly, all is chaos. Hadrosaurs race past, splitting up the
	group.

	Letting the others get ahead of him, Grant looks back. Much to
	his dismay, the raptors are ignoring the hadrosaurs.

	Indeed, the pack weaves its way through the herd -- the raptors
	only want them.

	In the chaos of the stampede, everyone loses sight of each other.

	Up ahead, Billy trips and falls. As he rolls the strap on his
	camera bag breaks. He doesn't notice it's missing until he's
	already back on his feet and running.

	Amanda and Paul keep close to each other. Further back, Grant
	spots Billy's fallen camera back. He grabs it as he runs past.

	Looking back, Billy sees that Grant now has his back...

				BILLY
		ALAN!

				GRANT
		KEEP GOING!

	They lose sight of each other in the rush.


61-19	OMIT									61-69


69A	EXT. EDGE OF THE JUNGLE - DAY					69A

	As the hadrosaurs WHIP PAST, Paul and Amanda climb up into a
	tree. A raptor leaps at Paul, barely missing his leg.

	Trying to pull Paul up, Amanda nearly loses her balance. This
	time, Paul catchers her.

	Billy climbs up a nearby tree of his own in sight of Paul and Amanda.

	Udesky has nearly reached a tree of his own when he finds
	himself

	HEADED OFF

	by a raptor. He turns to the other way, but finds

	THERE ARE MORE RAPTORS.

	He picks up a fallen branch as these dinosaurs cautiously
	approach. Not more than a few feet away, the leader of the trio
	stops, peering at him.

	Udesky swings hard, but the dinosaurs feints. From behind him,
	another raptor slashes at the back of his legs, severing his
	muscles. Udesky CRIES OUT and drops to the ground.

	IN THE TREETOPS

	Paul, Amanda and Billy can hear him.

				PAUL
		Udesky.

				AMANDA
			(Listening)
		He's this way.

	From here, the thick branches overlap, forming a kind of
	"second floor" above the ground. It's not easy, but you can move
	from branch to branch, tree to tree.

	ON THE FLOOR

	Unable to walk, Udesky attempts to crawl away from the animals.
	The effort clearly causes him great pain. Strangely, the
	raptors suddenly don't seem interested in him anymore.

	Rather, they're "talking" among themselves. Udesky is amazed to
	find him self still alive.

	Suddenly, one of the raptors SLASHES at him again. But it's
	delicately not a mortal blow, just a very painful one. Udesky
	CRIES OUT, louder this time.

	IN THE TREES

	Hearing the new cry, Paul, Amanda and Billy move faster, now
	finally seeing Udesky on the ground. He's face-down, barely
	moving but still MOANING.

	The raptors are gone.

	In the lead, Amanda starts to climb down. But Paul grabs her,
	holds her back.

				PAUL
		It's not safe.

				AMANDA
		We have to help him.

				BILLY
		He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill
		wounded.

				AMANDA
		He's not a kill, he's still alive.

	She breaks from Paul's grip and drops to the ground. She's only
	a foot away from the tree when

	ALL FOUR RAPTORS

	lead out from their hiding places. They almost catch her as
	Billy and Paul pull her back up on the limb

	The raptors stare up at them, angry their plan didn't work.

				PAUL
		They couldnt climb up, so they were trying
		to get us to come down.

				BILLY
		They set a trap
			(amazed)
		They actually set a trap.

	Bored with waiting, the raptors go back to finish off Udesky,
	making a meal out of it. Up in the branches, the survivors are
	horrified and sickened.

	Then, from the deep in the forest, a new RAPTOR CRY. The feasting
	raptors look up, listening, then suddenly run off into the dark
	jungle.

				PAUL
		Where's Grant?


69B	EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - DAY				69B

	Climbing higher in a tree, Grant is just feet above a growing
	pack of raptors. He scales one branch, the next, finally
	reaching a perch that the dinosaurs can't jump to.

	LOOKING DOWN

	The entire pack is now standing still, watching him. In the
	center, the Alpha Male lets out a sort of BARK. Responding to the
	cry, the other raptors CALL BACK.

	As terrified as he is, he can't help but be fascinated by their
	communication. Like a hellish bird song, there's a rhythm to it,
	a structure. They're clearly talking about something.

	Under his breath, Grant is able to mimic its patterns.

				GRANT
		What does that mean? What are you saying?

	Of course they can't answer. They just keep using the same
	"phrase."

	Ready to ditch Billy's camera bag in order to climb higher --
	he's had to hold it by the strap -- Grant finds his hand covered
	with a runny slime. He looks down at the camera bag, and that's
	the source. It's oozing out the bottom.

	He unzips the bag to find

	A BROKEN RAPTOR EGG

	inside, the white and green yolk still dripping from the pieces
	of the shell. There's another intact egg beside it.

	This is what the raptors where chasing.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		God damn you, Billy.

	Ever the scientist, Dr. Grant tests a theory even in the face of
	danger: he holds up the intact egg so that the raptors can see it.
	They suddenly go crazy, howling the same phrase but LOUDER.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		It means, "Give us the egg," doesn't it? "We
		want the egg."

	He gently drops the bag to the ground. Although the raptors are
	interested, pulling out the unbroken egg, they're still by no means
	placated. The song may have changed, but they still want Grant
	dead.

	They begin to jump at him, eventually, hopping up on each
	others backs. It's only a matter of time till they reach him.

	Grant moves to climb higher, but sees no branches he can reach.
	And than he hears the low CREAKING. A CRACK. The branch he's
	on is starting to give in.

	He looks down at the face of his enemies, knowing he'll be
	their next meal. And then,

	A SMALL CANISTER

	lands at the base of the trees, immediately SPRAYING out a thick
	cloud of oily fog. It's the first of

	FIVE CANISTERS

	that land in the area, creating a thick cloud. It's not just
	smoke though something far more caustic.

	As it hits the raptors they immediately recoil, those closest
	to the canisters SHRIEKING in pain. Tumbling in the dirt.
	There may be a pheremonal element to the mist as well -- they
	seem panicked, disoriented.

	Pack mentality takes over, and after the first ten raptors take
	off running, so do the rest, some tripping over their feet
	blindly.

	This may be dino-tear gas, but it's not good for humans either.
	Up in the tree, Grant's eyes immediately burn from the vapor
	He squints to see through the fog, where he spots

	A HUMAN SHAPE

	at the edge of the smoke

				VOICE
		Come on! They'll be back!

	Grant half-climbs, half-falls out of the tree, rushing to get
	through the heaviest of the smoke.

	A SMALL DIRTY HAND

	grabs his, pulling him along.


69C	EXT. JUNGLE - LATE DAY						69C

	Eyes swollen from the gas. Grant stumbles, barely able to see as
	the other person pulls him along. It's only now we can identify
	his rescuer as

	ERIC KIRBY,

	the boy he was brought to rescue. A lot has changed in the last
	eight weeks. It's not just dirt and muck -- he's the filthiest
	child you've ever seen -- something primal has come out in him.

	Something wild.


69D	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - TWILIGHT				69D

	On the far side of the tipped over vehicle, Eric pulls open a
	hatch -- his hiding place. The door opens part way.

	Eric motions for Grant to follow.


69E	INT. INSIDE THE BUNKER - TWILIGHT				69E

	Squeezing in sideways -- it's very tight fit -- Grant finds
	himself in a space no bigger than the inside of a Datsun. lit by
	a small battery-powered lantern. This is where Eric has been
	hiding.

	The minute Grant's inside, Eric goes back to work re-sealing
	the door. This 13-year old boy has become astonishingly
	efficient at staying alive.

				GRANT
		Eric...

	The boy holds up a hand. He listens for a moment. He doesn't
	hear anything outside.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Eric, your parents are both here.

				ERIC
		In Costa Rica?

				GRANT
		On the island.

	Eric truly can't believe it. He hoped to be rescued but...

				ERIC
		They'll never make it. I mean, they can't
		manage when the cable goes out.

				GRANT
		You'd be surprised what people can do when
		they have too.

	Eric studies his guest, finally certain he recognizes him.

				ERIC
		You're Alan Grant, aren't you?
			(off surprised reaction)
		I read both of your books.

				GRANT
		Which one do you prefer?

				ERIC
		The first one. Before you where on the island.
		You liked dinosaurs back then.

				GRANT
		Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.

	Grant takes a better look around Eric's tiny hideaway,
	impressed with what he's been able to scavenge. Among the many
	items we see another smoke canister, some battery-powered
	lanterns and lots of candy wrappers. This kid's been living on
	chocolate for weeks.

				ERIC
		When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of
		stuff behind.

				GRANT
		Any weapons, radios?

	Eric pulls up a long cattle prod to show Grant.

				ERIC
		Found this, but the battery's dead.

				GRANT
		It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I 
		barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight
		weeks.

	The line catches Eric strangely. It's the first moment of true
	emotion we've seen him in.

				ERIC
		Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.

				GRANT
			(trying to be positive)
		The important thing is we both made it.
		That's something we have in common.

	Eric rips into a candy bar. After a moment, he realizes he
	should offer one to his guest as well.

	Grant takes it. A lone beat. Than, Grant just has to know...

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Did you read Malcolm's book?

				ERIC
		Yeah.

				GRANT
		What did you think?

				ERIC
		I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy.
		Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the
		guy seemed kind of high on himself.

	Grant smiles.

				GRANT
		That's two things we have in common.


69F	EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT						69F

	The trio is where we left them, perched up in the branches.
	They're far from safe, but nothing's after them for a
	while.

	In Billy's eyes, we can see a storm of guilt raging. But he
	hasn't said anything. Won't say anything.

				AMANDA
		We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr.
		Grant are out there somewhere.

				PAUL
		I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit
		of good right now. For every scary thing we
		saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times
		more of 'em at night.
			(to Billy)
		Am I right?

				BILLY
		I dont know.

				PAUL
		I thought you were an expert.

				BILLY
		Dr. Grant was.

				AMANDA
		Well Dr. Grant isn't here, so we're going to
		have to figure out what to do ourselves.

	Amanda is impressed by her own determinations. A long beat.

				AMANDA (cont'd)
		So what do we do?

	No one has the faintest clue.


69G	EXT. DEEP IN THE FOREST - NIGHT					69G

	VARIOUS SHOTS; The creatures of Isla Sorna walk past in the
	shadows, some looking up at the light in the trees.

	Suddenly, one of the creatures is attacked by another. We hear
	ROLLING, SNARLING, HISSING, just seeing the outline of the
	fight. Just as fast as it began, the fight is over, the winner
	snakes on the loser.


69H	EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT (LATER)					69H

	Everyone's moved to different branches, trying to settle in for
	the night. Paul keeps looking over to the tearful Amanda, about
	to say something. He finally does.

				PAUL
		I just want you know, Amanda. It's not
		your fault what happened.

	Amanda looks over, not sure what his absolution.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		Eric has always been headstrong, and you
		throw Ben Hildebrand into the mix and well...

				AMANDA
		Well what?

				PAUL
		Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead.
		What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy
		accident. The exact same thing could have
		happened if he was with me. You can't go
		beating yourself up about it.

	Realizing he's trying his best, Amanda cant stay angry with
	him.

				AMANDA
		This wouldn't happen if he was with
		you. I mean, you drive five miles below the
		speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives
		years.

				PAUL
		That one time was just the bumper.

				AMANDA
		He would have been, safe. Completely,
		entirely, suffocatingly safe.
			(beat)
		I would have him to see more of the world than
		Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the
		world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's
		my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that
		you have to be here.

	Really looking at her...

				PAUL
		I'm not sorry at all.


69I	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - DAY					69I

	Morning on Isla Sorna. A low mist hangs tight to the forest
	floor as Eric seals up his hideaway for hopefully the last time.

	They start walking. Eric pulls something out of his pocket,
	shows it off to Grant.

				ERIC
		Know what this is?

				GRANT
			(takes it)
		A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.

				ERIC
		Mine's new.

	Grant hands it back.

	Eric is becoming more and more a normal thirteen-year old boy.
	There's an innocence to him that's coming back.

				GRANT
		How much of this island have you explored?

				ERIC
		I stayed pretty close to the compound,
		Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's
		where they'd start.

				GRANT
		We need to head for the coast.

				ERIC
		Are you sure?

				GRANT
		Why?

				ERIC
		Closer you get to the water, the bigger
		things get.


69J	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69J

	Billy and Amanda wait for Paul as he comes out of the bushes,
	hiking up his shorts.

	Trying to take charge...

				BILLY
		We need to stick to the plan. Head for the
		coast.

				AMANDA
		What about Eric and Dr. Grant?

				BILLY
		Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's
		alive, thats where he's headed.

				AMANDA
		What about Eric?

	Billy represses his instinct to say Eric's dead.

				PAUL
			(rationalizing)
		He's probably has a better chance by the coast
		as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs
		would live in the center of the island.
			(to Billy)
		Right?

				BILLY
		Sure.

	As Grant and Eric walk, both stop, hearing a strange sound. But
	for a change, it's not an ominous one.

	It's a human one.

	A phone is RINGING, very faintly. Without a word to each other,
	Grant and Eric decide its coming from the right.

69L	EXT. JUNGLE - CONTUNUOUS DAY					69L

	Paul is picking the briars out of his socks as they hike,
	risking tripping on every step. Then Amanda stops short. She's
	the first to hear it:

	THE SAME RINGING.

	After a beat, everyone else can hear it too. And recongnition
	finally lights on Paul's face...

				PAUL
		My phone.

	Suddenly, Paul frantically searches his pockets as the others
	anxiously watch.

				AMANDA
		You had the phone the whole time?

				BILLY
		Where is it?

				PAUL
		I don't know. I don't have it with me.

				AMANDA
		When did you have it last?

				PAUL
		I don't remember

				AMANDA
		Think.

	And Paul wracks his memory...

				PAUL
		The plane. I got a call on the plane, put it in
		my coat pocket, and...

	Bust suddenly, he stops, his face is lighting with an awful
	realization. Amanda couldnt bear the wait...

				AMANDA
		What?...WHAT!?

				PAUL
		I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on
		him when he...

	The hideous implication of his words slowly sink in.


69M	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69M

	Still following the faint RINGING, Grant and Eric turn to find

	A SAIL

	moving through the low trees. We recognize it as the back of a
	spinosaurus. We might think it's any random spinosaurus,
	except for the RINGING coming from somewhere inside it.

	Grant and Eric press back against a tree, keep perfectly
	still as they hear the THOOOOMB, THOOOOMB, THOOOMB of the
	creature's footsteps reverberating. It's tail RUSTKES against
	the brush.

	It's moving behind them, and it's close.

	We hear the RINGING move from left to right as it passes. So
	far, its has no idea they're there.

	Looking across the clearing, Eric is startled to see

	PAUL AND AMANDA

	are no more than 20 yards away, also hiding. An involuntary
	reflex, Eric calls out...

				ERIC
		Mon! Dad!

	Grant immediately covers the boys mouth. But it's to late.
	The dinosaur has stopped. We still can't see it. We don't know how
	close it is.

	Paul and Amanda spot Eric with Grant. They're a thousand
	emotions at once: relieved, disbelieving, terrified, overjoyed.
	They want to run to him, to yell out to him, but the monster is
	close.

	Grant takes his hand off Eric's mouth. They both stay
	completely silent.

	All this time, the sat-phone is RINGING.

	Than it stops.

	And after an agonizing beat, the beast moves. At first we're
	not sure which direction it's headed, but finally we can tell
	its moving away.

	Once the sail is finally out of sight, Eric breaks from Grant's
	hold and dashes to his parents' arms. They coop him up. Hug
	him, kiss him, their affection unquenchable. He's crying.

				AMANDA
			(reassuring him)
		Sweetheart, you're okay.
			(reassuring herself)
		You're okay.
			(disbelieving)
		You're okay.

				PAUL
		Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men,
		we stick around, huh?

				ERIC
		We do.

	Looking at her grubby son, Amanda licks her shirttail, trying
	to rub his face clean.

				PAUL
		Honey, there's not enough spit in the world
		for that.

	She LAUGHS. It's the first times she's laughed in two months.

	Billy crosses the distance to Grant.

				GRANT
		We need to keep moving.

				BILLY
		Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry
		about the...

				GRANT
		Billy, I can't talk to you now.

	He walks off. Billy follows him.

				BILLY
		Please, okay? Just yell at me. Call me an
		idiot. An asshole. Stupid. Tell me I screwed
		up because I know I did.

	Grant doesn't respond.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		I thought if we could get a raptor back
		to the mainland, we could get serious money
		for it. Enough to fund the digging for 10
		years. More. Whatever it took.

	Grant shakes his head, disgusted, But doesn't stop.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		You have to believe me. I did it with the
		best intentions.

				GRANT
			(finally turning on him)
		Some of the worst things imaginable have
		been done with the best intentions. You
		rushed in with no thought to the
		consequences, to yourself or anyone else.
			(finally)
		You're no better than the people who built
		this place.

	Grant keeps walking, leaving Billy with his guilt.


70	INT. CANYON BUILDING - DAY					70

	The group enters a structure with giant windows designed to
	look into the canyon beyond -- only there's nothing to see but a
	thick fog.

	Toward the center of the room, a spiral staircase that leads to
	a lower level.

	With Billy lagging, Grant approaches the stairs and peers down
	the circular opening in the floor. There is not much to see, just
	fog, a glint of sunlight.


71	EXT. RIVER CANYON - DAY						71

	Step by step, Grant leads the group down a rusty spiral
	staircase below the observation room. The stairs end in a lower
	level. Although we're technically outside, this whole place feel
	strangely enclosed.

	There's a thick fog at this level -- clouds, really -- but far
	below we can see the river. And at its banks, a barge.

				GRANT
		We climb down to the barge and follow the
		river out to the ocean. With any luck, the
		Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.

				ERIC
		Then we go home?

				AMANDA
		Then we go home.

	Grant leads everyone down a RAMP to --


72	EXT. LANDING - DAY							72

	A catwalk branches off, a SET OF STAIRS continuing down the
	along the canyon wall.

	Grant starts down the stairs. He's only taken a few steps down
	the rusty staircase suddenly

	BREAKS BENEATH HIS FEET.

	Paul grabs him in the nick of time. The staircase vanish into
	the fog. CLANFING AGAINST the canyon wall. After a few more
	seconds of silence, they hear the CRASH far below.

				AMANDA
		You okay?

	Grant nods and looks in the other direction.

				GRANT
		How about if we try this way?

	Their only other option is a precarious catwalk that
	disappears into the mist.

				AMANDA
		Do you think it goes all the way across?

				GRANT
		One way to find out.

	The only way to get his-near-fall is to push ahead. But his
	stomach turns at being so high.

	Amanda follows. The catwalk creaks and groans, listing
	slightly. She freezes mid-stride.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
			(glancing back)
		We'd better do this one at a time.

	Amanda steps of and Grant carefully pushes forward,
	disappearing into the thick fog.

	The others listen to the CREAKING of the catwalk until it STOPS
	ABRIPTLY.

	SILENCE.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant?

	More silence. Then, out of the fog, a distant voice call out --

				GRANT (O.S.)
		Come on over. One at a time.

	Amanda steps tentatively forwards. Eric is clinging to her.

				AMANDA
		Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.

				PAUL
		We're not going anywhere, I promise.

	As Paul holds Eric, and Amanda shares a look.

				Amanda
		We're all together now, Eric.

	Eric reluctantly releases her mother. Amanda starts to cross.


73	EXT. REVER CANYON - FAR WALL - DAY				73

	Grant has stopped at a lateral support across the
	catwalk, trying to get the sense of where they are and what
	purpose this place may have served.

	Seeing that the support beams are brace high arched walls of steal
	mesh, it becomes obvious that we are inside this vast
	construction.

	Amanda emerges from the mist and turns back to the catwalk.

				AMANDA
			(calling out)
		Okay! Come on, Eric!


74	EXT. LANDING - DAY							74

	Eric is next to go across. He's still tentative.

				PAUL
		How 'bout if I...

				ERIC
		No, I can do it.

	Billy and Paul look on as Eric disappears into the vapor.

				PAUL
			(muttering to himself)
		That's it Eric. Nice and easy...


75	EXT. CATWALK - DAY							75

	Eric slowly gropes his way forward. He feels a GUST OF WIND and
	a HEAVY THUD ahead on the catwalk which now sways beneath
	him.

	Regaining his balance, Eric peers forward, but the fog prevents
	him from seeing more than fifteen feet ahead. There is an EERIE
	SILENCE. Eric calls out timidly.

				ERIC
		Mom?


75A	EXT. RIVER CANYON - FAR WALL - DAY				75A

	Across the canyon, Grant moves across the later support. With
	his hand on the railing, he sends a white, hardened substance
	dropping into the mist.

	Looking up, Grant notices a large strut, covered with the same
	substance. Realizing what it could be.

				GRANT
		Oh, my God.

				AMANDA
		What is it?

				GRANT
		A bird cage.

	Then, the sound of Eric SCREAMING.


75B	EXT. CATWALK - DAY							75B

	Eric watches as A LOOMING SHAPE emerges from the fog -- a
	nightmarish vision stalking purposefully forward.

	A FULL GROWN PTERANODON,

	standing over seven feet high, walks upright on clawed feet, his
	thirty foot wings folded bat-like at his side.

	The creature sees Eric and fixes him with a demonic glare.

	Eric CRIES OUT and dashes back down the teetering catwalk.

	The Pteranodon ruses to its feet, spreads its thirty-foot wings
	and flies directly at him.

	AT THE OTHER END OF THE CATWALK

	Hearing Eric's SCREAMS, Paul charges onto the catwalk,
	searching in the fog.

				PAUL
		Eric!

				BILLY
		It won't hold!

	Suddenly,

	ERIC

	emerges from the fog, racing toward his father. And then
	
	THE PTERANODON

	swoops out of the fog, opens its giant rear claws, and snatches
	the terrified boy from the catwalk.

	Paul Kirby watches in stunned, abject horror as the Pteranodon
	carries Eric directly overhead --

				PAUL
		ERIC!

	The flying reptile struggles with the boy's weight. Paul
	watches helplessly as Eric is carried high across the canyon.

	Paul runs back alone the catwalk in a desperate attempt to keep
	Eric in sight.

	Billy stays behind, moving back up the platform to try to
	keep the dinosaur in view. With a new idea, he races back up the
	stairs to the observation room. He has a way to save Eric.

	When he reaches the canyon wall, Paul turns a corner and runs
	along another enclosed catwalk leading deeper into the canyon.

	Grant and Amanda now come pounding down the catwalk trying to
	catch up with Paul.

				AMANDA
			(shouting)
		Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?

				PAUL
			(shouting back)
		I'm trying! That thing took him down this
		way!

				GRANT
		Split up!

	THE PTERANODON

	carries Eric deeper into the canyon. The creature's wings beat
	steadily overhead, and the WIND is fierce. Eric looks down and
	sees the river far below.

	The Pteranodon swoops over an isolated outcropping of rocks at
	the end of the canyon and drops Eric into --


75C	EXT. PTERANODON NEST - DAY					75C

	A large bowl of mud and branches the size of a satellite dish.
	Eric lands right on top of a pile of dinosaur bones picked
	clean. Mixed among is one human skull.

	Before Eric has time to cry out, he looks up to find

	SIX PTERANODON HATCHLINGS

	closing in on him with sharp-edged beaks.

	He picks up the human skull and whips it to the hatchlings.
	They easily duck it and keep coming.

76	EXT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS DAY			76

	Grant looks up to see Billy leaning out over the edge of the
	observation platform. He suddenly realizes what Billy is about
	to do.

				GRANT
		BILLY! WAIT!

	Billy SHOUTS BACK, an excited-terrified grin on his face.

				BILLY
		I CAN GET HIM!

				GRANT
		NO!

				BILLY
		I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!

	Billy jumps off the railing and

	DROPS TOWARDS THE CANYON BELOW.

	Grant, Paul and Amanda watch as Billy FALLS past them like a
	stone, plummeting towards certain death. But then --

	THE PARASAIL CHUTE

	blossoms above him.

	Not only does it slows Billy's descent, but he even manages to
	catch an updraft and begin to rise.

	He struggles to control the parasail, swooping dangerously
	close to the canyon wall, barely avoiding it.

	Up ahead he catches sight of Eric and steers towards him.


77-80	OMIT									77-80


81	EXT. PTERANODON NEST - DAY					81

	Eric struggles to keep away from the hatchlings. But there's
	no way out of this nest.

	Billy SWOOPS overhead, but he's too high to reach Eric.

				BILLY
		ERIC! HOLD ON!

	He circles around to make another attempt.


82	EXT. ENCLOSED CATWAY - DAY					82

	Paul rounds the corner and finally catches sight of Eric in the
	nest, some fifty feet below, fighting off the hatchlings.

				PAUL
		Hang on, Eric!

	Paul sees an outcropping he could jump onto from here. It's a
	big leap, though, he might not make it. He steels himself up for
	the jump, then chickens out.

	Grant and Amanda come up behind him. Suddenly,

	A SECOND PTERANODON

	CRASH LANDS on the catwalk enclosure about them -- right next
	to a gaping hole in the mesh. The catwalk GROANS with the
	extra weight.

	The pteranodon JAMS its head through the hole, SNAPPING at
	them.


83	EXT. CANYON - IN THE AIR - DAY					83

	Billy circles, making his approach.

	In the nest, Eric kicks at the hatchlings, but they're
	undeterred. Billy and Eric will only have one chance.

	As Billy swoops past, Eric jumps and grabs onto his boot. He is
	yanked up and out of the nest. But than, MOTHER PTERANODON
	shoots past, tearing out a piece of the parasail in its beak.


84-85	OMIT									84-85


86	EXT. OVER THE RIVER - DAY					86

	The pteranodon who landed on the top of the catwalk continues to
	SNAP through the hole in the enclosure.

	Finally the reptile's massive weight proves to much, and the
	entire section of the catwalk BREAKS FREE of the canyon wall
	and FLIPS OVER LATERALLY.

	Amanda, Grant and Paul are able to hang on, but so is the
	pteranodon, who now climbs their way.


87	OMIT									87


88	EXT. OVER THE RIVER - DAY					88

	His parasail badly damaged, Billy tries to keep aloft. Heading
	as low as he dares, he yells to Eric --

				BILLY
		Let go!

	Terrified, Eric falls into the river safely. He surfaces,
	immediately swimming to shore.

	Trying to gain altitude, Billy bends hard to the right. But the
	rigging is too badly damaged. He flies right into the canyon
	wall, hitting hard.

	Instead of tumbling down to the river, he finds himself
	swinging from his harness - the parasail snagged on a rock
	spire above him.


89	EXT. BROKEN CATWALK - DAY					89

	Paul, Grant and Amanda struggle to stay away from the
	pteranodon as it moves towards them.

	Suddenly. the far end of this inverted section of catwalk
	detaches from the canyon wall and

	SWINGS DOWNWARD.

	The force of the action sends the three tumbling directly
	towards the pteranodon.

	Miraculously, they manage to avoid its open beak. But they
	are all sent plummeting toward the river below.


90	EXT. RIVER - DAY							90

	They hit the water hard, resurfacing moments later. The
	current is carrying them downstream.


91	EXT. CANYON WALL - DAY						91

	The two pteranodons who were pursuing Billy now land on nearby
	ledges and consider how best to dispatch their prey.

	Billy frantically tries to unhook his harness, but the tension
	is so tight from his own weight that he can't loosen the
	buckles.


92-93	OMIT							  92-93


94	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY					      94

	Paul and Amanda emerge from the water by the canyon wall and
	find their son hiding behind a rock, searching the skies for
	Billy.

	Amanda takes Eric tightly in her arms, and Paul urges them to
	keep moving. Up ahead, the mesh of the aviary meets the river.

	Wading the shore, Grant now scans the canyon, searching for
	Billy. It doesn't take long to spot him.

95	EXT. CANYON WALLL - DAY						95

	Billy continues to struggle with the harness but to no avail.

	The doomed young man is suspended high up on the canyon wall
	like a modern Prometheus, an entire FLOCK of pteranodons
	gathering around him preparing to peck away his liver. And
	everything else.

	A MAMMOTH PTERANADON has landed beside him and looks him
	straight in the eye.

	The gigantic creature lunges at him. Billy dodges away as best
	he can. The pteranodon's frustrated bite severs a crucial
	juncture on Billy's harness, and Billy is able to wriggle free.


96	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY						96

	Eric, Amanda, Paul and Grant watch in amazement as Billy is the
	last to PLUNGE DOWN into the river.

				GRANT
		He made it!

	Billy bobs to the surface and spots the group downstream. He
	waves and begins to swim towards them. Soon he nears the shore
	and gets to his feet, wading as he comes.

	Grant, Paul, Amanda and Eric hurry to meet him.

	Grant is overjoyed to see him alive. But his smile quickly
	fades as he sees

	THE ENTIRE FLOCK OF PTERANODONS

	diving down from above in angry pursuit of their lost prey.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Billy, look out!

	Billy glances behind him. He races forward, motioning fro his
	companions to turn around.

				BILLY
		Get back! Get back!

	Just then Billy is knocked down by the lead pteranodon. It
	strikes from behind with a brutal, calculated beak to the head.
	Billy stumbles and falls to the ground.

	Grant rushes forward with Paul right after him. Amanda takes
	Eric to safety down river.

	Billy SCREAMS as the ENTIRE FLOCK of pteranodons now swarms
	around him, picking him apart with their beaks and claws.

				GRANT
		Billy!

				PAUL
		It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.

	Grant can't take his eyes off Billy, whose BLOOD stains the
	water rushing by.

	And now several pteranodons are heading their way. Difficult
	as it is to leave Billy behind, Grant and Paul make a run for it.

	Just as the pteranodons are about to swoop in for the kill, Alan
	and Paul dive back into the river...


97	EXT. THE RIVER - CONTINUOUS DAY				97

	...and resurfaces on the far side of the mesh aviary wall, GASPING
	for air. Just behind them, the mammoth

	PTERANODON

	CRASHES into the mesh. It tears at the steel, actually ripping
	it in one place.

	At the dock up ahead, Amanda and Eric have found a rusty,
	waterlogged barge that's somehow still floating. Carrying a
	tarp-covered cage, the boat was meant for transporting dinos
	up and down the river.

	Amanda pushes them away from the dock as Alan and Paul climb
	on board.


98	EXT. ON THE BARGE - CONTINUOUS DAY				98

	The current takes the craft downstream, letting us get our
	first good look at the incredible
	
	AVIARY.

	It's a vast, domed mesh structure that spans the entire canyon.
	In all, a feat of remarkable engineering and unmistakable
	hubris.

	Catching their breath, our four survivors look at the cage they
	were caught in.


99	EXT. DOWN RIVER - DAY / LATER					99

	Yanking the starter rope one final time, Paul finally gets the
	engine to turn over, PUTTERING along. Amanda is beside him,
	bailing water.

				PAUL
		My own kid was right in front of me and I
		didn't do a damn thing.

				AMANDA
		You couldn't have made that jump.

				PAUL
		I should have tried. It should have been me
		on that beach back there, not Billy.

				AMANDA
		How would you have helped Eric?
			(he can't answer)
		He needs you, Paul. He needs us.

				PAUL
		He could have died.

				AMANDA
		But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm
		glad about that.


99A	UP ON THE BOW							99A

	Grant is beside Eric, keeping watch, but also feeling the weight
	of Billy's death.

				ERIC
		Do you have any kids?

				GRANT
		No. Although I've studied them in the wild.

	Eric looks over, not sure what that means.

				GRANT (CON'T)
		I have a theory that there's two kinds of
		boys. Those who want to be astronomers and
		those who want to be astronauts.

				ERIC
		I want to be an astronaut.

				GRANT
		See, I was the opposite. I never understood
		why anyone would want to go into space. It's
		so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and
		you're dead. The astronomer -- or the
		paleontologist -- get to study these amazing
		things from a place of complete safety. And
		truthfully, everything you really need to
		learn, you can learn it from the ground.

				ERIC
		But then you never get to go in space.

				GRANT
		Exactly. The difference between imagining
		how things might be and seeing how they
		really are. To be able to touch them. That's
		what Billy wanted to do.

	The barge starts to round a bend. On the bow, Grant and Eric
	are the fist to see something remarkable. Eric GASPS,
	unprepared. We don't know yet what they see.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		I can blame the people who made this island.
		But I can't blame the people who want to see
		it. To study it.

	At the rear of the barge, Paul just now sees what's ahead. Awe-
	struck, he slows the motor and motions for Amanda to take a
	look. And so do we.

	UP AHEAD

	The setting sun illuminates an incredible valley filled with
	dinosaurs. We see armored ANKYLOSAURS with clubbed
	tails. Duck-billed CORYTHOSAURS. We float under the gigantic,
	arching necks of eighty-foot BRACHIOSAURS.

	With the mist from the river and the play of light, we're
	witnessing a kind of primal Eden.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		How's a boy suppose to resist this?


100	EXT. FURTHER DOWNSTREAM - NIGHT				100

	A FULL MOON passes behind clouds. THUNDER quietly rumbles, and
	LIGHTNING flickers in the distance.

	Paul is still at the wheel. The river is narrower here, and
	cautions must be taken to avoid the banks.

	As the barge begins to round another bend. a FAMILIAR HIGH-
	PITCHED SOUND pierces the darkness. Muffled but unmistakable,
	it is the RINGING SAT-PHONE.

	All exchange looks of sheer PANIC, expecting Spinosaurus to
	leap out at any moment. Grant scans the river banks.

				GRANT
		Keep quiet.

	Paul cuts the motor, and time seems to stop as the four stand
	posed for action.

	The barge finishes rounding the curve, and the ringing grows
	LOUDER. The suspense is excruciating until finally...

	Their eyes widen at some horrifying sight, more horrifying
	than anything they've yet seen.

	SEVEN MOUNDS OF DINOSAUR DUNG sit on the patch off treeless flat
	ground just beyond the river bank.

	As our friends consider the sight, an idea comes to them all of them
	almost simultaneously.

	With Eric still in the boat, Amanda, Paul, and Alan jump into
	the river and rush to the bank.


101	EXT. RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT				101

	The three companions sprint towards the source of the RINGING.

				GRANT
		Find it before it stops ringing!

	And bracing themselves and hocking their breath, they PLUNGE
	their arms into their respective dung-heaps. After a few
	moments of this disgusting search...

				PAUL
		I've got something. I think I've got
		something!

	All turn to Paul. Clearing away the clinging defecation, he
	holds up to a beeper. And still the phone RINGS.

	Returning to their bleak task, they shovel the excrement with
	their arms. Finally:

				AMANDA
		I've got it! I've got it!

	Grant snatches the RINGING SAT-PHONE from Amanda's hands,
	presses a button, and puts it to his ear.

				RECORDED VOICE (ON PHONE)
		You too can own a time share in beautiful
		Guadalajara. Enjoy a meal in one of our four
		star restaurants, explore our coral reefs, or
		just walk on the beach...

	The Kirbys hear the recorded voice and let out a collective,
	heavy sigh. Grant shuts off the phone.

	In all the excitement, none of them notice a fierce horned
	CARNOTAUR right behind them. The giant creature ROARS, ready
	to eat them.

	But as it gets in close, it smells them. Even a dinosaur won't
	eat something that is covered in shit. After a beat, the
	Carnotaur turns and walks away, back into the jungle.

				PAUL
		Can't help but be a little offended.


102	EXT. BACK ON THE BARGE - NIGHT					102

	CLOSE ON the cleaned satellite phone's display. The battery
	level indicator is FLASHING.

				PAUL
		Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy.
		They won't do a God Damn thing.

				GRANT
		Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican
		phone book here, so it will have to be
		somebody we know in the states. Someone we
		can absolutely count on to send help.

				PAUL
			(to Amanda)
		Stan.

				AMANDA
		I wouldn't trust Stan with a snowball in a
		blizzard.

	Paul glares at her. Now Eric notices something odd in the
	river.

				ERIC
		What's that?

	The others look down in the murky water. Just below the
	surface,

	A SHIMMERING WAVE OF SILVER

	passes beneath the boat.

	Then a SINGLE FISH jumps from the water. And another. And
	another.

				GRANT
		Bonitas.

				ERIC
		Something must've scared them.

	Another roll of THUNDER, this time much closer.

				GRANT
		Get the motor going.

	Paul moves the motor and pulls the start cord. The engine
	sputters but won't come to life.

	And now the phone BEEPS. The battery is getting even weaker.

	Grant makes a quick decision and DIALS.

				AMANDA
		Who are you calling?

	But Grant ignores the question. RING. RING.

				GRANT
		Pick up! Pick up!


103	INT. ELLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT				103

	Wearing his jammies, three-year old Charlie awkwardly picks up
	the phone with both hands. He has the mouthpiece next to his
	lips, but the earpiece is hanging out in space.

				CHARLIE
		Hewwo?

	INTERCUT

	Recognizing who it must be...

				GRANT
		Charlie? Charlie. Get your mother. Right
		away!

	A long silence. Charlie bites his lip, looks around.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Charlie? Are you there?

				CHARLIE
		Hewwo?

	The sat-phone BEEPS again, this time much LOUDER.

	Amanda and Eric watch Grant, realizing their fate may hang on
	this single call. Paul struggles without success to start the
	motor.

	Then, unseen by the group, a

	GIGANTIC FIN

	rises from the water just fifty yards from the barge. It's
	headed right to them and closing fast.

				GRANT
			(desperate)
		Charlie! It's the dinosaur man! Go get
		mommy, okay?

				CHARLIE
		Okay.

	Not sure what to do with the phone, Charlie makes a logical
	choice and hangs it back up.

	He walks away to his mom.


104	EXT. BARGE - NIGHT [END INTERCUTTING]			104

	Grant realizes he's been cut off. He's about to redial when

	WHAM!

	The barge is RAMMED, sending everyone tumbling. Grant manages
	to stay on top of the wheelhouse, but he loses grip on the
	phone, which falls on deck.

	SPINOSAURUS

	rises from the water, towering over the barge. As lightning
	FLASHES and thunder CRACKS, the dinosaur lets out an ear-
	splitting ROAR.

	It lunges at Grant with gaping jaws. Grant leaps out of
	the way just in time as the dinosaur

	RIPS OFF

	the entire wheelhouse.

							            CUT TO:


105	INT. ELLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT				105

	Charlie leads Ellie into the room. Hands her the phone. Of
	course, it's just a DIAL TONE.

				ELLIE
		Was somebody on the phone?

				CHARLIE
		Dinosaur man.

	Ellie looks at him with confusion, then quickly checks the
	Caller ID box besides the phone. It's international, and not a
	number she recognizes.

							          BACK TO:


106	EXT. THE BARGE - NIGHT						106

	Grant stays one step ahead of the Spinosaurus as the beast rips
	apart the quickly-sinking boat.

	It spits out the wheelhouse and bites down on the stern of the
	boat, ripping off a chunk.

	Grant is heading up to the other three when he hears the sat-
	phone RING.  He spots it, just about to fall into the water.
	Dives for it, answering...

				GRANT
		ELLIE!


106A	INT. ELLIES LIVING ROOM - NIGHT					106A

				ELLIE
		Alan?

	She can hear the Spinosaurus ROAR.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		Alan? Alan!

	But he's cut off by a SECOND ROAR, the sound of someone
	SCREAMING.

	And then the line goes dead.

	Ellie pales. Charlie looks at her with a smile.

				CHARLIE
			(imitating)
		Raaaar!


106B	EXT. BACK ON THE BARGE - NIGHT					106B

	Dropping the dead phone, Grant scrambles towards the front of
	the boat and joins Paul, Amanda and Eric, who have taken refuge
	in the dinosaur cage.

	The fearsome beast now lifts the stern of the boat clear out of
	the water.

	The cage SCRAPES across the deck and SLAMS into the gunwale,
	toppling off the barge and

	INTO THE RIVER.

	Grant and the Kirbys are still inside.


107	EXT. THE RIVER - UNDERWATER - NIGHT				107

	The cage sinks. The closest to the door, Paul manages to get out.

	The other three aren't as lucky. The cage rotates as it descends
	and lands on the river bottom with the door side down, trapping
	them inside.

	In the cold murky depths, they pull frantically on the bars.
	Debris and equipment float around them.

	Paul surfaces out of the breath and disoriented. Spinosaurus
	pushes past the boat. If anyone is going to save his family, it
	has to be him.

	And so he dives.

	Pushing with all his might, he manages to tip the heavy
	structure, just enough so Amanda, Eric and Grant can get out.
	Paul himself isn't so lucky.

	Spinosaurus grabs the cage and Paul, throwing both straight up
	out of the water. Paul flies twenty feet away, further from the
	shore.

				AMANDA
		PAUL!

				ERIC
		DAD!

	Spinosaurus is going after the heroic Mr. Kirby, who dives,
	swimming underwater. He's trying to lead it away from his
	family.

				GRANT
			(looking around)
		Up! Up!

	He points to a heavy crane assembly, designed for lifting cages
	off the large boats. Now well accustomed to fleeing on
	command, Amanda sends Eric up first, climbing the scaffolding
	like a jungle gym.

	All the while, they're trying to spot Paul.

	Grant is the last to climb, reaching the first section as
	Spinosaurus returns from the water, SLAMMING into the base of
	the crane. The whole assembly SHUDDERS, threatening to rip into
	the water.

				ERIC
		Where's Dad?

				AMANDA
		Just hold on.

	Try as it might, the beast can't climb the crane. So instead it
	RAMS it, SHAKES it, trying to knock them off. Eric slips, but
	Amanda catches him.

	About to shed his bag to climb higher, Grant finds one last
	hope. It's the resonation chamber model. A beat before he
	decides: It may not be the best choice, but it's the only choice.

	He blows through it, the same EERIE PITCH we heard before. On
	the third try, he's able to approximate the "egg" cry he heard
	the raptors give. He keeps it up, repeating over and over.

	Spinosaurus stops for a beat, confused How this sound could be
	coming from a non-raptor. But then keeps SMASHING.

	We can hear the mounting bolts STRAIN. Soon the whole crane
	will tip.

	But not before a MATCHING CRY is heard in the jungle. Grant
	stops, not certain he heard it. But there it is AGAIN.

	He keeps blowing.

	The crane is close to tipping when a single RAPTOR appears
	from the darkness, CHIRP-BARKING at the Spinosaur, who simply
	bats away.

	But then MORE RAPTORS come. And even MORE. Soon there are
	dozens gathering, circling.

	Grant stops signaling. All three survivors watch with
	horrified fascination, knowing their fate is perilous no matter
	which side wins.

	Looking at his adversaries, Spinosaurus ROARS. And suddenly
	the raptors attack.

	Spinosaurus easily handles the first few, but like ants they
	just keep coming. They climb up his back, slicing, into him with
	their razor-sharp claws.

				GRANT
		Jump! Swim for the far shore!

	All three drop from the crane arm into the water.

	Meanwhile, the fight continues. Spinosaurus rallies, shaking
	off many of the raptors, but they just keep coming. Their
	hooked claws dig in, scraping the meat to the bone.

	Spinosaurus puts up a brave fight to the end, but finally
	collapses, dead. The raptors continue to shred it to ribbons.
	Then one of the raptors looks over to see the survivors
	swimming away.

	But a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It goes back to
	its meal.


107A	EXT. FAR SHORE - NIGHT						107A

	Grant is trying to move them along. still headed downstream.
	But Eric won't budge another foot.

				ERIC
		We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.

				AMANDA
		I know. I know. I want to look for him too.

				ERIC
		then we should...

	She kneels down, facing him. She's just as upset as he is, but
	motherhood carries the burden of remaining calm.

				AMANDA
		Let me tell you a few things about you Dad,
		okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave,
		and he loves you ever very much.

				ERIC
		He loves you too.

				AMANDA
		Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know
		that right now more than anything, your Dad
		would want to know that we're safe. Okay?

	Eric nods.

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		We're going to get out of this, and
		everything's going to be all right, I promise.

				A VOICE
		Listen to your mother.

	Out of the darkness steps Paul Kirby. Amanda is knocked over
	with surprise. Eric runs to him, nearly tackling him.

				PAUL
		Good thing I've been swimming, huh?

	Amanda hugs him and Eric so tightly they can't breath.


									CROSSFADE TO:


108-109	OMIT								108-109


110	EXT. BEACH - DAY							110

	The foursome sit back on the wide beach, one facing
	each direction, keeping watch. A light rain is falling, but they
	don't seem to notice.

	Trying to keep his boy's spirit up...

				PAUL
		You remember when we went fishing last
		summer? And I was trying to put the boat in
		and the trailer sank? And then the tow truck
		came and tried to pull it out, but it got
		dragged in? And the truck driver threatened
		to knock your Dad's lights out? So I said I
		was the governor and he believed me?

	Eric really smiles, remembering the day.

				ERIC
		Yeah.

	Amanda is smiling too. She had completely forgotten the
	incident.

				PAUL
		That was a fun day.

	To Paul, after some consideration....

				AMANDA
		We should try fishing again.

				PAUL
		You mean it?

				AMANDA
		I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows?
		Things might turn out differently.

	Her hand takes his, gently brushing off the wet sand, fingertips
	touching. It's a small thing, but it's a start.

	Sensing his cue to leave, Grant gets up and starts walking down
	the beach. Eric hurries to follow him. He speaks
	conspiratorially, not wanting to alarm his parents.

				ERIC
		The lady you called, how do you know she can
		help us?

				GRANT
		She's the one person I could always count on.
		And she's saved me more times than she
		realizes. I owe her everything.

	A long beat as they walk.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		It's strikes me now I never told her that.

				ERIC
		You should.

				GRANT
		You're right.

	As they keep walking, Grant notices something rammed against
	the rocks ahead. It's a speedboat, its hull ripped open from the
	impact.

	And it's not just any boat either -- it's the same Dino-Soar
	boat that was pulling the parasail. Eric hasnt seen it yet, so
	Grant stops him.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Eric, do you know what happened to the boat?
		that brought you here? Why did it crash?

				ERIC
		No. I couldn't see.

				GRANT
		Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a
		minute, would you?
			(pre-empting objections)
		They look worried.

	Eric nods and heads back to Paul and Amanda. Grant forges on,
	approaching the speedboat wreckage. He doesn't know what he'll
	find, but he needs to look.

	Almost reaching his parents, Eric stops. Looks out over the
	ocean, where he sees

	TWO LIGHTS.

	He doesn't say anything for a moment, trying to make sure
	they're real. They are. And they're coming closer.

				ERIC
			(excited)
		Mom! Dad!

	They look up to see the distant lights, just now making out
	full forms...

				PAUL
		Helicopters. Helicopters!

	He SHOUTS with joy. Paul, Amanda and Eric wave their arms,
	making as much motion as possible. The helicopters -- big
	military choppers -- change direction, heading straight for
	them.

	Paul and Amanda embrace, then kiss, the moment getting the best
	of them

	AT THE SPEEDBOAT

	Grant looks in, prepared to see anything in the wreckage. But
	the cabin is surprisingly intact, just a little blood. There are
	three gashes on the driver's seat back. Grant measures their
	spacing with his fingers.

				ERIC
			(yelling over)
		Dr. Grant! Helicopters are coming!

	Grant looks down to the wet sand around him, finding a trail of
	three-toed tracks.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		We're safe!

				GRANT
			(to himself)
		No we're not.

	THE FIRST CHOPPER.

	flies right overhead. Paul and Amanda are confused, until the
	second helicopter starts to land -- the first on is there to 
	cover them.

	Grant YELLS at the first chopper, trying to wave it away. But
	the noise of the blades is DEAFENDING.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		NO! STAY BACK! THEY'RE IN THE TREES!

	At the treeline, the upper branches are shaking. At first, it
	looks like it's just the wind off the chopper, but
	something more is happening.
	
	A PTERANODON

	flies up out of the trees, the first of twenty. It's a gorgeous
	and terrifying sight.


110A	INT. FIRST CHOPPER - DAWN					110A

	Terrified, the Costa Rican CHOPPER PILOT veers away, but the
	pteranodons are already on him. They SMASH at the windows,
	grabbing on the skids, The chopper rolls wildly.

	One over-eager pteranodon sticks his head up to high, getting
	decapitated by the blade.


110B	EXT. BEACH - DAWN							110B

	As the second chopper touches down on the beach, Eric, Amanda
	and Paul load in. Grant is running their way.


110C	EXT. BY THE TREES - DAWN						110C

	Meanwhile, the first copper is losing the battle even as it
	climbs higher. The helicopter suddenly tips, falling, SMASHING
	into the trees with a massive fireball.


110D	INT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWN					110D

	Seeing the explosion, the SECOND CHOPPER PILOT takes off. Eric,
	Amanda and Paul are on board, but Grant is still running up.
	The helicopter passes right over him.

				AMANDA
			(to the pilot)
		You have to go back! We can't leave him!

	Seeing a ladder release by the door, Paul throws the lever. A cord-
	and-steel-ladder unfurls, dragging across the sand.


110E	EXT. THE BEACH - DAWN					   110E

	Grant chases after us, catching a rung just as it goes over the
	water. Behind him, pteranodons are circling the wreckage of
	the first chopper and starting to go after the second.

	Buffeted by the wind, Grant climbs the ladder up towards the
	chopper. A pteranodon flies up right behind him, trying to
	bite. It catches Grant's shoulder.

	Grant spins to the far side of the ladder. The pteranodon goes
	to bite him again, but finds it head caught between the rungs.
	As it tries to free itself, it just gets more entangled.

	The entire ladder starts to lift, caught by the updraft from the
	creatures wings.


110F	INT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWN					110F

	Up with the pilot, Amanda sees the other pteranodons are headed
	back to the island, unable to keep up.

				AMANDA
		They're not following.

	In back, Paul and Eric get the ladder mechanism to begin to
	retract. It reels Grant in faster. It also reels in the
	pteranodon, which may be caught, but is still plenty dangerous.

	As Grant reaches the cabin, they shut off the ladder engine.
	The pteranodon is still working its way free, pulling itself closer
	and closer.

				GRANT
			(shouting over the noise)
		We have to cut it! Find something sharp!

	Everyone checking the cabin for a knife, anything sharp.

	Finally, Eric hands Grant the raptor claw.

	Grant uses it to rip the line. The fibers break and fray, but
	the pteranodon keeps coming closer.

	Paul throws a wrench at the pteranodon, WHACKING it straight
	in the head. It felt good, and damn if it didn't slow it down a
	little.

	Grant has cut through the cord. He started on the second when
	the pteranodon SNAPS at him, going for his hand. There's
	nowhere for Grant to cut without the pteranodon getting him.

	And idea, Grant very deliberately places in his hand on the line,
	pulling away at the last moment. The pteranodon itself bites
	through the line.


110G	EXT. OCEAN - DAWN							110G

	The pteranodon falls away from the helicopter, catching wind
	just before it hits the water.

	It circles and flies back to Isla Sorna.

	As horrifying as the creature was a moment ago, it's suddenly
	beautiful again. Each motion of its giant wings is a small
	symphony.


110H	INT. COPPER / FLYING - DAWN					110H

	Sitting between his parents, Eric looks back at the island in
	the distance.

				ERIC
		What do you think is going to happen with the
		dinosaurs?

				GRANT
		The population will Stabilize eventually.
		They'll adapt to fit different roles.

	ON PAUL AND AMANDA

				PAUL
		Either that, or the government will firebomb
		it back to the Stone Age.

				AMANDA
		I would completely support that.

	ON ERIC AND GRANT

	looking back at the island.

				ERIC
		I hope they don't. I want to come back
		someday.

	And Dr. Grant realizes...

				GRANT
		So do I.

EXT. OCEAN  DAWN
The helicopter flies away across the ocean, leaving the island behind.

1 	EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN  DAY	1

	A speedboat cuts swiftly through the ocean swells beneath the
	looming cliffs of ISLA SORNA.


2 	EXT. BOAT - DAY 							2

	Illegal Costa Rican parasail operator ENRIQUE CARDOSO helps
	Americans BEN HILDEBRAND and twelve-year-old ERIC KIRVY --
	already wearing life-vests -- strap themselves into a two-
	person PARASAIL HARNESS.


3 	EXT. BOAT - DAY 							3

	Ben and Eric clamber onto a makeshift PLATFORM that hangs over
	the back of the board. Dangling from Ben's neck is a CAMCORDER.

				BEN
		You make sure to get us as close as you can,
		okay? If it's a good trip, I'll give you a 
		little extra. 

				ENRIQUE
		Don't worry. I take you close. But not too 
		close.
			(rubbing Eric's head)
		You don't want them to eat you.

	Enrique heads toward the driver's seat and a large SECOND-HAND
	WINCH bolted to the deck.

				ENRIQUE (CONT'D)
		Ready, amigos?

	Ben and Eric nod excitedly and give the thumbs up. Ben lifts the
	camcorder to the record the action.

	Enrique jams the down the throttle down, and with a loud RAOR, the
	speedboat shoots forward. Soon the boat is whipping across the 
	rolling ocean.

	Strapped together, Ben and Eric lean back over the passing
	water, intently watching for Enrique's signal.

	As the boat picks up speed, Enrique eyes the speedometer.

	Ben grabs the end of the RIPCORD attached to the harness. He and
	Eric braces themselves.

	Enrique finally signals with a pulling motion. He pulls
	the winch, Ben yanks the cord and - 

	WOOOSH! A brightly colored PARASAIL blossoms behind the boat,
	hoisting Ben and Eric aloft. In a big BLOCK LETTERS on the
	parasail is stitched "DINO-SOAR."

	THE TOWNLINE unsold rapidly from its enormous reel.

	BEN AND ERIC climb higher and higher.

	ENRIQUE keeps an eye on the clients. When they reach a certain 
	height, he LOCKS OFF the reel.

	High overhead, Ben and Eric are floating in wonderful, quiet
	splendor. The motor of the boat now sounds strangely distant.

	Down below, the boat enters a think blanket of FOG.

	Eric points excitedly at the islands as Ben films him with the
	camera.

	Then, a sudden TUG on the thing line cause Ben to drop the camera,
	which now dangles from his neck.

				ERIC
		What was that?

	A second tug...and now the faintest of screams.

	Ben and Eric look down to find that the boat has disappeared
	into the low bank of FOG.

	By the time the boat emerges on the far side of the mist...THEIR
	IS NO SIGN OF ENRIQUE. The deck is splattered with blood.

	As Ben considers the driverless boat...

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Ben!

	Ben glances over at Eric, staring in horror at something 
	below. Following his gaze, Ben finds that their boat is only
	moments away from crashing into A LARGE REEF.

	Sticking out of the water, the imposing reef is being battered
	by waves.

	AS THE BOAT SMASHES INTO THE REEF, it splinters into a
	number of pieces.

	A panicked Ben turns to Eric.

				BEN
		Unclip your line!

	Eric and Ben frantically unclip their lines. Catching an
	updraft, the parasailers float upward.

	A strong wind sends them wafting over the daunting cliffs
	of ISLA SORNA...


4 	EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - DAY 					4

	TWO PLASTIC DINOSAURS enter the frame and do battle accompanied
	by a child's ferocious sounds.

				CHILD (O.S.)

		RRRRROW! GRRRRRR!

	WINDER TO REVEAL -

	CHARLIE, a three-year old boy, plays in a sandbox with his
	favorite toy dinosaurs. ALAN GRANT squats next to him and
	watches with great delight.

	ELLIE SATLER stands over them, an INFANT in her arms -- a
	picture of the perfect family.

				GRANT
		Oh, actually, Charlie, those two are
		herbivores. They wouldn't be interested in
		fighting each other. But these...
			(picking up two other dinosaurs)
		See, these are carnivores. And this one here
		-- see its claws -- this one here uses its
		claws to gouge at the throat of its opponent

	As Grant demonstrates with some GRUNT and GROANS of his
	own, he only succeeds in frightening the boy.

				ELLIE
			(interrupting)
		Uh, Alan?


				GRANT
		Hmm?

				ELLIE
		He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a
		little older?


				GRANT
		Oh, right.
			(back to Charlie)
		Happy dinosaurs.

	He bounces them along the sandbox edge.

	Then, the sound of a CAR ENGINE turning off and a door
	SLAMMING is heard.

				ELLIE
		That must be Mark.
			(calling out)
		Mark, were back here!

	Ellie and Grant turn to see --

MARK DEGLER coming through the gate carrying a briefcase. He's their age, handsome but not annoyingly so, with a friendly,
	balance demeanor.

	He and Ellie kiss tenderly on the lips.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		Good day?

				MARK
		Keeping the world safe.
			(re: baby)
		Here, let me take her.

	Ellie hands off the baby.

				ELLIE
		Mark, this is Alan Grant.

				MARK
		Nice to meet you, Alan. I've heard a lot about
		you.

	The two men shake hands, and we now realize it is Grant
	who is the stranger in this household. Little Charlie runs to
	his father, showing his dinosaur.

				CHARLIE
		Daddy, this is a herbabore.

	Grant smiles uncomfortably, a third wheel.


5 	INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 					5

	WINDEN to a PARROT in a large cage. Grant is teasing 
the bird with a cookie, holding a it just out of reach.

				GRANT
		What's my name? Come on, Jack, say it. Is my
		name Alan? Say my name.

		The bird doesn't respond.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		He used to know me.

				ELLIE
		Sorry, Alan it's been six years.

	Grant shrugs, gives Jack the cookie, and heads towards the table.
	The three adults are finishing their dessert and coffee. The
	The children have been out to bed.

	An awkward moment of silence. Uncomfortable smiles. Then --

				MARK
		More coffee?

				ELLIE
			(relived)
		Yes. Great.

	Mark stands and collects their cups.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		So, Mark's working at the State Department
		now.

				GRANT
		Really? 
(To Mark)
What do you do there?

				MARK
			(with mock bravado)
		I could tell you about it, but than I'd have to
		kill you.

				GRANT
		Indeed.

	Mark smiles, nodding. Then he goes into the kitchen. Another
	uncomfortable silence.

				ELLIE
	So what are you working on now?

				GRANT

	We have a new site in Montana. At least until
	the money runs out.

				ELLIE
		Anything good?

				GRANT
		Raptors, mostly.

				ELLIE
		My favorite.

	Grant leans forward, realizing Ellie's one of the few people he
	can talk to about this.

				GRANT
		You remember the sounds they made?

				ELLIE
		I try not to.

				GRANT
		We've done cranial scans, and raptors
		actually had a quite sophisticated
		resonating chamber. I have a theory that
		their ability to vocalize is the key to their
		social intelligence. The way they can work
		together as a team.

				ELLIE
		You think they could talk to each other?

				GRANT
		To a degree we never imagined.

	And from the cage in the corner of the room...

				JACK
		Bullshit!

	Both look back at the parrot. ELLIE smiles.

				ELLIE
		You taught him that.


6 	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 					6

	Ellie and Grant head toward the rental car parked in the
	driveway.

				ELLIE
		Good luck with the fund raising.

				GRANT
		It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park,
		you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils
		are out. Everyone wants to see a real live
		dinosaur.

				ELLIE
		Times change Alan. But you're the still the
		best. I mean that.

				GRANT
		The last of my breed.

	A long moment passes between them as both consider where
	they've ended up.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		I'd better get going.

				ELLIE
		Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad
		about asking for help, but please ask me.
		Anything, anytime.

				GRANT
			(deep down knowing he never
			 will)
		Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.

				ELLIE
		Goodbye, Alan.

	Not sure what the right thing to do is, they finally end up with
	a friendly hug. They keep it short.

	Grant gets in his car. Starts the ENGINE.

	He's about to pull off when Ellie knocks on the window. He rolls
	it down.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		When I met you, I thought that one day
		millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs
		became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me
		otherwise. When conditions changed,
		dinosaurs changed. They became other things.
		They evolved.

				GRANT
		A well-accepted theory.

				ELLIE
			(simply)
		Alan don't be afraid to evolve.

	Grant hears her, but Ellie knows it didn't really get through.
	A forced half-smile, than Grant waves goodbye.

	Ellie watches as he drives off.


7 	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY 						7

	The last stop on Grant's fund-raising tour, it's a public
	lecture hosted by some foundation. There are SCIENTISTS and
	STUDENTS here, but also a lot of DINO-FANS, some even with
	costumes.

	Grant finishes his speech to what was a full house -- some
	ATTENDEES are grabbing their coats and sneaking out. This
	wasn't the exciting guest speaker they were all expecting.

	A new slide comes up. Just black and white, and indecipherable.

				GRANT
		It's through the painstaking study of the
		Interior chamber in multiple specimens that
		we can determine this exciting correlation
		between the larynx and the upper plate. That
		lets us theorize -- theorize, mind you -- that
		the raptor might have been capable of bird-
		like vocalizations. Which as you can
		imagine, would be a tremendous breakthrough.

	He's finished, but no one seems to notice at first. Then the
	SYMPOSTUM LEADER stands up, leading a smattering round of
	APPLAUSE.

				SYMPOSTIUM LEADER
		Thank you very much Dr. Grant. Now does
		anyone have a question?

	Nearly every hand goes up. Grant doesn't seem surprised.

				GRANT
		Does anyone have a question that doesn't 
		relate to Jurassic Park?

	Quite a few hands go down.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		Or the incident in San Diego, which I'll
		remind you, I did not witness.

	Now most of the hands are down. Picking one of the few
	remaining...

				MALE STUDENT
		Your theory on raptors is good and all, but
		isn't all this conjecture kind of moot?

	The STUDENT'S BUDDY nods in agreement.

				MALE STUDENT (CONT'D)
		I mean, once the U.N. and Costa Rica and
		everyone decides how to handle the second
		island, scientist will just go in and look
		for themselves.

				TOO-CLEVER SCIENCE REPORTER
		Isn't paleontology itself in danger of
		extinction?

	Recognizing those as fighting words, the symposium leader is
	about to step in. But Grant will take this himself.

				GRANT
		No, and let me be perfectly clear on this
		point. Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago.
		What's left of them is fossilized in stone
		the actual scientists spend years to
		undercover.
								   (MORE)

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		what John Hammond and InGen created are
		theme park monsters. Nothing more, nothing
		less.

		The class clearly disagrees with his assessment.

				ANOTHER STUDENT
		You're saying you wouldn't want to study
		them if you had the chance?

				GRANT
		No force on this earth or in heaven could get me on
		that island.


8 	INT. DERELICT COCKPIT - DAY 					8

	Looking through the cracked windshield of a junkyard plane, we
	see someone spray painting red circles on the outside of the
	glass.


9 	EXT. AIRCRAFT GRAVEYARD - DAY 					9

	NASH, a wry, intelligent mercenary pilot and soldier, is
	painting huge eyes the windows of a wrecked plane. Finished, he
	tosses the paint can through the open windows and walks quickly
	away from the plane.

	We now see that RED TEETH are painted on the craft's nose. It
	looks absurdly like some angry beast.

	We are one the edge of a dry lake bed, part of an aircraft
	graveyard. Wrecked planes lie all around.

	We hear a phone RINGING...


10 	INT. CARGO PLANE - DAY 					       10

	A RINGING satellite phone rests on a stack of gun cases.

	UDESKY, the leader of this crew, answers it. 

				UDESKY
		Udesky.
			(beat)
		Yes sir. we're good to go. I'll lock it down as
		soon as you drop me the payment.

	With the phone still to his ear, Udesky wanders out of the
	craft...


11 	EXT. CARGO PLANE - DAY 					       11

	Udesky looks over at Nash and COOPER, another mercenary.

	Cooper's the quiet muscle of the bunch, a weapons specialist. He
	finishes loading a massive gun, essentially a hand-cannon. It's
	aimed at Nash's grimacing aircraft.

				UDESKY
		That's right, two of the very best I could
		find. No, I haven't worked with them
		personally, but they come with the highest
		recommendations.

	Then --

	Cooper FIRES at the grimacing aircraft. A projectile rockets
	into the plane and EXPLODES with a fireball.

	Nash and Cooper exchange a satisfied smile.

				UDESKY (CONT'D)
		You've got nothing to worry about, sir. This
		is going to be a piece of cake.

	Pieces of the demolished craft come raining down.


12 	EXT. EXCAVATION BASE CAMP, PT. PECK LAKE, MT - DAY 	12

	CLOSE ON a man's hand, carefully scraping the stone away from a
	dinosaur fossil. We follow his hand back as he wipes off his
	sweaty brow, revealing him to be BILLY BRENNAN, 25, an
	associate professor and site manager. He's a charmer.

	Looking past him, we see CHERYL, 21, a junior at junior of State. She's one
	of a dozen COLLEGE STUDENTS working at the site, and the one
	most smitten with her supervisor.

				CHERYL
		Billy? I don't think I'm doing this right.

	He scoots over, lying down beside her. Checks her work.

				BILLY
		You need to go slowly. See, just take it little
		at a time.

	She's not listening, just watching his eyelashes.

				CHERYL
		I can never tell what's bone and what's rock.

				BILLY
		Technically, it's all rock. The calcium in the
		bones is replaced during fossilization. But
		you can feel the difference. See? Rough,
		smooth. Rough, smooth.

	He runs her bare fingers over the two different patches, showing
	her. After a pause, she runs her finger along his
	stubbly chin...

				CHERYL
		Rough.

	...and along his lips.

				CHERYL (cont'd)
		Smooth.

	Billy may not have started this flirtation, but he's not ending
	it either. It's then that a

	SHADOW

	falls across them. Billy looks up to see...

				BILLY
		Dr. Grant!

	Grant has just returned, a bag over his shoulder.

				GRANT
		Mr. Brennan.

										CUT TO:


12A	EXT. WALKING TO THE MAIN TENTS - DAY 			12A

	Billy takes one of Grant's bags, talking as they go.

				BILLY
		How was your trip? Profitable?

				GRANT
		We'll be broke in four weeks.

				BILLY
		Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.

	The cross into one of the tents, which only has two "walls". On
	a dust-taped table, a dusty Macintosh is feeing data into a
	strange machine the size of a dorm refrigerator. A mechanical arm sweeps
	back and forth across a tray of fine sand.

				GRANT
		You rented an automated litter box.

				BILLY
		It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan
		data from the raptor skull, than the computer
		breaks it into thousands of slices which this
		thing prints, one layer on top of the other.
		It's the future of paleontology.

				GRANT
		Not if it can't dig.

	The arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes, dropping
	through holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of 
	a person's fist.

				BILLY
		I give you a raptor's resonating chamber.

	Grant hates technology, but he can't help but be amazed by the
	result. He lifts the strange object up, shaking out the
	remaining sand.

	Billy puts it to his lips and blows through it like a conch shell.
	The resulting SOUND is unique and piercing, the cry of an 
	non-existent animal. Grant is speechless with excitement. And so he
	uses it again and again, producing different SOUNDS and
	variations.

	In the distance, flocks of birds rise to the sky and fly off.

	Billy looks up to see a MAN and a WOMAN getting out of 	
	a Cadillac. Cheryl is pointing them in the direction of the 		
	tent. 									

				BILLY (cont'd) 				
			(falsely casual) 					
		Oh, I forgot to tell you. Some visitors 			
		wanted to come by and talk	to you. I 
told them you'd be happy to see them. 
		maybe even have dinner with them. 						

				GRANT 					
		Absolutely not. 						

				BILLY 						
		They're here. 							

				GRANT 					
		What? 								

	Only now does Grant realize these two people
Who were walking up to them.
Putting on a friendly smile, Billy goes up to them.				

				MAN 						
		Dr. Grant? 							

				GRANT 					
		Yes? 								

				MAN 						
			(extending his hand)					
		Paul Kirby. Kirby Enterprises				 	
			(reaching into his pocket) 	
		My card. 							

	PAUL KIRBY is a talkative optimist with				
	no "off" switch. His wife AMANDA KIRBY, just
as friendly, is harder to read. There seems to be			
	exhaustion behind her eyes. 					

				GRANT 					
		What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby? 				

				PAUL 						
		Well sir, I am a great admirer
of yours, and I have an extremely interesting 
proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife 
and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.					

				GRANT 					
		You know, I've been traveling and I'm very 		
		tired. Maybe some other time. 				

				PAUL
		I guarantee it'll be worth your while.

	Behind Kirby, Bill furtively rubs his thumb and fingers
	together, indicating the guy is loaded.

	Grant musters a weak smile.

				GRANT
		It's be my pleasure.


13 	INT. HELL CREEK BAR AND GRILL, JORDAN, MT - NIGHT 	13

	Theyre only halfway through the entree, but Grant is ready to
	bolt. It's only Billy who's keeping him from being rude. They walk
	over to Paul and Amandas table and sit down.

				PAUL
		First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts,
		Amanda and I have admired your work for
		years.

				AMANDA
		It is truly, whats the word? Inspiring.

				GRANT
		Thank you.

	It's everything Grant can do just to be polite. He desperately
	wants to leave and get back to his dig.

				PAUL
		Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors.
		Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure
		tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2,
		the Nile...

				AMANDA
		We even have two seats reserved aboard the
		first commercial moon flight.

	Billy nudges Grant.

				GRANT
		Hmmm.

				PAUL
		Now, for our wedding anniversary this year
		we wanted to do something really special,
		something...

	He places his hand on his wife's.

				AMANDA
		...once-in-a-lifetime.

				PAUL
		We've arranged for a private airplane to
		take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want
		you to be our guide.

	The Kirby's look to Grant as if they've offered him an amazing
	gift. But Grant just sighs and smooths the tablecloth.

				GRANT
		That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm
		afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can
		refer you to a number of highly qualified...

				PAUL
		No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've
		seen these animals in the flesh. No one else
		has come close to you.

				GRANT
		I'm flattered, but I've taken this little
		adventure tour. And with the air
		restrictions they've imposed after the
		incident in San Diego, you cant fly low
		enough to see anything of interest.

	Paul is momentarily stymied, but Amanda rallies.

				AMANDA
		You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I
		have special permission to fly low.

				BILLY
		How low?

				PAUL
		Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do
		know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone
		else.

				AMANDA
		From what I understand, it's pretty much
		whatever we want.

				GRANT
		That's hard to believe.

				PAUL
		Let's just say that through my business --
		imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've
		made some friends in high places. In this
		case, the Costa Rican government.

				AMANDA
		Dr. Grant, you don't know how important it is
		for us to have you come along. It would make
		all the difference.

	Grant is trying to find another way to say no, when Paul pulls
	out his checkbook.

				PUAL
		And of course, we're prepared to make a
		sizeable contribution to your research here.

	Billy looks at Grant. Don't say no.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		I can write all kinds of numbers on this
		check. Just tell me what exactly it would
		take.

	We HOLD ON a conflicted Dr. Alan Grant.

		  		  CUT TO:

14 	EXT. SKY - DAY 							14

	NNNNNRRRRRRNNNNNRRRRR...

	A SMALL AIRPLANE - a Beechcraft Kingair 200 Turboprop, to be
	exact - cruises through clear blue skies.


15 	INT. PLANE - DAY 							15

	Grant re-settles, trying to get comfortable. Billy is across
	from him, finishing cleaning his camera lenses before putting
	them back in the ragged case.

				GRANT
		Even with what I pay you, you could get a
		better bag.

				BILLY
		No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago
		some buddies and I went hang gliding off
		these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me
		right into the side. BOOM!

				GRANT
		That does sound lucky.

				BILLY
		It was this strap alone that saved my life.
		Got caught on a rock as I was falling.

				GRANT
		Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most
		idiotic.

	Because he hasn't really said it...

				BILLY
		Listen Alan, I really appreciate you
		bringing me along.

				GRANT
		The bones will be there when we get back.
		That's the nice thing about them. They never
		run away.
			(beat)
		And besides, you got me into this. I don't
		intend to be alone with these people.

	ON PAUL AND AMANDA

	sitting near the front of the plane. Paul draws a long, nervous
	breath and looks at Amanda. She seems just as tense.

	Finally finding a comfortable position, Grant puts his hat over
	his eyes, ready to take a nap.

	Done with his camera, Billy turns to someone just off screen.

				BILLY
		So how do you know the Kirby's?

	and we reveal...

	Mercenary Cooper, the weapons specialist we met earlier. He's
	wearing sunglasses so dark you can't tell whether he's staring
	at you or fast asleep.

	He doesn't answer. Did he even hear? And then --

				COOPER
		Through our church.

				BILLY
		What Religion?

				COOPER
		Uhthe one that worships God and believes in being
		Good. 



16 	EXT. SKY - DAY 							16

	The plane continues onward.


17 	INT. PLANE - DAY / HOURS LATER 					17

	Grant slowly wakes in his chair, groggy. All the other
	passengers are fast asleep. Then Grant turns to his right.

	A RAPTOR

	sits besides him. The dinosaur eyes him curiously, then opens
	his mouth...

				RAPTOR
		Alan.

	And than it STRIKES.


18 	INT. PLANE - DAY 					       		18

	Grant wakes up with a start, disoriented. Billy is leaning over
	him.

				BILLY
	Alan. We're almost there.

	The adrenaline still surging through him, Grant turns and looks

	THROUGH THE WINDOW.

	Clouds obscure the view, than parts reveal

	ISLA SORNA

	rising majestically out of the water.


19 	EXT. SKY - COUNTINUOUS DAY 					19

	We watch the plane descend sharply to the island.


20 	INT. PLANE - COUNTINUOUS DAY 					20

	In various combinations, Grant and Billy, Paul and Amanda look
	out the windows at the amazingly green island.

	Cooper looks out through a window of his own.


21 	INT. COCKPIT - COUNTINUOUS DAY 				21

	Here we find the rest of the crew from the junkyard. Nash is
	piloting.

	A VOICE comes over their radio headsets.

				RADIO VOICE
			(Spanish accent)
		Unidentified aircraft approaching Isla
		Sorna, this is San Juan approach. You are
		flying in restricted airspace. Immediately
		turn to the coordinates two-zero-zero. I repeat
		redirect to...

	A look from Nash then Udesky switches off the radio.


22 	EXT. PLANE - COUNTINUOUS DAY 				       22

	The plane now descends to a mere hundred feet above the
	treetops.


23 	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS DAY 				       23

	Paul puts his hand atop Amanda's as they stare intently out the
	window.

	Billy looks to Grant.

				BILLY

		Admit it. You're excited.

	Grant will admit nothing.

	Calling back from the cockpit...

				UDESKY
		Cooper! Yell up if you see anything!

				COOPER
			(yelling back)
		No, I thought I'd keep it to myself.

	Suddenly Grant spots...

				GRANT
		There. There! An Apatosaur. Look at the
		coloration.

EXT. ISLA SORNA  GRASSY FIELD  CONTINUOUS DAY

	An Apatosaur is grazing on the grass.

INT.  PLANE  CONTINUOUS DAY

				BILLY
			(amazed)
		I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see
		skin.

				GRANT
		Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right
		you can see...

	But Paul just waves him away with a hand, staring intently out
	his window. We HOLD ON Grant a moment, thinking that odd.


24 	INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS DAY 				       24

	Udesky puts down his binoculars.

				UDESKY
		South shore is clear. The rest is rock.

				NASH
		Are we on?

				UDESKY
		We're on.


25 	INT. MAIN CABIN - CONTINUOUS DAY  			       25

	Looking out the window, Grant notices they're flying awfully
	low. Just then, he hears a MECHANICAL HUM and a LOW RUSH from
	outside. Now wanting to believe --

				GRANT
		That's not the landing gear?

	Paul, Amanda and Cooper don't respond.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		What you're...
			(realizing)
		You can't land.

	Paul turns back to him.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll
		explain this all in a jiffy.

				GRANT
		This plane can not land!

				AMANDA
		It's going to be all right. Just...

	Grant is out of his seat, heading for the cockpit. He'll wrestle
	the controls if he has to.

	Cooper grabs him, pulling him back. Grant starts to struggle,
	but he's certainly no match. A well-practiced fist hits him
	dead on.

	CUT TO BLACK.


26 	OVER THE DARKNESS 						26

	we hear Amanda's voice, strangely distant but amplified.

				AMANDA
		Eric! Eric! Are you there honey? Ben!
		Erriccc!

	Her calls continue as we FADE UP to...


27 	INT. PLANE - DAY 							27

	GRANT'S P.O.V. -- blurry and disorientated. He finds himself lying
	on the floor of the plane.

	Seeing him come to, Billy helps him slowly get up. Grant's head
	is pounding.

				GRANT
		Tell me we didn't land.

	By his expression, we see Billy would have to lie.

				BILLY
		I think they're looking for someone.


28 	EXT. LANDING STRIP, ISLA SORNA - DAY 			       28

	The jungle has almost reclaimed this patchy vine-covered
	runway. The airplane is parked at one end.

	Nash, Udesky, and Cooper are checking their weapons.

	Amanda is at the edge of the tarmac calling into the jungle on a
	BULLHORN.

	Billy and a groggy Grant emerge from the airplane. Paul trots
	over.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant, are you alright? I'm sorry we
		had to be so...

	The three mercenaries are now walking into the jungle with
	their guns.

				GRANT
		What the hell is going on? What are they
		doing?

				PAUL
		Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe.
		These guys are really good. One of them was a
		Green...

				GRANT
		Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is
		no such thing as safe. We have to get back in
		this plane...

	Grant looks to Amanda, who shouts through a bull horn.

				AMANDA
			(on-bullhorn)
		ERRR-IIIC!

				GRANT
		And tell your wife to stop making so
		much noise! We're food to these damn 
animals.

				PAUL
			(yelling)
		Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad
		idea!

				AMANDA
			(on the bullhorn)
		What?

				PAUL
			(pointing broadly at Alan)
		He says it's a bad idea!

				AMANDA
			(on the bullhorn)
		What's a bad idea?

	As in on cue, there is a DEAFENING ROAR from the jungle.

	Everyone turns toward the sound and freezes.

				PAUL
			(to Alan)
		What was that?

	Grant doesn't answer, still listening to the reverberations. 
Then a couple shots are heard.

				BILLY
			(low)
		Is it a rex?

				GRANT
		I don't think so.

	Billy and Paul breathe a small sign of relief.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Sounds bigger.

	Nash and Udesky come RUNNING out of the jungle, headed for
	the plane.

				UDESKY
		We gotta go, now!

				PAUL
		What's the problem? Can't you guys...?

	As Udesky and Nash sprint past Paul in interrupted by a
	second, closer, DEAFENING ROAR. He pales.


29 	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 				       29

	Udesky waits by the door, hustling everyone inside. Nash
	hurries into the cockpit. Everyone scrambles to a seat. Amanda
	climbs next to Paul.

				AMANDA
		We can't just...

				PAUL
		Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and
		come back.

	Udesky closes the door.

				BILLY
		What about the other guy?

				UDESKY
		Coop's a professional. He can handle himself.

	A blood-curdling SCREAM echoes through the jungle followed by
	MACHINE GUN FIRE.

				NASH
			(yelling back)
		We're going!

	Udesky climbs into the copilot's seat, and Nash revs the engine.


30	EXT. RUNAWAY - DAY						30

	The plane starts down the runway.


31	INT. PLANE - DAY							31

	The passengers bounce in their seats as the plane picks up
	speed down the overgrown strip.


32	EXT. RUNWAY - DAY							32

	Suddenly, two hundred yards ahead of the plane,

	COOPER

	emerges from the jungle. He stands in the middle of the runway.
	waving one arm wildly. His second, badly injured arm hangs
	limp by his side.

				COOPER
		Come on, Nash. Slow down, buddy.


33	INT. THE COCKPIT - DAY					       33

	Nash spots Cooper, shoots a glance at the airspeed indicator.

				NASH
		Coop, you know I can't do it pal.

	He slams down full throttle in an attempt to reach flying speed.

	Seeing that Nash has no intention of stopping, Paul shouts from
	the cabin.

				PAUL
		What are you doing? That's Mr. Cooper!


34	EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY				34

	We are looking down on Cooper from behind. As the plane
	approaches,

	A SHADOW

	falls over the injured mercenary. Then with brutal speed, an
	ENORMOUS BEAST seizes him in its massive jaws and lifts him
	into the air.

	From this angle we get only a glimpse of a long crocodilian
	snout, powerful clawed forearms and spiny sail rising from the
	creature's back.


35	INT. THE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS - DAY			       35

	All eyes are on the creature as it devours Cooper. Amanda turns
	away in horror.

				AMANDA
		Oh, my God! Paul, my God!


36	INT. THE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS - DAY			       36

	Looking through the windshield, we see the creature is directly
	in the path of the plane.

	Nash pulls back on the stick. The plane rises.

	The left propeller clips the flank of the enormous
	dinosaur, SNAPPING the blade.

	Blood sprays the windshield and side windows.


37	EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY 				37

	The turboprop banks into the jungle, out of control.


38	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 					38

	The passengers are thrown about as the craft CRASHES through
	trees, tearing off a wing and pieces of the tail.

	Finally coming to rest in the jungle canopy, the plane settles
	in the trees.

	SILENCE.

	The passengers slowly recover and have a look around. Foliage
	blocks most windows, making it impossible to see out.

				BILLY
		Is anyone hurt?

	Checking themselves, everyone seems pretty much intact.

	Still thinking of himself as in charge...

				UDESKY
		Quiet! We're okay. Let's everybody just stay
		put.

	He attempts to turn on the cockpit radio, but it's dead.

				NASH
		Who's got the sat-phone?

				PAUL
		Right here!

	Paul hands the bulky phone up to Nash, who dials out.

	Grant unstraps himself, climbs to the back to the side door and shoves.
	The door opens a few inches before hitting a branch.

	He looks out the and lets out a quiet gasp as the ground reels

	THIRTY FEET BELOW.

	He quickly shuts and latches the door.

	CLOSE ON the sat-phone. pressed against Nash's ear.

				RECORDED VOICE
		We're sorry. All circuits are busy. Please
		try your call again later...

				NASH
		Shit!

				PAUL
		What is it? What's the matter?

	Amanda SCREAMS.

	A huge reptilian face appears in the cockpit window. Everyone
	else SCREAMS now.
	
	The plane LURCHES - and we hear a deep GROWL.
	
	The passengers hold tight, paralyzed. Nash buckles himself into
	his seat.

	Suddenly, the plane is YANKED from the side to side. Battered this
	way and that, the terrified passengers tightly grip their 
	seats.
	
	Finally, the horrible sounds of WRENCHING METAL as the nose of
	the plane is RIPPED RIGHT OFF.

	Nash and Udesky are suddenly sitting in open air. The nose of
	the plane is tilting downwards, the jungle floor far below.

	The passengers hang almost vertically in their seats,

	Debris tumbles out the open end of the plane, some of it
	striking Nash in the head.

	Udesky unbuckles his seat belt and climbs back up into the
	cabin. Nash follows.

	Suddenly, a long snout with dagger-like teeth pushes past the
	cockpit seats, opens wide, and

	CLAMPS DOWN

	on Nash's legs.

	The pilot CRIES OUT in agony. The others passengers grab onto
	his arms, trying to pull him back. But it's no use. The dinosaur
	rips Nash out of their grasp and down the aisle.

	Nash desperately grabs on to the seat cushion, then watches in
	horror as the fabric RIPS AWAY. He's pulled out of the plane and 
	dropped to the ground. A giant foot steps in the way as the snout
	of the creature reaches down and quickly devourers the screaming
pilot.

	It's horrifying sight, but no one can turn away.

	Pleased with the appetizer, the creature comes back for the
	main course.

	Grant tries to force open the jammed rear door. Billy tries to
	help, but the door won't budge.

	The dinosaur JAMS its snout into the fuselage and lunges for
	Amanda in the first row. She yanks her legs back as the jaws
	SNAP SHUT.

	Behind Amanda, Billy reaches forward, UNSNAPS her seat belt
	and pulls her into the next row back.

	The others unstrap their belts and crowd into the rear of the
	passenger compartment.

	The shift in weight sends the fuselage tipping backwards.


39	EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS - DAY				       39

 	The plane breaks free of the tree limbs and DROPS tail-first to
	the jungle floor.

	It SLAMS hard, then flips over onto its roof.


40	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY				       40

	The passengers are prowled on the ceiling of the plane, dazed
	by the impact. Everyone is cut and bruised.

	Out of the open cockpit, they see two approaching dino feet.

	A window near Amanda fogs over with condensation. when it
	clears, she finds herself looking right into enormous eyes.

	Then all hell breaks loose as the plane is SLAMMED across the
	jungle clearing.

	The passengers are hammered against the walls of the plane,
	tumbling like socks in a dryer. Debris, seats and luggage fly
	everywhere.


41	EXT. JUNGLE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY			41

	The plane comes to an abrupt halt as it SMASHES into a tree.

	A gargantuan FOOT steps on the fuselage and FLATTENS it like a 
	paper tube.


42	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY					42

	Inside, windows EXPLODE, raining glass over the passengers. As
	the walls compress, Udesky becomes trapped in the rear of the 
	plane, the others in front.

				BILLY
		Over here!

	Udesky dives into the narrowing gap, and Billy pulls him the
	rest of the way through.

	Billy is as terrified as the rest of them, but he thrives under
	this rush of adrenaline.
	
	Then a huge CLAW digs into the skin of the fuselage and begins
	to slowly PEEL the plane open. Grant looks up in dread at the
	widening tear.

				GRANT
		This way!

	Grant leads the group out the open end of the cockpit. They
	make a mad dash for the jungle.

	A tremendous ROAR causes Billy to look behind him. He can't
	help but steal a glimpse of this terrifying, but utterly
	fascinating, animal.

	Grant yanks him forward.


43	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY						       43

	With Grant in the lead, and Udesky taking up the rear, the group
	tears through the jungle.

	Concealed by the dense undergrowth, the unseen dinosaur bears
	down on them -- mowing down the young trees which TOPPLE all
	around them.

	Grant spots a grove of

	HEAVIER TREES

	and leads the group into it.

	The dinosaur cannot fit between the trunks. It ROARS at
	the fleeing humans, searching desperately for a route after
	them.

	The group continues their relentless pace, putting as much 
	distance as they can between themselves and the beast. Paul
	Kirby looks like he's about to have a heart attack. Even Billy
	is gasping for air.

	They stop, thinking they've outrun it.

	Grant directs the group through some underbrush and into --


44	EXT. CLEARING - CONTINUOUS - DAY				44

	Our friends stop dead in their tracks. Amanda stifles a cry.

	Before them lies an immense unmoving SAUROPOD.

				GRANT
		Don't worry. It's dead.

	Then a full-grown bull

	TYRANNOSAURUS

	rises up behind the carcass. It was feeding, its mouth mottled
	with blood and carrion.

	Grant FREEZES.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Nobody move a muscle.

	Remember: the T-Rex tracks motion.

	Obeying, the group FREEZES for a few long beats. Then Udesky
	takes off running.

	And T-Rex ROARS.

	Everyone runs. T-Rex is right behind them.


45	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							45

	Dashing back the way they came, the group suddenly comes face
	to face with --

	THE FIRST MONSTER.

	We now get our first full unobstructed view of the gigantic
	creature, SPINOSAURUS AEGYPTICUS. Over forty feet long and
	twenty-five feet high, the dinosaur has a bony sail along its
	back. Its head is crocodilian with rows of long, curving teeth.
	Sinewy six foot arms terminate in three fingers hands with
	fourteen inch claws.

	Nowhere else to run, the group scatters into the brush as the
	two behemoth predators rush forward, their ROARS thunderous.

	Paul and Amanda scramble into one direction, Billy and Udesky in
	the other. But Grant can't go anywhere - his foot is stuck 
	between two branches.

	He manages to free himself as the two dinosaurs approach.
	They'll have to deal with each other before eating the humans.

	Grant dives down between two fallen trees as the Spinosaurus and T-
	Rex circle one another like gladiators, each searching for the
	other's weakness.

	Laying flat on his back, Grant lets out a terrified GASP as the
	giant foot of Spinosaurus lands across the two trunks mere
	inches from his face.

	Spinosaurus lunges forward, powerful jaw open wide.

	T-Rex sidesteps the assault, its tail knocking down small
	trees as it spins out of the way.

	In the tress, Paul and Amanda scurry again for cover.

	Between the fallen trunks, Grant attempts to get away on his
	hands and knees.

	T-Rex presses the attack, slamming its tail into the flank of
	its adversary. Spinosaurus is knocked back, and Grant is again
	forced to duck for cover.

	As Spinosaurus struggles to regain its balance, T-Rex dives
	forward. Spinosaurus is driven backwards as T-Rex tries to
	grip its throat.

	Amanda yanks Paul out of their path. They Scramble over to
	Billy.

	Now on its side, Spinosaurus fights back ferociously. It slashes
	at T-Rex with its long arms and razor sharp claws, then finally
	kicks the animal with one mammoth foot.

	Tyrannosaurus staggers back, wounded.

	Down below, Grant is splashed by the blood pouring from the
	dinosaur, as he slowly makes his way towards his fellow humans.

	Spinosaurus lunges for the T-rex with gaping jaws and manages to
	topple T-Rex off its feet and sends the falling dinosaur to the
	ground.

	With an earth-shuttering CRASH, the dinosaur lands between
	Grant and the rest of the group.

	The companions scurry out of the way, but as they do so, the
	head of the T-Rex now lands almost directly on top of them.

	Plastered against an immense tree, the group watches in horror
	as T-Rex starts to rise but is thrown back down as Spinosaurus
	latches onto its throat.

	Spinosaurus crushes the life out of its adversary, and T-Rex
	opens and closes its jaw a mere inches from our terrified 
	friends.

	Finally, Grant reaches the others.

				GRANT
		Come on!

	Spinosaurus lets out a victorious HOWL, and the blood-drenched
	professor leads the group through the undergrowth.


46	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							46

	Winded from running, Paul is caught off-guard as a furious
	Grant slams his back against a tree. Only one thing he wants to
	know --

				GRANT
		Why did you bring us here?

	Paul is too startled to speak. Udesky tires to step in, but
	Grant gives him back a look.

				AMANDA
		Our son is on this island. We need your help
		to find him.

	Still crunched against the tree, Paul pulls out a photo from his
	shirt pocket.

				PAUL
		This is him. Eric. Hes thirteen now. He's
		just about the greatest kid in the world.

	Letting go of Paul, Grant takes the photo, a Sears-style
	portrait of the boy we saw Parasailing at the beginning. He
	shakes his head, disbelieving. He hands the photo to Billy.

	The group splits into two sides -- Paul and Amanda, Grant and
	Billy -- with Udesky stuck between. Dialogue overlaps in
	places.

				AMANDA
		He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.

				BILLY
		Who's that?

				PAUL
		Her new boyfriend.

				AMANDA
		A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted
		to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben
		found a guy who would take them parasailing.
		They never came back.

				PAUL
		We called everyone, did everything we could.
		Because of all the controversy over this
		island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says
		it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault.
		Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy --
		said we should "accept the inevitable." You
		believe that?

				GRANT
		So you hired these mercenaries.

				UDESKY
		We prefer "recovery specialists." We do
		overseas custody issues and...

				GRANT
			(interrupting)
		Then you duped us into coming here.

				PAUL
		We needed somebody who knew the lay of the
		land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.

				GRANT
			(disbelieving)
		I have never been on this island!

				PAUL
		Sure you have. You wrote that book...

				BILLY
		That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna.
		The second island.

				PAUL
			(low, to Udesky)
		I didn't know, there were two islands.

				AMANDA
		Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You
		saved those kids.

				GRANT
		A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we
		were better prepared and better armed.
			(finally)
		How many days have they been missing?

	A look between Amanda and Paul.

				PAUL
		Eight weeks.

	Grand and Billy are speechless. It might as well be eight years.

				GRANT
		After what you've seen today, you really
		think your son could be alive?

				AMANDA
		He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much
		about dinosaurs.

	Before anyone else can talk, Grant puts his hand out. He wants
	everyone to shut up while he plans their next move.

				GRANT
		No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we
		can from the plane. Then we head for the
		coast. There may be a boat left, something to
		get us off this island.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.

				GRANT
		You can stick with us, or you can go and look for
		him. Either way you're probably not getting
		out of here alive.

	With that he leaves, A beat later, Billy follows. He has
	genuine sympathy for the Kirby's, but he's logical enough to
	know Grant is right.

	BACK WITH PAUL AND AMANDA

	They look to Udesky.

				PAUL
		What do we do?

	Udesky is clearly at a loss, but for everyone's reassurance he
	tries to mutter some brio.

				UDESKY
		Well, I think we should start searching for your
son. In the direction they're going.

				PAUL
		Excellent.

	They follow after Grant and Billy.


47	EXT. PLANE CRASH SITE						47

	The five survivors search through the wreckage, trying to find
	anything useful. The task is grim. Mindful of Grant's 
	warnings, they move quickly and quietly.

	Udesky picks up a gun out of the swampy water. The barrel is bent
	almost 90 degrees, unless.

	Billy finds his camera, intact.

	Digging a change of clothes out of his suitcase, Paul steps
	around the side of the plane to change. He's in his underwear
	before he notices Amanda is also there changing.

				PAUL
		Sorry.

				AMANDA
		Nothing you haven't seen before.

	A beat. Amanda looks over as they get dressed.

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		How much weight have you lost?

				PAUL
		Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been
		swimming at the Y.

				AMANDA
		You hate to swim.

				PAUL
		People change.

	A nod to mean, that's the truth.

				PAUL (CONT'D)
		You look good.

				AMANDA
		So do you.

	They make brief eye contact, which Amanda breaks.

	Around the side, Billy is taking photos of a giant footprint the
	dinosaur left in the mud during its attack on the plane. Grant
	looks over.

				GRANT
		How would you classify it?

				BILLY
		Obviously a superpredator.
			(best guess)
		Suchimimus. that snout.

				GRANT
		They never got that big.

				BILLY
		Baryonyx?

				GRANT
		Not with that sail.
			(Billy gives up)
		Spinosaurus Aegypticus.

				BILLY
		I don't remember that on InGen's list.

				GRANT
		That's because it wasn't on their list. Who
		knows what else they were up to?

	Billy looks past Grant to see Paul approaching. He's struggling
	with the straps on his backpack. turning in circles.

	Billy regards him with suspicion.

				BILLY
		So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2,
		did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?

				PAUL
		Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.

				BILLY
		About a thousand feet above it, actually.
			(closer)
		Most mountain-climbers remember how tall
		that mountains were.

	Paul knows he's caught.

				GRANT
		There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?

				PAUL
		There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint
		and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate
		Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The
		"plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces
		accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like 
		that.

				BILLY
		I don't suppose that check you wrote us is
		any good.

				UDESKY
		He paid us half up front. Cash.

				PAUL
		Mortgaged everything we had to do it. Even
		the store. and if we make it off this island
		with my son, I swear, I'll make good on the
		money I owe you. I don't care if it takes me
		the rest of my life.

	Grant and Udesky exchange a dubious glance.

				UDESKY
		However long that is.


48	EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY						48

	Amanda, Paul, Billy, Udesky and Grant walk through the jungle.

				AMANDA
		Eric!

				GRANT
		Quiet!

				PAUL
			(loud whisper to Amanda)
		Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous
		territory.

				AMANDA
		Well we should split up or something. We can
		cover twice the area.

				PAUL
		No, Dr. Grant says...

				AMANDA
		Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...

				PAUL
		Well what's the use of hiring an expert if
		your not going to listen to him?

				AMANDA
		Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric.
		Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.

				PAUL
		Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after
		you, don't come crying to me.

				AMANDA
		Oh, don't worry about that.

				PAUL
		What?

				AMANDA
		Nothing.

				PAUL
		What did you say?

				AMANDA
		Nothing.

				PAUL
		What did you say!

				AMANDA
		Just drop it Paul!

	The Kirby's conversation trails off into the jungle. Udesky
	moves up next to Grant and Billy.

				UDESKY
		If they split up, I'm going with you.

	And as they continue forward, Billy spots something in the
	trees ahead.


49	EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY					49

	A parasail chute is caught in the branches of a tree. A yellow
	life vest hangs limply from a branch.

	Paul rushes over, unsnags it, and examines the label.

				PAUL
		Young adult.

				AMANDA
		Eric...

				UDESKY (O.S)
		Hey. Got something here.

	All turn to see Udesky holding up a camcorder encased in a
	waterproof shell.

				AMANDA
		That's Ben's!

	She grabs it from Udesky and pops open the housing. She tries
	the power switch on the camcorder, but the battery's dead.

	Udesky pull out a flashlight from his pack and looks to Amanda.

				UDESKY
		Here, give that to me.

	And as Udesky fiddles with the flashlight, Grant and Billy
	consider the parasail.

				BILLY
		It looks intact.

				GRANT
		We should take it with us to signal any planes.

				UDESKY (O.S)
		I think I've got it.

	Udesky has rigged the wires on the flashlight so that the
	batteries can be used to power the camcorder.

	He brings a live wire to back of the camcorder. A red power
	light comes on.

				AMANDA
		It works!

				UDESKY
		I don't know for how long.

	Udesky swings the tiny screen out and pushes play. The others
	crowd around.

	ON THE SCREEEN

	Eric and Ben play frisbee on the beach.

				PAUL (O.S.)
			(excited)
		That's him. Thats Eric!

				AMANDA (O.S.)
		I filmed this the morning they left.

	Ben catches the frisbee, checks his watch and motions to Eric.

	Eric runs over, and Ben puts his arm around him as they run to
	the camera.

	Paul reacts to this image but holds his tongue.

	THE VIDEO SCREEN -

	The image now CUTS to a shot from aboard Enrique's boat
	speeding towards ISLA SORNA -- the start of the movie. Eric
	points excitedly at the island and smiles at the camera.

	We replay the opening moments of the movie from Ben and Eric's
	perspective, soaring high until...

				ERIC
		Ben!

				BEN
		Unclip the line!

	THE JUNGLE -

	A PAN from face to face of all watching this tape with a
	mixture of hope and nausea.

	ON SCREEN -

	Angle again with Ben's legs in the foreground. Falling fast.

				BEN (CONT'D)
		Hand on! Hang on buddy!

	Now the camera penetrates the jungle canopy and the picture
	and sound become complete chaos: SCREAMS from the both,
	branches BREAKING, flashes of Ben and Eric's frightened faces
	as the camera is buffeted in all directions.

	With a lurch the terrifying descent in finally over, and the
	jungle floor is just ten feet away, swaying back and forth
	beneath Ben and Eric's feet.

				BEN (CONT'D)
		Are you ok, buddy?

	There's GURGLING to his voice. Ben may be more hurt than he's
	letting on.

				ERIC
			(through his sobs)
		I don't know. I think so.

				BEN
		We're okay. It's going to be okay. Here, get
		ready. I'm going to unhook you.

	The sound of PUMPLING is followed by the sight of Eric DROPPING		
	into the frame, landing on the ground rolling. He stands and
	looks back up at Ben.

				ERIC
		I'm all right

				BEN (O.S)
			(weaker)
		We're going to get out of this, pal.

	And on that, the power and picture fade away.

	BACK ON PAUL AND AMANDA - overjoyed.

				PAUL
		See? He's okay. He's alive! Everything's
		going to be all right now.

	Amanda brings a hand to her mouth, silently nodding her head.

	Grant and Billy exchange a dubious look, than begin pulling the
	parasail out of the tree. As they do so, the sail gets caught on
	a branch.

	They pull harder. The branch bends, but the sail won't come
	loose. One last tug and than, SNAP. The branch breaks, the chute
	falls away to reveal

	A SKELETON.

	It swings down directly at Amanda. She SCREAMS.

	Finally, the others are able to pull her away. As they untangle
	the lines, the men are able to get the first view of the remains
	of Ben Hillenbrand, still caught in his harness.

	Amanda's knees buckle. Regaining her balance, she runs off into
	the jungle.

	Paul quickly follows.

				PAUL (CONT'D)
		Amanda!


50	EXT. THICKNESS - DAY						50

	Reeling, Amanda comes to a stop in an area with thick
	undergrowth. It's danger here, very still and quiet.

	She tries to calm herself, but each effort to suppress just
	makes her more emotional. She's surprised as Paul wraps an arm
	around her to comfort her. But she doesn't fight it.

				PAUL
		I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for
		the things I said about him.

				AMANDA
		No, it's...

				PAUL
		I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...

				AMANDA
			(frustrated)
		Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out
		here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.

	Saying it aloud, the reality sinks in for both of them

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		I guess I was hoping that with Ben around,
		there'd be someone to keep him safe.

	Checking in on clients, Udesky stops at the edge of the
	thicket. Something raises the hairs on the back of his neck.

				UDESKY
		Dr. Grant!

	He nods for the others to take a look at this. They head over,
	Grant at the rear.

	As he approaches, Billy is packing up the rest of the chute in a
	backpack. He stops short from what he sees.

	Looking down, we CIRCLE across the jungle floor. Here we find a
	strange, hollowed-out construction made of sod and branches.
	Maybe six feet around.

	Just now noticing the others' stare, Paul looks down into one
	of the bowls at his feet, a half-buried nest. It's filled with
	football-sized eggs, laid in a spiral.

	And this isn't the only nest. Amanda counts twelve in all, laid
	out in an oddly symmetrical pattern.

	The last to arrive, Grant identifies the species in a horrified
	instant.

				GRANT
		Raptors.

And as he says the words, off in the distance, we hear
	the cry of some herbivores, around by the chorus of
	snarls.


							SMASH CUT TO:

51	EXT. FUTHER IN THE FOREST - DAY				51

	The party blasts through the forest, trying to keep up with
	Grant. They haven't even had time to ask --

				AMANDA
			(to Paul)
		Whats a raptor?

	Paul has no idea.

				UDESKY
		They don't look that big. I mean,
		comparatively.

				GRANT
		If we came across one, we might live.

				PAUL
		Well that's good.

				GRANT
		But you never came across just one.

	From the back --

				AMANDA
		Wait! Where's Billy?

	They all stop. The only one not there is --

				Grant
		Billy! Billy!

				AMANDA
			(almost sotto)
		I thought we weren't suppose to yell.

				BILLY (O.S)
		Here!

	He comes in from the left. Excited, he explains to Grant --

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		I got some great pictures of the nest. You
		know this proves raptors raised their young
		in colonies.

	Furious with his student. Grant just keeps moving. There's no
	time to stand around and argue.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		This speaks to a larger social structure, the
		possibility of Darwinian altruism. It
		changes everything.

	A beat. Trying not to sound presumptuous --

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		We could co-write a paper.

				GRANT
		Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish
		or perish.


52	SCENE PREVIOUSLY OMITTED					52


53	EXT. RIDGE - DAY (HOURS LATER)					53

	Much fatigued, the five now mach upward towards a crest.

	Panting and flushed, they reach the top of the ridge and gaze
	into the distance.

	A jungle valley stretches before them. Not far off in A VAST
	COMPOUND - comprised of several buildings. One building alone
	seems to cover several acres.

	The weary group breathes a sigh of relief.

				PAUL
		I bet there's a very good chance Eric's in
		there. I'd bet my bottom dollar.

	Udesky and Grant share dubious looks and continue down into
	the valley.


54	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - DAY					54

	The group emerges from the jungles and enters the compound.
	They walk through an overgrown parking lot, littered with
	abandoned vehicles. Some are lying on their side. Others are
	overturned completely.

	They're not going to be driving anywhere.

	A troubled Grant peers through a windshield, partially caved
	in, like some giant head butted the glass. (Think back to Lost 
World)

	And the group finally approaches the front doors of an
	enormous building. As they head up the front steps, we see
	something in the distance behind them:

	CAT-LIKE MOVEMENTS

	on the high ridge. To fast to see what it was. But too ominous
	to dismiss.


55	INT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY					55

	Our friends now find themselves in a sparse, one quietly
	opulent corporate lobby now in the process of being reclaimed
	by the jungle/ Roots and ivy poke through the floor and walls.

	In the waiting area, the cushions of a sofas and chairs have been
	gnawed at and pulled apart. Dusty coffee mugs and filled
	ashtrays lie on the table. The water has turned brackish in a
	near by cooler.

	Sudden FLAPPING. We look up and see BIRDS nesting in the
	rafters. It is an eerie, haunted place.

				PAUL
			(calling out)
		Eric! Are you here?

				AMANDA
		Eric!

	All listen for a response. Nothing. Paul and Amanda exchange a
	despondent look.

	Sitting on the reception counter is an official-looking
	telephone. Everyone has the same thought, but no one dares.
	Finally -

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		What the hell.

	Amanda puts the receiver to her ear. Nada.

	With Grant in the lead, they head deeper into the building.

	Unseen by the group, a fleeting SHADOW flits across the lobby's
	dirty windows with terrifying speed.


56	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY						56

	A couple vending machines stand at the one end of this long
	hallway covered with vines.

	Paul notices them and pulls change from his pocket.

				PAUL
		Let's see. I've got about a dollar seventy-
		five. How about you guys?

	Billy SMASHES IN the window of one machine with his boot.
	Picking through the glass, he pulls out some candy bars and
	chips. He checks the expiration date. 	


	CONTINUED:								56

				BILLY
		Thank God for preservatives.

	He tosses the food to the others.

	Paul now turns to his own vending machine and SMASHES it with
	his heal. The glass refuses to break.


57	INT. HATCHING LABORATORY					57

	Grant and Billy push through a set of doors to see
	
	A CAVERNOUS HATCHING FACILITY

	filled with much of the same equipment we recognized from the
	first island, although the sheer size of this place dwarfs any
	of the facilities seen previously.

	As the group walks down the ramp and onto the floor, they begin to
	absorb the incredible array of technology: enormous cryonic
	freezer, their plug pulled years ago; empty incubators; tanks
	of formaldehyde with dinosaur fetuses and body parts.

	Machines with intricate tubing and wing arms stand beside
	conveyer belts cris crossing the room at different levels.

				AMANDA
		This is how you make dinosaurs?

				GRANT
		This is how you play God.

	Billy looks around the lab. He can't help but be impressed.

				BILLY
		Okay if I take pictures?

	Grant nods.

	Billy sets his lucky camera back down on the worktable. Two years
	from now, astute observers of the DVD will not that Billy
	doesn't actually take his camera from the bag; he was carrying
	it because there wasn't any room inside.

	Billy pulls a new roll of film from the bag and zips it shut.

	ACROSS THE LAB

	Amanda is passing a large cylindrical tanks with half-formed
	embryos floating in formaldehyde -- genetic experiments gone
	awry. Finally she reaches

	A GIGANTIC MANIFIED RAPTOR HEAD

	floating in the one tank.

	Something about this specimen catches Amandas attention. She
	bends forward, getting very close to the glass. She peers right
	into the eyes of the nightmarish creature. Then --

	AN ACTUAL RAPTOR

	lunges at her form behind the tank. She SCREAMS.

	Fortunately the raptor can't get between the closely spaced
	tanks. Amanda runs.

				PAUL
		Amanda!

				GRANT
		Back out! Move!

	And as the group races through the lab the Raptors find a
	larger gap between the tanks.


58	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY				58

	Paul leads the way, checking the door for possible escape
	routes or hiding places. Twenty feet behind,

	THE RAPTOR

	rounds a corner, bolting after them. Paul ducks in the closest
	door.

				PAUL
		In here!


59	INT. DINO KENNEL - CONTINUOUS - DAY				59

	The group slams the door behind them and quickly takes in the
	room.

	There are several rows of oversized steel cages, apparently
	used for containing young dinosaurs. Many of the cage doors are
	standing open.

	The group races down a lone aisle. Close behind, the raptor
	BURSTS into the room, ROARS.

	As the Raptor gains ground, Udesky and Billy run into one of the
	open cages, SLAMMING the door behind them.

	Grant, Paul and Amanda duck into another. Before they can
	swing the cage door shut behind them, however, the raptor SLAMS
	into it, driving the door into the cage.

	They are forced back against a chain-like wall, trapped in a
	small triangle space by the advancing door. The angry
	Raptor is now inches away through the cage door.

	Then, suddenly, the raptor looks up. We follow its gaze. The top
	of their triangular enclose is wide open.

	The eager raptor climbs up the chain-like door. Catching the
	tail of an idea, Amanda grabs the door and nods to the others.

				AMANDA
		Push!

	They push hard on the cage door, swinging it and the raptor
	right through the opening of the cage.

	Now the raptor is trapped in a small triangular space, the door
	going right to the ceiling.

	Amanda slides the door's bolt through the chain like wall,
	temporarily trapping the dinosaur.

	The raptor struggles desperately, GRAWLING AND SNARLING, but
	the cage door seems to be holding.

	As everyone rushes back to the door.

	The raptor begins to make a LOW, HAUNTING MOAN.

	As the others head for the door, Grant lingers a step, listening
	to the beast's simple melodic cry. It has the same tones as
	came from the model resonating chamber.

				GRANT
		She's calling for help.


60	EXT. COMPOUND - DAY						60

	The group exits the rear of the lab building and finds itself in
	a large equipment yard. The CALL of the raptor is still audible
	as they head for the tree line.

	Now they moan is ANSWERED from distant jungle quarters.

	The responses quickly MULTIPLY. To the group's dismay, they
	soon find themselves virtually SURROUNDED by raptor CRIES both
	distant and near.

	Grant looks around with amazement. It's vindication of his
	theory on raptor communication, but it couldn't come at a worse
	time.

	Responding to the growls, a herd of grazing HADROSAURS suddenly
	flees across the open space. Then, in the distance behind the
	herd

	A PACK OF RAPTORS

	emerges from the jungles, coming their way.

				GRANT
		Head for the trees!

	From the lab building, the raptor we left imprisoned now BURSTS
	out one of the doors and HOWLS to the pack -- the same cry we
	heard in the lab.

	The raptor pack moves into the hunting formation. One ALPHA-MALE
	RAPTOR. slightly larger than the others, leads the charge up the
	middle.

	Grant risks a looks back. But doesn't stop running.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		THIS WAY!

	In an effort to escape the oncoming raptors, Grant leads the
	group right into the stampeding heard of hadrosaurs.

	Suddenly, all is chaos. Hadrosaurs race past, splitting up the
	group.

	Letting the others get ahead of him, Grant looks back. Much to
	his dismay, the raptors are ignoring the hadrosaurs.

	Indeed, the pack weaves its way through the herd -- the raptors
	only want them.

	In the chaos of the stampede, everyone loses sight of each other.

	Up ahead, Billy trips and falls. As he rolls the strap on his
	camera bag breaks. He doesn't notice it's missing until he's
	already back on his feet and running.

	Amanda and Paul keep close to each other. Further back, Grant
	spots Billy's fallen camera back. He grabs it as he runs past.

	Looking back, Billy sees that Grant now has his back...

				BILLY
		ALAN!

				GRANT
		KEEP GOING!

	They lose sight of each other in the rush.


61-19	OMIT									61-69


69A	EXT. EDGE OF THE JUNGLE - DAY					69A

	As the hadrosaurs WHIP PAST, Paul and Amanda climb up into a
	tree. A raptor leaps at Paul, barely missing his leg.

	Trying to pull Paul up, Amanda nearly loses her balance. This
	time, Paul catchers her.

	Billy climbs up a nearby tree of his own in sight of Paul and Amanda.

	Udesky has nearly reached a tree of his own when he finds
	himself

	HEADED OFF

	by a raptor. He turns to the other way, but finds

	THERE ARE MORE RAPTORS.

	He picks up a fallen branch as these dinosaurs cautiously
	approach. Not more than a few feet away, the leader of the trio
	stops, peering at him.

	Udesky swings hard, but the dinosaurs feints. From behind him,
	another raptor slashes at the back of his legs, severing his
	muscles. Udesky CRIES OUT and drops to the ground.

	IN THE TREETOPS

	Paul, Amanda and Billy can hear him.

				PAUL
		Udesky.

				AMANDA
			(Listening)
		He's this way.

	From here, the thick branches overlap, forming a kind of
	"second floor" above the ground. It's not easy, but you can move
	from branch to branch, tree to tree.

	ON THE FLOOR

	Unable to walk, Udesky attempts to crawl away from the animals.
	The effort clearly causes him great pain. Strangely, the
	raptors suddenly don't seem interested in him anymore.

	Rather, they're "talking" among themselves. Udesky is amazed to
	find him self still alive.

	Suddenly, one of the raptors SLASHES at him again. But it's
	delicately not a mortal blow, just a very painful one. Udesky
	CRIES OUT, louder this time.

	IN THE TREES

	Hearing the new cry, Paul, Amanda and Billy move faster, now
	finally seeing Udesky on the ground. He's face-down, barely
	moving but still MOANING.

	The raptors are gone.

	In the lead, Amanda starts to climb down. But Paul grabs her,
	holds her back.

				PAUL
		It's not safe.

				AMANDA
		We have to help him.

				BILLY
		He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill
		wounded.

				AMANDA
		He's not a kill, he's still alive.

	She breaks from Paul's grip and drops to the ground. She's only
	a foot away from the tree when

	ALL FOUR RAPTORS

	lead out from their hiding places. They almost catch her as
	Billy and Paul pull her back up on the limb

	The raptors stare up at them, angry their plan didn't work.

				PAUL
		They couldnt climb up, so they were trying
		to get us to come down.

				BILLY
		They set a trap
			(amazed)
		They actually set a trap.

	Bored with waiting, the raptors go back to finish off Udesky,
	making a meal out of it. Up in the branches, the survivors are
	horrified and sickened.

	Then, from the deep in the forest, a new RAPTOR CRY. The feasting
	raptors look up, listening, then suddenly run off into the dark
	jungle.

				PAUL
		Where's Grant?


69B	EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - DAY				69B

	Climbing higher in a tree, Grant is just feet above a growing
	pack of raptors. He scales one branch, the next, finally
	reaching a perch that the dinosaurs can't jump to.

	LOOKING DOWN

	The entire pack is now standing still, watching him. In the
	center, the Alpha Male lets out a sort of BARK. Responding to the
	cry, the other raptors CALL BACK.

	As terrified as he is, he can't help but be fascinated by their
	communication. Like a hellish bird song, there's a rhythm to it,
	a structure. They're clearly talking about something.

	Under his breath, Grant is able to mimic its patterns.

				GRANT
		What does that mean? What are you saying?

	Of course they can't answer. They just keep using the same
	"phrase."

	Ready to ditch Billy's camera bag in order to climb higher --
	he's had to hold it by the strap -- Grant finds his hand covered
	with a runny slime. He looks down at the camera bag, and that's
	the source. It's oozing out the bottom.

	He unzips the bag to find

	A BROKEN RAPTOR EGG

	inside, the white and green yolk still dripping from the pieces
	of the shell. There's another intact egg beside it.

	This is what the raptors where chasing.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		God damn you, Billy.

	Ever the scientist, Dr. Grant tests a theory even in the face of
	danger: he holds up the intact egg so that the raptors can see it.
	They suddenly go crazy, howling the same phrase but LOUDER.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		It means, "Give us the egg," doesn't it? "We
		want the egg."

	He gently drops the bag to the ground. Although the raptors are
	interested, pulling out the unbroken egg, they're still by no means
	placated. The song may have changed, but they still want Grant
	dead.

	They begin to jump at him, eventually, hopping up on each
	others backs. It's only a matter of time till they reach him.

	Grant moves to climb higher, but sees no branches he can reach.
	And than he hears the low CREAKING. A CRACK. The branch he's
	on is starting to give in.

	He looks down at the face of his enemies, knowing he'll be
	their next meal. And then,

	A SMALL CANISTER

	lands at the base of the trees, immediately SPRAYING out a thick
	cloud of oily fog. It's the first of

	FIVE CANISTERS

	that land in the area, creating a thick cloud. It's not just
	smoke though something far more caustic.

	As it hits the raptors they immediately recoil, those closest
	to the canisters SHRIEKING in pain. Tumbling in the dirt.
	There may be a pheremonal element to the mist as well -- they
	seem panicked, disoriented.

	Pack mentality takes over, and after the first ten raptors take
	off running, so do the rest, some tripping over their feet
	blindly.

	This may be dino-tear gas, but it's not good for humans either.
	Up in the tree, Grant's eyes immediately burn from the vapor
	He squints to see through the fog, where he spots

	A HUMAN SHAPE

	at the edge of the smoke

				VOICE
		Come on! They'll be back!

	Grant half-climbs, half-falls out of the tree, rushing to get
	through the heaviest of the smoke.

	A SMALL DIRTY HAND

	grabs his, pulling him along.


69C	EXT. JUNGLE - LATE DAY						69C

	Eyes swollen from the gas. Grant stumbles, barely able to see as
	the other person pulls him along. It's only now we can identify
	his rescuer as

	ERIC KIRBY,

	the boy he was brought to rescue. A lot has changed in the last
	eight weeks. It's not just dirt and muck -- he's the filthiest
	child you've ever seen -- something primal has come out in him.

	Something wild.


69D	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - TWILIGHT				69D

	On the far side of the tipped over vehicle, Eric pulls open a
	hatch -- his hiding place. The door opens part way.

	Eric motions for Grant to follow.


69E	INT. INSIDE THE BUNKER - TWILIGHT				69E

	Squeezing in sideways -- it's very tight fit -- Grant finds
	himself in a space no bigger than the inside of a Datsun. lit by
	a small battery-powered lantern. This is where Eric has been
	hiding.

	The minute Grant's inside, Eric goes back to work re-sealing
	the door. This 13-year old boy has become astonishingly
	efficient at staying alive.

				GRANT
		Eric...

	The boy holds up a hand. He listens for a moment. He doesn't
	hear anything outside.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Eric, your parents are both here.

				ERIC
		In Costa Rica?

				GRANT
		On the island.

	Eric truly can't believe it. He hoped to be rescued but...

				ERIC
		They'll never make it. I mean, they can't
		manage when the cable goes out.

				GRANT
		You'd be surprised what people can do when
		they have too.

	Eric studies his guest, finally certain he recognizes him.

				ERIC
		You're Alan Grant, aren't you?
			(off surprised reaction)
		I read both of your books.

				GRANT
		Which one do you prefer?

				ERIC
		The first one. Before you where on the island.
		You liked dinosaurs back then.

				GRANT
		Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.

	Grant takes a better look around Eric's tiny hideaway,
	impressed with what he's been able to scavenge. Among the many
	items we see another smoke canister, some battery-powered
	lanterns and lots of candy wrappers. This kid's been living on
	chocolate for weeks.

				ERIC
		When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of
		stuff behind.

				GRANT
		Any weapons, radios?

	Eric pulls up a long cattle prod to show Grant.

				ERIC
		Found this, but the battery's dead.

				GRANT
		It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I 
		barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight
		weeks.

	The line catches Eric strangely. It's the first moment of true
	emotion we've seen him in.

				ERIC
		Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.

				GRANT
			(trying to be positive)
		The important thing is we both made it.
		That's something we have in common.

	Eric rips into a candy bar. After a moment, he realizes he
	should offer one to his guest as well.

	Grant takes it. A lone beat. Than, Grant just has to know...

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Did you read Malcolm's book?

				ERIC
		Yeah.

				GRANT
		What did you think?

				ERIC
		I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy.
		Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the
		guy seemed kind of high on himself.

	Grant smiles.

				GRANT
		That's two things we have in common.


69F	EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT						69F

	The trio is where we left them, perched up in the branches.
	They're far from safe, but nothing's after them for a
	while.

	In Billy's eyes, we can see a storm of guilt raging. But he
	hasn't said anything. Won't say anything.

				AMANDA
		We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr.
		Grant are out there somewhere.

				PAUL
		I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit
		of good right now. For every scary thing we
		saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times
		more of 'em at night.
			(to Billy)
		Am I right?

				BILLY
		I dont know.

				PAUL
		I thought you were an expert.

				BILLY
		Dr. Grant was.

				AMANDA
		Well Dr. Grant isn't here, so we're going to
		have to figure out what to do ourselves.

	Amanda is impressed by her own determinations. A long beat.

				AMANDA (cont'd)
		So what do we do?

	No one has the faintest clue.


69G	EXT. DEEP IN THE FOREST - NIGHT					69G

	VARIOUS SHOTS; The creatures of Isla Sorna walk past in the
	shadows, some looking up at the light in the trees.

	Suddenly, one of the creatures is attacked by another. We hear
	ROLLING, SNARLING, HISSING, just seeing the outline of the
	fight. Just as fast as it began, the fight is over, the winner
	snakes on the loser.


69H	EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT (LATER)					69H

	Everyone's moved to different branches, trying to settle in for
	the night. Paul keeps looking over to the tearful Amanda, about
	to say something. He finally does.

				PAUL
		I just want you know, Amanda. It's not
		your fault what happened.

	Amanda looks over, not sure what his absolution.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		Eric has always been headstrong, and you
		throw Ben Hildebrand into the mix and well...

				AMANDA
		Well what?

				PAUL
		Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead.
		What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy
		accident. The exact same thing could have
		happened if he was with me. You can't go
		beating yourself up about it.

	Realizing he's trying his best, Amanda cant stay angry with
	him.

				AMANDA
		This wouldn't happen if he was with
		you. I mean, you drive five miles below the
		speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives
		years.

				PAUL
		That one time was just the bumper.

				AMANDA
		He would have been, safe. Completely,
		entirely, suffocatingly safe.
			(beat)
		I would have him to see more of the world than
		Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the
		world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's
		my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that
		you have to be here.

	Really looking at her...

				PAUL
		I'm not sorry at all.


69I	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - DAY					69I

	Morning on Isla Sorna. A low mist hangs tight to the forest
	floor as Eric seals up his hideaway for hopefully the last time.

	They start walking. Eric pulls something out of his pocket,
	shows it off to Grant.

				ERIC
		Know what this is?

				GRANT
			(takes it)
		A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.

				ERIC
		Mine's new.

	Grant hands it back.

	Eric is becoming more and more a normal thirteen-year old boy.
	There's an innocence to him that's coming back.

				GRANT
		How much of this island have you explored?

				ERIC
		I stayed pretty close to the compound,
		Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's
		where they'd start.

				GRANT
		We need to head for the coast.

				ERIC
		Are you sure?

				GRANT
		Why?

				ERIC
		Closer you get to the water, the bigger
		things get.


69J	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69J

	Billy and Amanda wait for Paul as he comes out of the bushes,
	hiking up his shorts.

	Trying to take charge...

				BILLY
		We need to stick to the plan. Head for the
		coast.

				AMANDA
		What about Eric and Dr. Grant?

				BILLY
		Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's
		alive, thats where he's headed.

				AMANDA
		What about Eric?

	Billy represses his instinct to say Eric's dead.

				PAUL
			(rationalizing)
		He's probably has a better chance by the coast
		as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs
		would live in the center of the island.
			(to Billy)
		Right?

				BILLY
		Sure.


69K	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69K

	As Grant and Eric walk, both stop, hearing a strange sound. But
	for a change, it's not an ominous one.

	It's a human one.

	A phone is RINGING, very faintly. Without a word to each other,
	Grant and Eric decide its coming from the right.

69L	EXT. JUNGLE - CONTUNUOUS DAY					69L

	Paul is picking the briars out of his socks as they hike,
	risking tripping on every step. Then Amanda stops short. She's
	the first to hear it:

	THE SAME RINGING.

	After a beat, everyone else can hear it too. And recongnition
	finally lights on Paul's face...

				PAUL
		My phone.

	Suddenly, Paul frantically searches his pockets as the others
	anxiously watch.

				AMANDA
		You had the phone the whole time?

				BILLY
		Where is it?

				PAUL
		I don't know. I don't have it with me.

				AMANDA
		When did you have it last?

				PAUL
		I don't remember

				AMANDA
		Think.

	And Paul wracks his memory...

				PAUL
		The plane. I got a call on the plane, put it in
		my coat pocket, and...

	Bust suddenly, he stops, his face is lighting with an awful
	realization. Amanda couldnt bear the wait...

				AMANDA
		What?...WHAT!?

				PAUL
		I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on
		him when he...

	The hideous implication of his words slowly sink in.


69M	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69M

	Still following the faint RINGING, Grant and Eric turn to find

	A SAIL

	moving through the low trees. We recognize it as the back of a
	spinosaurus. We might think it's any random spinosaurus,
	except for the RINGING coming from somewhere inside it.

	Grant and Eric press back against a tree, keep perfectly
	still as they hear the THOOOOMB, THOOOOMB, THOOOMB of the
	creature's footsteps reverberating. It's tail RUSTKES against
	the brush.

	It's moving behind them, and it's close.

	We hear the RINGING move from left to right as it passes. So
	far, its has no idea they're there.

	Looking across the clearing, Eric is startled to see

	PAUL AND AMANDA

	are no more than 20 yards away, also hiding. An involuntary
	reflex, Eric calls out...

				ERIC
		Mon! Dad!

	Grant immediately covers the boys mouth. But it's to late.
	The dinosaur has stopped. We still can't see it. We don't know how
	close it is.

	Paul and Amanda spot Eric with Grant. They're a thousand
	emotions at once: relieved, disbelieving, terrified, overjoyed.
	They want to run to him, to yell out to him, but the monster is
	close.

	Grant takes his hand off Eric's mouth. They both stay
	completely silent.

	All this time, the sat-phone is RINGING.

	Than it stops.

	And after an agonizing beat, the beast moves. At first we're
	not sure which direction it's headed, but finally we can tell
	its moving away.

	Once the sail is finally out of sight, Eric breaks from Grant's
	hold and dashes to his parents' arms. They coop him up. Hug
	him, kiss him, their affection unquenchable. He's crying.

				AMANDA
			(reassuring him)
		Sweetheart, you're okay.
			(reassuring herself)
		You're okay.
			(disbelieving)
		You're okay.

				PAUL
		Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men,
		we stick around, huh?

				ERIC
		We do.

	Looking at her grubby son, Amanda licks her shirttail, trying
	to rub his face clean.

				PAUL
		Honey, there's not enough spit in the world
		for that.

	She LAUGHS. It's the first times she's laughed in two months.

	Billy crosses the distance to Grant.

				GRANT
		We need to keep moving.

				BILLY
		Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry
		about the...

				GRANT
		Billy, I can't talk to you now.

	He walks off. Billy follows him.

				BILLY
		Please, okay? Just yell at me. Call me an
		idiot. An asshole. Stupid. Tell me I screwed
		up because I know I did.

	Grant doesn't respond.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		I thought if we could get a raptor back
		to the mainland, we could get serious money
		for it. Enough to fund the digging for 10
		years. More. Whatever it took.

	Grant shakes his head, disgusted, But doesn't stop.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		You have to believe me. I did it with the
		best intentions.

				GRANT
			(finally turning on him)
		Some of the worst things imaginable have
		been done with the best intentions. You
		rushed in with no thought to the
		consequences, to yourself or anyone else.
			(finally)
		You're no better than the people who built
		this place.

	Grant keeps walking, leaving Billy with his guilt.


70	INT. CANYON BUILDING - DAY					70

	The group enters a structure with giant windows designed to
	look into the canyon beyond -- only there's nothing to see but a
	thick fog.

	Toward the center of the room, a spiral staircase that leads to
	a lower level.

	With Billy lagging, Grant approaches the stairs and peers down
	the circular opening in the floor. There is not much to see, just
	fog, a glint of sunlight.


71	EXT. RIVER CANYON - DAY						71

	Step by step, Grant leads the group down a rusty spiral
	staircase below the observation room. The stairs end in a lower
	level. Although we're technically outside, this whole place feel
	strangely enclosed.

	There's a thick fog at this level -- clouds, really -- but far
	below we can see the river. And at its banks, a barge.

				GRANT
		We climb down to the barge and follow the
		river out to the ocean. With any luck, the
		Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.

				ERIC
		Then we go home?

				AMANDA
		Then we go home.

	Grant leads everyone down a RAMP to --


72	EXT. LANDING - DAY							72

	A catwalk branches off, a SET OF STAIRS continuing down the
	along the canyon wall.

	Grant starts down the stairs. He's only taken a few steps down
	the rusty staircase suddenly

	BREAKS BENEATH HIS FEET.

	Paul grabs him in the nick of time. The staircase vanish into
	the fog. CLANFING AGAINST the canyon wall. After a few more
	seconds of silence, they hear the CRASH far below.

				AMANDA
		You okay?

	Grant nods and looks in the other direction.

				GRANT
		How about if we try this way?

	Their only other option is a precarious catwalk that
	disappears into the mist.

				AMANDA
		Do you think it goes all the way across?

				GRANT
		One way to find out.

	The only way to get his-near-fall is to push ahead. But his
	stomach turns at being so high.

	Amanda follows. The catwalk creaks and groans, listing
	slightly. She freezes mid-stride.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
			(glancing back)
		We'd better do this one at a time.

	Amanda steps of and Grant carefully pushes forward,
	disappearing into the thick fog.

	The others listen to the CREAKING of the catwalk until it STOPS
	ABRIPTLY.

	SILENCE.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant?

	More silence. Then, out of the fog, a distant voice call out --

				GRANT (O.S.)
		Come on over. One at a time.

	Amanda steps tentatively forwards. Eric is clinging to her.

				AMANDA
		Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.

				PAUL
		We're not going anywhere, I promise.

	As Paul holds Eric, and Amanda shares a look.

				Amanda
		We're all together now, Eric.

	Eric reluctantly releases her mother. Amanda starts to cross.


73	EXT. REVER CANYON - FAR WALL - DAY				73

	Grant has stopped at a lateral support across the
	catwalk, trying to get the sense of where they are and what
	purpose this place may have served.

	Seeing that the support beams are brace high arched walls of steal
	mesh, it becomes obvious that we are inside this vast
	construction.

	Amanda emerges from the mist and turns back to the catwalk.

				AMANDA
			(calling out)
		Okay! Come on, Eric!


74	EXT. LANDING - DAY							74

	Eric is next to go across. He's still tentative.

				PAUL
		How 'bout if I...

				ERIC
		No, I can do it.

	Billy and Paul look on as Eric disappears into the vapor.

				PAUL
			(muttering to himself)
		That's it Eric. Nice and easy...


75	EXT. CATWALK - DAY							75

	Eric slowly gropes his way forward. He feels a GUST OF WIND and
	a HEAVY THUD ahead on the catwalk which now sways beneath
	him.

	Regaining his balance, Eric peers forward, but the fog prevents
	him from seeing more than fifteen feet ahead. There is an EERIE
	SILENCE. Eric calls out timidly.

				ERIC
		Mom?


75A	EXT. RIVER CANYON - FAR WALL - DAY				75A

	Across the canyon, Grant moves across the later support. With
	his hand on the railing, he sends a white, hardened substance
	dropping into the mist.

	Looking up, Grant notices a large strut, covered with the same
	substance. Realizing what it could be.

				GRANT
		Oh, my God.

				AMANDA
		What is it?

				GRANT
		A bird cage.

	Then, the sound of Eric SCREAMING.


75B	EXT. CATWALK - DAY							75B

	Eric watches as A LOOMING SHAPE emerges from the fog -- a
	nightmarish vision stalking purposefully forward.

	A FULL GROWN PTERANODON,

	standing over seven feet high, walks upright on clawed feet, his
	thirty foot wings folded bat-like at his side.

	The creature sees Eric and fixes him with a demonic glare.

	Eric CRIES OUT and dashes back down the teetering catwalk.

	The Pteranodon ruses to its feet, spreads its thirty-foot wings
	and flies directly at him.

	AT THE OTHER END OF THE CATWALK

	Hearing Eric's SCREAMS, Paul charges onto the catwalk,
	searching in the fog.

				PAUL
		Eric!

				BILLY
		It won't hold!

	Suddenly,

	ERIC

	emerges from the fog, racing toward his father. And then
	
	THE PTERANODON

	swoops out of the fog, opens its giant rear claws, and snatches
	the terrified boy from the catwalk.

	Paul Kirby watches in stunned, abject horror as the Pteranodon
	carries Eric directly overhead --

				PAUL
		ERIC!

	The flying reptile struggles with the boy's weight. Paul
	watches helplessly as Eric is carried high across the canyon.

	Paul runs back alone the catwalk in a desperate attempt to keep
	Eric in sight.

	Billy stays behind, moving back up the platform to try to
	keep the dinosaur in view. With a new idea, he races back up the
	stairs to the observation room. He has a way to save Eric.

	When he reaches the canyon wall, Paul turns a corner and runs
	along another enclosed catwalk leading deeper into the canyon.

	Grant and Amanda now come pounding down the catwalk trying to
	catch up with Paul.

				AMANDA
			(shouting)
		Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?

				PAUL
			(shouting back)
		I'm trying! That thing took him down this
		way!

				GRANT
		Split up!

	THE PTERANODON

	carries Eric deeper into the canyon. The creature's wings beat
	steadily overhead, and the WIND is fierce. Eric looks down and
	sees the river far below.

	The Pteranodon swoops over an isolated outcropping of rocks at
	the end of the canyon and drops Eric into --


75C	EXT. PTERANODON NEST - DAY					75C

	A large bowl of mud and branches the size of a satellite dish.
	Eric lands right on top of a pile of dinosaur bones picked
	clean. Mixed among is one human skull.

	Before Eric has time to cry out, he looks up to find

	SIX PTERANODON HATCHLINGS

	closing in on him with sharp-edged beaks.

	He picks up the human skull and whips it to the hatchlings.
	They easily duck it and keep coming.

76	EXT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS DAY			76

	Grant looks up to see Billy leaning out over the edge of the
	observation platform. He suddenly realizes what Billy is about
	to do.

				GRANT
		BILLY! WAIT!

	Billy SHOUTS BACK, an excited-terrified grin on his face.

				BILLY
		I CAN GET HIM!

				GRANT
		NO!

				BILLY
		I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!

	Billy jumps off the railing and

	DROPS TOWARDS THE CANYON BELOW.

	Grant, Paul and Amanda watch as Billy FALLS past them like a
	stone, plummeting towards certain death. But then --

	THE PARASAIL CHUTE

	blossoms above him.

	Not only does it slows Billy's descent, but he even manages to
	catch an updraft and begin to rise.

	He struggles to control the parasail, swooping dangerously
	close to the canyon wall, barely avoiding it.

	Up ahead he catches sight of Eric and steers towards him.


77-80	OMIT									77-80


81	EXT. PTERANODON NEST - DAY					81

	Eric struggles to keep away from the hatchlings. But there's
	no way out of this nest.

	Billy SWOOPS overhead, but he's too high to reach Eric.

				BILLY
		ERIC! HOLD ON!

	He circles around to make another attempt.


82	EXT. ENCLOSED CATWAY - DAY					82

	Paul rounds the corner and finally catches sight of Eric in the
	nest, some fifty feet below, fighting off the hatchlings.

				PAUL
		Hang on, Eric!

	Paul sees an outcropping he could jump onto from here. It's a
	big leap, though, he might not make it. He steels himself up for
	the jump, then chickens out.

	Grant and Amanda come up behind him. Suddenly,

	A SECOND PTERANODON

	CRASH LANDS on the catwalk enclosure about them -- right next
	to a gaping hole in the mesh. The catwalk GROANS with the
	extra weight.

	The pteranodon JAMS its head through the hole, SNAPPING at
	them.


83	EXT. CANYON - IN THE AIR - DAY					83

	Billy circles, making his approach.

	In the nest, Eric kicks at the hatchlings, but they're
	undeterred. Billy and Eric will only have one chance.

	As Billy swoops past, Eric jumps and grabs onto his boot. He is
	yanked up and out of the nest. But than, MOTHER PTERANODON
	shoots past, tearing out a piece of the parasail in its beak.


84-85	OMIT									84-85


86	EXT. OVER THE RIVER - DAY					86

	The pteranodon who landed on the top of the catwalk continues to
	SNAP through the hole in the enclosure.

	Finally the reptile's massive weight proves to much, and the
	entire section of the catwalk BREAKS FREE of the canyon wall
	and FLIPS OVER LATERALLY.

	Amanda, Grant and Paul are able to hang on, but so is the
	pteranodon, who now climbs their way.


87	OMIT									87


88	EXT. OVER THE RIVER - DAY					88

	His parasail badly damaged, Billy tries to keep aloft. Heading
	as low as he dares, he yells to Eric --

				BILLY
		Let go!

	Terrified, Eric falls into the river safely. He surfaces,
	immediately swimming to shore.

	Trying to gain altitude, Billy bends hard to the right. But the
	rigging is too badly damaged. He flies right into the canyon
	wall, hitting hard.

	Instead of tumbling down to the river, he finds himself
	swinging from his harness - the parasail snagged on a rock
	spire above him.


89	EXT. BROKEN CATWALK - DAY					89

	Paul, Grant and Amanda struggle to stay away from the
	pteranodon as it moves towards them.

	Suddenly. the far end of this inverted section of catwalk
	detaches from the canyon wall and

	SWINGS DOWNWARD.

	The force of the action sends the three tumbling directly
	towards the pteranodon.

	Miraculously, they manage to avoid its open beak. But they
	are all sent plummeting toward the river below.


90	EXT. RIVER - DAY							90

	They hit the water hard, resurfacing moments later. The
	current is carrying them downstream.


91	EXT. CANYON WALL - DAY						91

	The two pteranodons who were pursuing Billy now land on nearby
	ledges and consider how best to dispatch their prey.

	Billy frantically tries to unhook his harness, but the tension
	is so tight from his own weight that he can't loosen the
	buckles.


92-93	OMIT							  92-93


94	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY					      94

	Paul and Amanda emerge from the water by the canyon wall and
	find their son hiding behind a rock, searching the skies for
	Billy.

	Amanda takes Eric tightly in her arms, and Paul urges them to
	keep moving. Up ahead, the mesh of the aviary meets the river.

	Wading the shore, Grant now scans the canyon, searching for
	Billy. It doesn't take long to spot him.

95	EXT. CANYON WALLL - DAY						95

	Billy continues to struggle with the harness but to no avail.

	The doomed young man is suspended high up on the canyon wall
	like a modern Prometheus, an entire FLOCK of pteranodons
	gathering around him preparing to peck away his liver. And
	everything else.

	A MAMMOTH PTERANADON has landed beside him and looks him
	straight in the eye.

	The gigantic creature lunges at him. Billy dodges away as best
	he can. The pteranodon's frustrated bite severs a crucial
	juncture on Billy's harness, and Billy is able to wriggle free.


96	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY						96

	Eric, Amanda, Paul and Grant watch in amazement as Billy is the
	last to PLUNGE DOWN into the river.

				GRANT
		He made it!

	Billy bobs to the surface and spots the group downstream. He
	waves and begins to swim towards them. Soon he nears the shore
	and gets to his feet, wading as he comes.

	Grant, Paul, Amanda and Eric hurry to meet him.

	Grant is overjoyed to see him alive. But his smile quickly
	fades as he sees

	THE ENTIRE FLOCK OF PTERANODONS

	diving down from above in angry pursuit of their lost prey.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Billy, look out!

	Billy glances behind him. He races forward, motioning fro his
	companions to turn around.

				BILLY
		Get back! Get back!

	Just then Billy is knocked down by the lead pteranodon. It
	strikes from behind with a brutal, calculated beak to the head.
	Billy stumbles and falls to the ground.

	Grant rushes forward with Paul right after him. Amanda takes
	Eric to safety down river.

	Billy SCREAMS as the ENTIRE FLOCK of pteranodons now swarms
	around him, picking him apart with their beaks and claws.

				GRANT
		Billy!

				PAUL
		It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.

	Grant can't take his eyes off Billy, whose BLOOD stains the
	water rushing by.

	And now several pteranodons are heading their way. Difficult
	as it is to leave Billy behind, Grant and Paul make a run for it.

	Just as the pteranodons are about to swoop in for the kill, Alan
	and Paul dive back into the river...


97	EXT. THE RIVER - CONTINUOUS DAY				97

	...and resurfaces on the far side of the mesh aviary wall, GASPING
	for air. Just behind them, the mammoth

	PTERANODON

	CRASHES into the mesh. It tears at the steel, actually ripping
	it in one place.

	At the dock up ahead, Amanda and Eric have found a rusty,
	waterlogged barge that's somehow still floating. Carrying a
	tarp-covered cage, the boat was meant for transporting dinos
	up and down the river.

	Amanda pushes them away from the dock as Alan and Paul climb
	on board.


98	EXT. ON THE BARGE - CONTINUOUS DAY				98

	The current takes the craft downstream, letting us get our
	first good look at the incredible
	
	AVIARY.

	It's a vast, domed mesh structure that spans the entire canyon.
	In all, a feat of remarkable engineering and unmistakable
	hubris.

	Catching their breath, our four survivors look at the cage they
	were caught in.


99	EXT. DOWN RIVER - DAY / LATER					99

	Yanking the starter rope one final time, Paul finally gets the
	engine to turn over, PUTTERING along. Amanda is beside him,
	bailing water.

				PAUL
		My own kid was right in front of me and I
		didn't do a damn thing.

				AMANDA
		You couldn't have made that jump.

				PAUL
		I should have tried. It should have been me
		on that beach back there, not Billy.

				AMANDA
		How would you have helped Eric?
			(he can't answer)
		He needs you, Paul. He needs us.

				PAUL
		He could have died.

				AMANDA
		But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm
		glad about that.


99A	UP ON THE BOW							99A

	Grant is beside Eric, keeping watch, but also feeling the weight
	of Billy's death.

				ERIC
		Do you have any kids?

				GRANT
		No. Although I've studied them in the wild.

	Eric looks over, not sure what that means.

				GRANT (CON'T)
		I have a theory that there's two kinds of
		boys. Those who want to be astronomers and
		those who want to be astronauts.

				ERIC
		I want to be an astronaut.

				GRANT
		See, I was the opposite. I never understood
		why anyone would want to go into space. It's
		so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and
		you're dead. The astronomer -- or the
		paleontologist -- get to study these amazing
		things from a place of complete safety. And
		truthfully, everything you really need to
		learn, you can learn it from the ground.

				ERIC
		But then you never get to go in space.

				GRANT
		Exactly. The difference between imagining
		how things might be and seeing how they
		really are. To be able to touch them. That's
		what Billy wanted to do.

	The barge starts to round a bend. On the bow, Grant and Eric
	are the fist to see something remarkable. Eric GASPS,
	unprepared. We don't know yet what they see.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		I can blame the people who made this island.
		But I can't blame the people who want to see
		it. To study it.

	At the rear of the barge, Paul just now sees what's ahead. Awe-
	struck, he slows the motor and motions for Amanda to take a
	look. And so do we.

	UP AHEAD

	The setting sun illuminates an incredible valley filled with
	dinosaurs. We see armored ANKYLOSAURS with clubbed
	tails. Duck-billed CORYTHOSAURS. We float under the gigantic,
	arching necks of eighty-foot BRACHIOSAURS.

	With the mist from the river and the play of light, we're
	witnessing a kind of primal Eden.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		How's a boy suppose to resist this?


100	EXT. FURTHER DOWNSTREAM - NIGHT				100

	A FULL MOON passes behind clouds. THUNDER quietly rumbles, and
	LIGHTNING flickers in the distance.

	Paul is still at the wheel. The river is narrower here, and
	cautions must be taken to avoid the banks.

	As the barge begins to round another bend. a FAMILIAR HIGH-
	PITCHED SOUND pierces the darkness. Muffled but unmistakable,
	it is the RINGING SAT-PHONE.

	All exchange looks of sheer PANIC, expecting Spinosaurus to
	leap out at any moment. Grant scans the river banks.

				GRANT
		Keep quiet.

	Paul cuts the motor, and time seems to stop as the four stand
	posed for action.

	The barge finishes rounding the curve, and the ringing grows
	LOUDER. The suspense is excruciating until finally...

	Their eyes widen at some horrifying sight, more horrifying
	than anything they've yet seen.

	SEVEN MOUNDS OF DINOSAUR DUNG sit on the patch off treeless flat
	ground just beyond the river bank.

	As our friends consider the sight, an idea comes to them all of them
	almost simultaneously.

	With Eric still in the boat, Amanda, Paul, and Alan jump into
	the river and rush to the bank.


101	EXT. RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT				101

	The three companions sprint towards the source of the RINGING.

				GRANT
		Find it before it stops ringing!

	And bracing themselves and hocking their breath, they PLUNGE
	their arms into their respective dung-heaps. After a few
	moments of this disgusting search...

				PAUL
		I've got something. I think I've got
		something!

	All turn to Paul. Clearing away the clinging defecation, he
	holds up to a beeper. And still the phone RINGS.

	Returning to their bleak task, they shovel the excrement with
	their arms. Finally:

				AMANDA
		I've got it! I've got it!

	Grant snatches the RINGING SAT-PHONE from Amanda's hands,
	presses a button, and puts it to his ear.

				RECORDED VOICE (ON PHONE)
		You too can own a time share in beautiful
		Guadalajara. Enjoy a meal in one of our four
		star restaurants, explore our coral reefs, or
		just walk on the beach...

	The Kirbys hear the recorded voice and let out a collective,
	heavy sigh. Grant shuts off the phone.

	In all the excitement, none of them notice a fierce horned
	CARNOTAUR right behind them. The giant creature ROARS, ready
	to eat them.

	But as it gets in close, it smells them. Even a dinosaur won't
	eat something that is covered in shit. After a beat, the
	Carnotaur turns and walks away, back into the jungle.

				PAUL
		Can't help but be a little offended.


102	EXT. BACK ON THE BARGE - NIGHT					102

	CLOSE ON the cleaned satellite phone's display. The battery
	level indicator is FLASHING.

				PAUL
		Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy.
		They won't do a God Damn thing.

				GRANT
		Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican
		phone book here, so it will have to be
		somebody we know in the states. Someone we
		can absolutely count on to send help.

				PAUL
			(to Amanda)
		Stan.

				AMANDA
		I wouldn't trust Stan with a snowball in a
		blizzard.

	Paul glares at her. Now Eric notices something odd in the
	river.

				ERIC
		What's that?

	The others look down in the murky water. Just below the
	surface,

	A SHIMMERING WAVE OF SILVER

	passes beneath the boat.

	Then a SINGLE FISH jumps from the water. And another. And
	another.

				GRANT
		Bonitas.

				ERIC
		Something must've scared them.

	Another roll of THUNDER, this time much closer.

				GRANT
		Get the motor going.

	Paul moves the motor and pulls the start cord. The engine
	sputters but won't come to life.

	And now the phone BEEPS. The battery is getting even weaker.

	Grant makes a quick decision and DIALS.

				AMANDA
		Who are you calling?

	But Grant ignores the question. RING. RING.

				GRANT
		Pick up! Pick up!


103	INT. ELLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT				103

	Wearing his jammies, three-year old Charlie awkwardly picks up
	the phone with both hands. He has the mouthpiece next to his
	lips, but the earpiece is hanging out in space.

				CHARLIE
		Hewwo?

	INTERCUT

	Recognizing who it must be...

				GRANT
		Charlie? Charlie. Get your mother. Right
		away!

	A long silence. Charlie bites his lip, looks around.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Charlie? Are you there?

				CHARLIE
		Hewwo?

	The sat-phone BEEPS again, this time much LOUDER.

	Amanda and Eric watch Grant, realizing their fate may hang on
	this single call. Paul struggles without success to start the
	motor.

	Then, unseen by the group, a

	GIGANTIC FIN

	rises from the water just fifty yards from the barge. It's
	headed right to them and closing fast.

				GRANT
			(desperate)
		Charlie! It's the dinosaur man! Go get
		mommy, okay?

				CHARLIE
		Okay.

	Not sure what to do with the phone, Charlie makes a logical
	choice and hangs it back up.

	He walks away to his mom.


104	EXT. BARGE - NIGHT [END INTERCUTTING]			104

	Grant realizes he's been cut off. He's about to redial when

	WHAM!

	The barge is RAMMED, sending everyone tumbling. Grant manages
	to stay on top of the wheelhouse, but he loses grip on the
	phone, which falls on deck.

	SPINOSAURUS

	rises from the water, towering over the barge. As lightning
	FLASHES and thunder CRACKS, the dinosaur lets out an ear-
	splitting ROAR.

	It lunges at Grant with gaping jaws. Grant leaps out of
	the way just in time as the dinosaur

	RIPS OFF

	the entire wheelhouse.

							            CUT TO:


105	INT. ELLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT				105

	Charlie leads Ellie into the room. Hands her the phone. Of
	course, it's just a DIAL TONE.

				ELLIE
		Was somebody on the phone?

				CHARLIE
		Dinosaur man.

	Ellie looks at him with confusion, then quickly checks the
	Caller ID box besides the phone. It's international, and not a
	number she recognizes.

							          BACK TO:


106	EXT. THE BARGE - NIGHT						106

	Grant stays one step ahead of the Spinosaurus as the beast rips
	apart the quickly-sinking boat.

	It spits out the wheelhouse and bites down on the stern of the
	boat, ripping off a chunk.

	Grant is heading up to the other three when he hears the sat-
	phone RING.  He spots it, just about to fall into the water.
	Dives for it, answering...

				GRANT
		ELLIE!


106A	INT. ELLIES LIVING ROOM - NIGHT					106A

				ELLIE
		Alan?

	She can hear the Spinosaurus ROAR.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		Alan? Alan!

	But he's cut off by a SECOND ROAR, the sound of someone
	SCREAMING.

	And then the line goes dead.

	Ellie pales. Charlie looks at her with a smile.

				CHARLIE
			(imitating)
		Raaaar!


106B	EXT. BACK ON THE BARGE - NIGHT					106B

	Dropping the dead phone, Grant scrambles towards the front of
	the boat and joins Paul, Amanda and Eric, who have taken refuge
	in the dinosaur cage.

	The fearsome beast now lifts the stern of the boat clear out of
	the water.

	The cage SCRAPES across the deck and SLAMS into the gunwale,
	toppling off the barge and

	INTO THE RIVER.

	Grant and the Kirbys are still inside.


107	EXT. THE RIVER - UNDERWATER - NIGHT				107

	The cage sinks. The closest to the door, Paul manages to get out.

	The other three aren't as lucky. The cage rotates as it descends
	and lands on the river bottom with the door side down, trapping
	them inside.

	In the cold murky depths, they pull frantically on the bars.
	Debris and equipment float around them.

	Paul surfaces out of the breath and disoriented. Spinosaurus
	pushes past the boat. If anyone is going to save his family, it
	has to be him.

	And so he dives.

	Pushing with all his might, he manages to tip the heavy
	structure, just enough so Amanda, Eric and Grant can get out.
	Paul himself isn't so lucky.

	Spinosaurus grabs the cage and Paul, throwing both straight up
	out of the water. Paul flies twenty feet away, further from the
	shore.

				AMANDA
		PAUL!

				ERIC
		DAD!

	Spinosaurus is going after the heroic Mr. Kirby, who dives,
	swimming underwater. He's trying to lead it away from his
	family.

				GRANT
			(looking around)
		Up! Up!

	He points to a heavy crane assembly, designed for lifting cages
	off the large boats. Now well accustomed to fleeing on
	command, Amanda sends Eric up first, climbing the scaffolding
	like a jungle gym.

	All the while, they're trying to spot Paul.

	Grant is the last to climb, reaching the first section as
	Spinosaurus returns from the water, SLAMMING into the base of
	the crane. The whole assembly SHUDDERS, threatening to rip into
	the water.

				ERIC
		Where's Dad?

				AMANDA
		Just hold on.

	Try as it might, the beast can't climb the crane. So instead it
	RAMS it, SHAKES it, trying to knock them off. Eric slips, but
	Amanda catches him.

	About to shed his bag to climb higher, Grant finds one last
	hope. It's the resonation chamber model. A beat before he
	decides: It may not be the best choice, but it's the only choice.

	He blows through it, the same EERIE PITCH we heard before. On
	the third try, he's able to approximate the "egg" cry he heard
	the raptors give. He keeps it up, repeating over and over.

	Spinosaurus stops for a beat, confused How this sound could be
	coming from a non-raptor. But then keeps SMASHING.

	We can hear the mounting bolts STRAIN. Soon the whole crane
	will tip.

	But not before a MATCHING CRY is heard in the jungle. Grant
	stops, not certain he heard it. But there it is AGAIN.

	He keeps blowing.

	The crane is close to tipping when a single RAPTOR appears
	from the darkness, CHIRP-BARKING at the Spinosaur, who simply
	bats away.

	But then MORE RAPTORS come. And even MORE. Soon there are
	dozens gathering, circling.

	Grant stops signaling. All three survivors watch with
	horrified fascination, knowing their fate is perilous no matter
	which side wins.

	Looking at his adversaries, Spinosaurus ROARS. And suddenly
	the raptors attack.

	Spinosaurus easily handles the first few, but like ants they
	just keep coming. They climb up his back, slicing, into him with
	their razor-sharp claws.

				GRANT
		Jump! Swim for the far shore!

	All three drop from the crane arm into the water.

	Meanwhile, the fight continues. Spinosaurus rallies, shaking
	off many of the raptors, but they just keep coming. Their
	hooked claws dig in, scraping the meat to the bone.

	Spinosaurus puts up a brave fight to the end, but finally
	collapses, dead. The raptors continue to shred it to ribbons.
	Then one of the raptors looks over to see the survivors
	swimming away.

	But a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It goes back to
	its meal.


107A	EXT. FAR SHORE - NIGHT						107A

	Grant is trying to move them along. still headed downstream.
	But Eric won't budge another foot.

				ERIC
		We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.

				AMANDA
		I know. I know. I want to look for him too.

				ERIC
		then we should...

	She kneels down, facing him. She's just as upset as he is, but
	motherhood carries the burden of remaining calm.

				AMANDA
		Let me tell you a few things about you Dad,
		okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave,
		and he loves you ever very much.

				ERIC
		He loves you too.

				AMANDA
		Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know
		that right now more than anything, your Dad
		would want to know that we're safe. Okay?

	Eric nods.

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		We're going to get out of this, and
		everything's going to be all right, I promise.

				A VOICE
		Listen to your mother.

	Out of the darkness steps Paul Kirby. Amanda is knocked over
	with surprise. Eric runs to him, nearly tackling him.

				PAUL
		Good thing I've been swimming, huh?

	Amanda hugs him and Eric so tightly they can't breath.


									CROSSFADE TO:


108-109	OMIT								108-109


110	EXT. BEACH - DAY							110

	The foursome sit back on the wide beach, one facing
	each direction, keeping watch. A light rain is falling, but they
	don't seem to notice.

	Trying to keep his boy's spirit up...

				PAUL
		You remember when we went fishing last
		summer? And I was trying to put the boat in
		and the trailer sank? And then the tow truck
		came and tried to pull it out, but it got
		dragged in? And the truck driver threatened
		to knock your Dad's lights out? So I said I
		was the governor and he believed me?

	Eric really smiles, remembering the day.

				ERIC
		Yeah.

	Amanda is smiling too. She had completely forgotten the
	incident.

				PAUL
		That was a fun day.

	To Paul, after some consideration....

				AMANDA
		We should try fishing again.

				PAUL
		You mean it?

				AMANDA
		I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows?
		Things might turn out differently.

	Her hand takes his, gently brushing off the wet sand, fingertips
	touching. It's a small thing, but it's a start.

	Sensing his cue to leave, Grant gets up and starts walking down
	the beach. Eric hurries to follow him. He speaks
	conspiratorially, not wanting to alarm his parents.

				ERIC
		The lady you called, how do you know she can
		help us?

				GRANT
		She's the one person I could always count on.
		And she's saved me more times than she
		realizes. I owe her everything.

	A long beat as they walk.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		It's strikes me now I never told her that.

				ERIC
		You should.

				GRANT
		You're right.

	As they keep walking, Grant notices something rammed against
	the rocks ahead. It's a speedboat, its hull ripped open from the
	impact.

	And it's not just any boat either -- it's the same Dino-Soar
	boat that was pulling the parasail. Eric hasnt seen it yet, so
	Grant stops him.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Eric, do you know what happened to the boat?
		that brought you here? Why did it crash?

				ERIC
		No. I couldn't see.

				GRANT
		Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a
		minute, would you?
			(pre-empting objections)
		They look worried.

	Eric nods and heads back to Paul and Amanda. Grant forges on,
	approaching the speedboat wreckage. He doesn't know what he'll
	find, but he needs to look.

	Almost reaching his parents, Eric stops. Looks out over the
	ocean, where he sees

	TWO LIGHTS.

	He doesn't say anything for a moment, trying to make sure
	they're real. They are. And they're coming closer.

				ERIC
			(excited)
		Mom! Dad!

	They look up to see the distant lights, just now making out
	full forms...

				PAUL
		Helicopters. Helicopters!

	He SHOUTS with joy. Paul, Amanda and Eric wave their arms,
	making as much motion as possible. The helicopters -- big
	military choppers -- change direction, heading straight for
	them.

	Paul and Amanda embrace, then kiss, the moment getting the best
	of them

	AT THE SPEEDBOAT

	Grant looks in, prepared to see anything in the wreckage. But
	the cabin is surprisingly intact, just a little blood. There are
	three gashes on the driver's seat back. Grant measures their
	spacing with his fingers.

				ERIC
			(yelling over)
		Dr. Grant! Helicopters are coming!

	Grant looks down to the wet sand around him, finding a trail of
	three-toed tracks.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		We're safe!

				GRANT
			(to himself)
		No we're not.

	THE FIRST CHOPPER.

	flies right overhead. Paul and Amanda are confused, until the
	second helicopter starts to land -- the first on is there to 
	cover them.

	Grant YELLS at the first chopper, trying to wave it away. But
	the noise of the blades is DEAFENDING.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		NO! STAY BACK! THEY'RE IN THE TREES!

	At the treeline, the upper branches are shaking. At first, it
	looks like it's just the wind off the chopper, but
	something more is happening.
	
	A PTERANODON

	flies up out of the trees, the first of twenty. It's a gorgeous
	and terrifying sight.


110A	INT. FIRST CHOPPER - DAWN					110A

	Terrified, the Costa Rican CHOPPER PILOT veers away, but the
	pteranodons are already on him. They SMASH at the windows,
	grabbing on the skids, The chopper rolls wildly.

	One over-eager pteranodon sticks his head up to high, getting
	decapitated by the blade.


110B	EXT. BEACH - DAWN							110B

	As the second chopper touches down on the beach, Eric, Amanda
	and Paul load in. Grant is running their way.


110C	EXT. BY THE TREES - DAWN						110C

	Meanwhile, the first copper is losing the battle even as it
	climbs higher. The helicopter suddenly tips, falling, SMASHING
	into the trees with a massive fireball.


110D	INT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWN					110D

	Seeing the explosion, the SECOND CHOPPER PILOT takes off. Eric,
	Amanda and Paul are on board, but Grant is still running up.
	The helicopter passes right over him.

				AMANDA
			(to the pilot)
		You have to go back! We can't leave him!

	Seeing a ladder release by the door, Paul throws the lever. A cord-
	and-steel-ladder unfurls, dragging across the sand.


110E	EXT. THE BEACH - DAWN					   110E

	Grant chases after us, catching a rung just as it goes over the
	water. Behind him, pteranodons are circling the wreckage of
	the first chopper and starting to go after the second.

	Buffeted by the wind, Grant climbs the ladder up towards the
	chopper. A pteranodon flies up right behind him, trying to
	bite. It catches Grant's shoulder.

	Grant spins to the far side of the ladder. The pteranodon goes
	to bite him again, but finds it head caught between the rungs.
	As it tries to free itself, it just gets more entangled.

	The entire ladder starts to lift, caught by the updraft from the
	creatures wings.


110F	INT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWN					110F

	Up with the pilot, Amanda sees the other pteranodons are headed
	back to the island, unable to keep up.

				AMANDA
		They're not following.

	In back, Paul and Eric get the ladder mechanism to begin to
	retract. It reels Grant in faster. It also reels in the
	pteranodon, which may be caught, but is still plenty dangerous.

	As Grant reaches the cabin, they shut off the ladder engine.
	The pteranodon is still working its way free, pulling itself closer
	and closer.

				GRANT
			(shouting over the noise)
		We have to cut it! Find something sharp!

	Everyone checking the cabin for a knife, anything sharp.

	Finally, Eric hands Grant the raptor claw.

	Grant uses it to rip the line. The fibers break and fray, but
	the pteranodon keeps coming closer.

	Paul throws a wrench at the pteranodon, WHACKING it straight
	in the head. It felt good, and damn if it didn't slow it down a
	little.

	Grant has cut through the cord. He started on the second when
	the pteranodon SNAPS at him, going for his hand. There's
	nowhere for Grant to cut without the pteranodon getting him.

	And idea, Grant very deliberately places in his hand on the line,
	pulling away at the last moment. The pteranodon itself bites
	through the line.


110G	EXT. OCEAN - DAWN							110G

	The pteranodon falls away from the helicopter, catching wind
	just before it hits the water.

	It circles and flies back to Isla Sorna.

	As horrifying as the creature was a moment ago, it's suddenly
	beautiful again. Each motion of its giant wings is a small
	symphony.


110H	INT. COPPER / FLYING - DAWN					110H

	Sitting between his parents, Eric looks back at the island in
	the distance.

				ERIC
		What do you think is going to happen with the
		dinosaurs?

				GRANT
		The population will Stabilize eventually.
		They'll adapt to fit different roles.

	ON PAUL AND AMANDA

				PAUL
		Either that, or the government will firebomb
		it back to the Stone Age.

				AMANDA
		I would completely support that.

	ON ERIC AND GRANT

	looking back at the island.

				ERIC
		I hope they don't. I want to come back
		someday.

	And Dr. Grant realizes...

				GRANT
		So do I.

EXT. OCEAN  DAWN
The helicopter flies away across the ocean, leaving the island behind.

THE LOST WORLD JURASSIC PARK

 
			THE LOST WORLD
			 JURASSIC PARK

			Screenplay by
			  David Koepp
	
		     based on the novel by
			Michael Crichton

	EXT. TROPICAL LAGOON - DAY

	A 135-foot-luxury yacht is anchored just offshore in a 
	tropical lagoon.  The beach is a stunning crescent of white
	sand at the jungle fringe, utterly deserted.

				ISLA SORNA
		87 miles southeast of Nublar

	Two SHIP HANDS, dressed in white uniforms, have set up a
	picnic table with three chairs on the sand and are carefully
	laying out luncheon service -- fine china, silver, crystal
	decanters with red and white wine.

	PAUL BOWMAN, fortyish, sits in a chair off to the side,
	reading.  MRS. BOWMAN, painfully thin, with the perpetually
	surprised look of a woman who's had her eyes done more than
	once, supervises the settings of the table.

	She looks up and sees a little girl, CATHY, seven or eight
	years old, wandering off down the beach.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		Cathy!  Don't wander off!

	Cathy keeps wandering.

				MRS. BOWMAN (cont'd)
		Cathy, come back!  You can look for
		shells right here!

	Cathy gestures, pretending she can't hear.

				BOWMAN
			(eyes still in his book)
		Leave her alone.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		What about snakes?

				BOWMAN
		There's no snakes on a beach.  Let
		her have fun, for once.

	FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH,

	Cathy keeps wandering away, MUTTERING to herself as her
	parents' quarreling voices fade in the distance.

				CATHY
		Please be quiet, please be quiet
		please be quiet...

	Rounding a curve in the beach, her parents disappear from view
	behind her.  A RUSTLING sound draws her attention, and she
	turns, toward where the thick jungle foliage gives way to the
	sand.

	A large bush, maybe twelve feet tall, is moving, its branches
	swaying and shaking.  Curious, Cathy walks up to the bush,
	which abruptly stops moving.

	A small, lizard-like animal, dark green with brown stripes
	along its back, steps out from the bush.  Only about a foot
	tall, it stands on its hind legs, balancing on its thick tail.
	It walks upright, bobbing its head like a chicken.

				CATHY
		Well, hello there!

	The animal (a COMPSOGNATHUS) just stares at her.  Cathy squats
	down on her haunches.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		What are you?  A little bird or
		something?

	She opens her hand.  She's got a handful of goldfish crackers.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Are you hungry?  You want a goldfish?

	The compy bobs forward a few steps, cautiously.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Come on.  I won't hurt you.

	The compy draws closer.  Cathy holds the cracker in the palm
	of her hand.  The compy gets closer still --

	-- and hops numbly up onto Cathy's palm.  Her arm dips a bit
	under the weight, but it's not that heavy, and she holds it up
	easily.  It bobs its head, scarfs up the goldfish, and eats
	it.

	Enchanted, Cathy breaks into an enormous grin and returns her
	hand, calling back over her shoulder.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Mom!  Dad!  You gotta come see this!
		I found something!

	She turns back.

	Thirty more compys have come out onto the sand.  They're
	standing there, bobbing anxiously, staring at her from a few
	feet away.  Cathy's smile fades.

	She turns her head slowly to the right.  TWENTY MORE COMPYS
	have come in from that side, forming a semi-circle, bobbing
	and CHIPPING as they surround her.

				CATHY (cont'd)
			(terrified)
		What do you guys want?

	BACK ON THE BEACH,

	the table is set.  Mrs. Bowman calls out.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		Cathy, sweetheart!  Lunch is ready!

	From around the curve of the beach, a flock of birds bolts
	from the jungle trees as Cathy's shrill SCREAMS suddenly
	pierce the air.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		PAUL!

	She takes off, running down the beach, Mr. Bowman leaps out of
	his chair and follows, and all available deck hands race off
	to help, kicking up geysers of sand behind them.

	DOWN THE BEACH,

	Mrs. Bowman stops dead in her tracks when she rounds the bend
	in the beach.  We don't see what she sees, but we hear the
	frenzied SQUEAKING of the strange compys.  Mr. Bowman and the
	Hands race past her to help Cathy as Mrs. Bowman lets loose a
	horrified, slack-jawed SCREAM, her mouth a perfect oval.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

	Mrs. Bowman's screaming face dissolves slowly over the
	YAWNING face of a bored CORPORATE EXECUTIVE, TWENTY OTHER
	EXECUTIVES sit around a conference table in the boardroom of a
	monied corporation.  All are in expensive suits, most are over
	sixty.  There are rows of BACKBENCHERS too, whispering in their
	lawyers who sit behind their clients, whispering in their
	ears.  Empty coffee cups and fast food containers on the table
	hint that everyone's been here a long time.

	A familiar VOICE resounds through the boardroom as we move
	down the long table, pat the grim faces of the board members.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		The hurricane seemed like a disaster
		at the time, but now I think it was a
		blessing, nature's way of freeing
		those animals from their human
		confines.  Of giving them another
		chance to survive, but this time as
		they were meant to, without man's
		interference.

	The source of the voice is JOHN HAMMOND, the founder of InGen
	and creator of Jurassic Park.  But he's not in the room.  His
	image is on a closed circuit TV screen, which has been wheeled
	up to the end of the table.

	And he doesn't look good.  He's terribly infirmed, propped up
	in bed, his face pale and drawn, medical equipment BEEPING
	around him.

				HAMMOND (cont'd)
		There are some corporate issues that
		are not about the bottom line.  We
		have so much still to learn about
		those creatures.  A whole world of
		intricate, interlocking behaviors,
		vanished everywhere -- except for
		Site B. Please.  Let's not do what
		is good for more men at the expense
		at what is best for all mankind.

	The CHAIRMAN, seventyish, nods awkwardly to the television.

				CHAIRMAN
		Thank you, John.  Mr. Ludlow?

	He turns to PETER LUDLOW, late thirties, a man with the
	anxious look of someone who insists the buck stop on his desk.
	Ludlow flips open a file, pulls out a stack of black and white
	eight by tens, and tosses them on the table.

				LUDLOW
			(an accent similar to
			 Hammond's)
		These pictures were taken in a
		hospital in Costa Rica forty-eight
		hours ago, after an American family
		on a yacht cruise stumbled onto Site
		B.  The little girl will be fine, but
		her parents are wealthy, angry, and
		very fond of lawsuits.  But that's
		hardly new to us, is it?
			(takes a paper from the
			 file)
		Wrongful death settlements, partial
		list:  family of Donald Gennaro, 36.5
		million dollars; family of Robert
		Muldoon, 12.6 million.  Damaged or
		destroyed equipment, 17.3 million.
		Demolition, de-construction, and
		disposal of Isla Nublar facilities,
		organic and inorganic, one hundred
		and twenty-six million dollars.  The
		list goes on, gentlemen -- research
		funding, media payoffs.  Silence is
		expensive.

	He's warming up.  Not a bad performer.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		This corporation has been bleeding
		from the throat for four years.  You,
		our board of directors, have set
		patiently and listened to ecology
		lectures while Mr. Hammond signed
		your checks and spent your money.
		You have watched your stock drop from
		seventy-eight and a quarter to
		nineteen flat with no good and in
		sight.  And all along, we have held a
		significant product asset that we
		could have safely harvested and
		displayed for profit.  Enormous
		profit.

	He reaches out to a model on the table and gives it a shove,
	sending it sliding down the length of the table in front of
	them.  It's a mini-mall version of a zoo.  Cages hold tiny
	replicas of various kinds of dinosaurs while Boy Scout troops
	and Tourists look on in wonder.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Enough money to wipe out four years
		of lawsuits and damage control and
		unpleasant infighting, enough to not
		only send our stock back to where it
		was but to double it.  And the one
		thing, the only thing standing
		between us and this asset is a
		born-again naturalist who happens to
		be our own CEO.  Well, I don't work
		for Mother Nature.  I work for you.

	Two of his Backbenchers distribute documents from a stack.
	Ludlow takes one and reads from it.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		"Whereas the Chief Executive
		Officer has engaged in wasteful and
		negligent business practices to
		further his own personal
		environmental beliefs --
		Whereas these practices have 
		affected the financial performance
		of the company by incurring
		significant losses --
		Whereas the shareholders have been
		materially harmed by these losses --
		Thereby, be it resolved that John
		Parker Hammond should be resolved from
		the office of Chief Executive
		Officer, affective immediately."  Mr.
		Chairman, I move the resolution be
		put to an immediate vote.  Do I have
		a second?

				BOARD MEMBER
		I second the motion,  Mr. Chairman,
		Please poll the members by a show of
		hands.

	The CHAIRMAN signs heavily, feeling like a traitor.  He can't
	bear to look at Hammond on the TV monitor.

				CHAIRMAN
		All those in favor of InGen Corporate
		Resolution 213C, please signify your
		approval by raising your right hand.

	It starts slowly, guiltily, but every hand in the room goes
	up.  Ludlow sits back, victorious.  Hammond, furious, raises
	his right hand, which holds a remote control, and points it at
	the TV screen.  It goes blank.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. WELDER'S YARD - NIGHT

	Sparks fly out the windows and doors of a shed in the middle
	of a welder's yard.  Scrap iron and steel lies everywhere.
	Somewhere inside the shed, a phone RINGS.

	The WHOOSH of the arc welder shuts off.  DIETER STARK, a big
	barrel-chested man of forty or so, his face streaked with soot
	and grime, steps outside with a cordless phone, a cigarette
	dangling from his lips.

				DIETER
		Yeah.

	He takes a deep drag while someone talks on the other end.  He
	smiles and blows out a cloud of smoke.

							CUT TO:
	INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY - NIGHT

	Smoke turns into steam as a subway THUNDER into a station
	underneath Manhattan.  The door WHOOSH open, spit out some
	COMMUTERS and suck up a few more.

	A tall man hurries down the platform, limping heavily, moving
	as fast as he can.  The subway doors begin to close, but just
	before they meet --

	-- the man jams a cane in between, stopping them.  The man
	is IAN MALCOLM, fortyish, dressed in black from head to toe.
	There's a hard wisdom in Malcolm's eyes that may not have been
	there's a few years ago -- he know what you think, and he
	doesn't care.

	INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

	MALCOLM finds a seat on the crowded subway car and sits down.
	He looks awful.  Tired.  Weathered.  He notices a CURIOUS MAN
	across from his is staring at his.  Malcolm looks away.  The
	Curious Man still stares.  Nervy, the Curious Man gets up and
	approaches.

				MALCOLM
			(under his breath)
		Shit.

	The Curious Man sits down next to Malcolm, grinning.

				MAN
		You're him, aren't you?

				MALCOLM
		Excuse me?

				MAN
		The guy.  The scientist.  I saw you
		on TV.
			(conspiratorially)
		I believed you.

	No response from Malcolm.  The guy leans in even closer.

				MAN (cont'd)
		Roooooarr.

				MALCOLM
			(a withering look)
		I was misquoted.  I was merely
		speculating on the evolutionary
		scenario of a Lost World.  I never
		said I was in any such place.

	He gets up and moves to another seat on the car, away from the
	Curious Man.  As he sits down, he notices two other COMMUTERS
	across from him are staring at him.

	He looks at them.  They looks away.

	He pulls the collar of his coat up tight around him.  Nowhere
	to hide.

	INT. JOHN HAMMOND'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A UNIFORMED BUTLER has a question:

				BUTLER
		Whom shall I tell Mr. Hammond is
		calling?

	MALCOLM stands in the foyer of an expensively decorated Park
	Avenue apartment.

				MALCOLM
		Ian Malcolm

	A door opens and a little dog comes YAPPING out of the back.
	It bounds straight at Malcolm, GROWLING, jaws SNAPPING.  It
	lunges --

	-- and Malcolm BATS it away with one swift swing of his cane.
	The dog rolls across the floor and slinks away, WHINING.  The
	Butler looks at Malcolm disapprovingly.
	
				BUTLER
		Not an animal lover?

				MALCOLM
		Not really.

	INT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	MALCOLM enters a darkened bedroom.  JOHN HAMMOND lies in the
	bed we saw earlier, on the other side of the room;

	Medical equipment has been disguised as well as possible among
	the furniture and flowers, but the sheer abundance of it tells
	us that whatever has stricken him is going to win this battle.

				HAMMOND
		Ian!  Don't linger in the doorway
		like an ingenue, come in, come in!

	Malcolm steps further into the room.

				HAMMOND (cont'd)
		It's good to see you.  It really is.
		How's the leg?

				MALCOLM
		Resentful.

				HAMMOND
		When you have a lot of time to think,
		it's funny who you remember.  It's
		the people who challenged you.  It is
		the quality of our opponents that
		gives our accomplishments meaning.  I
		never told you how sorry I was about
		what happened after we returned.
	
	Noticing Hammond's deteriorated condition, Malcolm finds it
	hard to sustain anger.
	
				MALCOLM
		I didn't know you -- weren't well.
		
				HAMMOND
		It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are
		finally killing me.
		
				MALCOLM
		They do have motives.  Why did you
		want to see me?  Your message said it
		was urgent.
		
				HAMMOND
		You were right -- and I was wrong.
		There!  Did you ever think you'd hear
		me say that?  Spectacularly wrong.
		Instead of observing those animals, I
		tried to control them.  I squandered
		an opportunity and we still know next
		to nothing about their lives.  Not
		their lives as man would have them,
		behind electric fences, but in the
		wild.  Behavior in their natural
		habitat, the impossible dream of any
		paleontologist.  I could have had it,
		but I let it slip away.
			(pause)
		Thank God for Site B.
		
	Malcolm just looks at him for a long moment.
	
				MALCOLM
		What?
		
				HAMMOND
			(a spark in his eye)
		Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle
		compact to you?
		
				MALCOLM
		What are you talking about?
	
				HAMMOND
		The hatchery, in particular?  You
		know my initial yields had to be low,
		far less than one percent, that's a
		thousand embryos for every single
		live birth.  Genetic engineering on
		that scale implies a giant operation,
		not the spotless little laboratory I
		showed you.

				MALCOLM
		I don't believe you.

				HAMMOND
		Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian,
		something for the tourists, Site B
		was the factory floor.  We built it
		first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some
		miles from Nublar.

				MALCOLM
		No, no, no, no, no, no . . .

				HAMMOND
		After the accident at the park, a
		hurricane wiped out our facility on
		Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave
		the animals to fend for themselves.
		And they did.  For four years I've
		fought to keep them safe from human
		meddling, now I want you to go there
		and document them.

				MALCOLM
		Are you out of your mind?  I still
		have nightmares, my reputation's a
		joke, my leg is shot -- you think I
		need more of that?

				HAMMOND
		It would be the most extraordinary
		living fossil record the world has
		ever seen.

				MALCOLM
		So what?

	Hammonnd picks up a thick file folder from the night table near
	to him and open it on his lap.  Inside, there are memos,
	charts, maps and photographs.

				HAMMOND
		I've been putting this together for
		over a year.
			(MORE)
		I have personal suggestions for your
		entire team, phone numbers, contact
		people.  They won't believe you about
		what they're going to see, so don't
		bother trying to convince them.  Just
		use my checkbook to get them there.
		I'll fund your expedition through my
		personal accounts, as such money and
		equipment as you need, but only if
		you leave immediately.  If we
		hesitate, all will be lost.

				MALCOLM
		John . . .

				HAMMOND
		You'll need an animal behaviorist,
		someone with unimpeachable
		credentials.  I believe you already
		know Sarah Harding.  She's got
		theories about parenting and
		nurturing among hunter/scavengers I
		bet she'd be dying to prove on a
		scale like this.  If you convince her
		to go, it'll be a major coup.  When
		she publishes, the scientific
		community must take it seriously.

	Malcolm just shakes his head, flipping through the file sadly.

				HAMMOND
		Your documentation, you should use
		forensic photographic methods,
		Hasselbladt still cameras, high
		definition video.  When the trick
		photography analysts take your
		evidence apart, make it impossible
		for them to say there was enhancement
		or computer graphic imaging.  Oh,
		this is very important -- avoid the
		island interior at all costs.  Stick
		to the outer rim.  Everything you
		need to know can be found there.
		Vindication lies on the outer rim.

	Malcolm gently closes the file and pushes it back to Hammond.

				MALCOLM
		I'm not going, John.

				HAMMOND
			(fatigue returning)
		Ian, you are my last chance to give
		something of real value to the world.
		I can't walk so far and leave no
		footprints; die and leave nothing
		with my name on it.  I will not  be
		known only for my failures.  And you
		will not allow yourself to go down in
		history as a lunatic.  You're too

		Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance
		at redemption.  For both of us.
		There's no time to equivocate, we
		must seize it now, before --

	He stops, staring over Malcom's shoulder.  Malcom turns.
	PETER LUDLOW, still in his overcoat, is standing in the
	doorway to the bedroom.  He looks back and forth from Hammond
	to Malcolm suspiciously.

				LUDLOW
		Hello, Uncle John.  Dr. Malcolm.

	Malcolm doesn't answer.  He seems to know Ludlow, and dislikes
	him.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Did I interrupt something?

	Malcolm turns back to Hammond.

				MALCOLM
		Find someone else.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HAMMOND'S APARTMENT/FOYER - NIGHT

	In the foyer, LUDLOW hands MALCOLM his coat, just a trifle
	rudely, and shepherds him to the door.

				LUDLOW
		So, you two were just, uh, telling
		old campfire stories, were you?

				MALCOLM
		Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a
		second that you and I don't know the
		truth.  You can convince Time
		magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer
		of whatever you want, but I was 
		there.

				LUDLOW
		You signed a non-disclosure agreement
		before you went to the island that
		expressly forbade you from discussing
		anything you saw.  You violated that
		agreement.

				MALCOLM
		You cost me my livelihood.  That on
		which I relied to support my
		children.

				LUDLOW
		If your university felt you were
		causing it embarrassment by selling
		wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly
		see how I am to--

				MALCOLM
		I didn't tell anything, I told the
		truth.

				LUDLOW
		You version of it.

				MALCOLM
		There are no versions of the truth!
		This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's
		my life.

				LUDLOW
		We made a generous compensatory offer
		for your injuries.

				MALCOLM
		It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen
		never--

				LUDLOW
		InGen is my livelihood, Dr.
		Malcolm, and I will jealously defend
		its interests.  People will know what
		I want them to know when I want them
		to know it.

	Ludlow tosses something to Malcolm, hard.  It sails across the
	foyer, upright, and Malcolm reaches out and catches it with
	one hand.  It's his cane.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Don't forget that.

	Malcolm stares at him for a long moment.  Finally, he turns
	and walks away.

	But he does not out of the apartment.  Instead, he
	walks directly past Ludlow, crosses the living room, and steps
	back into Hammond's bedroom, closing the door behind him with
	a determined CLICK.

	INT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	HAMMOND looks up, hopeful, as MALCOLM comes back into the room
	and walks over to his bed.  He reaches down --

	-- and picks up the file folder.

				MALCOLM
		Do you have a satellite phone?

							CUT TO:

	INT. MOMBASSA BAR - DAY

	ROLAND TEMBO, late sixties, skin like leather and the diamond
	hard look of a cobra, sits at a table in the middle of an
	African cafe/bar in Mombassa.

	It's daytime and the place is half full, mostly with locals,
	but there are a few obnoxious TOURISTS too, Americans on
	safari who somehow found the local handout.

	They're a noisy bunch, but Roland tunes them out, calmly
	eating his lunch and drinking a beer while he reads a book,
	eyeglasses hanging low on his nose.

	Roland suddenly stops reading and furrows his brow.  He looks
	up.  He SNIFFS the air once, then smiles and calls out a
	person's name.

				ROLAND
		Ajay?

	He turns around.  AJAY (AH-jay) SIDHU, a wiry East Indian in
	his late forties, is standing behind him, caught trying to
	sneak up.

				AJAY
			(delighted)
		How did you know?

				ROLAND
			(taps his nose)
		That cheap aftershave I send you
		every Christmas, you actually wear
		it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit
		down, what brings you to Mombassa?

				AJAY
		You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the
		last time you answered your phone?

				ROLAND
		Last time I plugged it in, I suppose.
		Why?

	Behind them, the group of TOURISTS, all men, laughs loudly.
	One of them, the MOST OBNOXIOUS TOURISTS, berates the WAITRESS.

				AJAY
		I got a call from a gentleman who's
		going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts.
		If he's to be believed, it's a most,
		uh, unique expedition.  And very
		well-funded.

				ROLAND
		Well, I'm a very well-funded old son
		of a bitch.  You go.

	The Most Obnoxious Tourist bellows for the Waitress.  His
	buddies LAUGHS.  Roland throws a glance, annoyed.

				AJAY
		But alone?  We always had great
		success together, you and I.

				ROLAND
		Just a little bit too much, I
		think.

				AJAY
		How do you mean?

				ROLAND
		A true hunter doesn't mind if the
		animal wins.  If it escapes.  But
		there weren't enough escapes from you
		and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend
		a bit less time in the company of
		death.  Maybe I just feel too close
		to it my--

	The Waitress comes to the Tourists' table and the Most
	Obnoxious Tourist actually paws her ass.  Roland is out of his
	chair in a second.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
			(to Ajay)
		Excuse me.

	Romand walks over to the Tourists' table, says something to
	the Waitress in the local dialect, and she walks away, behind
	him.  He stares down at the Most Obnoxious Tourist.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		You, sir -- are no gentleman.

				TOURIST
		Is that supposed to be an insult?

				ROLAND
		I can think of none greater.

	The Tourist looks at his Buddies and laughs.

				TOURIST
		Buzz off, you silly old bastard.

				ROLAND
		What do I have to do to pick a fight
		with you, bring your mother into it?

				TOURIST
		Are you kidding?  I could take you
		with one arm tied down.

				ROLAND
		Really?

	IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR,

	the Waiter finishes tying a man's wrist to his belt in the
	back of his pants with a napkin.  He pulls the knot tight and
	the man turns around.

	It's Roland, with his arm tied down.  The Tourist stands
	across from him.

				TOURIST
		I mean my arm.

	POW!  Roland punches him square in the jaw.  The Tourist
	reels, stunned.  Enraged, he lunges at Roland, swinging with
	both arms.

	Roland bobs, neatly ducking the punches, waits for the Tourist
	to turn around, and POPS him thrice in the face.  The Tourist
	spins and goes down to the floor, face first.  A cloud of
	sawdust and a loud CHEER from the locals rise up in the bar.

	BACK AT HIS TABLE,

	Roland drops the napkin on the table and sits back down with
	Ajay.  In the background, the Tourist's Buddies hurriedly
	carry their fallen cohort out of the bar.

				ROLAND
		Sorry.  We were saying?

				AJAY
		You broke that idiot's jaw for no
		reason other than your boredom.  Tell
		the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even
		interested in knowing this
		expedition's quarry?

				ROLAND
		Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a
		look around the trophy room, and tell
		me what kind of quarry you think
		could possibly be of any interest
		to me.

	Ajay just smiles.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. AFRICAN SAVANNAH - NIGHT

	The African savannah appears in shades of fluorescent green,
	seen through night-vision goggles.  An ANIMAL YELP comes from
	the left and the green vista sweeps abruptly toward it.  The
	world blurs momentarily, then comes into focus on a field of
	long grass.

	The grass ripples in a complex pattern as animals move
	stealthily through it.  One animal head pops up above the
	grass for a split-second, teeth bared, a white stripe between
	its eyes.  SARAH HARDING pulls the goggles away from her face.

				SARAH
		Hyenas.  Ace Face is the striped
		snout.

	Sarah is thirty, with a compact, athletic body built for the
	outdoors.  She loos through the goggles again, sweeping ahead
	of the hyenas to their prey.

	It's a herd of African buffalo, standing belly-deep in the
	grass, agitated, bellowing and stamping their feet.

	Sarah turns to MAKENA, her African assistant.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		They'll try to take down a calf.
		Come on.

				MAKENA
		Closer?

	Sarah scurries up and over a rock face.  Makena follows.
	Closer now, they watch as the hyenas rush the herd, running
	through it, trying to break it up.

				MAKENA (cont'd)
		You know, we could see everything
		from up on the edge of that cliff.

				SARAH
		No way.

				MAKENA
		But the view would --

				SARAH
		No cliffs.
			(into a pocket recorder)
		F1 headed sough, F2 and F5 flanking,
		twenty yards.  F3 center.  F6
		circling wide east.  Can't see F7.

	While she talks, breathless, fascinated by the drama before
	her, Sarah continues to creep closer and closer to the action.
	Makena follows, with growing unease.

				MAKENA
		Sarah.

				SARAH
		F8 circling north.  F1 straight
		through, disrupting.  Herd moving,
		stamping.  There's F7.  Straight
		through.  F8 angling through from the
		north.

	She's practically on top of the animals now.

				MAKENA
		Dr. Harding.

	Makena has a hold of Sarah's sweatshirt and is tugging her
	back, at least trying to slow down her progress as Sarah,
	wide-eyed with fascination, creeps even closer.

	Suddenly there is a tremendous BELLOWING and the grass right
	in front of them rips apart, trampled under the feet of the
	hyenas as they cluster around a fallen buffalo calf.  They
	yelp and jump, their muzzles bloody.

	The adults move aside, making room as the hyena pups come
	forward, squealing to get at the kill.  Sarah's eyes shine
	with excitement and she moves even closer, whispering into the
	tape recorder.

				SARAH
		Brooding behavior in evidence at the
		kill site, pups are ushered forward
		and adults help them eat, pulling
		flesh away from the carcass and--

	A telephone rings.

	Sarah stops in mid-sentence, unsure if she heard what she
	thought she heard.  It rings again, the unmistakable CHIRPING
	of a cellular phone.  Sarah and Makena both move at once,
	pawing at a backpack.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			(a frantic whisper)
		I thought you turned it off!

	Two hyenas look inquisitively in the direction of the phone.
	Sarah comes up with it and jabs at a button in irritation.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Yes?!

	Someone speaks on the other end.  Sarah rolls her eyes.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Ian.  This better be important.

	Sarah doesn't say anything for a long moment, just listens as
	the voice on the other end talks.  And talks.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		When?

							CUT TO:

	INT. MOBILE FIELD SYSTEMS - DAY

	Ian Malcolm's leg, badly scarred, is bared and draped over the
	end of a bench.  Two sandbags are fastened to his ankle and
	MALCOLM is lifting them, painfully rehabbing his injury while
	talking on a satellite phone.

				MALCOLM
		We leave in twenty-four hours.  Five
		member team.

	Behind them, the SPARKS of a acetylene torch fly as WORKMEN
	make modifications on several vehicles, including a dark-green
	Mercedes Benz AAV (all-activity vehicle).  The hood of the AAV
	is up and the V-6 engine has been pulled out; a new, smaller
	engine is lowered in its place.  To one side are two long
	trailers, connected by an accordion-like passageway, like on a
	subway car, allowing one to be towed behind the other.

				MALCOLM
		Eddie Carr's handling all our
		equipment and he'll be there to
		maintain it.  He's designing special
		field trailers now, top of the line
		mobile research units.

	EDDIE CARR, fortyish, is barking out orders to the Workmen.

				EDDIE
		No, no, look at the plans, Henry,
		you can't place that strut laterally,
		it has to be crosswise, LOOK AT THE
		PLANS!

	From the ceiling, a large metal age CRASHES down, landing
	next to them on the floor with a deafening CLANG.  They leap
	back and look up.  A WORKMAN waves from a scaffolding.

				WORKMAN
		Sorry, Eddie!  Specs say it can't
		deform at 12,000 PSI, we had to test
		it

	Eddie bends down to inspect the cage, which is rectangular,
	constructed of inch-thick titanium-alloy bars.  Malcolm hangs
	up the phone and walks up, joining him.

				MALCOLM
		Any damage?

				EDDIE
		Minimal.

				MALCOLM
		"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be
		light, it has to be strong --

				EDDIE
		Light and strong, light and strong,
		sure, why not, it's only impossible.
		God save me from academics.

				MALCOLM
		You are an academic.

				EDDIE
		Former academic.  Now I actually make
		things.  I don't just talk.

				MALCOLM
		You think I'm all talk, Eddie?

				EDDIE
			(doesn't look at him)
		It doesn't matter what I think.

				MALCOLM
		Is there anything we've forgotten?
		Anything at all?

	Behind them, someone CLEARS THEIR THROAT.  Eddie and Malcolm
	turn around.  KELLY MALCOLM, an African-American girl around
	twelve years old, stands in the doorway to the garage, a
	duffel bag slung over one shoulder.  She looks at Malcolm and
	breaks into a wide grin.

				KELLY
		Hi, Dad.

				MALCOLM
		Kelly!  What are you doing here?

	She drops the bag on the floor, and wraps her arms around him
	in a warm embrace.  He responds stiffly.

				KELLY
		Vacation.  I'm all yours.  You didn't
		forget, did you?

	She pulls back and looks at him.

				KELLY (cont'd)
		Did you?

							CUT TO:

	INT. EDDIE'S OFFICE - DAY

	KELLY is slumped in a chair in Eddie's office next to the
	construction floor.  Outside the glass windows work on the
	vehicles continues unabated.  MALCOLM hangs up the phone.

				MALCOLM
		Okay, Karen is expecting you in half
		an hour.  You only have to stay with
		her one night, she'll put you on a
		bus in the morning and your mother
		will be at the station when you get
		there.

				KELLY
		I don't even know this woman.

				MALCOLM
		Well, I do, and she's fantastic.
		She'll take you to the museum, maybe
		to a movie if you play your cards
		right.  You're going to have a
		fantastic time.

				KELLY
		Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you
		going?

				MALCOLM
		I can't tell you.  But I'll be back
		within a week.

				KELLY
		My vacation is over in a week.

				MALCOLM
		I'll make it up to you this summer.
		I promise.

				KELLY
		I'm your daughter all the time, you
		know.  Not just when it's convenient.

				MALCOLM
		Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you
		to say that?

				KELLY
		No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own
		once in a while.

	From the construction floor, EDDIE calls out.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Dr. Malcolm!

	Malcolm looks at her, trying to make peace.  Quickly.

				MALCOLM
		Is that kid still bothering you?

				KELLY
		Which one?

				MALCOLM
		You know, at the bus stop.  With the
		hair?

				KELLY
		That was about a year ago.

				MALCOLM
		Well, is he?

				KELLY
		No.  Richard talked to his parents.

				MALCOLM
		That Richard.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Ian, come here a minute!

				KELLY
			(to Malcolm)
		I could come with you.

				MALCOLM
		Out of the question.  You'd miss the
		gymnastics trials.  You've been
		training for that for a year.

				KELLY
		I don't care about the trials, I
		want to be with you.  I could be your
		research assistant, like I was in
		Austin.

				MALCOLM
		This is nothing like Austin.  Forget
		about it.

				KELLY
		You like to have kids, you just
		don't want to be with them, do you?

	He looks at her, hurt.  Eddie calls out a third time,
	impatient now.  Grateful for the escape, Malcolm gets up and
	heads for the door.  He pauses guiltily.

				MALCOLM
		I'm not like you wan me to be.  I've
		what I can be.

	He leaves.

	INT. MAIN FLOOR - DAY

	While MALCOLM and EDDIE argue over something in the
	background, KELLY circles around the trailers and looks up at
	the windows.  They're all made of tempered glass, fine wire
	mesh inside it.  She looks around, to see if anybody's
	watching.  They're not, so she quickly slips inside the front
	trailer.

	INT. TRAILER - DAY

	Inside, the trailer is a miracle of planning and design.  It's
	divided into sections, for different laboratory functions.
	The main area is a biological lab, with specimen trays,
	dissecting pans, and microscopes that connect to video
	monitors.

	Next to it there's an extensive computer section, a bank of
	processors, and a communications section.  All the lab
	equipment is miniaturized and built into small tables that
	slides into the walls.  Everything is bolted down.

	She notices a large map on the wall.  Off the coat of Costa
	Rica, there is an area that has been circled in heavy black
	ink.

	Kelly puts a finger on the map, crossing westward, through the
	Pacific Ocean.  Thegre are dozen s of islands out here, but in
	the highlighted region, there is a semi-circle of five.
	Matanceros.  Muerte.  Tacano.  Pena.  And Sorna.  Underneath
	the whole island chain, there is a bold legend.

	"The Five Deaths," it says.

	Slowly, an ocean barge starts to chug its way across the
	face of the map, leaving a wake that rolls the printed letters
	of those three ominous words.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. OPEN SEA - DAY

	The map dissolves slowly away as the barge SPALASEHS through
	five foot ocean swells in the open sea.  The barge is crammed
	with equipment, the AAV, trailers, a jeep, and the members of
	Malcolm's team.

	ON THE BOAT,

	MALCOLM stands in the bow, riding the choppy seas.  Next to
	him, DR. JUTTSON, fortyish, holds onto the railing,
	seasick.  He SHOUTS over the DRONE of the boat's engines.

				JUTTISON
			(as the waves pound the
			 boat)
		Couldn't -- we just -- airlift --
		into the -- island?

				MALCOLM
		Dr. Harding insisted we go by sea!
		Helicopters are too disruptive.
		These aren't piles of bones you'll be
		studying this time, Dr. Juttson, they
		live, they breathe, and they react!

	Juttson looks at him skeptically --

	-- and throws up.

	AT THE BACK OF THE BOAT,

	NICK VAN OWEN, a good-looking American in his late
	twenties, is sitting amid a pile of video cameras and other
	photographic equipment, playing with a Game Bow.  SARAH
	HARDING, dressed in field gear, sits down next to him.

				SARAH
		So what's your story, Nick?

				NICK
		I was a cameraman for Nightline for
		six years, been freelance since '91.
		Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.

				SARAH
		That must be interesting.  What drew
		you there?

				NICK
		Women.  'Bout eighty percent female
		in Greenpeace.

				SARAH
		Very noble of you.
			(of the noisy Game Boy)
		You don't think you're bringing that
		thing onto the island, do you?

	Nick grins and shuts it off.

				NICK
		Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the
		woolly mammoths.

				SARAH
		You think this is all a joke?

				NICK
		Oh, please.  How am I supposed to
		keep a straight face when --
			(gestures to the
			 black-clad Malcolm)
		-- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm
		going to Skull Island?

				SARAH
			(not amused)
		Ian's a very good friend of mine.

				NICK
		He doesn't need a friend, he needs a
		shrink.

				SARAH
		I believe in him.

	But her face says even she has her doubts.

				NICK
		Come on, there's only one reason any
		of us are here.  His check cleared.

	She looks at him.

				SARAH
		Drop the cynical pose.  You can't
		pull it off while playing Donkey
		Kong.

	The boat's CAPTAIN, a Costa Rican, points ahead and SHOUTS to
	them.

				CAPTAIN
		There it is!

	They all turn and look out over the bow.  Up ahead, shear,
	reddish-gray cliffs of volcanic rock rise dramatically out of
	the fog-heavy ocean.

				CAPTAIN (cont'd)
		Isla Sorna!

	The boat ROARS ahead, plowing into a heavy wreath of fog.  The
	mist swirls and encircles it.

	EXT. ISLAND FIORD - DAY

	A narrow inlet cuts through the steep cliffs, leading to the
	island interior.  The barge bursts through the fog at the
	mouth of the fiord and heads deeper into the island.

	EXT. LAGOON - DAY

	Lush green plants drip everywhere in this verdant lagoon.
	Sulfurous yellow steam issues from the ground, bleaching the
	nearby foliage white.  In the distance one can hear the cries
	of JUNGLE BIRDS.

	The boat is now beached and the CREW flips the tarps off the
	AAV, the jeep, and the trailers.  The trucks back down a
	narrow ramp and onto the soft clay shore at the edge of the
	lagoon.  There is a large three-toad animal imprint in the
	clay at the water's edge, and the AAV backs right over it,
	swapping its track for the animal's.

	MALCOLM is at the edge of the water with the CAPTAIN.

				MALCOLM
		Be back in three days, but keep the
		satellite phone on and your radio
		tuned to the frequency I specified in
		case we need you sooner.

				CAPTAIN
		Don't worry.  I've lived around here
		all my life, these islands are
		completely --

	In the distance, they hear the faint, strange ROAR of a very
	large animal.  The Captain looks at Malcolm, eyes wide.

				CAPTAIN (cont'd)
		-- safe.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. GRASSY PLAIN - DAY

	The jeep tows the double trailer to the edge of a grassy plain
	just beyond the lagoon, overlooking the interior of the
	island.  The noon sun is high overhead; below, the valley
	shimmers in midday heat.

	EDDIE connects a flexible cable to the jeep's power winch and
	flicks it on.  The cable turns slowly in the sunlight.  Moving
	along the length of it, we see the cable leads to a pile of
	aluminum, some kind of strut assembly painted a camouflage
	color.

	As the winch pulls the cable tight, the jumble of thin struts
	begins to move, slowly rising into the air.  The emerging
	structure climbs, spidery, struts unfolding, fifteen feet into
	the air.  The light house at the top (the cage that was
	tested back at Eddie's workshop) is now just beneath the
	lowest branches of the nearby trees, which almost conceal it
	from view.

	NICK lights a cigarette and carelessly tosses the match on the
	ground.  Malcolm notices.

				MALCOLM
		Listen.  I know you all have probably
		concluded that I'm out of my mind.

	Is it our imagination, or did the trees behind Malcolm just
	sway slightly?

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		That's all right, for now.  But just
		humor me and be careful.

	No, it's not our imagination, there they go again.  Whole
	trees shivering and swaying from left to right and back
	again.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Even if you think I'm harmless and
		deluded, I promise --

	Now the trees CREAKS and GROAN as they sway.  Everyone has seen
	it, and now Malcolm turns around too.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		-- this place is for real.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DOUBLE TRAILERS - DAY

	It's quiet inside the trailers that serve as their command
	post/living quarters.  The books are lined up neatly on the
	shelves.  The computers sit, booted up and awaiting data
	input.

	All the way in the back, past the spare tires and life
	preservers and canned food and bottled water, up in one
	storage bin all the way on top, there's a RUSTLING SOUND.

	A plastic student ID card pops out in the cracks under the
	bin's door.  A photograph in the lower right hand corner of
	the card is visible -- it's Kelly, Malcolm's twelve-year-old
	daughter.

	The card wriggles against the lock and, with a soft CLICK, the
	door pops open.  KELLY herself tumbles out, wrapped in several
	blankets and carrying a mason jar half full of a yellowish
	liquid.  We can guess.

	She leaps to her feet, blinks the light out of her eyes, and
	bolts to the back of the trailer as fast as she possibly can.
	She races through a narrow door and SLAMS it shut.

	A sign on the door says "RESTROOM."  Inside, a SIGH of relief
	is heard.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY

	Along a stream bed, the jungle trees still shiver.  NICK loads
	a three quarter inch tape into his heavy video camera and
	chews anxiously on a piece of gum.  SARAH and DR. JUTTSON are
	beside him as the group nervously follows the GROANING forest
	trees to their right.

	At the rear, EDDIE and MALCOLM walk side by side.  Eddie is
	carrying a heavy silver rifle, an aluminum canister hanging
	beneath the barrel.  He shows it to Malcolm, his voice low and
	urgent.

				EDDIE
		Lindstradt air rifle.  Fires a
		subsonic Fluger impact-delivery dart.

	He cracks open the cartridge bank, revealing a row of plastic
	containers filled with straw-colored liquid.  Each is tipped
	with a three inch needle and carries a bright yellow warning
	tag -- "EXTREME DANGER!  LETHAL TOXICITY!"

				EDDIE (cont'd)
		I loaded the enhanced venom of Conus
		purpurascens, the South Sea cone
		shell.  Most powerful neurotoxin in
		the world.  Acts within a
		two-thousandth of a second.  Faster
		than the nerve-conduction velocity.
		The animal's down before it feels the
		prick of the dart.

	From their right, the shaking trees seen closer now.  By
	walking down the stream bed, the humans are tracking right
	along with the animals as they move in the foliage.

				MALCOLM
			(to Eddie)
		Is there an antidote?

				EDDIE
		Like if you shoot yourself in the
		foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be
		dead  before you realized you'd
		accidentally pulled the trigger.

	Ahead of them, thick foliage blocks the path of the dried up
	stream bed to the height of about fifteen feet.  But around
	them, the CRASHING sounds get louder and closer, the swaying
	trees shiver right beside them.  Eddie raises the rifle in
	defense as the trees right at the edge of the stream bed sway
	and part.  Above the foliage, they see the sudden
	movement --

	-- of a row of STEGOSAUR fins.  The spade-shaped fins run
	along a ridge down the middle of the animal's back, about
	three feet tall each.  The group freezes, amazed, and as the
	stegosaur continues on, they get a good look at it through a
	break in the foliage.

	It's a large dinosaur with a small head, a thick neck, and a
	huge lumbering body.

	A double row of plates runs along the crest of its back, and
	it has a dragging trail with long spikes in it.

	The gum drops out of Nick's mouth, FLOPS onto his shirt, and
	sticks there.

				NICK
		Oh --

				JUTTSON
		-- my --

				EDDIE
		-- God!

				SARAH
		It's beautiful!

	A second stegosaur, a baby about a quarter the size of the
	first animal, breaks through the foliage, following the adult.

	While the group is reaching to that, the earth vibrates and
	a third stego, by far the biggest of the three, walks out of
	the foliage right behind them, crossing within ten feet.

	Apparently unconcerned about these little creatures in their
	environment, the stegos continue on across the stream bed.

	Sarah raises a still camera and shoots pictures.  Her shutter
	is muted, so that a muffled CLICK is all that's audible.

	Juttson raises a pocket recorder to his lips and whispers into
	it breathlessly.

				JUTTSON
		Stegosaurus, family Stegosauridae,
		infraorder Stegosauria, suborder
		Thyreophora.  Length, adult male,
		estimate twenty-five to thirty feet.

	His breathy words turn into almost helpless laughter, of all
	things, as he can't contain his astonishment.  Eddie covers
	his mouth, trying to keep him quiet.

				SARAH
			(to Juttsn)
		That was a pair bond!  A family
		group, even, long after that infant
		was nestbound!

				JUTTSON
		I want to see the nesting ground!

	Nick turns to Malcolm, eyes like saucers, and makes a futile,
	wordless, boy-was-I-wrong-on-this-one gesture.  Malcolm
	smiles, leans over, and TAPS softly on Nick's video camera.
	Nick raises it to his shoulder and flicks it on as the group
	continues on into the bush after the animals.

	IN THE BUSH,

	the baby wanders away from the group and ambles over near
	where Sarah crouches in the bushes.  Sarah raises her camera
	again and silently SNAPS a picture.  She WHISPERS to Juttson,
	who is beside her.

				SARAH
		Lone nest -- not colonial.  I don't
		see an egg clutch...

	She gestures and Juttson peers through a pair of field
	glasses.

				JUTTSON
			(whispering back)
		The empty shells are crushed and
		trampled.  The young stay in the
		birth environment, that's conclusive!

				SARAH
		Not without a shot of the nest.

	She sees an opportunity.  As the baby heads back to its
	parents, Sarah scoots right along with it, moving behind it,
	using its body as a shield to block her from the view of the
	other two.

	Nick and Eddie's faces whiten in alarm.  Nick reaches out to
	stop her, but he barely gets hold of the sole of her boot
	before she pulls away from him and duckwalks out into the
	clearing.

	IN THE CLEARING,

	Sarah slinks along behind the baby stego as it walks back,
	toward the nest, chewing the branches it carries in its south.
	She raises up sightly, squeezing off pictures of the herd,
	ever better as she gets closer.

	BACK AT THE HILL,

	the others can only watch her, aghast.

				NICK
		She's gutty.

				MALCOLM
		She's nuts.

	IN THE CLEARING,

	Sarah keeps moving closer.  The baby passes a small grouping
	of rocks and Sarah ducks behind them.  She's now in a perfect
	position to photograph the nest, and she squeezes off picture
	after picture from this ideal vantage point.

	She shoots the last picture on the roll --

	-- and the camera's autowinder WHIRS to life.  Sarah looks
	down in horror as the camera's motor WHINES loudly in her
	hands.

	Th noise startles the animals.  The male turns toward her
	the plates on its back bristling.  Sarah gets to her feet and
	starts to move away, slowly.

	The male turns away from her and swings its tail, spikes
	extended.  It WHIZZES through the air, right at her, but Sarah
	leaps back at the last second --

	-- and the tail's spikes THUD into the dirt where she was.

	Sarah CRUNCHES to the ground and the three stegosaurs dart
	away, disappearing into the bush, moving surprisingly quickly
	for animals their size.

	The others run to Sarah, help her to her feet, and pull her
	back, against a massive tree trunk.  But the tree trunk lifts
	right up off the ground.

	It's no tree, it's a DINOSAUR'S LEG, a massive one, six feet
	across, God knows how many feet high.  The Group gasps and
	looks up as a MAKENCHIASAURUS, an enormous saurupod over a
	hundred feet from nose to tail,  lumbers away from them.

	The Group stares in wonder as the mamenchiasaur stops and
	HONKS furtively, its long neck stretched out above them.

	Now a second mamenchiasaur neck cranes out of the
	surrounding forest trees and wraps around the first.  The
	first mamenchiasaur THUNDERS around in a semi-circle, getting
	into position behind the second.

	Nick swings his video camera straight up and the group
	suddenly finds itself in the middle of a mamenchiasaur mating.

	The mighty tails swing and SNAP around them as the two animals
	come together, and trees start snapping and falling, CRASHING
	to the jungle floor.

	The group panics and bolts for cover toward the only place
	where the trees are not falling -- which is directly underneath
	the animals!

	Amid HONKS and BLEATS, the swinging tails continue to deforest
	the jungle around them.

	The noise and chaos is deafening, drowning out the LAUGHTER
	and SCREAMS of the fascinated and terrified group.

	There is a momentary lull and the group dashes out from
	underneath the animals, disappearing into the thick forest.

	A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY,

	the Group collapses to the ground, breathless, chests heaving
	with wild, frightened laughter.  Sarah goes to Malcolm and
	throws her arms around him, exhilarated.

				SARAH
		Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so
		glad!

				JUTTSON
			(out of breath)
		Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you
		an apology.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY

	Suddenly, the Gathereres are taking their expedition a lot more
	seriously.  They march quickly back to base camp, their energy
	and excitement palpable.  NICK strikes a match and raises it
	to a cigarette with a shaking hand, but SARAH leans in and
	blows it out.

				SARAH
		No more smoking.  We leave no scent
		of any kind.  No hair tonics, no
		cologne, seal all our food in plastic
		bags.  We will observe and document,
		but we will not interact.

				MALCOLM
		That's a scientific impossibility,
		you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty
		principle.  Whatever you study, you
		also change.

	Nick ejects the used videotape from his camera and pulls out a
	sharpie, to label it.

				NICK
		What should I call this?  "Jurassic
		Pork?"

	Eddie, next to him, laughs.

				SARAH
			(still to Malcolm)
		And let's forget about the high hide.
		We can't do this kind of work up in a
		tower, we need to be out in the
		field, as close to the animals as
		possible.

				JUTTSON
		I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in
		a family group, but there's never
		been anything in the fossil record to
		prove the carnivores did.

				SARAH
		Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas,
		jackals, nearly all species of
		predator birds --

				JUTTSON
		That doesn't say a thing about T-rex,
		they could have been rogues.  Robert
		Burke certainly thinks they were.

				SARAH
		We've got to see one to find out.
		Is there any --

				MALCOLM
		No way.

				NICK
		Oh, my God.

				SARAH
		-- way we could safely --

				NICK
		Oh, no!

	He takes off, running as fast as he can, down the trail,
	toward base camp.  They look ahead, in the direction Nick is
	running.  A plume of black smoke is rising up over the trees.

				EDDIE
		Fire!

							CUT TO:

	EXT. BASE CAMP - DAY

	NICK bursts out of the trees and races toward the thick plume
	of smoke.  In the middle of the base camp, someone has neatly
	built a campfire surrounded by stones.  Flames burn in the
	middle.

	Nick races over to it and stomps it out as the OTHERS emerge
	from the trees behind him.

				MALCOLM
		A campfire?!

	Nick grabs a jug of water, but Sarah steps in.

				SARAH
		No!  Water mixes the smoke billow,
		use dirt!

	They start to kick and rake dirt onto the fire with their
	hands and feet.  Eddie and Dr. Juttson jump in and help out.

				MALCOLM
		Who the hell started a campfire?!

				VOICE (o.s.)
		It was just to make lunch.

	Malcolm turns toward the source of the voice.  KELLY stands in
	the doorway of the trailer, sheepish.

				KELLY (cont'd)
			I wanted it ready when you got back.

	The whole group stares, stunned, none more so than Malcolm
	himself.

				MALCOLM
		Oh ... man.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. BASE CAMP - LATER

	Later, and base camp is a blur of activity.  SARAH, JUTTSON,
	NICK, and EDDIE are hard at work, burying the remains of the
	fire, sealing their food in plastic bags, loading camera
	equipment, packing up specimen containers and other
	information-gathering equipment.

	MALCOLM, meanwhile, is lecturing Kelly.

				MALCOLM
		You know you were putting yourself in
		a potentially dangerous situation,
		but you didn't bother to find out
		how dangerous before you leapt in.
		You don't have the faintest idea
		what's going on on this island!

				SARAH
			(loading a backpack)
		What do you want to do, Ian, lock her
		up for curiosity?  Where do you think
		she gets it?

				JUTTSON
			(to Nick)
		Do you have chromium tapes?  The
		others fog in high-

				NICK
		-humidity, I know.
			(waving a tape)
		Highest lead density on the market.

				EDDIE
			(to Malcolm)
		We've got a lot of heavy marching
		ahead of us.  I'm not carrying 
		anybody.

				KELLY
		I can keep up.

				MALCOLM
		You're going home.  I'm sending a
		radio call for the boats.  We'll all
		go down to the lagoon and wait for
		them.

				SARAH
		Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a
		high school vice-principal.

				MALCOLM
		I'm her father.

				KELLY
		Sure, now.

	Nick leans over and whispers to Eddie, gesturing to Malcolm
	and Kelly.

				NICK
		Do you see any family resemblance
		here?

				MALCOLM
		You can't stay, Kelly, that's it.
		It's too dangerous.

				SARAH
		If it's so dangerous, why'd you bring
		any of us?

				KELLY
		You're wrong, Dad.  I do know
		what's going on on this island.

				MALCOLM
		How could you possibly?

				KELLY
		Because you said so.  Maybe nobody
		else believed you, but I always
		did.

	He looks at her, touched.  Nick mutters to Eddie again.

				NICK
		The kid scores with cheap sentiment.

				SARAH
		Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've
		made two invasive landings in one
		day.  That'll have to go in any paper
		I write, and it will leave room for
		people to say our findings were
		contaminated.  You know the academic
		world as well as I do, once they
		smell blood in the water, you're
		dead.  Our presence has got to be one
		hundred percent antiseptic.  That
		means if we bend a blade of grass, we
		bend it right back the way it-

	A low sound has been rising while she speaks, and now it comes
	BOOMING over the jungle around them, a THUNDEROUS racket that
	shakes the very ground beneath them.  Suddenly, three C-130
	military cargo planes THUNDER overhead and ROAR toward the
	island interior, flying very low.  The planes are enormous,
	fat-assed creatures, their rear cargo doors hanging open.

	AT A RIDGE,

	the members of the gatherer expedition hit the dirt and peer
	over a ledge, watching as the airplanes bank and circle over a
	specific spot.

	Eddie raises a pair of field glasses.

	DOWN BELOW,

	huge metal equipment containers are shoved out the back of the
	cargo bays.  They SNAP off trees like matchsticks, CRUSH flat
	anything foolish enough to exist where they want to land.

	Now MEN pour out the rear of the planes, their low-altitude
	parachutes billowing open behind them.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick looks at Sarah.

				NICK
		You were saying something about
		antiseptic?

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - DAY

	Metal container doors CLANG to the ground, jeep engines ROAR
	to life in a cloud of thick black diesel smoke, blue laser
	barriers SIZZLE and BURN through foliage as this group of
	HUNTERS establishes a perimeter around their new camp.

	PETER LUDLOW, dressed in brand new Banana Republic safari
	wear, steps into the center of the camp and surveys the
	surroundings.  He turns to DR. ROBERT BURKE, a ragged,
	pony-tailed man in wire-rimmed glasses.

				LUDLOW
		Welcome to your dream come true, Dr.
		Burke.

	Burke has a detailed set of satellite recon photographs that
	he spreads out on the hood of a jeep.

				BURKE
		I believe the large herbivores forage
		in open plains, like bison, which
		would explain the great variety of
		heat dots we're reading in the
		flatlands around this waterhole.
		Right -- here.

				LUDLOW
		Then that's where we're going.

	Burke flips open a manifest that he will carry with him at all
	times.  Inside, there are dozens of sketches of various kinds
	underneath.  As each vehicle ROARS out of the equipment
	container, Burke slips a waterproof eight by ten card with an
	icon of the various dinosaurs on the island into a slot in the
	dashboard.

				BURKE
			(calling them off)
		Hadrosaurus!  Carinthosaurus!
		Maiasaurus!

	As the procession goes on, Ludlow turns to DIETER STARK, the
	man we saw welding earlier.

				LUDLOW
		This is as good a place as any for
		base camp.  First priority is the
		laser barriers, I want them all up
		and running in thirty minutes.  Half
		an hour, understand?

	Dieter nods and turns to some of the HUNTERS, who number about
	twenty in all, that are working nearby.  But someone steps in
	front of Dieter, cutting him off.  It's ROLAND TEMBO, the
	hunter from the bar in Mombassa.

				ROLAND
		Cancel that, Dieter.

				LUDLOW
		What?  Why?

	Roland points to a stream running nearby.

				ROLAND
		Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do
		you want to set up base camp or an
		all-you-can-eat people bar?

				LUDLOW
			(thinks)
		You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new
		spot.  And remember, we're after
		herbivores only -- no unnecessary
		risks.

	Dieter SIGHS and goes to work.  Roland puts an arm around
	Ludlow and pulls him aside.

				ROLAND
		Peter, if you want me to run your
		little camping trip, there are two
		conditions.  First -- I'm in
		charge, and when I'm not around,
		Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the
		checks, tell us we're doing a good
		job, and open your case of scotch
		when we have a good day.  Second
		condition -- my fee.  You can keep
		it.  All I want in exchange for my
		services is the right to hunt one of
		the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck
		only.  Why and how are my business.
		If you don't  like either of those
		conditions, you're on your own.  Go
		ahead and set up your camp right
		here, or in a swamp, or in the middle
		of a rex nest, for all I care.  But
		I've been on too many safaris with
		rich dentists to listen to any more
		suicidal ideas.  Okay?

				LUDLOW
			(what else can he say?)
		Okay.

				ROLAND
		Good lad.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE

	The jungle foliage shivers, quakes, and finally falls as the
	Hunters' convoy ROARS into the hart of the jungle.  DIETER
	STARK stands in the front of the lead vehicle, the
	"speedbird," waving the convoy forward, his Driver (CARTER) at
	the wheel beside him.

	LUDLOW is in the back seat of the speedbird next to DR. BURKE.
	ROLAND and AJAY, his tracker, are in the second jeep.  They
	look up as the brakelights on the speedbird flash and the car
	stops, forcing the rest of the convoy to halt as well.

	In the front, the speedbird flashes its lights at something in
	front of it.  Dieter climbs out, plainly irritated.  He walks
	around the front of the car and sees --

	-- four PACHYCEPHALOSAURS eating grass in the middle of the
	jungle trail.  They're about five feet tall, thick, heavy-set
	animals whose distinctive feature is an enormous skull casing,
	a tall, impressive crown that rises on the tops of their
	heads.  Dieter doesn't seem impressed.  He looks back at
	Ludlow, who look at Dr. Burke.

	Burke stands up in his seat, a look of wonder on his face.

				BURKE
		Pachycephalosaurus!

				LUDLOW
		Carnivore?

				BURKE
			(enchanted)
		Huh?  No!  No, herbivore, late
		Cretaceous.  Very unusual plant
		eater, see that distinctive domed
		skull?  That's nine inches of solid
		bone.

				LUDLOW
			(who cares?)
		Just get them out of the way, Dieter.

				DIETER
		COME ON, MOVE IT!!

	The pachys look up at him sluggishly, still eating, like cows
	chewing their cuds.  As unimpressive with him as he is with
	them, they go back to their grass.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		Oh, for God's --

	He slings his rifle off his  shoulder and aims it at the
	closest animal.  Behind him, Roland has climbed out of the
	second jeep.

				ROLAND
		Dieter.  This is a round-up, not a
		war.  Use your powers of persuasion.

	Dieter gestures to the speedbird to pull ahead, which it does,
	slowly, toward the animals.  The pachys look up, alert, but do
	not move.  Dieter walks toward them.

				DIETER
		Come on, come on, don't have all
		day!

				BURKE
			(going on to no one in
			 particular)
		See, the pachy's neck attaches at the
		bottom of its skull instead of the
		back of its head, as with reptiles.

	The speedbird draws closer.  The first pachy stares at it
	intently.  The lead vehicle gets closer, closer --

	-- and BANGS into the pachy, knocking it back a few feet, out
	of the way.

				BURKE (cont'd)
		So when it lowers its head, its neck
		lines up directly with its
		backbone --

	BEHIND DIETER,

	Ajay is staring at something on the ground at his feet.  He
	takes a few steps further into the foliage, then turns back
	toward Roland.

				AJAY
		Roland.

	UP AT THE FRONT,

	the pachys turn and hop away.  Dieter turns and heads back to
	the speedbird.  As he reaches for the door, a VOICE calls
	"look out!" from behind him.  Dieter spins around, just in
	time to see --

	-- the first pachy in full charge.  It SLAMS headfirst into
	the speedbird, SMASHING the headlights and denting the grill.

				BURKE
			(concluding his lecture)
		Which is perfect for absorbing
		impact.

	Dieter turns and runs around to the front of the car.  The
	pachy has backed up  for another run and is now CHARGING RIGHT
	AT HIM.

	Dieter retreats, quickly, and rips open the passenger door to
	protect himself.

	SLAM!  The pachy clobbers the door, sending Dieter flying
	against the car, knocking the wind out of him.

	In the other jeeps, the rest of the HUNTERS stand up or lean
	out the window for a better look, laughing.

	POW!!  The pachy head-butts the tire next to Dieter.  It
	bounces off, tumbles to the ground, and rolls to its feet as
	Dieter gets to his knees and crawls toward the back of the
	speedbird.

	But the pachy is quicker and lunges at Dieter again.  He's
	forced to hit the dirt and crawls quickly underneath the
	speedbird, just as the animal SLAMS into the rear of the
	vehicle.

	Now the other three animals join the jun.  Ludlow and the
	Driver have to cover their heads as the animals lunge at the
	car again and again, SMASHING the steel-meshed windows and
	MANGLING the quarter panels.  The rest of the group watches,
	vastly amused.

	A FEW STEPS INTO THE JUNGLE,

	Ajay and Roland are staring at something on the ground -- an
	animal footprint, three-toed, enormous.

				AJAY
		It matches the pictures.

				ROLAND
		It certainly does.

	Roland gets up and goes back to his vehicle, ignoring the
	pachy demolition derby that continues up at the speedbird.
	Roland opens a case in the back of the jeep, revealing --

	-- his gun.  It's an antique elephant gun, a double barreled
	.600 Nitro Express.  Nearly a hundred years old, it's still in
	immaculate condition, its rosewood stock buttery smooth,
	bisons delicately engraved along its silver breach.

	The barrels are twenty-four inches long, topped with an ivory
	bead foresight at the business end.  Roland scoops up the gun,
	breaks the breach, and pulls two rounds of ammunition from his
	shirt pocket.

	Four inches long and three-quarters of an inch in diameter,
	these are the largest full metal jacket cartridges ever made.
	He slips one into each barrel and heads back into the bush.

	Roland pauses before he goes, as if noticing the animals
	trashing the speedbird for the first time.

				ROLAND
		HEY!

	The pachys all freeze, staring at him.  Roland waves one hand,
	HISSES sharply between his teeth --

	-- and the pachys scatter, back into the jungle.  Takes care
	of that problem.  Roland turns and heads back into the jungle,
	calling out over his shoulder to Ludlow.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Don't worry about us.  We'll catch
		up.

				LUDLOW
		Where do you think you're going?!

				ROLAND
		To collect my fee.

	And with that he disappears into the foliage.

	The Driver of the Speedbird drops it into gear and the
	battered car GROANS forward.  As it moves ahead, it reveals
	DIETER, lying underneath it, ego bruised worse than body.

	IN THE JUNGLE,

	Ajay takes a step into the bush, but at a ninety degree
	angle away from the direction in which the animals tracks
	lead.

				ROLAND
		Ajay.

	Ajay turns.  Roland points in the direction in which the
	footprints lead.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		I'm no tracker, but even I can read
		this spoor.

				AJAY
		Do you wish to go where the animal
		has been, or where the animal is?

	Roland smiles.  Ajay sets off in his direction and Roland
	follows.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. ISLAND RIDGE - DAY

	Seen from a ridge above them, the hunters' convoy continues to
	plow through the jungle.  But how the hunters themselves are
	being tracked, followed by the GATHERERS.  They scurry along
	as fast as they can, trying to keep pace with the moving
	vehicle below.

				EDDIE
		Why didn't you tell us about these
		guys, Ian?!

				MALCOLM
		Because I didn't know!  I don't have
		the faintest idea what they're doing
		here.

				NICK
			(angry)
		Ruining everything, that's what
		they're doing.  You could choke on
		the diesel smoke already!

				SARAH
		Ian, nothing we observe will be valid
		if we're trailing along in the wake
		of an army.

	Kelly has a pair of binoculars and is studying the vehicles as
	they move below.

				KELLY
		"InGen."  What's InGen?

				MALCOLM
		Where does it say that?

				KELLY
		On the side of that one truck.

	Malcolm takes the binoculars and stares down there himself.

				JUTTSON
		InGen is a genetics corporation,
		isn't it?

				NICK
			(to Malcolm)
		Is that who we're really working
		for?!  Gene splicers?!

				MALCOLM
		No!  We're an independently funded
		expedition.

				SARAH
		Funded by whom?

				MALCOLM
		John Hammond.

				JUTTSON
		But he's the head of InGen!

				NICK
		You gotta be kidding.
			(to Malcolm)
		You dragged me out of Greenpeace to
		be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't
		get anybody else?

				KELLY
		Yeah, what have you done, Dad?

				SARAH
		We'd better keep moving, or we'll
		lose them.

	The group moves on ahead, but Malcolm lingers, angry, staring
	through the binoculars.

				MALCOLM
		What are you doing to me, John?

							CUT TO:

	EXT. THE CAVES - DAY

	AJAY and ROLAND make their way through the foliage and come
	into a small clearing, where a cluster of caves is carved into
	the rock.  Ajay freezes, gesturing ahead, to the cave on the
	far left.

	Roland pulls up a handful of grass and releases it on the
	breeze.  It floats back between his legs.  That's good.

	He proceeds toward the cave, carefully, Ajay behind him.  They
	can see nothing beyond the yawning mouth of the cave, only a
	black interior.

	Roland pauses, looking down.  On the ground to his right he
	sees the partially eastern leg of a creature.  It's old,
	crawling with white maggots and flies.

	Roland continues on.  Closer to the cave, he now passes the
	skull of a large animal, some of the flesh and green skin
	still adhering to the bone.  It, too, is covered with flies.

	Still he continues on.  A short rise leads into the cave, and
	they edge up it.  From inside the cave, they can hear an odd
	SQUEAKING sound, very high-pitched.

	Crawling now, Roland and Ajay scale a four-foot circular
	rampart of dried mud, and peer into --

	-- the tyrannosaur nest.  It's flattered inside, about ten
	feet in diameter, completely encircled by earthen walls.

	A BABY TYRANNOSAUR, about four and a half feet long, is in the
	center of the nest.  It has a large head, very large eyes, and
	its body is covered with a fluffy red down, which gives it a
	scraggly appearance.

	It SQUEAKS repeatedly, tearing awkwardly at the remains of a
	chunk of animal flesh, biting decisively with tiny, sharp
	teeth.

	The cave itself is a foul boneyard.  ANIMAL CARCASSES litter
	the edges, flies BUZZ in the captive air.  Roland raises a
	bandana to his nose to cover the stench.  He  turns to Ajay and
	WHISPERS.

				ROLAND
		It's the rex nest.

	Ajay nods.  The baby tyrannosaur hears the whisper and looks
	up, cocking its head in curiosity.

				AJAY
		Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck
		to return?

				ROLAND
			(shakes his head no)
		If the nest is upwind, so are we.
		When he comes back, he'll know we're
		here before we have a chance.  The
		truck --

	In the nest below, the baby SQUEAKS angrily at the intruders.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		-- is to get him to come where we
		want him.

	The baby SQUEAKS again, indignant.  Roland turns and looks
	down at it.  Thinking.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. RIDGE - DUSK

	As the sun glows bright orange on the horizon, NICK raises a
	pair of binoculars to his eyes and peers down at the vista
	below the ridge.

	In the lenses of the binoculars, we can clearly see a mixed
	herd of midsized herbivores -- HARDOSAURS, PACHYCEPHALOSAURS,
	and CALLIMIMUSES -- racing across the plain below.
	
	MALCOLM, also staring through binoculars, lies on the ridge
	beside him.  SARAH is several feet behind them, her back
	pressed against a tree, unwilling to go to the lip of the
	ridge.

	THROUGH NICK'S BINOCULARS

	We see a shaky point of view of the herd running.  The
	binoculars whip to the right --

	-- revealing a jeep chasing the herd  Not just one jeep, in
	fact, but a whole FLEET OF HUNTER PURSUIT VEHICLES!

	There are two herding jeeps, one motorcycle, as speedier
	mini-jeep, and, further behind, a container truck and a
	wrangler's pickup truck.

	Although there's a great deal of commotion below, up here it's
	almost eerily silent.

	ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick lowers the binoculars, angry.  When he raises them again,
	the sun FLARES off the lens --

	EXT. THE PLAIN - DUSK

	-- and when the brilliant flare clears, we're right down in
	the middle of the roundup.  Engines ROAR, wheels spin and dig
	in the dirt, men SHOUT and radios SQUAWK as the hunter
	vehicles pursue the fleeting herd they're flushed.

	The HUNTER SHOUT and SHRIEK with glee, incredulous and
	thrilled by the spectacular animals they're pursuing.

				HUNTER
		LOOK AT THESE THINGS!

				HUNTER 2
		THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL, MAN, THEY'RE
		BEAUTIFUL!!!

	One of the pursuit vehicles (a "snagger"), pulls ahead of the
	others.  DIETER STARK stands in the passenger seat, holding a
	long pole with a noose dangling from the end of it.

	He swings the pole out over the side of the jeep and SHOUTS to
	the driver.

				DIETER
		FASTER!

	The Driver hits the gas and the snagger leaps forward, gaining
	on the herd.  Aware of the danger behind them, the herd veers
	to the right, toward the cover of thick jungle --

	-- but the motorcycle ROARS in from the right side, cutting
	them off, herding them back out into the open.

	BACK IN THE CONTAINER TRUCK,

	PETER LUDLOW stands in a "conning tower," a command post in
	the heaviest pursuit vehicle.  He BARKS into a walkie-talkie.

				LUDLOW
		Alive, Dieter, and uninjured!

	BACK ON THE SNAGGER,

	the Driver can barely keep up with the twists and feints
	thrown by the herd ahead of him.  Dieter CURSES and throws the
	lasso pole into the back of the jeep.  Ludlow's voice
	continues over the radio in Dieter's jeep.

				LUDLOW (o.s.)
		Those are very expensive animals!
		Can you hear me?!

				DIETER
			(to the Driver)
		Turn that off!

	The Driver SNAPS off the radio as Dieter grabs a long-barreled
	rifle from the back of the vehicle.

	THE MOTORCYCLE

	guns it again, forcing the herd back into the middle of the 
	plain.  From the trees to the left, two heads on enormous
	necks rise up in alarm.  Two APATOSAURS are startled from the
	bush and lumber out across the middle of the plain.

	The herd doesn't even break stride, but keeps running,
	scampering after the giants and stampeding right between their
	massive legs.

	One smaller pachycephalosaur bolts loose, but the motorcycle
	cuts it off and herds it back into the middle, which now takes
	the motorcycle right through the rising and falling legs of
	the apotosaurs.

	The bike chases the pachy out the other side, and as the
	apatosaurs disappear into the distance, the cycle isolates the
	juvenile.

	Another truck, a "scissor rig," spots the isolated animal.
	High in the back of the truck, a HUNTER mans a tranquilizer
	cannon, drawing a bead on the pachy as the cycle runs it down.

	He FIRES and the tranquilizer dart hits the animal in the
	neck.  Its pace slows and another HUNTER from the truck tosses
	a lasso around its neck.

	They crank a winch, reeling in the animal.

	As the truck gain on it, two six-foot padded arms with what
	look like heavy airbags on the insides open up on the front of
	the truck.

	As the animal is pulled in, the scissors close with a
	hydraulic WHIR, trapping the animal between its airbags.

	Now a pick-up rig ROARS up and drops its back gate.  The
	scissor rig rolls forward, depositing the squirming pachy in
	this dino-contaiment vehicle.

	Two HUNTERS throw levers on the side of the scissor bars and
	the scissor rig backs away, leaving the animal, still pinched
	between the bars, imprisoned in the back of the pick-up rig.

	The Hunters quickly fit new scissor bars onto the scissor rig
	and it takes off, back into the hunt.

	BACK ON THE SNAGGER,

	Dieter, rifle in hand, drops down into the passenger seat,
	whips a harness over himself and CLICKS it into place.  He
	jabs his thumb into a flashing red button in the dashboard.

	Immediately, a motor underneath the seat HUMS to life and the
	seat itself telescopes, extending a good four feet out to

	Dieter raises the gun, picks a CARINTHOSAUR, a red-crested
	herbivore, from the rear of the fleeting herd, and takes aim.

	BANG!!

	The carinthosaur staggers as a tranquilizer dart sticks in
	its left hindquarter.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	there is utter quiet.  Nick and the others stare wordlessly at
	the spectacle below.

	DOWN ON THE PLAIN,

	the snagger SHUDDERS to a halt in the dirt, kicking up a huge
	cloud of dust and dirt.

	The motorcycle spins to a stop beside it, its DRIVER pushing
	his mask up to reveal his sweat and dirt-streaked face.

	The wrangler truck backs up and drops its rear door, which
	CLANGS heavily to the ground.

	FOUR WRANGLERS carrying wire noose poles and chains race down
	the ramp and out of the truck.

	Dieter jumps off the snagger.  He puts down his tranquilizer
	gun, picks up a long steel rod, and walks forward slowly.
	Ahead of him, the carinthosaur is still on its feet.

	The sedated animal staggers, fighting to retain its balance
	while it is surrounded by the wary Wranglers.

				DIETER
		Easy -- easy -- not too close!
		Full extension!

	The Wranglers adjust their poles, extending them another three
	feet, which allows them to stay further from the reeling, ten
	foot tall animal.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		Now!

	Almost as one, the Wranglers flip their noose over the
	stunned animal's neck.  It thrashes, but the Wranglers hold
	their poles tightly, surrounding and immobilizing it.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick turns away.  He can't watch.

	DOWN ON THE PLAIN,

	a bolero-type device, a rope with a round weight at either
	end, whips around the carinthosaur's legs.  The animal THUDS
	to the dirt with a SNORT of a defeat.

	Ludlow steps up next to Dieter and both of them stare down at
	the helpless animal.  Ludlow's breathing heavily, eyes
	glowing.

	The animal is still thrashing, pumping its legs crazily.
	Dieter turns a knob on the side of the steel rod he's holding
	and thrusts it into the defenseless animal's neck.

	A blue arc of electricity CRACKS and dances over the
	carinthosaur's body.  The animal convulses in pain, a
	horrible, high-pitched SQUEALING rips the air.

	DR. BURKE, their paleontologist, hurries forward with a
	syringe.

	He draws a certain amount of tranquilizer from a bottle and
	injects it into the animal's thigh.

	CARTER, Dieter's Driver, steps up with a can of spray paint
	and quickly tags the animal with an ID number in day-glo
	orange.

	Dieter pulls the card with an icon of a carinthosaur from the
	dashboard of the jeep and marks a black X over the drawing of
	the animal.

				DIETER
		Next case.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. RIDGE - NIGHT

	Night has fallen over the island.  The hunters have
	established base camp in an area they have trampled and
	cleared just below the ridge.  Blue laser fences encircle the
	perimeter.  Inside, half a dozen tents are set up around a
	central campfire.

	The vehicles are all parked at one end, away from the tents.
	At the other end, there is a row of at least a dozen "capture
	containers," cages that hold the imprisoned dinosaurs they
	have already rounded up.

	SARAH, MALCOLM, and NICK stand at the edge of the ridge above,
	looking down at the scene.  Sarah stands a bit further back
	from the others, not wanting to get too close to the edge.
	VOICES waft up to them, raucous, LAUGHING, some even SINGING.

	DR. JUTTSON has a pair of night-vision binoculars trained on
	the cages.

				JUTTSON
		Carinthosaurus -- compsognathus --
		triceratops -- pachycephalosaurus --
		or small scavengers only.

	Malcolm, also with binoculars, furrows his brow, seeing
	something below.

	THROUGH MALCOLM'S BINOCULARS,

	he sees PETER LUDLOW, standing in the middle of the camp,
	pointing, giving orders.

	ON THE RIDGE,

	Malcolm drops the binoculars.

				MALCOLM
		Ludlow.  That's why Hammond was in
		such a hurry for me to get here.  He
		knew they were coming.

	He gives the binoculars to Sarah, who moves forward gingerly.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		You okay?

				SARAH
			(irritated)
		Heights, I can't help it.  Put your
		arm here, will you?

	She puts his arm around her waits, to steady her while she is
	close to the cliff edge.

				JUTTSON
		What do they want?

				MALCOLM
		They want their money back.  To
		InGen, this island is nothing more
		than a bed investment.

				JUTTSON
		We should get back to base camp.
		Eddie's waiting for us.

				MALCOLM
		I can't believe Peter Ludlow's
		running all this.

				SARAH
		He isn't.  Check out the guy walking
		past the fire.

	She hands the binoculars to Malcolm.

	THROUGH THE BINOCULARS,

	Malcolm sees ROLAND, who's walking with AJAY, weapons and
	equipment slung over their shoulders.

				SARAH (o.s.)
		I've seen him before.  In Brazil.  He
		and that guy with him were
		spearhunting jaguars.  Said it was
		immoral to go after them any other
		way.  He's not just a hunter, he's a
		philosopher.  Kind of guy who beats
		you up with your own argument.

	BACK ON THE RIDGE,

				SARAH (cont'd)
		He's the one in charge.

				MALCOLM
		Well, if that's true -- the man in
		charge just left camp.

	Nick, who has been quietly fuming next to them, now steps
	forward.

				NICK
		Then this is our chance.

				MALCOLM
		Our chance to do what?

				NICK
		I don't know these guys, but I know
		'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese
		whalers, French barges trying to dump
		barrels of nuclear waste in the North
		Atlantic.  They're all the same.
		They spray us with water cannon when
		we try to stop 'em, sink our boats,
		and then call us crazy.

	He rummages through his pack, coming up with various tools.  A
	hunting knife.  A bolt cutter.

				NICK (cont'd)
		Nobody has to come with me.  I've
		done this before.

				SARAH
		Why, Nick.  You are a tree-hugger.

	He looks at her, hurt.

				NICK
		There' no reason for name calling.

				MALCOLM
		Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back
		to camp right away.  Leave the other
		car for us and we'll meet you there
		in an hour or so.

				KELLY
		What are you guys gonna do?

				MALCOLM
			(signs)
		Exactly what John Hammond wanted us
		to do.

							CUT TO:

	INT. TENT - HUNTER'S CAMP - NIGHT

	In the hunters' supply tent, a case of twelve-year-old scotch
	sits open amid crate after crate of weapons and ammunition.
	PETER LUDLOW reaches in and pulls a bottle out.

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	In the jungle, LUDLOW approaches a small clearing.  ROLAND is
	bent over a small stake in the ground, chaining something to
	it.  As Ludlow approaches and walks around him, he sees what
	protest.  Roland looks up.

				ROLAND
		Offering a little incentive.

	Ludlow laughs and shakes his head.  He takes a drink and
	offers Roland one.  Roland accepts.  Ludlow notices Roland's
	gun leaning against a tree.

				LUDLOW
		What kind of gun is that?

				ROLAND
		My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made
		in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to
		him after he took down his last
		elephant.  8700 foot pound striking
		force.

				LUDLOW
		How close do you have to be?

				ROLAND
		Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume
		it'll take a slug in the brain case
		to bring him down.

				LUDLOW
		Why not just use a scope and a poison
		dart and snipe him from a hill?

	Roland just looks at him.

				ROLAND
		Or a laser beam from a satellite?

	Ludlow leans down, close to the baby rex, and examines it
	while it thrashes on its chain.  Its mouth has been bound shut
	with a leather strap.

				LUDLOW
		You rally think this'll draw the
		parent?

				ROLAND
		I once saw a bull elephant die
		charging a jeep.  All the jeep had
		done was startle the bull's calves.
		I saw a lioness carry wounded prey
		four and a half miles, all the way
		back to its den, just to teach its
		cubs how to finish off a kill.

				LUDLOW
		Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.

				ROLAND
		Rex won't be any different.  It'll
		come.

				LUDLOW
		You're kidding yourself.  An adult
		T-rex cares about one thing --
		filling its own belly.  It acts the
		way people wish they could, that's
		why everyone's fascinated by it.  If
		people had the chance to see one
		dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine
		percent would --

	He stops, an idea on his face.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Wait.  Why not?  Sedatives...
		growth inhibitors...

				ROLAND
		What?

				LUDLOW
		I hadn't planned on bringing
		carnivores back because of the
		liability risk, but I only thought of
		adults, it never occurred to me --
			(close to the animal)
		You are a billion dollar idea, my
		little f-

	CRACK!  The tyrannosaur, even with its jaws clamped shut,
	lunges at Ludlow's face, head-butting him right across the
	bridge of the nose.  Ludlow staggers back, WAITING in pain,
	clutching his bleeding face.

	Roland laughs.  Ludlow, like an enraged child, snatches up
	Roland's gun and brings the butt down viciously on the rex's
	leg.  The bone breaks with a dry SNAP and the animal HOWLS in
	pain.

	Roland lunges and throws Ludlow to the ground, but the damage
	is done.

				ROLAND
		What the hell you do that for?!

	As his pain eases, Ludlow feels a bit foolish, but he attempts
	to cover.

				LUDLOW
		Had to.  To keep him still for the
		trip.

				ROLAND
		You've broken its leg!

				LUDLOW
		We've got to transport it seven
		thousand miles.  Would you prefer it
		bit off the leg of a crew member?

	He gets up, brushes himself off, and heads back to the camp,
	trying to salvage his dignity.  Roland watches him go.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. EDGE OF HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	At the edge of the hunters' camp, NICK, SARAH, and MALCOLM
	scramble down a hillside and stop at the edge of the laser
	barriers.  There are three beams, each about two feet apart,
	the tallest almost six feet off the ground.

	Nick reaches the edge and crouches.  Sarah, helped by Malcolm,
	steps up onto his back and jumps over the top, landing with a
	CRUNCH.  Nick is next, given a boost by Malcolm, who is then
	left alone on the other side.

	He backs up a few steps, jogs right at the lasers, then
	springs off his good leg --

	-- and does the Fosburry Flop right over the top.  He lands
	with a THUD, to the silent admiration of the other two.

	FURTHER IN THE CAMP,

	the three of them creep along, hiding behind a stack of fuel
	barrels.  They lean around the edge for a look.  They're
	directly behind the row of vehicle.

	They move, into the open, covering the ground between them and
	the jeeps.  Reaching them, Nick hits the dirt and wriggles
	under the first one.  Malcolm and Sarah stand lookout.

	UNDER THE JEEP,

	Nick pulls the bolt cutter from his back pocket.  He squirms
	along until he finds the jeep's fuel line --

	-- and he snips it.  He ducks out of the way just as the
	stream of fuel begins to pour into the dirt.

	MALCOLM AND SARAH

	move slowly down the line, standing watch as Nick crawls out
	from under the first jeep and proceeds to the second.  They
	hear another SNIP, then keep moving, to cover him as he moves
	to the third.

	From in the distance, Malcolm hears a sound, a faint,
	high-pitched SCREECHING.  He turns and looks to that
	direction.

	EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT

	It's the baby T-rex, still SCREENING.  Up in a nearby tree,
	ROLAND and AJAY have spread some broken branches crosswise to
	form a high hide of their own about ten feet off the ground.

	They wait.

	Roland raises his binoculars.  The light of the camp spills
	all the way out here, illuminating some of the jungle.  He
	scans it, searching for any sign of movement.

	EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	Back in the camp, Sarah, Malcolm, and Nick have finished with
	all of the vehicles except the badly battered one, which is
	parked some distance away, undergoing repairs.  The motor pool
	area is now a soggy lake of spilled gasoline.

	The saboteurs walk casually across the camp, unnoticed in the
	drunken revelry.  They pass several tents, the shadows of the
	partiers visible as they move inside.

	They continue across the camp and arrive at the other side --

	-- to face the caged animals.  The carinthosaur that was
	tranquilized earlier stands there dully, eyes heavy and
	glassy, still under the effects.  They pass a stegosaur, its
	row of fine bristling.

	And finally they reach the largest cage, which houses a
	triceratops the size of a pickup truck, Nick pulls out his
	trusty bolt cutters.  He looks at them, a glint in his eye.

				NICK
		Hang on.  We may encounter some
		turbulence.

	INT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	In one of the hunter tents, PETER LUDLOW leans over the
	satellite recon pictures of the island, planning the next
	day's assault with DIETER and DR. BURKE, their paleontologist.
	There are small wooden dinosaur models scattered around the
	photos, indicating where certain species can be found.

				BURKE
		If you're really interested in
		infants, we'll have better luck at
		the seaside, because the sands offer
		a cushioning surface where the egg
		clutches can -- can --

	He trails off.  A low RUMBLING sound can be heard outside, and
	the little wooden dinosaurs start shaking on the board.

	They look at each other.  The RUMBLING gets louder.  Outside,
	someone SHOUTS; on the board, the little dinosaurs start
	hopping and bouncing from the vibrations, the SHOUTS outside
	turn to SCREAMS, they turn and look at the back of the tent --

	-- and the triceratops bursts right through the canvas!

	EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

	HUNTERS go flying as the tent-covered triceratops, its horns
	tearing through the canvas, RUMBLES across the camp.  Men
	SHOUT in alarm, the triceratops BELLOWS in anger and
	confusion, chaos reigns.

	In the crush of PEOPLE running every which way, MALCOLM and
	SARAH are swept off in one direction while NICK is buffeted
	in another.  They SHOUT, but cannot be heard over the frey.

	The triceratops, blinded by the canvas shroud, stomps right
	through the fire in the middle of the camp AND THE TENT BURSTS
	INTO FLAME.

	Now really upset, the animal panics and lashes out in all
	directions, blasting through tents, demolishing and/or setting
	ablaze anything that gets in its way.  Its considerable
	hindquarters SLAM into a parked jeep, sending it rolling
	across the camp.

	The jeep flattens the largest tent and SLAMS down on its side.
	Its broken gas line SPRAYS gas over the ground, the gas hits
	one of the dozens of small blazes the triceratops has left in
	its wake, and the flame shoots up the ribbon of gas.

	The jeep explodes.

	OUT IN THE JUNGLE CLEARING,

	Roland and Ajay, up in the tree, leap to their feet as a
	fireball rises up from the camp in the distance.

				ROLAND
		What in God's -- !

	BACK IN THE CAMP,

	the rest of the newly-freed animals now storm through the
	camp.  The blue laser barriers bounce crazily and go out as
	the sending units are trampled underfoot by the fleeing
	animals.

	AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP,

	Nick takes advantage of the downed lasers to slip part the
	bordere of the camp and disappear into the jungle in one
	direction, while Malcolm and Sarah vanish in the other.

	The burning tent, which was the equipment tent, now detonates
	in a series of smaller EXPLOSIONS.

	Dieter and several others are knocked to the ground by the
	series of concessive blasts.  He drags himself up onto all
	fours, charred and bruised.  A burning tire rolls slowly past
	him, spinning to a stop --

	-- at ROLAND's feet.  Dieter looks up at him.

				ROLAND
		Last time I leave you in charge.

	OUT IN THE JUNGLE,

	Nick breaks out into the jungle clearing, the same one where
	Ajay and Roland had their blind.  He sees the baby tyrannosaur
	chained to the stake.

				NICK
		Sick bastards.

	He goes to the animal, which now BLEATS in pain, its broken
	leg hanging at an odd angle.  With one strong tug, Nick pulls
	the stake out of the ground.

	BACK IN THE CAMP,

	Roland surveys the destruction.  The fire has spread and
	several tents are now tongues of flame flapping in the air,
	the animals are gone or going, and their personnel are
	scattered and terrified.  PETER LUDLOW, breathless, face
	smeared with dirt, and smoke, staggers up to Roland.

				LUDLOW
		What in Christ's name is going on?!

				ROLAND
		Isn't it obvious?

	He holds up the sniped padlock from one of the animal cages.

				NICK (cont'd)
		We're not alone on this island.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	MALCOLM and SARAH race back up onto the ridge trail, where the
	green AAV is parked.  NICK bursts around from the other side
	of the car.

				SARAH
		Nick, thank God, we didn't know
		if --

	Malcolm opens the rear door.

				NICK
		Wait, don't ---

	With a piercing SHRIEK, the BABY TYRANNOSAUR, now in the back
	of the AAV, flings itself at the open doorway, jaws SNAPPING
	just short of Malcolm's nose.

				MALCOLM
		HOLY SHIT!!

	He SLAMS the door.

	DOWN IN THE HUNTERS' CAMP,

	Roland hears the commotion up on the ridge and looks up.

				ROLAND
		Do we have anyone up there?

	BACK UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Malcolm is confronting Nick.

				MALCOLM
		?!

 NICK 		It has a broken leg!

 MALCOLM 		So do it a favor and put it out of
		its misery!

 NICK 		No!  Get in the car before they hear 
		us!

	He runs around and leaps in the driver's seat.  Sarah slips
	into the passenger seat, quickly, leaving Malcolm no choice
	but the rear.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT 
	The AAV SLAPS through the jungle foliage.  From inside the
	car, we can hear the baby tyrannosaur SCREAMING in anger.

 INT. AAV - NIGHT 
	The baby writhes on the base seat next to Malcolm, who has
	flattened himself against the door, as far away from the
	animal as possible.

 SARAH 		Ian, close the window, it's going to
		wake every predator in the jungle!

	Malcolm leans over the enraged animal and cranks up its
	window.  The tyrannosaur SLASHES with one of its powerful hind
	legs, ripping the flesh of his forearm.  He SHOUTS in pain.

	Outside, the listening jungle whizzes by.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Up in the high hide, EDDIE, DR. JUTTSON, and KELLY are
	standing watch, scanning the jungle for any sign of their
	returning comrades.

	Juttson yanks the night-vision binoculars away from his face
	as he spots the AAV, pulling up to the base camp a couple
	hundred yards away.

 JUTTSON 		There they are!

	They all turn and look, but Eddie furrows his brow, watching
	them pull the wounded animal from the back seat.

 EDDIE 		What is that they have with them?

 EXT. CAMP - NIGHT 
	SARAH and NICK carry the SCREECHING baby tyrannosaur in their
	arms, headed for the trailer.  MALCOLM, holding his bleeding
	arm, isn't far behind.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	SARAH and NICK bring the SCREAMING infant to the metal dining
	table and hold it down.  MALCOLM is right behind them.

 MALCOLM 		This is exceedingly unwise.

	Sarah turns away from a drawer of medical supplies, holding a
	small syringe.  Her shirt is streaked with blood from the
	baby's injured leg.

 SARAH 		Too late to worry about that!  Hold
		him together, Nick!

	Nick tightens his grip on the animal and Sarah makes an
	injection into its thigh, over its loudly voiced objections.

 MALCOLM 		Just do whatever you have to do and
		get it out of here as quickly as
		possible.

	Sarah picks up a small ultrasound transducer and runs it over
	the animal's leg.  A green and white skeletal image appears on
	a monitor next to the table.

 SARAH 		Okay, there's the metatarsals --
		tibia, fibula -- there it is!  See
		it?  That's a fracture, just above
		the epiphysis.

	They peer closely at the monitor.

 NICK 		That little black line?

 SARAH 		That little black line means death
		for this infant.  The fibula won't
		heal straight, so the ankle joint
		can't pivot when he stands on his
		hind feet.  The baby won't be able to
		run, and probably can't even walk.
		It'll be crippled, and a predator
		will pick it off before it gets more
		than a few weeks old.

 MALCOLM 		Can you set up?

 SARAH 			(thinking)
		It has to be temporary, something
		that'll break apart and fall off as
		the animal grows...

 MALCOLM 		Think fast, Sarah.

	The tyrannosaur, still in pain, SHRIEKS again.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Through their binoculars, the rest of the group watches the
	trailer carefully.  Even inside, the animal's SCREECHES are
	clearly audible.  Kelly is getting scared.

 KELLY 		What are they doing?  Why don't
		they hurry?!

 EDDIE 		Give me the radio.

	From the trailer, the baby lets out a long, plaintive
 SHRIEK -- 
	One by one, Eddie, Kelly, and Juttson turn around and stare
	into the night jungle.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	NICK holds the animal while SARAH fits an aluminum foil cuff
	around its injured leg and paints it with a coating of resin.
	MALCOLM, at the window, stares out anxiously.  The animal
	thrashes again.

 NICK 		Give it more morphine!

 SARAH 		We'll kill it with too much, we'll
		put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm
		almost done.  Damn it, I need
		another adhesive, something pliable I
		can --

	Her eyes fall on Nick.  She holds out her hand, urgently.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Spit!

	He spits his bubblegum into the palm of her hand.  The baby
	rex CRIES OUT again.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	From the swaying jungle, there is another answering ROAR.

	And this one's closer.

	In the high hide, the rest of the group stares, trembling.  In
	the distance, a flock of birds SHRIEKS and takes flight as the
	tops of some trees move, a whole section of forest suddenly
	coming alive, as if brushed by wind.

	But it's not the wind.

	They hear noises, THUDS in the jungle.  And then another
	section of forest trembles.  Closer.  Another flock of birds
	bursts out of the treetops and swarms past the high hide.

 KELLY 		What is it?

	Dr. Juttson puts an arm around Kelly, instinctively pulling
	her closer to him.  Eddie WHISPERS urgently into the
	walkie-talkie.

 EDDIE 		Sarah, come in!

 JUTTSON 		It's moving.  Fast.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	There is a radio box mounted on the far wall of the trailer.
	The speaker BUZZES urgently with Eddie's VOICE.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Sarah, Malcolm, can you hear me?!

	On the table, Sarah is frantically molding Nick's bubblegum
	into place on the makeshift splint.  But the baby rex,
	regaining its strength, is thrashing again.

 SARAH 		Hold it down, Nick!

 NICK 		I'm trying!

				EDDIE (o.s.)
			(from the radio)
		Is anybody there?!

	Malcolm moves to answer the radio, but Sarah SHOUTS to him.

 SARAH 		Ian, get the bottle of amoxicillin
		and fill a syringe!  Quick injection
		of antibiotics and I can get it out
		of here!

	Forsaking the radio, Malcolm moves to the medicine drawer and
	comes up with what she wants.  Working fast, he draws twenty
	cc's of the pink liquid.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
			(still from the radio, now
			 desperate)
 SARAH OR IAN, ANSWER ME! 
	They ignore him as Sarah grabs the syringe and makes the
	injection.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
 WHATEVER YOU BROUGHT INTO THE TRAILER, GET IT OUT NOW! 
 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Eddie has given up on whispering as he clutches the radio
	desperately.

 EDDIE WE ESTIMATE TWO LARGE ADULTS HEADED IN YOUR DIRECTION! I REPEAT -- 
 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Nick, Sarah, and Malcolm spin around at hearing that terrible
	piece of information.

 MALCOLM 		Oh, Christ.

	He bolts over to the wall speaker and hits the button.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Let me talk to Kelly, is she--

	A deafening ROAR sound from just outside the trailer,
	followed immediately by a CRASHING sound.  They whirl and look
	to the window, just in time to see --

	--  the AAV tumbling by, rolling on its side!

	There is another ROAR, and the baby, on the table, ROARS in
	response.  Outside the window, the head of a full-grown
	TYRANNOSAURUS REX lowers and peers inside.

	Malcolm, Sarah, and Nick all freeze in absolute terror.

	The rex outside GURGLES, making material cooing noises.  The
	baby rex, calm for the first time, GURGLES back.

	But across the trailer, in the opposite window, ANOTHER T-REX
 HEAD SUDDENLY APPEARS. 
	This one ROARS, deeply, a roar so low and loud it rattles
	anything in the trailer that isn't tied down.

 NICK 		What do they want?!

 MALCOLM 		What do you think they want?!

 SARAH 		That's impossible, they can't have
		the sensory equipment to track it all
		the way here!

 MALCOLM 		Current evidence seems to be to the
		contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT
 TO THEM! 
	Nick, hands shaking, grabs the shoulder video camera he used
	earlier.  He whips out the cassette that's in there, hurls it
	into an open duffel bag with half a dozen others, SLAMS a
	fresh cassette in, and flicks the "ON" switch.

	Sarah and Malcolm, meanwhile, hurry to the other end of the
	trailer, carrying the baby rex.  Outside, the two adult rexes
	stay with them, walking in the same direction, watching them
	through the window.

 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Seen from outside, the light inside the trailers clearly
	illuminates Sarah and Malcolm as they carry the bay rex.  The
	adult rexes tower over the trailer, twice as tall and nearly
	as long.  They walk slowly alongside it, hunched over,
	watching their infant.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	At the door to the trailer, Sarah un-muzzles the frantic baby.

 SARAH 		Ready?

	Malcolm reaches for the door handle.

 NICK 		Wait!

	He dives down on the floor under them, pointing the video
	camera up at the door, getting the best shot.  Malcolm takes a
	breath, turns the knob, and throws open the door.

	Outside, the enormous rex heads pause for a moment, staring,
	surprised.

	Although terrified, Sarah actually starts to sing.

 SARAH 			(softly)
		Born free, as free as the wind blows.
		As free as the grass grows --

 MALCOLM 		Are you insane?!

 SARAH 		I swear to God, it works with lions
		sometimes!  There we are -- your baby
		is free --

	The baby, excited, wriggles free of them and lands on the
	ground outside.  Not wasting a second, Malcolm SLAMS the door
	shut.

	The three of them freeze, not daring to breath.  Outside, they
	can hear the SNUFFLING and COOING of the animals as they
	inspect their young --

	-- and then the soft THUD of their footsteps, growing fainter
	as they move away.

	From the wall, EDDIE'S VOICE comes over the radio, relieved.

 EDDIE 		They're going back into the jungle.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	EDDIE, JUTTSON, and KELLY sag back against the railings of the
	high hide.

 EDDIE 		Thank God.  Thank God.

	MALCOLM'S VOICE comes over the radio.

				MALCOLM (o.s.)
		Kelly?  Are you all right?

	She takes the radio, her voice shaky.

 KELLY 		Uh huh.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM is at the radio.

 MALCOLM 		Wait there.  I'll come up in a
		minute.  Don't move, understand?

				KELLY (o.s.)
		I understand.

	Malcolm slump against the wall of the trailer.  SARAH and
	NICK sit on the floor leaning against the opposite wall,
	completely drained.  Sarah pulls out her pocket recorder and
	speaks shakily into it.

 SARAH 		Note to Dr. Juttson -- Tyrannosaurus
		rex does nurture its young.

	They laugh weakly.

 NICK 		There's, uh -- there's an unwritten
		rule when a news crew is in a war
		zone.  You stop the van every two
		miles and decide whether or not to go
		on.  Whether or not you feel lucky.
		One "no" from anybody in the group
		and you turn around right there, no
		question asked, nobody embarrassed.
			(pause)
		Well?  Do we go on?
	Immediately:

 SARAH 		No.

 MALCOLM 		No.

 NICK 		No way.

	They all laugh.

 MALCOLM 		All right.  I'm satisfied with the
		evidence we have right now.
		I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will
		too.
			(to Sarah)
		Do you have enough to publish?

 SARAH 		They will come after me.  But I can
		collect some stool samples, for DNA
		with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest
		of you to back me up, it should stand
		when we get back.

 MALCOLM 			(getting up)
		Then the only thing left to do is
		make sure we do get back.  I'll
		call the mainland on the satellite
		phone and have them send the boat
		right now.  This expedition is over.

	He goes to the desk and picks up the heavy gray satellite
	phone that's resting in a battery pack.  The front panel
	lights up, a brilliant green.

	But from the wall speaker, the radio CRACKLES and EDDIE'S
	VOICE breaks through, soft and empty.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Oh, God.  I am so sorry.

	Malcolm and Sarah look at the speaker box.

 MALCOLM 		What the hell is he sorry f-

	A low RATTLE sneaks into the trailer.  Malcolm, Sarah, and
	Nick takes a step forward from the walls, looking around.  The
	RATTLE gets louder, the trailer shakes and vibrates,
	everything in it starts to BANG against the walls --

	-- and something huge SMASHES into the side of the trailer.

	They're all thrown against the far wall, there is an
	earsplitting CRACK of electricity, the entire trailer rocks
	and sparks a brilliant blue, and then everything goes black.

	The satellite phone flies out of Malcolm's hands and SMACKS
	against the wall.  It lands on the floor, its number pad still
	glowing green.

	Nick crawls over and looks out one of the windows.  Outside,
	the flank of one of the tyrannosaurs wipes past the window,
	revealing the second tyrannosaur, charging straight at the
	trailer!

 NICK HANG ON TO SOMETHING! 
	They hurl themselves at the nearest solid object and hang on
	for dear life.  The charging rex SLAM into the side of the
	trailer, which rocks up on one side, BANGS back  down, and is
	quickly RAMMED again by the furious animal.  This time the
	entire trailer rolls over, completely upside down.

	Sarah, Nick, and Malcolm let go of their precarious handholds
	and drop onto the ceiling.  The tables, chairs, lab equipment,
	everything that's bolted down clings to the floor above them;
	everything that isn't RAINS DOWN ON THEM.

	But the rexes aren't done.  The trailer JOLTS INTO MOTION,
	sliding forwards.

 SEEN FROM OUTSIDE, 
	the upside down trailer, which is the rear of the two
	trailers, slides along the muddy ground, pushing up earth in
	front of it.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
 SARAH 		They're pushing us!

	Malcolm, frantic, crawls up to a window to get a look outside.
	He looks down and sees a T-rex footprint in the earth outside
	as they move past it.

	He cranks his head to get a look at the direction in which
	they are being pushed.  His eyes widen at something he sees
	outside the window.

 MALCOLM 		Oh, God.

 SARAH 		What?!

 MALCOLM 		They're pushing us over the cliff.

	Sure enough, out the back window, we see a few more feet of
	muddy earth, and then nothing but inky black.  The three of
	them look at each other for a moment --

	-- and then crawl like hell toward the other end of the
	trailer.  The opposite end reaches the edge of the cliff and
	starts up to tip ever-so-slightly downward.  They reach the
	accordion-like connector and Malcolm crawls into it.

 THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF THE FRONT TRAILER, 
	which is right-side-up, Malcolm can see the two rexes hard at
	it, pushing the front end of the trailer.

 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	Nick has a pretty good grip at the top of the trailer, but
	Sarah can only cling to an air vent in the ceiling as stuff
	starts to roll and tumble past her, headed downhill.

	The angle increases, the trailer dips, and now stuff starts to
	freefall, right past her, some SMASHING her in the head.

	Malcolm, still in the connecting tube, grabs hold.  Sarah,
	starting to be pulled downward, paws at the refrigerator,
	getting a g rip on the handle.  The door, held by a safety
	latch, doesn't open.

	Below Sarah, debris falls to the rear window of the trailer.
	Through the CRACKING glass, we can see the surf, CRASHING five
	hundred feet below.

	The refrigerator bolts suddenly CRUNCH free of the wall.  The
	box strains on its power cord.

	Still clinging to the handle, Sarah swings wildly as it starts
	to come loose, swaying above her.

	The safety latch on the door gives, it swings open, and a
	shower of food BANGS off of her as gravity empties the
	contents.

	Sarah loses her grip and plummets through the now-vertical
	trailer.  She SCREAMS, covers her head, and SMASHES into the
	rear window.  The glass spiderwebs, but does not break.

 FIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW, 
	an enormous wave POUNDS the rocky shore.  Above, Sarah is a
	tiny figure, sprawled out on the glass, held invisibly by the
	breaking window.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Nick SHOUTS to her.

 NICK SARAH! DON'T MOVE! 
	Sarah, stunned by the fall, blinks a few times, regaining her
	senses.  She looks down, at the crashing surf so far below.
	For a person with a fear of heights, this is a real drag.  As
	she stares, the rocks seem to move even farther away from her.
	She blanches; the world spins around her.

 SARAH 		OH... GOD ... please...

	Her breath fogs the cracked glass.  Slowly, she tries to get
	up, caaaaaarefully pulling herself up to her hands and knees.

	But as she puts pressures on her hands, the glass CRACKS even
	more, tiny spiderwebs shooting out around her fingers.  The
	whole glass panel sags, bowing out around the bottom of the
	trailer.

 UP ABOVE HER, 
	Malcolm looks down and sees the satellite phone precariously
	balanced on one leg of the kitchen table, its number pad still
	glowing green.  Nick is closest to it.

 MALCOLM 		Nick!  Grab the phone!

 SARAH 
	looks to her right, at a metal grating that runs along the
	wall of the trailer.  She shifts her weight, leaning on one
	hand to reach for the grating with the other.

 NICK 
	reaches for the satellite phone, its antenna just six inches
	from his outstretched fingers.

 SARAH 
	leans toward the metal grating, all hairline cracks shoot out
	around her pivot hand, shaking through the glass.  The
	splintered glass spread like a disease, it reaches the edge
	of the frame --

	-- and her hand CRACKS right through the glass.  She GASPS and
	pulls her hand out, but now she knees SMASH through the
	glass.

 NICK 
	has two fingers on the phone, but suddenly the whole trailer
	shudders and the heavy phone tips off the table leg and falls.

 NICK SARAH LOOK OUT! 
 SARAH 
	lunges for the metal grating and clings to it just as the
	heavy phone whizzes past her head and SMASHES into the glass,
	opening up a huge hole in the center of the back window.

 UNDERNEATH THE TRAILER, 
	glass, food, lab equipment, and the precious satellite phone
	fall out the broken window and SMASH on the rocks far below.

 IN THE CLEANING, 
	the trailers are split, like an L, the rear trailer hanging
	straight down, the forward one resting on the edge of the
	cliff.  Satisfied with their work, the T-rexes turn and lumber
	back into the jungle.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Sarah climbs carefully up the metal grating.  Above her, Nick
	lowers himself as far as he can, reaching for her.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE, 
	we realize the hanging trailer halted its descent because one
	corner of it is wedged in the branches of a tree that grows
	out from the muddy cliff.

	But now those branches SPLINTER.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Malcolm sees the bellows, the connector between the trailers,
	stretch as the lower trailer JERKS and dips lower.

 BELOW HIM, 
	Sarah mountain-climbs through the trailer's kitchen,
	inadvertently kicking the faucet on as she struggles for
	purchase.

 OUTSIDE, 
	the tree branch SNAPS and the trailer jerks, stretching down
	again.  The bellows expands to its full length, stretching
	like a Slinky.

 INSIDE, 
	Nick knows he has to hurry.  He climbs down, bouncing off the
	built-in furniture, moving ever closer to Sarah.

	But Sarah slips and loses her grip, dropping a few feet.  She
	gabs hold of the sink, the flowing water spraying her face.

 EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT 
	EDDIE CARR is in the driver's seat of the jeep, racing through
	the jungle as fast as he can.

 EDDIE 		Hang on -- hang on --

	The foliage SMACKS the windshield, then clears suddenly,
	revealing the endangered trailers on the cliffside ahead of
	him.  The jeep bounces through the deep footprints left by the
	rex and SKIDS to a halt.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Sarah loses her grip on the sink and falls, SMASHING into the
	frame of the half-broken rear window again.

 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie bolts out of the car and runs to the front trailer.  He
	SHOUTS in through the broken front window.

 EDDIE HEY! HELLO?! 
 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	The three look up from their precarious positions.

 MALCOLM WE'RE IN HERE! GET SOME ROPE! 
 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie turns and run back to the jeep.  He grabs a coil of
	rope, secures one end around a tree, and hurries back to the
	trailer.

 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	Eddie dashes over the mess in the front trailer and crawls out
	into the extended connector.  He peers over the edge, down
	into the second trailer, and tosses the rope.

 EDDIE 		Catch!

	The rope falls through the center of the trailer, its end
	dangling all the way out the smashed rear window.  But the
	trailer SHUDDERS, starting to move again.

 SARAH 		We're sliding!

 EDDIE 		Climbs up if you can!

 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie runs out of the trailer in time to see the wheels
	dragging forward through the mud as the weight of the dangling
	trailer pulls the whole thing toward the edge of the cliff.

	He runs for the jeep and grabs hold of the power winch on the
	front grill.

	Behind him, the trailer rolls closer to the edge of the cliff.

	Eddie races back to the trailer, pulling out a length of cable
	behind him.  He runs up to the still-moving trailer, dives for
	its towing hook, the cable goes taut --

	-- and he falls short.  Just by six inches, but he's out of
	cable.

 EDDIE 		Damn it!

 INSIDE THE TRAILER, 
	Nick and Sarah are now together, clinging to the rope near the
	bottom of the trailer as it shifts around them.  Malcolm is
	further up, also clinging to the rope.

 OUTSIDE, 
	dirt and rocks pile up around the wheels and spill over the
	edge of the cliff.

	Eddie, back at the jeep, reels out more winch cable.  He turns
	and races back to the trailer just as gravity starts to LIFT
 THE FRONT END OFF THE GROUND! 
	Eddie dives again, and this time the cable hook CLICKS
	securely into the trailer's towing hook.  The trailer lurches
	toward the edge of the cliff and stops.

	But the jeep is jerked forward by the sudden pressure.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Malcolm clings to the rope in the middle of the trailer while
	Nick and Sarah try to struggle up it, but a sudden dig knocks
	them back, and their hands slide down the line.  SCREAMING,
	they slide through the trailer and their feet SMASH through
	the remains of the rear window.

	Regaining hold of the rope at the very end, the two of them
	now find themselves hanging out of the rear end of the trailer,
	dangling over the rocky shore below.

 IN THE JEEP, 
	Eddie hits the gas and the tires slosh in the mud, trying to
	get a grip.  The jeep pulls just enough to lower the front
	trailer back to earth.  But the tires spin, fighting to hold
	it there.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE 
	Sarah and Nick dangle, desperate.

 IN THE JEEP 
	Eddie CHUNKS the shifter into four wheel drive and GUNS the
	engine.  As the motor ROARS, the sound is topped by another
	ROAR, in the distance.

	And this one's not a machine.  But Eddie doesn't hear it.  He
	GUNS the engine again.  There is another ROAR from the jungle.

	Eddie hears this one.  He darts a look at the side view
	mirror.  In it, he sees one of the TYRANNOSAURS bolt out of
	the jungle behind him.

	He GASPS and looks at the other side view.  In it, he sees the
	OTHER REX racing toward him.

	The tyrannosaurs STOMP forward to confront the ROARING jeep.
	The first rex bends over, CHOMPS down on the rear tire, and
	lifts the car to its teeth.

	But the spinning tire LINGS in the rex's mouth, burning it.
	Surprised by the fight in this foe, the rex loses its grip and
	the jeep BANGS back down onto the ground.

	Eddie, horrified, dives down under the steering wheel, to get
	away.  The gas pedal pops up --

	-- which makes the trailer pitch over the side of the cliff.

	But the rex STOMPS down on the jeep to prevent its escape.
	The trailers stop.

	Now the rexes lean down, over the jeep, and focus on Eddie,
	who still covers under the steering wheel.  The first rex
	SNAPS at him, hitting the steering column with it, leaving Eddie fully
	exposed.

	He SCREAMS and the second rex lashes in, seizing him in its
	teeth and tossing him out of the car.

	Eddie pops up into the air between the two rexes, both their
	heads flash at him at the same time, and in a split-second, he
	disappears between their teeth.

	Now completely ignored, the jeep rolls freely forward and the
	trailers drop over the edge of the cliff.

 INSIDE THE TRAILER, 
	Nick, Sarah and Malcolm cling to each other and the rope as
	the trailers fall around them.  The windows flash by as the
	trailers plummet, equipment BANGS and SCRAPES them, but they
	hold on to the rope, still tied to the tree, for dear life.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE, 
	the trailers slide the rest of the way, exposing the three,
	who pop out the space where the front windshield was.
	Dangling from the rope, they look up and see the jeep, which
	is now rolling to the edge of the cliff.

	It falls, past them, and the whole mess EXPLODES on the rocks
	below.  Finally, it is silent, except for the sound of the
	surf.

 EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT 
	It's quiet up here too, the rexes nowhere to be seen.  At the
	cliff, a hand appears from over the edge.  Then another.
	SARAH pulls herself up, back onto solid ground, then comes
	NICK, then both of them reach over and help MALCOLM up over
	the edge.

	They collapse there, in the mud, completely exhausted.

 MALCOLM 			(softly)
		Eddie?

	He looks at the other two.  They glance around, then drop
	their heads.  Sarah hears a SOUND in the distance.

 SARAH 		Oh, God.  Now what?

	From the edge of the jungle, a cris-cross of flashlight beams
	moves toward them.  But rather than the three or four that
	would signify their own group, there are nearly twenty of
	them.

	The HUNTERS, PETER LUDLOW is in the lead, ROLAND and AJAY
	with him.  DIETER is there too, shepherding KELLY and DR.
	JUTTSON along in front of him.

	Malcolm sees Kelly, they call out to each other, and race
	together.  Malcolm falls to his knees and hugs her as tightly
	as he possibly can.

 MALCOLM 		Are you all right?!  Anything broken?

 KELLY 		I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I
		thought you, are you okay?!

 MALCOLM 		I'm fine... I'm fine...

	Roland looks around, at the mess that was their base camp.

 ROLAND 			(mostly to himself)
		That's what you think.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. RUINED BASE CAMP - NIGHT 
	In the ruins of the first team's base camp, the survivors of
	the night's two separate catastrophes stand face to face, in a
	heated argument.

	MALCOLM sits off to the side, still holding Kelly in his arms,
	just looking down at the ground and shaking his head.  There's
	something about his posture of defeat that is far more ominous
	than any of the hot tempers that are flaring.  LUDLOW rants to
	SARAH while DIETER looms menacingly over NICK.

 LUDLOW 		Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go
		to jail just for being here, did
		you know that?

 SARAH 		Don't start a legal argument with me,
		this island isn't your property, and
		neither are these animals!

	DR. JUTTSON has encountered DR. BURKE.

 JUTTSON 		What are you doing here, Burke?
		There's no TV cameras, what's the
		point?

 BURKE 		Dr. Juttson, you exist outside the
		classroom.  I am amazed.

	Dieter continues to get in Nick's face.

 NICK 		Are you looking for a problem?

 JUTTSON 			(an urgent whisper)
		Everyone, keep your voices down!

 ROLAND 		Back off, Dieter.

 JUTTSON 		Listen to me, by moving the baby
		rex into our camp, we changed the
		adults' perceived territory!

 LUDLOW 		Their what?

 SARAH 			(she understands)
		Oh, God.

 JUTTSON 		That's why they persisted in
		destroying the trailers, they now
		feel they have to defend this entire
		area!  We're not safe here.

 LUDLOW 			(of Sarah and Nick)
		Thanks to you people.

 SARAH 		Hey, we came here to observe, you
		came here to strip-mine the place!
		It's a looter mentality, all you care
		about is what you can take.

 ROLAND 		None of that matters.  Our
		communications equipment's been
		destroyed.  If your radio and
		satellite phone were in those
		trailers that went off the cliff, and
		I'm guessing by the look on his
		face --

	He points at Malcolm, who is still off to the side, sitting in
	stunned silence.  Malcolm looks up and nods, slowly.  The
	grimness of their situation sinks in.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		We are stuck here, ladies and
		gentlemen.  And we're stuck together.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT 
	Back in the hunters' now-demolished camp, members of the two
	groups combine their diminished supplies.  They have half a
	dozen large plastic containers of water, thirty-seven
	containers of food, ranging from Ziploc bags to aluminum tins,
	a variety of weapons, mot of them borne on the hips or
	shoulders of the HUNTER team, the charred and scraggly
	remnants of several pieces of now-useless electrical
	equipment, a flare gun and several flares, somebody's tattered
	paperback ("Crime and Punishment"), a box of Hershey bars, and
	a cartoon of Marlboros.

	ROLAND supervises the assembling of the resources, which are
	displayed in front of him.  LUDLOW, NICK, SARAH, JUTTSON, and
	MALCOLM, who is still holding KELLY close to him, are with
	him.  They hold their discussion in quiet tones.

 ROLAND 		If we can't stay in the rex's
		territory, we have to move tonight.

 SARAH 		Move where?  Our boat's not coming
		for two days, your airlift is waiting
		for an order you have no way to
		send --

	Ludlow refers to the charred and trampled satellite
	photographs of the island, which are still mostly legible.

 LUDLOW 		There's a communication center, here,
		in the old worker village.  Hammond
		put in some kind of renewable power
		source replenishing.  It may still
		work.  If we could get there, we
		could send a radio call for the
		airlift.

 NICK 		How far is the village?

 LUDLOW 		I said if we could get there.

 NICK 		Well, how far is it?

 LUDLOW 		A day's walk, maybe more.  That's not
		the problem.

 ROLAND 		What is?

 LUDLOW 		The velociraptors.

	Malcolm looks up sharply.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Our infrareds show their nesting
		sites are concentrated in the island
		interior.  That's why we planned on
		keeping to the outer rim.

	Malcolm shepherds Kelly away from the conversation and mutters
	something to her quietly in the background.

 DIETER 		What are velociraptors?

 JUTTSON 		Carnivores.  Pack hunters.  About six
		feet long, three or four hundred
		pounds, and very, very fast.

	Dieter brandishes his weapon.

 DIETER 		I think we can handle ourselves
		against them.

	Malcolm rejoins the conversation, alone.  He keeps his voice
	low.

 MALCOLM 		No.  I'm quite certain you can't.

 ROLAND 		Look, we have two choices.  We can
		hike back down to the lagoon, where
		we can sit for two days, in the open,
		next to a heavily used water source
		while we're waiting for your boat to
		arrive, or we can head for the
		village, where we might find some
		shelter and we can call for help.

 MALCOLM 		We'd never make it past the raptors.
		Trust me, I have some experience in
		this matter.

	Roland looks at him.

 ROLAND 		That may be.  But you weren't with
		me at the time.

	Malcolm just shakes his head, then turns and walks back to
	Kelly.  Roland turns to the others.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Load up.  Let's get this moveable
		feast underway.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ISLAND - NIGHT 
	The SURVIVORS set forth, marching through the jungle in a
	column.  Two HUNTERS strap on small shoulder-mounted
	servo-flashlights.  Wires run from the lights end in
	sensor pads which they stick to the skin of their necks.  Thus
	attached, when the hunters turn their heads, the servo-lights
	turn with them, illuminating whatever direction they look in.

	MALCOLM screws the barrel into the Lindstradt rifle and slings
	it over his shoulder as he marches, limping heavily.  He looks
	down at KELLY, who is marching alongside him.  His face shows
	the deepest of regret.  He shakes his head, cursing himself.

 MALCOLM 		Damn it.

	He looks away as Kelly looks up at him, questioning.  ROLAND
	falls into step with Malcolm and notices his limp.

 ROLAND 		You all right?

	Malcolm looks at him, then looks away without answering.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Wrong question?

 MALCOLM 		You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?

 ROLAND 		What's that?

 MALCOLM 		A statistical phenomenon.  Says
		everything in the world goes in
		streaks.  It's real, you see it
		everywhere -- in weather, in river
		flooding, in baseball, in blackjack,
		in stock markets.  Once things go
		bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad
		things cluster.  They go to hell
		together.

 ROLAND 		Feeling a bit blue, are we?

	Malcolm glances at Kelly, who has taken a slightly faster pace
	and is a few steps ahead of them now.

 MALCOLM 		Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.

 ROLAND 		Why did you come here?

 MALCOLM 		So that others would know about this
		place?

 ROLAND 		Why should they?

 MALCOLM 		Because it exists.

 ROLAND 		It'll still exit if they go on not
		knowing, won't it?

 MALCOLM 		Yes.  And people will live in the
		absence of truth.

 ROLAND 		So the truth is more important to you
		than your life?

 MALCOLM 			(lowers is voice)
		I don't care about my life.  But if
		I'd ever thought for a second that
		she would be in danger --

	Roland follows his gaze forward, to Kelly, who's about ten
	yards ahead now.

 ROLAND 		She yours?

 AHEAD OF THEM, 
	Kelly can hear their voices, faint, but clear.  They are not
	as far away as they think they are.

				MALCOLM (o.s.)
		I'm afraid so.  I don't know what the
		hell I'm doing with kids.  I never
		should have had her.

	Kelly's face shows she heard that part.

 BEHIND HER, 
	Malcolm, unaware, continues with Roland.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Why are you here?

 ROLAND 		Somewhere on this island, there
		exits the greatest predator that
		ever lived.  And the second greatest
		predator must take him down.

 MALCOLM 		But why?

 ROLAND 		You remember that guy, about twenty
		years ago, I forget his name, but he
		climbed Everest without any oxygen,
		came down almost dead.  And they
		asked him, "why did you go up there
		to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I
		went up there to live."

 MALCOLM 			(nods)
		It's called self-testing.  But in
		your case, it sounds more like
		self-destruction.  A uniquely human
		characteristic.  In fact, human
		beings destroy things so well that I
		sometimes think that's our function.
		Maybe every few sons, some animal
		comes along that kills off the rest
		of the world, clears the decks, and
		lets evolution proceed to his next
		phase.  Maybe death and destruction
		are our job, maybe we're supposed
		to destroy ourselves and every other
		living thing that-

	Every person on the trail within earshot has stopped and is
	staring at Malcolm, shaken by his words.  Roland grabs Malcolm
	by the shirt collar and pulls him close, GROWLING in his ear.

 ROLAND 		Tell you what.  You can see whatever
		you want to, to me, but you will not
		spew any more nihilist rants at
		anyone else in the group.  I'm
		fighting panic, and you push the
		wrong buttons.  Understand?

	Malcolm just blinks.  This guy's in charge.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - DAWN 
	As a purple dawn dissolves the night sky, the SURVIVORS
	stagger on, exhausted.  Some are starting to tire, and there
	are spaces in the column.  MALCOLM's limp seems to be getting
	worse.  NICK reaches out, to take Malcolm's pack, but Malcolm
	swats his hand away.

	KELLY, still ahead of him, falls into step with SARAH.

 KELLY 		I don't think -- my dad doesn't
		think we're going to make it.

	Sarah looks at her.

 SARAH 		Your dad is wrong.  About a lot more
		than he knows.

	She puts an arm around her.  Kelly looks up at her, grateful.
	The long march continues.

 UP AT THE FRONT, 
	NICK catches up to ROLAND.

 NICK 		I think you should call a break.

 ROLAND 		Another half hour.

 NICK 		Some of them won't make another half
		hour.  We didn't come this far to
		start dropping in the middle of the
		jungle.  If you don't call it, I
		will.

	Roland looks at him, steely, then SHOUTS to the group.

 ROLAND FIVE MINUTES BREAK! 
	Immediately, the marchers drop where they stood, absolutely
	drained.

 AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP, 
	DRS. BURKE and JUTTSON are bickering.

 JUTTSON 		I can't believe you're still angry
		about that.

 BURKE 		You know, it's very easy to criticize
		the first person who studies
		something.

 JUTTSON 		No, it's easy to criticize sloppy
		research and hasty conclusions.

 NEARBY, 
	MALCOLM checks Nick's bag of videotapes, making sure they're
	still dry and undamaged.  Sarah comes up, watching him.

 SARAH 		You know, even if we do get those
		tapes back, people are going to say
		it's just another hoax.  Ian
		Malcolm's alien autopsy.

 MALCOLM 		Maybe.  Maybe not.

 SARAH 		Ian, they will misplace our evidence,
		shoot holes in our testimony, and say
		some special effects genius created
		the animals.  The only way people
		will ever believe that dinosaurs
		exist is if you dump a T-rex in the
		middle of times Square.

	He doesn't look at her.  She sits down beside her.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		There's something more important that
		you should be thinking about instead.

 BEHIND THEM, 
	Dr. Burke, furious, has stalked away from Juttson and sits
	down on a rock.  H does a double take, noticing something
	behind the rock.  He leans over and picks it up.

	It's an oval shape about eight inches long, with a pebbled
	exterior.  A dinosaur egg.

	Burke's face lights up, fascinated, and he carefully pieces
	the egg in a satchel he wears over one shoulder.

 AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP, 
	DIETER STARK pulls a wad of toilet paper from his pack, drops
	the pack on the ground, and turns to the Hunter nearest him --
	CARTER, his driver, who has his back turned.

 DIETER 		Wait here for me, would ya Carter?

	He steps off the path, into the jungle.  But as we come around
	the front of Carter, we see he's wearing a Walkman, the
	headphone BLARING tinnily in his ears.

	And he didn't hear a word.

 EXT. THICK OF THE JUNGLE - DAY 
	Only a few feet off the path, it's primary forest, the growth
	so thick that almost all sunlight is obscured.  DIETER claws
	forward until he finds a suitable spot to relieve himself.

	He clears away a bunch of leaves and debris and raises his
	hand to his belt buckle.  He freezes, hearing something we
	didn't.  He glances around, head darting, alert to any danger.

	Nothing there.  Just a few distant ANIMAL CALLS--

	-- and s SCURRYING around to his left.

	Dieter snaps his head in that direction.  At first, he sees
	nothing, but as he moves closer, gun extended in front of him,
	he sees a small dinosaur, a COMPSOGRATHUS, the same
	chicken-sized animal Cathy saw on the beach so long ago.

 DIETER 		It's not polite to --

	He pulls the steel rod out of a loop in his belt and touches
	it to the compy's back.  The blue bolt of electricity CRACKS
	and dances over the compy's body and it convulses in pain.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		-- sneak up on people.

	The wounded compsognathus scurries back into the jungle,
	whimpering.  Dieter clambers through the foliage ten or twelve
	paces, pushes aside two large palm fronds, and steps out
	into --

	-- more jungle.  He stops, puzzled, not sure if he went back
	or forward.

	He looks behind him.  He pauses, recalculating the path he
	took coming into the jungle, MUTTERING to himself, gesturing
	with his hands, retracing his steps.

	He adjusts his angle slightly to the right and heads off in
	that direction.  But after five or six hard-fought steps, he
	stops again.  Still nothing but jungle.

 DIETER HEY! CARTER! YELL OR SOMETHING, I GOT TURNED AROUND IN HERE! 
 ON THE TRAIL, 
	Dieter's cries are faint, but audible.  The only Marchers hear
	enough to hear him is CARTER, but the Walkman is blaring in
	his ears.

				DIETER (o.s.)
		...Carter... me?...

 IN THE JUNGLE, 
	Dieter hears that SCURRYING sound again, this time from his
	right.  He adjusts his angle again and SCRAPES through the
	foliage, moving faster and faster.

	Panicking, he ties to run, but the roots rise high out of the
	ground in the jungle, and he trips on one and falls flat on
	his face.

	He looks up.  The SCURRYING sound comes again, this time ten
	times louder than before, like a hundred feet coming at him.

	Dieter GASPS as something rushes in at him.

	He whirls to his right.  Whatever it is rushes in from that
	side as well.  And the left.  And behind him.  Dieter
	scrambles up into a sitting position --

	-- and laughs.  He is surrounded by at least forty compys now,
	the same as the one he wounded.

	For a long moment, they just stare at him.  Slowly, he brings
	his gun around, to point it at them.

 DIETER 		Easy -- wait -- one more sec-

	As one, the compys SHRIEK and hurl themselves forward,
	covering Dieter's body.  Their teeth and claws FLASH as they
	each try to grab a scrap of his flesh, tearing savagely.

	Dieter SCREAMS and flails, waving his arms and legs wildly.
	Some of the tiny animals lose their grip and sail off,
	SMASHING into trees or the ground.  But dozens of others hang
	on, and Dieter falls over backwards, now lying on his back on
	the ground.

	Hysterical, he fights like hell to get to his feet, SCREAMING,
	shaking, swatting the compys loose.  He spins, and that tactic
	seems to work, as the compys themselves begin to panic and
	drop off of him.  But he also loses his grip on his weapon,
	which goes flying, landing in the thick foliage five or six
	feet from him.

	Losing the attack, the compys turn and dart away en masse,
	stopping ten yards away from him.

	But they turn and regroup, facing him in a line, hopping up
	and down, CHIRPING and SHRIEKING.

	Dieter bounds into the foliage, looking for his gun.  But the
	compys follow him in and he's forced to flee, abandoning his
	lost weapon.

	Ten feet on, he stops, knowing he's screwed without the gun.
	He turns to face the pursuing compys.

	They stop.

	Dieter charges them, SHOUTING, waving his arms.

	The compys turn and run.  Dieter stops.

	The compys stop.  They stare back at him.  There is a moment
	of quiet, then they start to hop again, CHIRPING and
 SQUEALING. 
	Dieter, tired of this game, turns and runs away.

	The compys follow.

 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	From the front of the convoy, ROLAND SHOUTS out.

 ROLAND 		Break's over, move on!

	The exhausted marchers drag themselves back to their feet and
	start to march again.  At the rear of the group, someone taps
	Carter, who is still listening to his music.  Carter gets up,
	hoists his backpack, and marches away.

	Behind him, Dieter's pack is left, forgotten, on the jungle
	trail.

 EXT. DEEP IN THE JUNGLE - DAY 
	DIETER stumbles along, exhausted.  He reaches the edge of a
	stream that runs under the foliage, and his feet slip on the
	stones.  He falls, into the rocky stream.

	Behind him, the army of compys pours over the little hill he
	just crested.  They disappear for a moment, down an incline --

	-- And then swarm over his body.  In a frenzy of splashing,
	Dieter shrugs them off and crawls away, through the stream.
	He gets to his feet but falls again, this time over a log.  A
	geyser of water splashes up in the air behind the log as
	Dieter drops out of sight.

	The compys leap over the log and disappear from view too,
	throwing up their own splashes of water.  SCREECHING,
	CHIRPING, and the sound of TEARING flesh mixes with Dieter's
 SCREAMS. 
	Now, as more compys leap over the log and splash into the
	water below, the geysers that shoot up into our field of view
	are pink.

	And then they're a deep, deep red.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	The group has stopped again.  Near the rear, SARAH, NICK,
	MALCOLM, LUDLOW, and ROLAND are in a tense conversation with
 CARTER. 
 ROLAND 		How long ago was this?

 CARTER 		Seven, eight minutes.

	Roland looks at them, thinking.  Finally:

 ROLAND 		Then he's dead.  Nobody tells the
		little girl.  Last thing we need is
		screaming hysterics.

	He turns and heads back to the front of the column.

 SARAH 		We have to send someone to look for
		him!

 ROLAND 		You go if you like, but we're not
		waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!

	They look at each other, appalled, but the column starts to
	move.  Numbed, shocked, but left with no choice, they move on,
	one by one.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ISLAND RIDGE - DUSK 
	The column of MARCHERS has finally reached the island ridge,
	where they are silhouetted against the setting sun.  They're
	taking a break, sprawled out on rocks or over the ground.

	MALCOLM sits next to KELLY, who's sitting on a log.

 MALCOLM 		You okay?

	She doesn't look at him, just gets up and walks away, going to
	sit over next to SARAH.

	Malcolm watches, pained, but Sarah puts an arm around her and
	makes a "she's okay" gesture to Malcolm.

 AT THE RIDGE, 
	ROLAND steps up to the very edge and peers into the island
	interior.  From his vantage point, he's able to see all the
	way to the far side of the island, a rim of herd black cliff,
	miles away.  Between here and the cliffs there is nothing but
	gently undulating jungle.

	He refers to one of the satellite recon photos.

 ROLAND 		Looks like the worker village is down
		in there, about a mile and a half
		northeast from the base of these
		cliffs.

	MALCOLM is next to him.

 MALCOLM 		There must be a game trail, some kind
		of path that goes down there.

	Roland looks around at the exhausted MARCHERS.

 ROLAND 		They'll have to rest before we look
		for it.  Eat.  Sleep.  Two hours.
		Then we hit it.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT 
	The group has made camp in the jungle.  The mood is somber,
	most of the MARCHERS asleep already.  Three or four tents have
	been put up.

 IN ONE TENT, 
	KELLY sits quietly in a corner, her eyes wide, knees hugged up
	to his chest.  SARAH comes in.

 SARAH 		There you are.  Your dad's looking
		for you.

 KELLY 		I doubt that.

	Sarah takes off her outer shirt and hangs it over a bar to dry
	the broad red smear across its front.

 SARAH 		Oh, come on.  Go talk to him.

 KELLY 		Why?  He likes to be alone.  I can
		stay with you.

 IN THE CAMPSITE, 
	all is still.  The nocturnal jungle HOOTS and BUZZES around
	the sleeping marchers.

	In his tent, ROLAND abruptly sits up.  As if he heard
	something.  He looks out the open flap.  In the middle of the
	campsite, he sees AJAY stop in his tracks, head cocked.

	Roland gets up and goes outside, joining Ajay in the middle of
	the camp.

 ROLAND 		You hear something?

 AJAY 		No.  I feel something.

	Roland looks at him.  This isn't so good.  He looks out at the
	shifting jungle.  He notices a thin plume of smoke rising up
	over the trees just barely outside the edge of camp.

 ROLAND 		Oh, no.

 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Kelly and Sarah have laid down on top of sleeping bags, trying
	to get a few minutes' rest.  Sarah's shirt hangs over them,
	swaying in the gentle breeze coming through the open flap.

	As the shirt dangles there, swinging softly from side to side,
	we notice the broad red smear across the front.  Oh, that's
	right -- it's blood.

	The baby T-rex's blood.

 AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP, 
	the thin plume of smoke leads down to a tiny cooking fire
	that's been lit by DR. BURKE.

	He's set a small frying pan on top of it, and now he CRACKS
	the dinosaur egg he picked up earlier into the pan.

	Roland and Ajay run up behind him.

 ROLAND 			(hisses)
 ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?! 
	Burke leaps out of the way as Roland kicks dirt on the fire.

 BMBB! 
	Roland, Ajay, and Burke all freeze.  What was that?

 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Sarah and Kelly sit up.  They felt it too.

 BMBB! 
 AT THE COCKING FIRE, 
 ROLAND 		Get my weapon.

	Ajay turns and trots away a few steps, then stops cold,
	staring down at the ground.

 BMBB! 
	A recent rain has all left puddles scattered around the camp, and
	impact tremors now create ripples in the puddles -- concentric
	circles spreading to the outer edges.

 BMBB! 
 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Sarah and Kelly are frantically sealing up any opened food
	into Ziploc bags.

 BMBB! 
	Now they leap into Sarah's sleeping bag, to seal themselves,
	and draw the zipper up, all the way around.

	Outside, the silhouette of the rex's head passes by the tent.
	Sarah works faster, her fingers struggling to close the last
	few inches, but --

	-- the rex head pokes through the flap of the tent.  It
	sniffs, SNORTING the air in and out.  It looks around the
	tent.

	It sniffs Sarah's hanging shirt, the one that is stained with
	the blood of the baby tyrannosaur.  The adult tyrannosaur
	GURGLES again, COOING and cocking its head curiously.

	In the sleeping bag, Sarah and Kelly's eyes are barely
	visible, wide in panic.  The rex sniffs and nudges the bag,
	trying to figure out what this thing is.

	It rolls the bag over once, decides it's uninteresting, and
	then rises, straights up --

	-- taking the whole tent with it!  The stakes pop out of the
	ground as the tent rises high up into the air and flutters
	away, leaving the sleeping bag fully exposed on the ground
	beneath it.

 IN THE CAMPSITE, 
	the SECOND TYRANNOSAUR now steps out of the jungle, joining
	the first.  Panic hits the camp as the sleeping HUNTERS wake
	up.  Many of them start to run.

	Roland scrambles toward his tent, where he can see his weapon
	lying near the open flap.  As he draws close, an enormous
	T-rex foot stomps down on the tent, driving the rifle deep
	into the mud.

	Roland, weaponless, stands frozen, watching as the panicked
	Hunters flee in all directions.

 ROLAND FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, DON'T RUN! 
	But they ignore him, sweeping him up in the wave of flushed
	prey that pours across the campsite.  Some toss random and
	ill-aimed GUNSHOTS back at the rexes.

 ACROSS THE CAMPSITE, 
	NICK bursts out of the crowd, sees Kelly and Sarah struggling
	to get out of the sleeping bag, and grabs each by an arm.  He
	rips them to their feet and sweeps them off ahead of him, into
	the jungle.

 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD, 
	MALCOLM, blinking back sleep, stands a good head above the
	rest of the panicking crowd.  Frantically, he scans the group.

 MALCOLM KELLY? KEEEEELLLY?! 
	But he can't see her.

 AT THE EDGE OF CAMP, 
	the two rexes join forces, herding the fleeing Hunters into a
	narrow ravine.

 UP ON A ROCK RACE, 
	Roland scrambles up a steep rock face.  No way in hell he's
	going down  that ravine.  He sees Malcolm, still in the middle
	of the camp, start to head for the ravine.

 ROLAND MALCOLM! OVER HERE! 
	Malcolm runs over and hurls himself at the rock face,
	scrambling to climb up the smooth, steep boulders.

	Behind him, one of the rexes spots him and lunges across the
	camp toward him.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
 FASTER!! 
	Malcolm gives it everything he's got, clawing his way up the
	rock face --

	-- and rex draws closer and pounces at his legs --

	-- and Roland reaches down, grabs Malcolm by the hair and
	pulls him up, out of the rex's grasp.

	The rex falls short, but he's close enough that we can hear
	his teeth SNAP together, closing around nothing but air.  It
	turns, sees easier prey in the fleeing Hunters, and takes off
	after them.

	Malcolm lands on top of the rock ledge with a CRUNCH.  Roland
	unceremoniously dumps a fistful of hair in his lap.

 IN THE RAVINE, 
	Kelly, in the middle of the fleeing crowd with Sarah and Nick,
	hears her father screaming her name and looks up.  Malcolm and
	Roland are on the rock ridge above them, keeping pace.

 MALCOLM 			(shouting)
 KELLY, UP HERE! 
	But Kelly continues to flee, as the rexes are in the ravine
	now, and drawing closer to the group.

	Some Hunters try to leap up and scale the rocks, but the
	ravine is deepening, there's no way out.  One rex grabs hold
	of a Hunter in its teeth and hurls him against the rock face.

	The second rex picks up another Hunter and snaps its massive
	head left and right quickly, to break its victim's neck.  The
	Hunter goes flying forward and crashes into --

	-- CARTER, Dieter's driver, who stumbles and falls.  The rest
	of the fleeing humans run around or over him, but when the
	rex lifts its foot, we see Carter is actually stuck to the
	bottom of it --

	-- and when the animal takes its next step it CRUSHES him into
	the earth.

 UP ON TH ROCK FACE, 
	Malcolm is frantic.

 MALCOLM 		I gotta get down there!

 DOWN IN THE RAVINE, 
	it's obvious no one is going to outrun the rexes, and Nick
	knows it.  He bursts ahead of Sarah and Kelly and spots
	something off to his left.

	It's a waterfall, apparently right in front of a sheer rock
	face.  But there's something about the way the water is
	falling that tells him something.

 NICK SARAH KELLY COME HERE! 
	He grabs each of them and hauls them forward, running straight
	at the waterfall.  Apparently, he intends to jump right into
	the rock, and he's dragging them along with him.

 SARAH WHAT ARE YOU- 
 NICK JUMP! 
	The three of them spring right at the waterfall and disappear
	THROUGH the water.

	DR. BURKE, fleeing along with everyone else, is watching as
	they vanish.

 BEHIND THE WATERFALL, 
	there is a small recess, which is what Nick had hoped for.
	It's small, only four or five feet deep, but it's just enough
	for him, Sarah, and Kelly to cover behind the flowing water.
	Breathless, terrified, they can hear the mayhem outside.

 NICK 		Shhhh... shhhh...

	With an enormous SPLASH, something bursts through the
	cascading water and crashes into them.

	Dr. Burke.

 BURKE 		Get out of the way!

	He pulls his way up against the far wall, as far away from the
	water as he can.

	FOOOOM!  Now another shape bursts through the watery curtain.

	A Tyrannosaur head.  Burke gave away the hiding spot.

	The four SCREAM as the rex's jaws SNAP left and right,
	searching for them, falling just inches short.  They squeeze
	as far back against the wall as they can get.

	The rex can't quite get its head all the way through the
	opening --

	-- so it uses its tongue.  A long, dark blue shape slithers
	out of its mouth and touches the humans, trying to wrap around
	them, to pull them out of the cave.

	Burke, blind with panic, forces himself even further into the
	cave, which pushes Kelly further out.

 SARAH STOP IT YOU'RE PUSHED HER OUT STOP IT! 
	But Burke doesn't listen, throwing elbows to make room for
	himself.  His movements dislodge a portion of muddy earth, and
	a flurry of enormous cockroaches, eight or nine inches long
	each, pour out of the wall and swarm over his face and neck.

	Burke SCREAMS and instinctively leaps away, toward the flowing
	water.

	And that's all the leverage the rex needs.  It curls its
	tongue, wrapping Burke up in it and pulling him between its
	teeth.  SCREAMING hideously, he is dragged out, through the
	waterfall, and disappears.

	Sarah, Nick, and Kelly stare in horror as the white screen of
	water turn pink.

 UP ON THE ROCK FACE, 
	Malcolm and Roland see the rex walk away from the waterfall
	with Burke, leaving the hiding place unmolested.  Malcolm is
	nearly hysterical.

 ROLAND 		She's okay!  They'll stay in there,
		she's okay!

 IN A JUNGLE CLEARING, 
	routed Hunters emerge from the gully at the edge of he
	jungle.  Ahead of them, there is a large open plain covered by
	long "elephant" grass.

	AJAY, running along with them, stops abruptly at the edge of
	the grass, SHOUTING to the others.

 AWAY NO! DON'T GO INTO THE LONG GRASS! 
	Not in the frenzy, they ignore him.  Behind Ajay, the enormous
	shadows of the two pursuing tyrannosaurs stop as well, holding
	up at the edge of the jungle.

	Ajay, torn between a sense of responsibility and his better
	judgement, opts for the former and races into the grass after
	the other Hunters, waving his arms.

 UP ABOVE THEM, 
	Roland and Malcolm come out onto a rocky ledge that has a view
	of the plain below.  Roland can see the Hunters leaving trails
	as they plow through the grass.

 ROLAND 		Elephant grass!

 ON THE PLAIN, 
	the groups of Hunters wades into the middle of the long grass.
	One of them stops and turns, looking back at the jungle trees.

 HUNTER 		They gave up!  They're not chasing
		us!

	There are CHEERS, SIGHS OF relief.  In the distance, AJAY'S
	VOICE can be heard, faintly calling to them to come back.  Up
	on the rock in the distance, they can see Roland, waving his
	arms madly.

	But in the giddiness of their escape, they pay it no mind.
	They continue plowing into the high grass, anything to get
	further away from the tyrannosaurs.

 ABOUT FIFTY YARDS AWAY, 
	the tops of three animal heads rise up slowly, backlit by
	the full moon.  In the distance, the heads can seethe Hunter
	party.  The heads descend, back into the grass.

 BACK WITH THE HUNTERS, 
	they continue forward, oblivious.  Now behind them, four
	more heads rise up in the grass.  As then descend.

	On all sides of the Hunters, the grass ripples as animals move
	forward toward them, undetected, inexorable as torpedoes.

	And these torpedoes are on target.  One Hunter is suddenly
	dragged down, yanked silently below the surface of the tall
	grass.

	In his place, a long, lizard-like tail rises up as the animal
	drops its head to make the kill.

	Behind him, two more Hunters are taken down, and two more
	animal tails rise up in their place.  A Hunter ahead hears the
	RUSTLING and turns.  His face turns white as, behind him --

	-- a VELOCIRAPTOR springs out of the grass.

	Velociraptor runs upright on its powerfully muscled hind legs,
	the second tow of each foot bearing an extra-large curved
	claw, carried in a retracted position, with which it slashes
	on attack.

	Like now.  This raptor SNARLS and SLAMS into the body of the
	Hunter, taking him down.  A feeding frenzy ensues.  The
	Hunters run in all directions, but are pulled down and vanish
	into the twitching long grass.

	Another raptor enters from the right, leaps high into the air,
	past the full moon, SLAMS into the chest of more human prey,
	and takes him down, into the grass.

	Behind them, Ajay's face falls, defeated.  He looks around,
	realizing he too is now stranded in the middle of the long
	grass.

	Around him, four torpedo trails head straight for him.

	Ajay simply closes his eyes.

 UP ON THE ROCK, 
	Roland turns away from the carnage, pained.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. RUINED CAMPSITE - NIGHT 
	SARAH, MALCOLM, KELLY, NICK, ROLAND, DR. JUTTSON, and PETER
	LUDLOW stand in the ruins of their campsite, their ranks
	decimated, spirits shattered.

	Roland is at the hole in the ground where his tent once was.
	He has pulled his .800 Nitro Express from the mud and more or
	less cleaned it, now he's checking the loads.

	Kelly, nearly catatonic with fear, clings to Sarah, and it
	doesn't look as if she'll ever let go.  Malcolm, who is on his
	knees picking through the wreckage of a tent, looks over at
	them, but Sarah waves him off -- "she's okay."

	Roland appears, standing over the group.  He looks at Malcolm,
	who has found the Lindstradt rifle, intact.

 ROLAND 		How many rounds did you find for that
		weapon?

 MALCOLM 		Four, counting the one in the
		chamber.

 ROLAND 		Don't let it out of your hands again.
			(to Sara, but looking at
			 Kelly)
		Can the kid walk?

 SARAH 		Ask her.

 ROLAND 		Can the kid walk?

 KELLY 		I can.  I can walk.

	While he addresses the group, Roland straps on one of the
	servo-lights, the shoulder-mounted flashlights that follow
	your gaze.

 ROLAND 		We're going to find a path down into
		the interior of the island.  Load up
		whatever you think you need, and I
		mean need.  If you can't carry it
		indefinitely, don't bring it.  We'll
		hit the worker village in a couple
		hours and be out of here before dawn.

 AT THE EDGE OF CAMP, 
	Roland bends over one of the three-toed footprints left by the
	rex.  Behind him, the rest of the group is packing up,
	slinging the remnants of their equipment over their shoulders.

	Roland bends over and SNIFFS the footprint.  It's filled with
	a liquid of some kind.

	He takes his canteen, dumps the remaining water into the
	ground, and plunges the canteen into the footprint, filling
	it.  Ludlow hovers over his shoulder.

 LUDLOW 		What is that?

 ROLAND 		Piss.

	Ludlow doesn't ask.

 NOW AT THE FIRE, 
	Roland stares down at the ashes of the cooking fire that led
	to such disaster.  He grabs a handful of the ash and shoves it
	in his pants pocket.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT 
	ROLAND and LUDLOW (who, along with Sarah and Malcolm, is also
	wearing a servo-light now) maneuver down a rugged hillside and
	come out in a flattened area.  Ludlow GASPS, looking ahead in
	wonderment.  MALCOLM breaks through the hillside's foliage a
	moment later.  He too stares in amazement.

	SARAH and KELLY come next, then NICK, then JUTTSON.  One by
	one, they all stop and stare.

 SARAH 		God help us.

	They're standing in a flat, sandy area lined with boulders at
	the sides.  The flat area stretches fifty yards from side to
	side and as far as they can see ahead.  But that's not what
	amazes them so.

	Everywhere, the sand is dotted with dinosaur skeletons.  Some
	are huge, apatosaurs, sixty feet from head to tail tip.
	Others are smaller, herbivores of many different kinds.  The
	more intact skeletons lie on their sides, their ribcages arcs
	of pale bone.  but just as many have been ripped apart, bits
	of carcass tossed in every direction.

 NICK 		I do not feel lucky.

 ROLAND 		Keep moving.

	They march on, tiny figures moving among the mountainous
	skeletons by the light of the full moon.  Roland notices one
	carcass in particular, a recent kill.  It's an enormous
	HADROSAUR with fresh bites taken out of it.

	He bends down, studying the soft earth around it for
	footprints.

 FURTHER ON, 
	Malcolm looks up, noticing the bony shapes around them, which
	fall in heavy shadows like cell bars, seem to be changing.

	He turns, and his servo-light shines on the bones.  But
	they're not bones any more at all, they're pipes, the animal
	graveyard now given over to the lifeless skeletons of manmade
	objects -- twisted, rotting machinery.

 LUDLOW 		We made it!

	They hurry over a small rise --

 EXT. WORKER VILLAGE - NIGHT 
	-- and find themselves at the edge of what was once Isla
	Sorna's worker village.  The size of a football field, the
	town is divided by a main street that's dotted on both sides
	by stores, residences, cafes, a gas station.  All the way at
	the far end is a large, blocky, four-story building.

	But the town is a mess.  The hurricane that hit here must have
	been ferocious, for everywhere things are smashed, broken,
	upended.  And the jungle has stepped into the breath, growing
	up, around, and over everything.  Huge root systems snake
	through the street, making it almost impassable.

 MALCOLM 		The jungle.  It's always ready to
		return.

	Roland catches up and looks at Ludlow.

 ROLAND 		Where's the power and radio setup?

 LUDLOW 		Operations building.  Far end of the
		street.

	A light rain falls as they start down the street, carefully,
	silently, Roland and Malcolm with their weapons at the ready.

	They pass the skeleton of a fallen water tower.  An empty gas
	station, its vine-snarled pumps now useless.  The only sound
	is the low mechanical HUM of the servo-lights as they follow
	the group's gazes obediently.

	Every few feet, the group encounters strange, grayish lumps
	that lies in random places in the middle of the street.
	Malcolm, curious, stops and taps one of them.  It's a rock-hard.
	Nick looks over his shoulder.

 NICK 		Lava?

 MALCOLM 		No.

 NICK 		What are they?

 MALCOLM 		I don't know.

	Finally, they reach the operation building, at the far end of
	the town.

 LUDLOW 		The radio rig is inside.  It runs
		directly from the geothermal
		generator, so power shouldn't be a
		problem.

 ROLAND 		Good.

	He pulls out his canteen.  Ludlow watches as he screws the top
	off, moves toward the building, and starts splashing the
	contents on the outside of it.

	The rest of the group just stares at him.

 MALCOLM 		What's he got in there?

 LUDLOW 		Piss.

 SARAH 		What?

 LUDLOW 		Don't ask me.  The guy's completely
		out to lunch.

 NICK 		What in God's name would he want
		with-

	Roland rejoins them.

 ROLAND 		Tyrannosaur urine.  I don't want
		anything to do with it, and neither
		does any other animal on this island.
		This building is now demarcated as
		the rex's territory.  As long as you 
		stay in that building, you'll all be
		safe until the helicopter comes.

	He drops his pack, swings his gun off his shoulder, and checks
	the load.  Dr. Juttson looks fearful.

 JUTTSON 		Where are you going?

 ROLAND 		After the rex.  I saw a fresh kill
		back in the valley with tyrannosaur
		tracks all around it.  If I'm not
		back in time, don't wait for me.

 SARAH 		You've got to be kidding.

 ROLAND 		Runs against my nature to hole up in
		a cave and wait.

 LUDLOW 		Do you think the rex might have the
		infant with it?

 ROLAND 		Possible.

	Ludlow takes off his hat and turns to Nick.

 LUDLOW 		You know how to work a radio, don't
		you?

 SARAH 		You're going too?

 LUDLOW 		I lost everything I came after on
		this trip, but one T-rex in one theme
		park could single-handedly bail
		InGen out of Chapter 11.

	He takes a slip of paper from the brim of his hat and hands it
	to Nick.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		This is the broadcast frequency.  ID
		yourself as "Harvest Leader."  You
		know what to tell 'em.

 MALCOLM 		You gentlemen feel you have to do
		this now?

 ROLAND 		Now's the perfect time.  The animal
		just fed, so it won't stalk us for
		food.  Predators don't hurt when
		they're not hungry.

	Ludlow double checks the clip on his semi-automatic rifle --

 NICK 		No.

	-- and SMACKS it back into the belly of the gun.

				NICK (cont'd)
		Only humans do.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT 
	The console of a sophisticated radio set-up glows brightly,
	all green, red, and yellow.  NICK tunes the dial to a specific
	frequency.  The radio WHINES and HISSES tuning in.

 NICK 			(into microphone)
		CQ, CQ.  This is InGen Operation
		Harvest Leader to Harvest Base.  Come
		in, please.

	The remaining SURVIVORS, minus Ludlow and Roland, shine their
	flashlights around the dusty, vine-hung interior of the
	communications room.  On the wall a row of chrome letters says
	"We Make The Future,"  but the words are obscured by a tangle
	of vines.  Mushrooms and fungi sprout from the carpet.

	On one wall, there is a mural of what the completed Jurassic
	Park would have looked like.  Big hotels, Ford Explorers with
	tourists leaning out the windows taking pictures, big crowds
	at the fences around the animal exhibits.  But none of it came
	true, and now even the mural is runny and dust-covered.

	There is a pause, filed only with radio static.  Sarah looks
	at Nick tensely, waiting.  Finally, a VOICE comes over the
	radio, clean as can be.

				VOICE (o.s.)
		Go ahead, Harvest Leader.

	They all breath a sign of relief.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	With Roland and Ludlow gone on the hunt and the rest of the
	group inside the operations building, main street stands
	deserted and silent.

	Nearly deserted, anyway.  Moonlight shadows lengthen at one
	end of the street --

	-- and FIVE VELOCIRAPTORS STROLL INTO TOWN.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT 
	ROLAND AND LUDLOW are back in the valley of death, standing
	amid the giant skeletons of long-dead animals.  Roland bends
	down, checking the carcass of the freshly-chewed HADROSAUR he
	saw earlier.

	A set of giant three-toed rex tracks leads away from the
	carcass, down the stream bed.  Roland follows them.  Ludlow
	follows Roland.

	As they near a bend in the stream, Roland looks down, at the
	surface of the water.  A pattern of ripples moves toward them,
	washing over their ankles.  Roland follows the ripples with
	his eyes.  From up head, around the bend, he can hear the
	sound of an animal eating and drinking.  A very large animal.

	He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a  pinch of the ashes
	from the cooking fire that he scooped up earlier and releases
	that on the wind.  They float there for a second, suspended,
	then blow back at him.

 LUDLOW 		We're downwind.  Good.

	Roland darts a contemptuous look at him.  He puts a finger to
	his lips, gesturing for silence, then steps up, onto the
	shore.  Ludlow follows.

	They creep forward, toward the sounds.  They round the bend
	and Roland hits his belly, edging up over a small rise.

	Over the rise, he sees the TYRANNOSAUR, about a hundred yards
	ahead.  It's stooped over the stream bed, drinking.  Like a
	bird, it dips its head in the water and then straightens up,
	to let the water fall down its throat.  A dozen COMPYS are at
	the water as well, drinking.

	Roland gently FLICKS the safety on his gun to "off."

	Ludlow edges toward the cover of a low-hanging branch.  As he
	puts his weight on one knee, it presses down hard on the
	middle of a small stick, which CRACKS in half.  Roland turns,
	eyes blazing.

	Out in the open, the tyrannosaur snaps its head sharply as
	well, staring in the direction of the sound.  But since
	Roland's own head is turned, he doesn't see the dinosaur's
	reaction.  Roland holds a warning finger out to Ludlow.

	Roland turns his head back.  The tyrannosaur is gone.

 FURTHER ON, 
	the trail of three-toed tyrannosaur footprints stops abruptly.
	Roland stops too, gesturing for Ludlow to freeze behind him.
	Roland glances both ways, looking for any sign of the track.

	To the right, the ground gives way to hard black volcanic rock.
	A short distance behind them, the rock is solid, a massive,
	green, pebbled boulder ten feet high.  Roland frowns and
	WHISPERS in Ludlow's ear again.

 ROLAND 		We took to the rock.

 LUDLOW 		Why?

	In front of Roland, a palm frond sways gently in the night
	breeze.  Roland's eyes widen.  He pulls out another pinch of
	campfire ash and releases it on the wind.

	This time, the ash blows off, straight away from him.

 ROLAND 		Wind shift.

	They freeze, terrified.  Behind them, the enormous green
	pebbled boulder --

	-- opens an eye.

	That's no boulder, that's the MALE TYRANNOSAUR, standing
	rock-solid still, its natural camouflage blending into the
	surrounding foliage perfectly.  Very slowly and almost
	silently, the rex brings its head all the way around until it
	is staring directly down at them from about ten feet away.

	Roland and Ludlow stand frozen, their back to the rex,
	unaware of its presence.

	Until it exhales.  The soft SNORT of its breath isn't quite
	audible, but it brushes the hair on the backs of their necks
	ever so slightly.

	Their hearts drop into their stomachs.  Ludlow speaks, his
	voice a queasy HISS.

 LUDLOW 		It's... behind... us.

 ROLAND 			(the very softest whisper)
		It's just fed.  It won't attack unless
		it's threatened.  Don't move.

	As the rex silently cocks its head, sizing up the danger from
	these intruders, it breathes again.  A few strands of Ludlow's
	hair flap in the exhalation.  He closes his eyes, near tears.

	He can't take it.  His eyes dart, glancing down at the weapon
	he holds in his hands.  Unfortunately, it's extended in front
	of him, away from the rex.

	He risks another HISS.

 LUDLOW 		If I don't move, I can't shoot it.

 ROLAND 		Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.

	Behind them, the rex appears satisfied.  It starts to swing
	its massive head around, back toward the jungle.  It lifts one
	great leg and takes a step into the trees.

	Roland signs and closes his eyes, relieved.

	But Ludlow seizes the opportunity.  He whips his weapon around
	and drops to one knee.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
 NO! 
	The rex is infinitely quicker.  Ludlow just has time to
	squeeze off a short burst of semi-automatic gunfire when the
	animal whirls, takes one elegant step forward, and POUNCES.

	Ludlow's bullets rip harmlessly through the foliage between
	the rex's legs as its big head snaps forward and comes down,
	jaws wide.  They close around Ludlow's body, lift his straight
	up into the air, and toss him once, readjusting their grip so
	it is firmly around his midsection.

	The whole combination of movements takes but half a second.
	By the time Roland turns around, the animal has pivoted and
	darted back into the jungle, carrying Ludlow, still SCREAMING
	and writhing in its mouth.

	Roland raises his gun, to draw a bead on the animal, but
	through the shivering trees, he can only see that the
	tyrannosaur is gone.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM SARAH, NICK, KELLY, and DR. JUTTSON wait nervously in
	the communications room.  An empty can of Dr. Pepper sitting
	on one of the countertops begins to RATTLE.  They look over at
	it, confused, as the lightweight aluminum can CHATTERS on the
	formica counter.

	Other objects in the lab begin to rattle too.  Glass jars
	CLANK against one another, books start to drop off the
	shelves, a stool shudders across the floor.

 KELLY 		What's going on?!

	Above them, the rotting wooden roof of the building starts to
	actually tear away, chunks of moldy timber flying up into
	the night.  They look up, a deafening ROAR fills the room --

	-- and a helicopter's searchlight floods in!

	As the chopper dips lower, looking for a place to land, the
	violent prop wash rips away huge chunks of the roof over their
	heads.

 INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT 
	Up above the operations building, the helicopter circles.  The
	roof of the building is all arches and rotten timber,
	impossible to land open.

	Below, the PILOTS see the SURVIVORS through the torn roof of
	the building.  They wave frantically, their flashlight beams
	piercing the night sky.

 PILOT 		There they are!

	The Co-Pilot scans the street below, but it's choked with
	overturned cars and fallen trees.

 CO-PILOT 		No LZ in the street, too much debris!

 PILOT 		Check the other buildings!

	The Co-Pilot nods and they peel off, swooping over the rest of
	the village.

	At the far end of the street, the Co-Pilot brings the
	searchlight to bear on the large, flat roof of a three story
	building.

	The Pilot gives him a thumbs-up.

 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM, SARAH, KELLY, NICK and finally DR. JUTTSON run out
	the front of the operations building.  At the end of the
	street, they can see the helicopter as it descends slowly over
	the building, to land on its roof.

 MALCOLM 		There it is!

	Happily, the group double-times it down the street, headed for
	the chopper.  Again, those strange rock formations are
	everywhere.  Some seem to be on the sides of buildings, as if
	they once dripped there and then turned to stone.

	This time Sarah pauses at one that is dripping over to the side
	of a car like solidified lava.  Her face falls as a thought
	occurs to her.

 SARAH 		Ian.  It's guano.

 MALCOLM 		What?

 SARAH 		These formations.  They're dried --

 MALCOLM 		Birdshit?

	A VELOCIRAPTORS jumps onto a fallen tree trunk behind them.

	They don't see it.

 NICK 		Who cares?  Let's go!

	Unaware of the raptor's presence, they resume their trot
	toward the helicopter.  Behind them, the raptor crouches and
	SNARLS, but the sound is lost under the WHINE of the
	helicopter's engines.  It springs, covering the distance
	between them quickly.

	The animal SLAMS into JUTTSON, the last person in the group,
	and takes him down.  Juttson is thrown forward, into the
	others, who fall like dominoes.

	Juttson SCREAMS, his voice an unnatural, high-pitched SQUEAL,
	as the raptor flips him over and lowers its jaws into him.

	Sarah looks up, panicked.  Her eyes widen at the sight of a
	SECOND RAPTOR, this one running straight at hr at top speed.
	She buries her face in the dirt, covering her head with her
	hands --

	-- and the raptor's foot SLAMS into the ground between her
	legs as it bounds over her and dives onto Juttson, joining the
	first raptor in the kill.

	Panicked, the group scatters in all directions.  Kelly jumps
	up and scrambles into the middle of the street, where she hits
	the dirt and crawls under a fallen shed in the middle of the
	road.

	Malcolm rolls over to the space where Kelly was, but she's
	gone now.  He looks around frantically.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly?!  KELLY?!

	Sarah rolls onto her feet and sprints toward the building
	nearest her.

	Behind her, a THIRD RAPTOR gives chase, bounding after her
	with horrifying speed.  Sarah runs flat-out, but her speed is
	nothing compared to the raptor's, and it gains on her rapidly.

	The walls of a structure of some kind close in around Sarah,
	and as she leaps across a leather seat and SLAMS a door behind
	her, we realize she's crawled into the back seat of an
	abandoned car.

	But the car door is thin protection against the charging
	raptor, which SLAMS into the window, head first.  The window
	spinderwebs, but does not yield.  The raptor crumples to the
	ground.

	Sarah looks up, through a three inch hole in the middle of the
	web.  The raptor leaps back to its feet and plunges its nose
	into the tiny hole, thrashing, widening it.

	Sarah SCREAMS and the animal forces its entire head through
	the hole, SNAPPING its jaws just short of her face.

	She hurls herself over the seat and into the front as the
	animal penetrates even further into the car, but its torso
	will not fit through the window opening.  It pulls away.

	In the front seat, Sarah gets some very bad news.

	There's no windshield.

	The raptor springs up onto the hood, its claws CLATTERING on
	the sheet metal, and tosses its body through the opening --

	-- just as Sarah hurls herself out the door.  While the raptor
	struggles to right itself in the front seat, Sarah runs to the
	nearest building, ducks inside, and SLAMS the heavy wooden
	door.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM races between the idled gas pumps and into the gas
	station building, closing the door behind him.  A moment
	later, a raptor bounds after him, SLAMMING into the door.

	Meeting resistance, it bounces off, notices the plate glass
	window next to the door, and pounces at that.  The window
	SHATTERS and the raptor clings to the ledge, staring inside,
	its tail hanging out.

	Just as it gets inside, Malcolm opens the door and comes back
	out, keeping the place of wall between them.  He pulls the
	Lindstradt rifle off his back and tries to take aim --

	-- but the raptor whirls and springs, forcing him back inside,
	through the door again.

	Willing to play along, the raptor turns and jumps through the
	window again.

 INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	Balancing on the window frame, the raptor HISSES and crouches,
	ready to spring at Malcolm.

	Malcolm takes cover behind the door, which is hanging open
	between them.  He raises the rifle.

	Th raptor springs into the door, BLASTING it off its hinges,
	knocking Malcolm right through a window behind him.

	But the door SMACKS up against the wall, covering the window,
	preventing the raptor from following Malcolm out that way.

	For the moment.

 EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	Malcolm flies through the window and CRUNCHES to the ground.
	He GROANS  in agony and rolls off his bad leg, which is twisted
	unnaturally beneath him, and claws in the mud for the gun.

	ROUGH HANDS reach down, grab him by the shirt, and haul him to
	his feet.  It's NICK.  He drags Malcolm away, but in the
	commotion Nick's duffel slips off his shoulder and lands in
	the street, spilling some of the precious videotapes.

	Malcolm scoops them up.

 NICK 		Come on!

 MALCOLM 		Where's Kelly?

 NICK 		She's with Sarah!

	They race off, down the street.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. KILN HOUSE - NIGHT 
	High above SARAH, we see she is standing alone in a three
	story kiln house, a windowless shed used for firing pottery
	and other construction projects.  Catwalks lined with heavy
	chains hang above her, and onto the floor below, she turns in
	circles, wondering what to do now.

	From outside the kiln house, she hears SCRATCHING, digging
	sounds.  From the other side of the door comes an animal
	SNORT, and a small puff of dust and dirt billows up through
	the crack along the ground.

 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, 
	the claws of one of the raptors dig furiously, trying to
	tunnel underneath.

 INSIDE, 
	Sarah runs to the opposite wall, falls to her knees, and
	starts digging a tunnel of her own, clawing frantically at the
	ganging tools always and CLANKS as it tears at the earth below
	it.

	Sarah digs faster.  So does the raptor.

	With about eight inches of space under the wall, Sarah grabs
	hold of the bottom of one of the plans and pries it up as
	hard as she can.  It snaps off with a loud CRACK.

	At the door, the raptor stops digging.  It's silent for a
	moment.

	Sarah has a good foot and a half of space under her wall now.
	She starts to lower her body into it --

 -- JUST AS THE RAPTOR'S CLAWS FLASH THROUGH FROM THE OTHER SIDE! 
	Sarah falls back, SCREAMING, leaps to her feet, and jumps up,
	grabbing hold of one of the catwalks above.  She starts to
	climb, up, anywhere up, as the RAPTOR now squirms and thrashes
	its way inside, coming in through her hole.

	Sarah climbs, hauling herself up, leaping from one catwalk to
	another.

	The raptor leaps up onto a catwalk as well and follows her.

 EXT. KILM HOUSE - NIGHT 
	A window in the slanted roof of the kiln house EXPLODES in a
	shower of glass as SARAH kicks through it and climbs outside.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	Nick drags a badly limping MALCOLM down the main street.  They
	can see helicopter at the far end, engine ROARING and
	searchlight playing over them as they draw closer.  They
	approach a rusted, abandoned pickup in the middle of the
	street --

	-- and a RAPTOR leaps on top of it.  Its claws CLACK on the
	roof as it goes into its pre-attack crouch.

	They don't stick around to negotiate.  Nick hauls Malcolm off
	into the nearest building.

 INT. WORKER HOTEL - NIGHT 
	NICK and MALCOLM hurry inside and SLAM the door behind them.
	They're standing in the lobby of a hotel of some kind,
	probably used for overnight guests and day workers who had to
	spend the night.  The room and staircase wind around a large,
	open-aired central area four stories tall.  They SHOUT at each
	other, frantic.

 MALCOLM 		We can't stay in here!

 NICK 		We're sure as hell not going back out
		there"

 MALCOLM 		This is single-wall construction!
		It's just a shack!

 NICK 		It'll hold!

 MALCOLM 		For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at
		this!
			(RAPS on the door with his
			 knuckles)
		You could-

	With a CRASH, the wood SPRINTERS around the lock and the door
	swings open violently.  Malcolm is thrown aside, landing hard
	on the floor.

	A VELOCIRAPTOR stands HISSING in the doorway.  Nick throws his
	weight against the door.  SLAMMING it hard against the raptor.

	Malcolm rolls over and paws the gun off his back.

	SLAM!  The raptor charges the door again, this time BLASTING
	it off its hinges, knocking Nick to the floor beneath it.  The
	raptor turns and SNARLS at Malcolm.

	Malcolm swings the gun around --

	-- the raptor lunges at him --

	-- Malcolm's finger closes on the trigger --

	-- and the raptor lands on top of him.

	The weight of the animal CRUSHES him into the floor, but the
	gun barrel now stands between them.  The raptor CHOMPS down
	hard on the barrel, its teeth GRINDING on the metal, and SNAPS
	its head, to tear it from Malcolm's hands.

	Malcolm pulls the trigger.

	The raptor's eyes pop wide as the dart SLAMS into the back of
	its throat.  It makes a GURGLING sound, then convulses
	violently and rolls off of Malcolm, yanking the gun from his
	hands as it falls and dies.

	Nick scrambles out from under the door.  Malcolm tries to
	wrench the gun from the raptor's clenched jaws, but it won't
	budge.

 NICK 			(helping him out)
		Head for the roof!

 MALCOLM 		I have to find Kelly!

 NICK 		I think she's with Sarah!

 MALCOLM DAMN IT, BE SURE!! 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	KELLY remains huddled under the fallen shed, trembling with
	fear.  She holds her breath and freezes, as just outside, only
	two feet from where she's hiding --

	-- a RAPTOR'S FEET pick their way past her, down the middle of
	the street.

	Kelly closes her eyes and suppresses a scream.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
	NICK and MALCOLM burst onto the roof of the now-burning
	hotel and SLAM the door behind them.  The helicopter is now
	only three rooftops away.  They turn and head for it, Nick in
	the lead, but there's an eight foot gap between the buildings.

 MALCOLM 		It's too wide!

	Nick looks around, desperate.  A fallen power pole leans
	against the building they're standing on, its lines gone
	slack.

 NICK 		Help me push this!

	Malcolm understands.  He and Nick throw a shoulder into the
	pole and give it a mighty push, tipping it over in the other
	direction.  One good hard shove and it falls to the far
	building, THUDDING against it solidly.

	Its power lines are not taut, a lifeline from this rooftop to
	the next.  Nick grabs hold and starts to pull himself across
	the gap, hand over hand.

	Behind them, the door of the building SPLINTERS and CRASHES
	open as a raptor throws all its weight into it.  Malcolm leaps
	onto the power line without hesitation and starts pulling
	himself across.

	But even with the door wide open, the raptor on the other side
	hesitates.  It SNARLS and backs away, refusing to come out
	onto the roof.

 ON THE OTHER ROOFTOP, 
	Malcolm lands next to Nick on the second rooftop.  They look
	back at the frightened animal, which takes tow steps out onto
	the roof, SNARLS, and backs into the doorway again.

 NICK 		It's afraid to come onto the roof!

	Malcolm looks around, at the rooftop.  Strange bits of scrap
	and debris seem to have been arranged there, in an odd,
	concentric pattern.

 MALCOLM 		Something's wrong.

 NICK 		Look!  Sarah!

	He points to the roof of the kilm house, in the distance.
	Malcolm turns, and sees SARAH crawling across the tile.  His
	face turns white.

 MALCOLM SHE'S ALONE!! 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. KILM HOUSE ROOF - NIGHT 
	SARAH has problems.  Still on top of the kilm house, she
	reaches the edge and pushes off the roof, leaping to the roof
	of the next building.

	She lands at the peak of the intersection of the two sides of
	sloping roof.  As she pulls herself up --

	-- a RAPTOR appears on the rooftop behind her.  In full
	stride, it leaps, sails over her, and lands on the roof
	ahead of her.

	Sarah swings to her left and starts to crawl down the slope,
	away from the raptor.  Suddenly the roof board under her
	SPRINTERS and CRACKS under her weight.  The whole section
	pulls up and starts to slide off the roof.  Sarah, clinging to
	it, rides the roof  planks down, away from the raptor.

	She looks over her shoulder, down --

	-- and sees ANOTHER RAPTOR, waiting for her on the roof of the
	building below.

	Sarah quickly rolls off the sliding section of roof, which
	keeps sliding, falling.  The raptor below jumps up, just in
	time to get WHACKED in the head by the falling roof section.

	Sarah tries to cling to the Spanish tile roof, fingers and
	nails slipping on the slick ceramic surface.  She slides all
	the way to the edge, grabs hold of the gutter, and dangles
	there, suspended above one raptor and trapped below another.

	The raptor above works its way down.  The one below leaps up,
	at her dangling legs.  She has left them in time with its
	jumps, to avoid losing her feet.  This can't go on for long.

	Desperate, she pulls one of the Spanish tiles up from the roof
	and hurls it at the raptor below.  It hits the animal in the
	head, for all the good that does.

	But Sarah keeps on, pulling and throwing more tiles.  She
	edges to the right, toward a fresh supply.

	The raptor above edges even closer, claws CLICKING on the
	slick roof.

	Something interesting is happening.  As Sarah pulls the loose
	tiles free, the ones above slide down, to take their place.
	Sarah sees this and pulls more free, knocking them out of the
	way as fast as she can.

	Suddenly an avalanche of loose tiles breaks loose and the
	footing underneath the raptor above disintegrates.  The
	animal's feet flail and grasp, it slides towards the edge amid
	the tumbling tiles.

	Sarah, seeing it coming, swings in close to the building,
	hugging it as closely as she can.  The raptor falls off the
	roof, right past her --

	-- and CRUNCHES into the raptor below.  Both animals SNARK and
	attack one another.

	Now Sarah, her grip exhausted, falls too, landing right next
	to the enraged animals.  They fight and roll, RIGHT OVER HER.
	She GROANS and hugs the wood below her, the raptors continue
	to thrash and bite, they roll back, toward her, she rolls out
	of their way --

	-- and plunges through a hole in the roof.

 INT. LAB - NIGHT 
	Sarah falls through the roof of a deserted laboratory and
	lands in the tray of an old-fashioned hanging fluorescent
	light fixture.

	One end of the fixture's support SNAPS, it drops at a 45
	degree angle, Sarah slides out the other end and CRASHES
	through a window.

 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
	Sarah lands in the mud in the street below.

 CUT TO: 
EXT. BETWEEN TWO BUILDING - NIGHT 
	With a THUD, MALCOLM lands in the mud between two other
	building, one of which he has just climbed off of.  Panicked,
	he leaps to his feet and starts to SHOUT.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly!  KELLY!

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	SARAH sprints down the main street as fast as she can, toward
	the building on which sits the helicopter.  Above her, she can
	see NICK has now reached the helicopter and is waving to her.

	Sarah reaches the fallen water tower, which is next to the
	helicopter building, and starts to climb it.

 ELSEWHERE IN THE STREET, 
	KELLY is still covering underneath the fallen shed.  In the
	distance, she can see the helicopter.  But she is trembling
	with fear, unable to move.

	The whole shed suddenly RATTLES as something heavy hits it
	outside.  Kelly's mouth drops open to scream, but her terror
	is so complex that no sound comes out.  She raises her hands
	in self-defense, whatever's outside ROARS with effort, the
	entire shed is suddenly RIPPED right up off of her, and she
	looks up --

	-- into her father's eyes.

 KELLY 		Dad!

 MALCOLM 		Come on!

	He grabs her by the hand and they take off down the street.

 ON THE ROOFTOP, 
	Sarah emerges at the top of the water tower structure and
	leaps onto the roof, into Nick's arms.

 NICK 		Where's Kelly?

 SARAH 		Where's Ian?

	Eyes wide with panic, they both turn and look down at the
	street below, where they see KELLY and MALCOLM, racing at top
	speed down the middle of the street --

 -- WITH A VELOCIRAPTOR CHASING THEM. 
 DOWN IN THE STREET, 
	Malcolm and Kelly have a twenty yard advantage on the animal.
	They're pretty fast, but it's faster.

	Above them, Nick and Sarah are at the edge of the roof,
	SHOUTING and urging them on.  They push it, faster.

	They reach the base of the fallen water tower, the jumble of
	struts and metal poles that Sarah climbed.

 MALCOLM CLIMB! 
	Kelly leaps ahead of him and grabs hold of one of the poles,
	pulling herself neatly up to her feet and reaching for the
	next one.

	Malcolm stretches and makes the same effort, but for him it's
	much harder.

	Below them, the raptor springs and SLAMS into the struts,
	shaking the whole structure.  It pulls itself up.

	Higher up, Kelly climbs fast, hands gliding over the poles.
	She breaks out into the open, where a long, narrow pole runs
	on a slight incline up to the roof.  She scampers across it,
	running the balance beam.

	She reaches the other side, on a ledge below the roofline, and
	looks back.  Malcolm is at the other end, hesitating, drained,
	breathing hard.

 KELLY DAD, COME ON! 
	Below him, the raptor closes in.  Malcolm sets out across the
	beam, his legs shaking.  He places his feet carefully, he
	doesn't have nearly the balance Kelly did.

	The raptor draws closer.

				KELLY (cont'd)
 FASTER! 
	Malcolm slips.

	One foot twists right off the bar and he spins, arms flailing,
	trying to regain his tenuous balance.

	But he overcompensates and his whole body, wrenches out from
	under him.  He falls, the bar SMACKS him hard in the chest,
	knocking the wind out of him, and he drops, flipping right off
	the bar and bouncing painfully through the maze of bars below.

	He drops right past the pursuing velociraptor, CRUNCHING to
	a halt in a nest of bars ten feet off the ground, probably
	cracking a rib.  Kelly SCREAMS from above him.

				KELLY (cont'd)
 DAD! 
	She stares down in horror at her father.  Wrenched in among
	the bars, Malcolm is helpless as the animal crouches only six
	feet above him now, with an open attack route.

	The animal SNARKS and goes into its pre-attack crouch.

	Up above, Kelly wipes the palms of her hands on her jeans
	and leaps out into space, grabbing hold of one of the bars.

	The raptor springs.

	Kelly spins around, over the top of the bar, and, at the very
	peak of her trajectory, she lets go.

	The raptor sails through down from above, feet first, SLAMMING
	both of them squarely into the raptor's side, sending it
	hurtling into space.

	She lands hard and awkwardly, CLANGING into the spidery
	scaffolding next to Malcolm as the raptor SMASHES to the
	ground below.  But Kelly manages to hold on.

 KELLY GET UP! 
	She grabs hold of Malcolm and pulls him to his feet.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	Kelly and Malcolm appear over the roofline.  The PILOTS SHOUTS
	from inside.

 PILOT LET'S GO LET'S GO LET'S GO!! 
	Malcolm and Kelly scramble toward the helicopter.  But at the
	opposite side of the roof, a RAPTOR claws its way over the
	edge as well.

	Malcolm sees it and they lunge for the helicopter, but the
	animal is far faster.  It's only ten feet away, then five,
	they're surely done for this time, when --

 -- KA-BOOM! 
	There comes the loudest single gunshot anyone has ever heard,
	and the raptor flies off its feet and lands ten feet across
	the roof, dead.  They look up, to the source of the
	gunshot.

	It's ROLAND, standing at the edge of the roof, holding his
	smoking .600 Nitro Express.

	But there's no time for celebration, as suddenly the
	helicopter's left skid CRACKS right through the surface of the
	roof.

 PILOT HURRY! THE ROOF'S GIVING WAY! 
	The skid dips even further, ripping right through the
	thatch-and-wood construction.  Kelly, who had one foot in the
	helicopter, loses her balance --

	-- as the roof caves in beneath her.

 MALCOLM KELLY! 
	She falls,  SCREAMING, through the hole and down, into the
	building below.

 ONE FLOOR DOWN, 
	Kelly lands with a CRUNCH on the floor immediately below the
	roof, about nine feet down.  But her landing is cushioned by
	an inordinate amount of straw and leaves that have been
	arranged there.  She lifts one hand, and a yellowy, viscous
	substance drips off of it.

	It's yolk.  She looks around, noticing half a dozen large,
	oblong shapes.  Eggs.

	Above her, Malcolm is scrambling, climbing down to her through
	the wreckage of the CREAKING, crumbling roof.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly!  I'm coming!

	Kelly climbs to her knees, but behind her, a large, dark shape
	is moving.  Rising.  Unfolding, in a way.

 IT'S A PTERANODON. 
	Yep, flying dinosaur.  The enormous animal raises its head, a
	brilliant blue crest extending two feet behind its long,
	saber-like beak.  It SQUAWKS at Kelly in fury.  She can only
	stare, spellbound.

	Malcolm reaches her and grabs hold as the angry animal unfurls
	its massive twenty-two foot wingspread.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	the helicopter lurches as it sinks further into the crumbling
	roof, and now the skids are getting tangled in the debris.
	Roland races over to the hole, climbs in a few feet, and
	starts kicking at it, making it larger.

 ROLAND 		Give me a ladder!

 IN THE PTERANODON NEST, 
	Malcolm tries to haul Kelly back up the way he came, but a
	SECOND PTERANODON now appears from the depths of the building,
	SCREECHING in fury at these invaders who have landed in the
	middle of their clutch of eggs.

	An emergency rescue ladder drops through the hole in the roof.
	Malcolm grabs Kelly with one arm and the ladder with the other
	and they start to climb out of the nest.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	Malcolm and Kelly climb the ladder and are pulled into the
	belly of the chopper just as two enormous beaks break
	through the surface of the roof around them.

	The pteranodons are emerging.

 MALCOLM GO GO GO GO GOG GO! 
	The helicopter lurches up a few feet, but it yanked to an
	abrupt stop.  The engines WHINE, the chopper just hovers
	there.

 PILOT 		We're snagged on something!

	They loos down. BOTH PTERANODONS have come out through the
	hole in the roof and are clinging to the skids of the
	helicopter.  They flap their gigantic wings in unison, and
	drag the helicopter off, into the air, away from the nest --

	-- and let go.  Freed, the helicopter gains altitude quickly.

 IN THE HELICOPTER, 
	the PILOTS gape as the pteranodons coast along, right next to
	the helicopter.

 PILOT 		Hang on!  If I tip it hard, I can cut
		'em with the rotors!

 SARAH 		NO!  Don't!  They're not attacking!

	They look out the windows, where, indeed, the magnificent
	animals are merely accompanying them, flying escort as the
	chopper gains altitude.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		They're protecting their nest.
		That's all.  That's all they're
		doing.

	Kelly, completely drained, sits between Sarah and Malcolm,
	each of whom has a protective arm around her.  She sags
	against her father's chest, nothing left.

	He holds her tight and WHISPERS in her ear.

 MALCOLM 		Thank you.  Kelly, thank God.  Thank
		God for you...

 IN THE NIGHT SKY, 
	over the island, the helicopter steadily gains altitude.  A
	hundred feet.  Three hundred.  A thousand.

	As the helicopter is clearly leaving the island, the
	pteranodons now peel off, their job done.  One of them banks
	sharply, right in front of the moon.  The moonlight
	silhouettes it, shining right through its membranous wings,
	lighting it up like a Halloween skeleton.

	Below, the tiny green island melts away into the vastness of
	the wine-dark sea.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. TYRANNOSAUR NEST - NIGHT 
	Elsewhere in the forest, it's not such a happy story.  PETER
	LUDLOW, still alive, drops through the air and CRUNCHES to the
	muddy ground.  Dizzy, bleeding, the breath knocked out of him,
	he opens his eyes and sees a sloping bank of dried mud.

	From behind him, he hears a CHIRPING sound.  He turns.

	He's in the tyrannosaur nest.

	The BABY TYRANNOSAUR faces him, still with a strange
	aluminum-foil cast on its leg.  The baby SQUEAKS with
	excitement as it toddles toward him.

	Ludlow scrambles to his feet, unsure what to do.  Both ADULT
	TYRANNOSAURS stand outside the nest, staring down at him.

	The baby runs toward Ludlow, so he turns and runs away.

	But in an instant, the male brings its head down, knocking
	Ludlow to the ground.  Then it raises its head again.
	Watching.  Waiting.

	Ludlow gets up again and tries to run, but now the female rex
	strikes, knocking him over again.

	Ludlow tries to crawl away, on all fours.  The male bends down
	and closes its jaws around one of his legs, holding it
	tightly.  Ludlow SCREAMS --

	-- and the rex bits down decisively.  The bone breaks with a
	dry SNAP.  Ludlow HOWLS in pain, unable to move, and the baby
	toddles forward eagerly.  Ludlow can only stare as it leaps
	up, onto his chest, and opens its jaws wide.

	Peter Ludlow SCREAMS.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. CEMETERY - DAY 
	Snow falls in a gray midwinter sky.  In a cemetery, a group of
	fifty MOURNERS is grouped around a gravesite next to a coffin
	that is festooned with cascades of flowers.  On a table, there
	is an array of framed photographs --

	-- of JOHN HAMMOND.  A MINISTER reads from the Bible while the
	Mourners wipe away tears.  IAN MALCOLM stands a respectful
	distance from the group, KELLY right beside him.  Malcolm's
	face is blank, tired, his sunburn out of place with the white
	winter setting around him.

	At gravesite, a Young Woman turns, looking back over her
	shoulder.  About sixteen, she's lovely, with long blonde hair
	and an honest, open face.  She notices Malcolm, recognizes
	him.

	She nudges a Young Man next to her, about thirteen years old.
	The Young Man turns and breaks into a smile just as welcoming.

	As the ceremony breaks up, they walk over to him.

 MALCOLM 		Hello, Lex.  Tim.

	LEX stands on her tiptoes and kisses Malcolm on the cheek.
	TIM extends a hand and Malcolm shakes it.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		This is Kelly.  My daughter.

	They nod their hellos.

 LEX 		I'm glad you came, Dr. Malcolm

 MALCOLM 		I'm sorry about your grandfather.

 TIM 		Thank you.

 LEX 		We were going to call you, in a few
		days.  Tim and I have been thinking,
		and we've decided we want people to
		know about the island.  About what we
		all saw.

 TIM 		We think it's something our
		grandfather would want us to do.

 MALCOLM 			(pause)
		Why?

 LEX 		Because it's true.

	Malcolm looks at her for a long moment.

 MALCOLM 		I know, Lex.  But even if we're the
		only ones who ever know, it'll still
		be true.  You see, I've decided
		that if the world found out about
		what your grandfather created, it
		wouldn't be around for very long.

 LEX 		But -- it was real.  You can't let
		people go on saying it's not.

 MALCOLM 		That's the thing about reality.

	He looks down at Kelly.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Even when people stop believing in
		it, it doesn't go away.

	Kelly smiles and takes his hand, her slender fingers
	interlocking with his.

 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	Back on Isla Sorna, we float over the deserted worker village,
	moving lightly, as in a dream.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		Do you feel the cold wind blowing on
		your face?  That's real.

	We sweep low, landing on the roof the helicopter took off
	from, the nest below now careful rebuilt with straw and
	scrap, a dozen unblemished eggs in the middle of it.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		Do you see the four of us, standing
		here together, alive?  That's real.

	A PTERANODON land gently on the nest.  Ever so carefully, it
	positions itself over the eggs, lowers itself to roosting
	position, and folds its giant wings around its body.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		And maybe that's still that matters.

	The animal raises its head, opens its beak, and SQUAWKS
	approvingly up at the heavens.

 FADE OUT
THE LOST WORLD
			 JURASSIC PARK

			Michael Crichton

	EXT. TROPICAL LAGOON - DAY

	A 135-foot-luxury yacht is anchored just offshore in a 
	tropical lagoon.  The beach is a stunning crescent of white
	sand at the jungle fringe, utterly deserted.

				ISLA SORNA
		87 miles southeast of Nublar

	Two SHIP HANDS, dressed in white uniforms, have set up a
	picnic table with three chairs on the sand and are carefully
	laying out luncheon service -- fine china, silver, crystal
	decanters with red and white wine.

	PAUL BOWMAN, fortyish, sits in a chair off to the side,
	reading.  MRS. BOWMAN, painfully thin, with the perpetually
	surprised look of a woman who's had her eyes done more than
	once, supervises the settings of the table.

	She looks up and sees a little girl, CATHY, seven or eight
	years old, wandering off down the beach.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		Cathy!  Don't wander off!

	Cathy keeps wandering.

				MRS. BOWMAN (cont'd)
		Cathy, come back!  You can look for
		shells right here!

	Cathy gestures, pretending she can't hear.

				BOWMAN
			(eyes still in his book)
		Leave her alone.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		What about snakes?

				BOWMAN
		There's no snakes on a beach.  Let
		her have fun, for once.

	FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH,

	Cathy keeps wandering away, MUTTERING to herself as her
	parents' quarreling voices fade in the distance.

				CATHY
		Please be quiet, please be quiet
		please be quiet...

	Rounding a curve in the beach, her parents disappear from view
	behind her.  A RUSTLING sound draws her attention, and she
	turns, toward where the thick jungle foliage gives way to the
	sand.

	A large bush, maybe twelve feet tall, is moving, its branches
	swaying and shaking.  Curious, Cathy walks up to the bush,
	which abruptly stops moving.

	A small, lizard-like animal, dark green with brown stripes
	along its back, steps out from the bush.  Only about a foot
	tall, it stands on its hind legs, balancing on its thick tail.
	It walks upright, bobbing its head like a chicken.

				CATHY
		Well, hello there!

	The animal (a COMPSOGNATHUS) just stares at her.  Cathy squats
	down on her haunches.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		What are you?  A little bird or
		something?

	She opens her hand.  She's got a handful of goldfish crackers.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Are you hungry?  You want a goldfish?

	The compy bobs forward a few steps, cautiously.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Come on.  I won't hurt you.

	The compy draws closer.  Cathy holds the cracker in the palm
	of her hand.  The compy gets closer still --

	-- and hops numbly up onto Cathy's palm.  Her arm dips a bit
	under the weight, but it's not that heavy, and she holds it up
	easily.  It bobs its head, scarfs up the goldfish, and eats
	it.

	Enchanted, Cathy breaks into an enormous grin and returns her
	hand, calling back over her shoulder.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Mom!  Dad!  You gotta come see this!
		I found something!

	She turns back.

	Thirty more compys have come out onto the sand.  They're
	standing there, bobbing anxiously, staring at her from a few
	feet away.  Cathy's smile fades.

	She turns her head slowly to the right.  TWENTY MORE COMPYS
	have come in from that side, forming a semi-circle, bobbing
	and CHIPPING as they surround her.

				CATHY (cont'd)
			(terrified)
		What do you guys want?

	BACK ON THE BEACH,

	the table is set.  Mrs. Bowman calls out.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		Cathy, sweetheart!  Lunch is ready!

	From around the curve of the beach, a flock of birds bolts
	from the jungle trees as Cathy's shrill SCREAMS suddenly
	pierce the air.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		PAUL!

	She takes off, running down the beach, Mr. Bowman leaps out of
	his chair and follows, and all available deck hands race off
	to help, kicking up geysers of sand behind them.

	DOWN THE BEACH,

	Mrs. Bowman stops dead in her tracks when she rounds the bend
	in the beach.  We don't see what she sees, but we hear the
	frenzied SQUEAKING of the strange compys.  Mr. Bowman and the
	Hands race past her to help Cathy as Mrs. Bowman lets loose a
	horrified, slack-jawed SCREAM, her mouth a perfect oval.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

	Mrs. Bowman's screaming face dissolves slowly over the
	YAWNING face of a bored CORPORATE EXECUTIVE, TWENTY OTHER
	EXECUTIVES sit around a conference table in the boardroom of a
	monied corporation.  All are in expensive suits, most are over
	sixty.  There are rows of BACKBENCHERS too, whispering in their
	lawyers who sit behind their clients, whispering in their
	ears.  Empty coffee cups and fast food containers on the table
	hint that everyone's been here a long time.

	A familiar VOICE resounds through the boardroom as we move
	down the long table, pat the grim faces of the board members.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		The hurricane seemed like a disaster
		at the time, but now I think it was a
		blessing, nature's way of freeing
		those animals from their human
		confines.  Of giving them another
		chance to survive, but this time as
		they were meant to, without man's
		interference.

	The source of the voice is JOHN HAMMOND, the founder of InGen
	and creator of Jurassic Park.  But he's not in the room.  His
	image is on a closed circuit TV screen, which has been wheeled
	up to the end of the table.

	And he doesn't look good.  He's terribly infirmed, propped up
	in bed, his face pale and drawn, medical equipment BEEPING
	around him.

				HAMMOND (cont'd)
		There are some corporate issues that
		are not about the bottom line.  We
		have so much still to learn about
		those creatures.  A whole world of
		intricate, interlocking behaviors,
		vanished everywhere -- except for
		Site B. Please.  Let's not do what
		is good for more men at the expense
		at what is best for all mankind.

	The CHAIRMAN, seventyish, nods awkwardly to the television.

				CHAIRMAN
		Thank you, John.  Mr. Ludlow?

	He turns to PETER LUDLOW, late thirties, a man with the
	anxious look of someone who insists the buck stop on his desk.
	Ludlow flips open a file, pulls out a stack of black and white
	eight by tens, and tosses them on the table.

				LUDLOW
			(an accent similar to
			 Hammond's)
		These pictures were taken in a
		hospital in Costa Rica forty-eight
		hours ago, after an American family
		on a yacht cruise stumbled onto Site
		B.  The little girl will be fine, but
		her parents are wealthy, angry, and
		very fond of lawsuits.  But that's
		hardly new to us, is it?
			(takes a paper from the
			 file)
		Wrongful death settlements, partial
		list:  family of Donald Gennaro, 36.5
		million dollars; family of Robert
		Muldoon, 12.6 million.  Damaged or
		destroyed equipment, 17.3 million.
		Demolition, de-construction, and
		disposal of Isla Nublar facilities,
		organic and inorganic, one hundred
		and twenty-six million dollars.  The
		list goes on, gentlemen -- research
		funding, media payoffs.  Silence is
		expensive.

	He's warming up.  Not a bad performer.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		This corporation has been bleeding
		from the throat for four years.  You,
		our board of directors, have set
		patiently and listened to ecology
		lectures while Mr. Hammond signed
		your checks and spent your money.
		You have watched your stock drop from
		seventy-eight and a quarter to
		nineteen flat with no good and in
		sight.  And all along, we have held a
		significant product asset that we
		could have safely harvested and
		displayed for profit.  Enormous
		profit.

	He reaches out to a model on the table and gives it a shove,
	sending it sliding down the length of the table in front of
	them.  It's a mini-mall version of a zoo.  Cages hold tiny
	replicas of various kinds of dinosaurs while Boy Scout troops
	and Tourists look on in wonder.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Enough money to wipe out four years
		of lawsuits and damage control and
		unpleasant infighting, enough to not
		only send our stock back to where it
		was but to double it.  And the one
		thing, the only thing standing
		between us and this asset is a
		born-again naturalist who happens to
		be our own CEO.  Well, I don't work
		for Mother Nature.  I work for you.

	Two of his Backbenchers distribute documents from a stack.
	Ludlow takes one and reads from it.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		"Whereas the Chief Executive
		Officer has engaged in wasteful and
		negligent business practices to
		further his own personal
		environmental beliefs --
		Whereas these practices have 
		affected the financial performance
		of the company by incurring
		significant losses --
		Whereas the shareholders have been
		materially harmed by these losses --
		Thereby, be it resolved that John
		Parker Hammond should be resolved from
		the office of Chief Executive
		Officer, affective immediately."  Mr.
		Chairman, I move the resolution be
		put to an immediate vote.  Do I have
		a second?

				BOARD MEMBER
		I second the motion,  Mr. Chairman,
		Please poll the members by a show of
		hands.

	The CHAIRMAN signs heavily, feeling like a traitor.  He can't
	bear to look at Hammond on the TV monitor.

				CHAIRMAN
		All those in favor of InGen Corporate
		Resolution 213C, please signify your
		approval by raising your right hand.

	It starts slowly, guiltily, but every hand in the room goes
	up.  Ludlow sits back, victorious.  Hammond, furious, raises
	his right hand, which holds a remote control, and points it at
	the TV screen.  It goes blank.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. WELDER'S YARD - NIGHT

	Sparks fly out the windows and doors of a shed in the middle
	of a welder's yard.  Scrap iron and steel lies everywhere.
	Somewhere inside the shed, a phone RINGS.

	The WHOOSH of the arc welder shuts off.  DIETER STARK, a big
	barrel-chested man of forty or so, his face streaked with soot
	and grime, steps outside with a cordless phone, a cigarette
	dangling from his lips.

				DIETER
		Yeah.

	He takes a deep drag while someone talks on the other end.  He
	smiles and blows out a cloud of smoke.

							CUT TO:
	INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY - NIGHT

	Smoke turns into steam as a subway THUNDER into a station
	underneath Manhattan.  The door WHOOSH open, spit out some
	COMMUTERS and suck up a few more.

	A tall man hurries down the platform, limping heavily, moving
	as fast as he can.  The subway doors begin to close, but just
	before they meet --

	-- the man jams a cane in between, stopping them.  The man
	is IAN MALCOLM, fortyish, dressed in black from head to toe.
	There's a hard wisdom in Malcolm's eyes that may not have been
	there's a few years ago -- he know what you think, and he
	doesn't care.

	INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

	MALCOLM finds a seat on the crowded subway car and sits down.
	He looks awful.  Tired.  Weathered.  He notices a CURIOUS MAN
	across from his is staring at his.  Malcolm looks away.  The
	Curious Man still stares.  Nervy, the Curious Man gets up and
	approaches.

				MALCOLM
			(under his breath)
		Shit.

	The Curious Man sits down next to Malcolm, grinning.

				MAN
		You're him, aren't you?

				MALCOLM
		Excuse me?

				MAN
		The guy.  The scientist.  I saw you
		on TV.
			(conspiratorially)
		I believed you.

	No response from Malcolm.  The guy leans in even closer.

				MAN (cont'd)
		Roooooarr.

				MALCOLM
			(a withering look)
		I was misquoted.  I was merely
		speculating on the evolutionary
		scenario of a Lost World.  I never
		said I was in any such place.

	He gets up and moves to another seat on the car, away from the
	Curious Man.  As he sits down, he notices two other COMMUTERS
	across from him are staring at him.

	He looks at them.  They looks away.

	He pulls the collar of his coat up tight around him.  Nowhere
	to hide.

	INT. JOHN HAMMOND'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A UNIFORMED BUTLER has a question:

				BUTLER
		Whom shall I tell Mr. Hammond is
		calling?

	MALCOLM stands in the foyer of an expensively decorated Park
	Avenue apartment.

				MALCOLM
		Ian Malcolm

	A door opens and a little dog comes YAPPING out of the back.
	It bounds straight at Malcolm, GROWLING, jaws SNAPPING.  It
	lunges --

	-- and Malcolm BATS it away with one swift swing of his cane.
	The dog rolls across the floor and slinks away, WHINING.  The
	Butler looks at Malcolm disapprovingly.
	
				BUTLER
		Not an animal lover?

				MALCOLM
		Not really.

	INT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	MALCOLM enters a darkened bedroom.  JOHN HAMMOND lies in the
	bed we saw earlier, on the other side of the room;

	Medical equipment has been disguised as well as possible among
	the furniture and flowers, but the sheer abundance of it tells
	us that whatever has stricken him is going to win this battle.

				HAMMOND
		Ian!  Don't linger in the doorway
		like an ingenue, come in, come in!

	Malcolm steps further into the room.

				HAMMOND (cont'd)
		It's good to see you.  It really is.
		How's the leg?

				MALCOLM
		Resentful.

				HAMMOND
		When you have a lot of time to think,
		it's funny who you remember.  It's
		the people who challenged you.  It is
		the quality of our opponents that
		gives our accomplishments meaning.  I
		never told you how sorry I was about
		what happened after we returned.
	
	Noticing Hammond's deteriorated condition, Malcolm finds it
	hard to sustain anger.
	
				MALCOLM
		I didn't know you -- weren't well.
		
				HAMMOND
		It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are
		finally killing me.
		
				MALCOLM
		They do have motives.  Why did you
		want to see me?  Your message said it
		was urgent.
		
				HAMMOND
		You were right -- and I was wrong.
		There!  Did you ever think you'd hear
		me say that?  Spectacularly wrong.
		Instead of observing those animals, I
		tried to control them.  I squandered
		an opportunity and we still know next
		to nothing about their lives.  Not
		their lives as man would have them,
		behind electric fences, but in the
		wild.  Behavior in their natural
		habitat, the impossible dream of any
		paleontologist.  I could have had it,
		but I let it slip away.
			(pause)
		Thank God for Site B.
		
	Malcolm just looks at him for a long moment.
	
				MALCOLM
		What?
		
				HAMMOND
			(a spark in his eye)
		Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle
		compact to you?
		
				MALCOLM
		What are you talking about?
	
				HAMMOND
		The hatchery, in particular?  You
		know my initial yields had to be low,
		far less than one percent, that's a
		thousand embryos for every single
		live birth.  Genetic engineering on
		that scale implies a giant operation,
		not the spotless little laboratory I
		showed you.

				MALCOLM
		I don't believe you.

				HAMMOND
		Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian,
		something for the tourists, Site B
		was the factory floor.  We built it
		first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some
		miles from Nublar.

				MALCOLM
		No, no, no, no, no, no . . .

				HAMMOND
		After the accident at the park, a
		hurricane wiped out our facility on
		Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave
		the animals to fend for themselves.
		And they did.  For four years I've
		fought to keep them safe from human
		meddling, now I want you to go there
		and document them.

				MALCOLM
		Are you out of your mind?  I still
		have nightmares, my reputation's a
		joke, my leg is shot -- you think I
		need more of that?

				HAMMOND
		It would be the most extraordinary
		living fossil record the world has
		ever seen.

				MALCOLM
		So what?

	Hammonnd picks up a thick file folder from the night table near
	to him and open it on his lap.  Inside, there are memos,
	charts, maps and photographs.

				HAMMOND
		I've been putting this together for
		over a year.
			(MORE)
		I have personal suggestions for your
		entire team, phone numbers, contact
		people.  They won't believe you about
		what they're going to see, so don't
		bother trying to convince them.  Just
		use my checkbook to get them there.
		I'll fund your expedition through my
		personal accounts, as such money and
		equipment as you need, but only if
		you leave immediately.  If we
		hesitate, all will be lost.

				MALCOLM
		John . . .

				HAMMOND
		You'll need an animal behaviorist,
		someone with unimpeachable
		credentials.  I believe you already
		know Sarah Harding.  She's got
		theories about parenting and
		nurturing among hunter/scavengers I
		bet she'd be dying to prove on a
		scale like this.  If you convince her
		to go, it'll be a major coup.  When
		she publishes, the scientific
		community must take it seriously.

	Malcolm just shakes his head, flipping through the file sadly.

				HAMMOND
		Your documentation, you should use
		forensic photographic methods,
		Hasselbladt still cameras, high
		definition video.  When the trick
		photography analysts take your
		evidence apart, make it impossible
		for them to say there was enhancement
		or computer graphic imaging.  Oh,
		this is very important -- avoid the
		island interior at all costs.  Stick
		to the outer rim.  Everything you
		need to know can be found there.
		Vindication lies on the outer rim.

	Malcolm gently closes the file and pushes it back to Hammond.

				MALCOLM
		I'm not going, John.

				HAMMOND
			(fatigue returning)
		Ian, you are my last chance to give
		something of real value to the world.
		I can't walk so far and leave no
		footprints; die and leave nothing
		with my name on it.  I will not  be
		known only for my failures.  And you
		will not allow yourself to go down in
		history as a lunatic.  You're too
		smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr.
		Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance
		at redemption.  For both of us.
		There's no time to equivocate, we
		must seize it now, before --

	He stops, staring over Malcom's shoulder.  Malcom turns.
	PETER LUDLOW, still in his overcoat, is standing in the
	doorway to the bedroom.  He looks back and forth from Hammond
	to Malcolm suspiciously.

				LUDLOW
		Hello, Uncle John.  Dr. Malcolm.

	Malcolm doesn't answer.  He seems to know Ludlow, and dislikes
	him.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Did I interrupt something?

	Malcolm turns back to Hammond.

				MALCOLM
		Find someone else.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HAMMOND'S APARTMENT/FOYER - NIGHT

	In the foyer, LUDLOW hands MALCOLM his coat, just a trifle
	rudely, and shepherds him to the door.

				LUDLOW
		So, you two were just, uh, telling
		old campfire stories, were you?

				MALCOLM
		Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a
		second that you and I don't know the
		truth.  You can convince Time
		magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer
		of whatever you want, but I was 
		there.

				LUDLOW
		You signed a non-disclosure agreement
		before you went to the island that
		expressly forbade you from discussing
		anything you saw.  You violated that
		agreement.

				MALCOLM
		You cost me my livelihood.  That on
		which I relied to support my
		children.

				LUDLOW
		If your university felt you were
		causing it embarrassment by selling
		wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly
		see how I am to--

				MALCOLM
		I didn't tell anything, I told the
		truth.

				LUDLOW
		You version of it.

				MALCOLM
		There are no versions of the truth!
		This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's
		my life.

				LUDLOW
		We made a generous compensatory offer
		for your injuries.

				MALCOLM
		It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen
		never--

				LUDLOW
		InGen is my livelihood, Dr.
		Malcolm, and I will jealously defend
		its interests.  People will know what
		I want them to know when I want them
		to know it.

	Ludlow tosses something to Malcolm, hard.  It sails across the
	foyer, upright, and Malcolm reaches out and catches it with
	one hand.  It's his cane.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Don't forget that.

	Malcolm stares at him for a long moment.  Finally, he turns
	and walks away.

	But he does not out of the apartment.  Instead, he
	walks directly past Ludlow, crosses the living room, and steps
	back into Hammond's bedroom, closing the door behind him with
	a determined CLICK.

	INT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	HAMMOND looks up, hopeful, as MALCOLM comes back into the room
	and walks over to his bed.  He reaches down --

	-- and picks up the file folder.

				MALCOLM
		Do you have a satellite phone?

							CUT TO:

	INT. MOMBASSA BAR - DAY

	ROLAND TEMBO, late sixties, skin like leather and the diamond
	hard look of a cobra, sits at a table in the middle of an
	African cafe/bar in Mombassa.

	It's daytime and the place is half full, mostly with locals,
	but there are a few obnoxious TOURISTS too, Americans on
	safari who somehow found the local handout.

	They're a noisy bunch, but Roland tunes them out, calmly
	eating his lunch and drinking a beer while he reads a book,
	eyeglasses hanging low on his nose.

	Roland suddenly stops reading and furrows his brow.  He looks
	up.  He SNIFFS the air once, then smiles and calls out a
	person's name.

				ROLAND
		Ajay?

	He turns around.  AJAY (AH-jay) SIDHU, a wiry East Indian in
	his late forties, is standing behind him, caught trying to
	sneak up.

				AJAY
			(delighted)
		How did you know?

				ROLAND
			(taps his nose)
		That cheap aftershave I send you
		every Christmas, you actually wear
		it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit
		down, what brings you to Mombassa?

				AJAY
		You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the
		last time you answered your phone?

				ROLAND
		Last time I plugged it in, I suppose.
		Why?

	Behind them, the group of TOURISTS, all men, laughs loudly.
	One of them, the MOST OBNOXIOUS TOURISTS, berates the WAITRESS.

				AJAY
		I got a call from a gentleman who's
		going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts.
		If he's to be believed, it's a most,
		uh, unique expedition.  And very
		well-funded.

				ROLAND
		Well, I'm a very well-funded old son
		of a bitch.  You go.

	The Most Obnoxious Tourist bellows for the Waitress.  His
	buddies LAUGHS.  Roland throws a glance, annoyed.

				AJAY
		But alone?  We always had great
		success together, you and I.

				ROLAND
		Just a little bit too much, I
		think.

				AJAY
		How do you mean?

				ROLAND
		A true hunter doesn't mind if the
		animal wins.  If it escapes.  But
		there weren't enough escapes from you
		and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend
		a bit less time in the company of
		death.  Maybe I just feel too close
		to it my--

	The Waitress comes to the Tourists' table and the Most
	Obnoxious Tourist actually paws her ass.  Roland is out of his
	chair in a second.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
			(to Ajay)
		Excuse me.

	Romand walks over to the Tourists' table, says something to
	the Waitress in the local dialect, and she walks away, behind
	him.  He stares down at the Most Obnoxious Tourist.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		You, sir -- are no gentleman.

				TOURIST
		Is that supposed to be an insult?

				ROLAND
		I can think of none greater.

	The Tourist looks at his Buddies and laughs.

				TOURIST
		Buzz off, you silly old bastard.

				ROLAND
		What do I have to do to pick a fight
		with you, bring your mother into it?

				TOURIST
		Are you kidding?  I could take you
		with one arm tied down.

				ROLAND
		Really?

	IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR,

	the Waiter finishes tying a man's wrist to his belt in the
	back of his pants with a napkin.  He pulls the knot tight and
	the man turns around.

	It's Roland, with his arm tied down.  The Tourist stands
	across from him.

				TOURIST
		I mean my arm.

	POW!  Roland punches him square in the jaw.  The Tourist
	reels, stunned.  Enraged, he lunges at Roland, swinging with
	both arms.

	Roland bobs, neatly ducking the punches, waits for the Tourist
	to turn around, and POPS him thrice in the face.  The Tourist
	spins and goes down to the floor, face first.  A cloud of
	sawdust and a loud CHEER from the locals rise up in the bar.

	BACK AT HIS TABLE,

	Roland drops the napkin on the table and sits back down with
	Ajay.  In the background, the Tourist's Buddies hurriedly
	carry their fallen cohort out of the bar.

				ROLAND
		Sorry.  We were saying?

				AJAY
		You broke that idiot's jaw for no
		reason other than your boredom.  Tell
		the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even
		interested in knowing this
		expedition's quarry?

				ROLAND
		Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a
		look around the trophy room, and tell
		me what kind of quarry you think
		could possibly be of any interest
		to me.

	Ajay just smiles.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. AFRICAN SAVANNAH - NIGHT

	The African savannah appears in shades of fluorescent green,
	seen through night-vision goggles.  An ANIMAL YELP comes from
	the left and the green vista sweeps abruptly toward it.  The
	world blurs momentarily, then comes into focus on a field of
	long grass.

	The grass ripples in a complex pattern as animals move
	stealthily through it.  One animal head pops up above the
	grass for a split-second, teeth bared, a white stripe between
	its eyes.  SARAH HARDING pulls the goggles away from her face.

				SARAH
		Hyenas.  Ace Face is the striped
		snout.

	Sarah is thirty, with a compact, athletic body built for the
	outdoors.  She loos through the goggles again, sweeping ahead
	of the hyenas to their prey.

	It's a herd of African buffalo, standing belly-deep in the
	grass, agitated, bellowing and stamping their feet.

	Sarah turns to MAKENA, her African assistant.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		They'll try to take down a calf.
		Come on.

				MAKENA
		Closer?

	Sarah scurries up and over a rock face.  Makena follows.
	Closer now, they watch as the hyenas rush the herd, running
	through it, trying to break it up.

				MAKENA (cont'd)
		You know, we could see everything
		from up on the edge of that cliff.

				SARAH
		No way.

				MAKENA
		But the view would --

				SARAH
		No cliffs.
			(into a pocket recorder)
		F1 headed sough, F2 and F5 flanking,
		twenty yards.  F3 center.  F6
		circling wide east.  Can't see F7.

	While she talks, breathless, fascinated by the drama before
	her, Sarah continues to creep closer and closer to the action.
	Makena follows, with growing unease.

				MAKENA
		Sarah.

				SARAH
		F8 circling north.  F1 straight
		through, disrupting.  Herd moving,
		stamping.  There's F7.  Straight
		through.  F8 angling through from the
		north.

	She's practically on top of the animals now.

				MAKENA
		Dr. Harding.

	Makena has a hold of Sarah's sweatshirt and is tugging her
	back, at least trying to slow down her progress as Sarah,
	wide-eyed with fascination, creeps even closer.

	Suddenly there is a tremendous BELLOWING and the grass right
	in front of them rips apart, trampled under the feet of the
	hyenas as they cluster around a fallen buffalo calf.  They
	yelp and jump, their muzzles bloody.

	The adults move aside, making room as the hyena pups come
	forward, squealing to get at the kill.  Sarah's eyes shine
	with excitement and she moves even closer, whispering into the
	tape recorder.

				SARAH
		Brooding behavior in evidence at the
		kill site, pups are ushered forward
		and adults help them eat, pulling
		flesh away from the carcass and--

	A telephone rings.

	Sarah stops in mid-sentence, unsure if she heard what she
	thought she heard.  It rings again, the unmistakable CHIRPING
	of a cellular phone.  Sarah and Makena both move at once,
	pawing at a backpack.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			(a frantic whisper)
		I thought you turned it off!

	Two hyenas look inquisitively in the direction of the phone.
	Sarah comes up with it and jabs at a button in irritation.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Yes?!

	Someone speaks on the other end.  Sarah rolls her eyes.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Ian.  This better be important.

	Sarah doesn't say anything for a long moment, just listens as
	the voice on the other end talks.  And talks.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		When?

		Eddie Carr's handling all our
		equipment and he'll be there to
		maintain it.  He's designing special
		field trailers now, top of the line
		mobile research units.

	EDDIE CARR, fortyish, is barking out orders to the Workmen.

				EDDIE
		No, no, look at the plans, Henry,
		you can't place that strut laterally,
		it has to be crosswise, LOOK AT THE
		PLANS!

	From the ceiling, a large metal age CRASHES down, landing
	next to them on the floor with a deafening CLANG.  They leap
	back and look up.  A WORKMAN waves from a scaffolding.

				WORKMAN
		Sorry, Eddie!  Specs say it can't
		deform at 12,000 PSI, we had to test
		it

	Eddie bends down to inspect the cage, which is rectangular,
	constructed of inch-thick titanium-alloy bars.  Malcolm hangs
	up the phone and walks up, joining him.

				MALCOLM
		Any damage?

				EDDIE
		Minimal.

				MALCOLM
		"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be
		light, it has to be strong --

				EDDIE
		Light and strong, light and strong,
		sure, why not, it's only impossible.
		God save me from academics.

				MALCOLM
		You are an academic.

				EDDIE
		Former academic.  Now I actually make
		things.  I don't just talk.

				MALCOLM
		You think I'm all talk, Eddie?

				EDDIE
			(doesn't look at him)
		It doesn't matter what I think.

				MALCOLM
		Is there anything we've forgotten?
		Anything at all?

	Behind them, someone CLEARS THEIR THROAT.  Eddie and Malcolm
	turn around.  KELLY MALCOLM, an African-American girl around
	twelve years old, stands in the doorway to the garage, a
	duffel bag slung over one shoulder.  She looks at Malcolm and
	breaks into a wide grin.

				KELLY
		Hi, Dad.

				MALCOLM
		Kelly!  What are you doing here?

	She drops the bag on the floor, and wraps her arms around him
	in a warm embrace.  He responds stiffly.

				KELLY
		Vacation.  I'm all yours.  You didn't
		forget, did you?

	She pulls back and looks at him.

				KELLY (cont'd)
		Did you?

							CUT TO:

	INT. EDDIE'S OFFICE - DAY

	KELLY is slumped in a chair in Eddie's office next to the
	construction floor.  Outside the glass windows work on the
	vehicles continues unabated.  MALCOLM hangs up the phone.

				MALCOLM
		Okay, Karen is expecting you in half
		an hour.  You only have to stay with
		her one night, she'll put you on a
		bus in the morning and your mother
		will be at the station when you get
		there.

				KELLY
		I don't even know this woman.

				MALCOLM
		Well, I do, and she's fantastic.
		She'll take you to the museum, maybe
		to a movie if you play your cards
		right.  You're going to have a
		fantastic time.

				KELLY
		Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you
		going?

				MALCOLM
		I can't tell you.  But I'll be back
		within a week.

				KELLY
		My vacation is over in a week.

				MALCOLM
		I'll make it up to you this summer.
		I promise.

				KELLY
		I'm your daughter all the time, you
		know.  Not just when it's convenient.

				MALCOLM
		Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you
		to say that?

				KELLY
		No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own
		once in a while.

	From the construction floor, EDDIE calls out.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Dr. Malcolm!

	Malcolm looks at her, trying to make peace.  Quickly.

				MALCOLM
		Is that kid still bothering you?

				KELLY
		Which one?

				MALCOLM
		You know, at the bus stop.  With the
		hair?

				KELLY
		That was about a year ago.

				MALCOLM
		Well, is he?

				KELLY
		No.  Richard talked to his parents.

				MALCOLM
		That Richard.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Ian, come here a minute!

				KELLY
			(to Malcolm)
		I could come with you.

				MALCOLM
		Out of the question.  You'd miss the
		gymnastics trials.  You've been
		training for that for a year.

				KELLY
		I don't care about the trials, I
		want to be with you.  I could be your
		research assistant, like I was in
		Austin.

				MALCOLM
		This is nothing like Austin.  Forget
		about it.

				KELLY
		You like to have kids, you just
		don't want to be with them, do you?

	He looks at her, hurt.  Eddie calls out a third time,
	impatient now.  Grateful for the escape, Malcolm gets up and
	heads for the door.  He pauses guiltily.

				MALCOLM
		I'm not like you wan me to be.  I've
		what I can be.

	He leaves.

	INT. MAIN FLOOR - DAY

	While MALCOLM and EDDIE argue over something in the
	background, KELLY circles around the trailers and looks up at
	the windows.  They're all made of tempered glass, fine wire
	mesh inside it.  She looks around, to see if anybody's
	watching.  They're not, so she quickly slips inside the front
	trailer.

	INT. TRAILER - DAY

	Inside, the trailer is a miracle of planning and design.  It's
	divided into sections, for different laboratory functions.
	The main area is a biological lab, with specimen trays,
	dissecting pans, and microscopes that connect to video
	monitors.

	Next to it there's an extensive computer section, a bank of
	processors, and a communications section.  All the lab
	equipment is miniaturized and built into small tables that
	slides into the walls.  Everything is bolted down.

	She notices a large map on the wall.  Off the coat of Costa
	Rica, there is an area that has been circled in heavy black
	ink.

	Kelly puts a finger on the map, crossing westward, through the
	Pacific Ocean.  Thegre are dozen s of islands out here, but in
	the highlighted region, there is a semi-circle of five.
	Matanceros.  Muerte.  Tacano.  Pena.  And Sorna.  Underneath
	the whole island chain, there is a bold legend.

	"The Five Deaths," it says.

	Slowly, an ocean barge starts to chug its way across the
	face of the map, leaving a wake that rolls the printed letters
	of those three ominous words.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. OPEN SEA - DAY

	The map dissolves slowly away as the barge SPALASEHS through
	five foot ocean swells in the open sea.  The barge is crammed
	with equipment, the AAV, trailers, a jeep, and the members of
	Malcolm's team.

	ON THE BOAT,

	MALCOLM stands in the bow, riding the choppy seas.  Next to
	him, DR. JUTTSON, fortyish, holds onto the railing,
	seasick.  He SHOUTS over the DRONE of the boat's engines.

				JUTTISON
			(as the waves pound the
			 boat)
		Couldn't -- we just -- airlift --
		into the -- island?

				MALCOLM
		Dr. Harding insisted we go by sea!
		Helicopters are too disruptive.
		These aren't piles of bones you'll be
		studying this time, Dr. Juttson, they
		live, they breathe, and they react!

	Juttson looks at him skeptically --

	-- and throws up.

	AT THE BACK OF THE BOAT,

	NICK VAN OWEN, a good-looking American in his late
	twenties, is sitting amid a pile of video cameras and other
	photographic equipment, playing with a Game Bow.  SARAH
	HARDING, dressed in field gear, sits down next to him.

				SARAH
		So what's your story, Nick?

				NICK
		I was a cameraman for Nightline for
		six years, been freelance since '91.
		Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.

				SARAH
		That must be interesting.  What drew
		you there?

				NICK
		Women.  'Bout eighty percent female
		in Greenpeace.

				SARAH
		Very noble of you.
			(of the noisy Game Boy)
		You don't think you're bringing that
		thing onto the island, do you?

	Nick grins and shuts it off.

				NICK
		Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the
		woolly mammoths.

				SARAH
		You think this is all a joke?

				NICK
		Oh, please.  How am I supposed to
		keep a straight face when --
			(gestures to the
			 black-clad Malcolm)
		-- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm
		going to Skull Island?

				SARAH
			(not amused)
		Ian's a very good friend of mine.

				NICK
		He doesn't need a friend, he needs a
		shrink.

				SARAH
		I believe in him.

	But her face says even she has her doubts.

				NICK
		Come on, there's only one reason any
		of us are here.  His check cleared.

	She looks at him.

				SARAH
		Drop the cynical pose.  You can't
		pull it off while playing Donkey
		Kong.

	The boat's CAPTAIN, a Costa Rican, points ahead and SHOUTS to
	them.

				CAPTAIN
		There it is!

	They all turn and look out over the bow.  Up ahead, shear,
	reddish-gray cliffs of volcanic rock rise dramatically out of
	the fog-heavy ocean.

				CAPTAIN (cont'd)
		Isla Sorna!

	The boat ROARS ahead, plowing into a heavy wreath of fog.  The
	mist swirls and encircles it.

	EXT. ISLAND FIORD - DAY

	A narrow inlet cuts through the steep cliffs, leading to the
	island interior.  The barge bursts through the fog at the
	mouth of the fiord and heads deeper into the island.

	EXT. LAGOON - DAY

	Lush green plants drip everywhere in this verdant lagoon.
	Sulfurous yellow steam issues from the ground, bleaching the
	nearby foliage white.  In the distance one can hear the cries
	of JUNGLE BIRDS.

	The boat is now beached and the CREW flips the tarps off the
	AAV, the jeep, and the trailers.  The trucks back down a
	narrow ramp and onto the soft clay shore at the edge of the
	lagoon.  There is a large three-toad animal imprint in the
	clay at the water's edge, and the AAV backs right over it,
	swapping its track for the animal's.

	MALCOLM is at the edge of the water with the CAPTAIN.

				MALCOLM
		Be back in three days, but keep the
		satellite phone on and your radio
		tuned to the frequency I specified in
		case we need you sooner.

				CAPTAIN
		Don't worry.  I've lived around here
		all my life, these islands are
		completely --

	In the distance, they hear the faint, strange ROAR of a very
	large animal.  The Captain looks at Malcolm, eyes wide.

				CAPTAIN (cont'd)
		-- safe.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. GRASSY PLAIN - DAY

	The jeep tows the double trailer to the edge of a grassy plain
	just beyond the lagoon, overlooking the interior of the
	island.  The noon sun is high overhead; below, the valley
	shimmers in midday heat.

	EDDIE connects a flexible cable to the jeep's power winch and
	flicks it on.  The cable turns slowly in the sunlight.  Moving
	along the length of it, we see the cable leads to a pile of
	aluminum, some kind of strut assembly painted a camouflage
	color.

	As the winch pulls the cable tight, the jumble of thin struts
	begins to move, slowly rising into the air.  The emerging
	structure climbs, spidery, struts unfolding, fifteen feet into
	the air.  The light house at the top (the cage that was
	tested back at Eddie's workshop) is now just beneath the
	lowest branches of the nearby trees, which almost conceal it
	from view.

	NICK lights a cigarette and carelessly tosses the match on the
	ground.  Malcolm notices.

				MALCOLM
		Listen.  I know you all have probably
		concluded that I'm out of my mind.

	Is it our imagination, or did the trees behind Malcolm just
	sway slightly?

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		That's all right, for now.  But just
		humor me and be careful.

	No, it's not our imagination, there they go again.  Whole
	trees shivering and swaying from left to right and back
	again.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Even if you think I'm harmless and
		deluded, I promise --

	Now the trees CREAKS and GROAN as they sway.  Everyone has seen
	it, and now Malcolm turns around too.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		-- this place is for real.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DOUBLE TRAILERS - DAY

	It's quiet inside the trailers that serve as their command
	post/living quarters.  The books are lined up neatly on the
	shelves.  The computers sit, booted up and awaiting data
	input.

	All the way in the back, past the spare tires and life
	preservers and canned food and bottled water, up in one
	storage bin all the way on top, there's a RUSTLING SOUND.

	A plastic student ID card pops out in the cracks under the
	bin's door.  A photograph in the lower right hand corner of
	the card is visible -- it's Kelly, Malcolm's twelve-year-old
	daughter.

	The card wriggles against the lock and, with a soft CLICK, the
	door pops open.  KELLY herself tumbles out, wrapped in several
	blankets and carrying a mason jar half full of a yellowish
	liquid.  We can guess.

	She leaps to her feet, blinks the light out of her eyes, and
	bolts to the back of the trailer as fast as she possibly can.
	She races through a narrow door and SLAMS it shut.

	A sign on the door says "RESTROOM."  Inside, a SIGH of relief
	is heard.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY

	Along a stream bed, the jungle trees still shiver.  NICK loads
	a three quarter inch tape into his heavy video camera and
	chews anxiously on a piece of gum.  SARAH and DR. JUTTSON are
	beside him as the group nervously follows the GROANING forest
	trees to their right.

	At the rear, EDDIE and MALCOLM walk side by side.  Eddie is
	carrying a heavy silver rifle, an aluminum canister hanging
	beneath the barrel.  He shows it to Malcolm, his voice low and
	urgent.

				EDDIE
		Lindstradt air rifle.  Fires a
		subsonic Fluger impact-delivery dart.

	He cracks open the cartridge bank, revealing a row of plastic
	containers filled with straw-colored liquid.  Each is tipped
	with a three inch needle and carries a bright yellow warning
	tag -- "EXTREME DANGER!  LETHAL TOXICITY!"

				EDDIE (cont'd)
		I loaded the enhanced venom of Conus
		purpurascens, the South Sea cone
		shell.  Most powerful neurotoxin in
		the world.  Acts within a
		two-thousandth of a second.  Faster
		than the nerve-conduction velocity.
		The animal's down before it feels the
		prick of the dart.

	From their right, the shaking trees seen closer now.  By
	walking down the stream bed, the humans are tracking right
	along with the animals as they move in the foliage.

				MALCOLM
			(to Eddie)
		Is there an antidote?

				EDDIE
		Like if you shoot yourself in the
		foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be
		dead  before you realized you'd
		accidentally pulled the trigger.

	Ahead of them, thick foliage blocks the path of the dried up
	stream bed to the height of about fifteen feet.  But around
	them, the CRASHING sounds get louder and closer, the swaying
	trees shiver right beside them.  Eddie raises the rifle in
	defense as the trees right at the edge of the stream bed sway
	and part.  Above the foliage, they see the sudden
	movement --

	-- of a row of STEGOSAUR fins.  The spade-shaped fins run
	along a ridge down the middle of the animal's back, about
	three feet tall each.  The group freezes, amazed, and as the
	stegosaur continues on, they get a good look at it through a
	break in the foliage.

	It's a large dinosaur with a small head, a thick neck, and a
	huge lumbering body.

	A double row of plates runs along the crest of its back, and
	it has a dragging trail with long spikes in it.

	The gum drops out of Nick's mouth, FLOPS onto his shirt, and
	sticks there.

				NICK
		Oh --

				JUTTSON
		-- my --

				EDDIE
		-- God!

				SARAH
		It's beautiful!

	A second stegosaur, a baby about a quarter the size of the
	first animal, breaks through the foliage, following the adult.

	While the group is reaching to that, the earth vibrates and
	a third stego, by far the biggest of the three, walks out of
	the foliage right behind them, crossing within ten feet.

	Apparently unconcerned about these little creatures in their
	environment, the stegos continue on across the stream bed.

	Sarah raises a still camera and shoots pictures.  Her shutter
	is muted, so that a muffled CLICK is all that's audible.

	Juttson raises a pocket recorder to his lips and whispers into
	it breathlessly.

				JUTTSON
		Stegosaurus, family Stegosauridae,
		infraorder Stegosauria, suborder
		Thyreophora.  Length, adult male,
		estimate twenty-five to thirty feet.

	His breathy words turn into almost helpless laughter, of all
	things, as he can't contain his astonishment.  Eddie covers
	his mouth, trying to keep him quiet.

				SARAH
			(to Juttsn)
		That was a pair bond!  A family
		group, even, long after that infant
		was nestbound!

				JUTTSON
		I want to see the nesting ground!

	Nick turns to Malcolm, eyes like saucers, and makes a futile,
	wordless, boy-was-I-wrong-on-this-one gesture.  Malcolm
	smiles, leans over, and TAPS softly on Nick's video camera.
	Nick raises it to his shoulder and flicks it on as the group
	continues on into the bush after the animals.

	IN THE BUSH,

	the baby wanders away from the group and ambles over near
	where Sarah crouches in the bushes.  Sarah raises her camera
	again and silently SNAPS a picture.  She WHISPERS to Juttson,
	who is beside her.

				SARAH
		Lone nest -- not colonial.  I don't
		see an egg clutch...

	She gestures and Juttson peers through a pair of field
	glasses.

				JUTTSON
			(whispering back)
		The empty shells are crushed and
		trampled.  The young stay in the
		birth environment, that's conclusive!

				SARAH
		Not without a shot of the nest.

	She sees an opportunity.  As the baby heads back to its
	parents, Sarah scoots right along with it, moving behind it,
	using its body as a shield to block her from the view of the
	other two.

	Nick and Eddie's faces whiten in alarm.  Nick reaches out to
	stop her, but he barely gets hold of the sole of her boot
	before she pulls away from him and duckwalks out into the
	clearing.

	IN THE CLEARING,

	Sarah slinks along behind the baby stego as it walks back,
	toward the nest, chewing the branches it carries in its south.
	She raises up sightly, squeezing off pictures of the herd,
	ever better as she gets closer.

	BACK AT THE HILL,

	the others can only watch her, aghast.

				NICK
		She's gutty.

				MALCOLM
		She's nuts.

	IN THE CLEARING,

	Sarah keeps moving closer.  The baby passes a small grouping
	of rocks and Sarah ducks behind them.  She's now in a perfect
	position to photograph the nest, and she squeezes off picture
	after picture from this ideal vantage point.

	She shoots the last picture on the roll --

	-- and the camera's autowinder WHIRS to life.  Sarah looks
	down in horror as the camera's motor WHINES loudly in her
	hands.

	Th noise startles the animals.  The male turns toward her
	the plates on its back bristling.  Sarah gets to her feet and
	starts to move away, slowly.

	The male turns away from her and swings its tail, spikes
	extended.  It WHIZZES through the air, right at her, but Sarah
	leaps back at the last second --

	-- and the tail's spikes THUD into the dirt where she was.

	Sarah CRUNCHES to the ground and the three stegosaurs dart
	away, disappearing into the bush, moving surprisingly quickly
	for animals their size.

	The others run to Sarah, help her to her feet, and pull her
	back, against a massive tree trunk.  But the tree trunk lifts
	right up off the ground.

	It's no tree, it's a DINOSAUR'S LEG, a massive one, six feet
	across, God knows how many feet high.  The Group gasps and
	looks up as a MAKENCHIASAURUS, an enormous saurupod over a
	hundred feet from nose to tail,  lumbers away from them.

	The Group stares in wonder as the mamenchiasaur stops and
	HONKS furtively, its long neck stretched out above them.

	Now a second mamenchiasaur neck cranes out of the
	surrounding forest trees and wraps around the first.  The
	first mamenchiasaur THUNDERS around in a semi-circle, getting
	into position behind the second.

	Nick swings his video camera straight up and the group
	suddenly finds itself in the middle of a mamenchiasaur mating.

	The mighty tails swing and SNAP around them as the two animals
	come together, and trees start snapping and falling, CRASHING
	to the jungle floor.

	The group panics and bolts for cover toward the only place
	where the trees are not falling -- which is directly underneath
	the animals!

	Amid HONKS and BLEATS, the swinging tails continue to deforest
	the jungle around them.

	The noise and chaos is deafening, drowning out the LAUGHTER
	and SCREAMS of the fascinated and terrified group.

	There is a momentary lull and the group dashes out from
	underneath the animals, disappearing into the thick forest.

	A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY,

	the Group collapses to the ground, breathless, chests heaving
	with wild, frightened laughter.  Sarah goes to Malcolm and
	throws her arms around him, exhilarated.

				SARAH
		Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so
		glad!

				JUTTSON
			(out of breath)
		Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you
		an apology.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY

	Suddenly, the Gathereres are taking their expedition a lot more
	seriously.  They march quickly back to base camp, their energy
	and excitement palpable.  NICK strikes a match and raises it
	to a cigarette with a shaking hand, but SARAH leans in and
	blows it out.

				SARAH
		No more smoking.  We leave no scent
		of any kind.  No hair tonics, no
		cologne, seal all our food in plastic
		bags.  We will observe and document,
		but we will not interact.

				MALCOLM
		That's a scientific impossibility,
		you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty
		principle.  Whatever you study, you
		also change.

	Nick ejects the used videotape from his camera and pulls out a
	sharpie, to label it.

				NICK
		What should I call this?  "Jurassic
		Pork?"

	Eddie, next to him, laughs.

				SARAH
			(still to Malcolm)
		And let's forget about the high hide.
		We can't do this kind of work up in a
		tower, we need to be out in the
		field, as close to the animals as
		possible.

				JUTTSON
		I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in
		a family group, but there's never
		been anything in the fossil record to
		prove the carnivores did.

				SARAH
		Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas,
		jackals, nearly all species of
		predator birds --

				JUTTSON
		That doesn't say a thing about T-rex,
		they could have been rogues.  Robert
		Burke certainly thinks they were.

				SARAH
		We've got to see one to find out.
		Is there any --

				MALCOLM
		No way.

				NICK
		Oh, my God.

				SARAH
		-- way we could safely --

				NICK
		Oh, no!

	He takes off, running as fast as he can, down the trail,
	toward base camp.  They look ahead, in the direction Nick is
	running.  A plume of black smoke is rising up over the trees.

				EDDIE
		Fire!

							CUT TO:

	EXT. BASE CAMP - DAY

	NICK bursts out of the trees and races toward the thick plume
	of smoke.  In the middle of the base camp, someone has neatly
	built a campfire surrounded by stones.  Flames burn in the
	middle.

	Nick races over to it and stomps it out as the OTHERS emerge
	from the trees behind him.

				MALCOLM
		A campfire?!

	Nick grabs a jug of water, but Sarah steps in.

				SARAH
		No!  Water mixes the smoke billow,
		use dirt!

	They start to kick and rake dirt onto the fire with their
	hands and feet.  Eddie and Dr. Juttson jump in and help out.

				MALCOLM
		Who the hell started a campfire?!

				VOICE (o.s.)
		It was just to make lunch.

	Malcolm turns toward the source of the voice.  KELLY stands in
	the doorway of the trailer, sheepish.

				KELLY (cont'd)
			I wanted it ready when you got back.

	The whole group stares, stunned, none more so than Malcolm
	himself.

				MALCOLM
		Oh ... man.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. BASE CAMP - LATER

	Later, and base camp is a blur of activity.  SARAH, JUTTSON,
	NICK, and EDDIE are hard at work, burying the remains of the
	fire, sealing their food in plastic bags, loading camera
	equipment, packing up specimen containers and other
	information-gathering equipment.

	MALCOLM, meanwhile, is lecturing Kelly.

				MALCOLM
		You know you were putting yourself in
		a potentially dangerous situation,
		but you didn't bother to find out
		how dangerous before you leapt in.
		You don't have the faintest idea
		what's going on on this island!

				SARAH
			(loading a backpack)
		What do you want to do, Ian, lock her
		up for curiosity?  Where do you think
		she gets it?

				JUTTSON
			(to Nick)
		Do you have chromium tapes?  The
		others fog in high-

				NICK
		-humidity, I know.
			(waving a tape)
		Highest lead density on the market.

				EDDIE
			(to Malcolm)
		We've got a lot of heavy marching
		ahead of us.  I'm not carrying 
		anybody.

				KELLY
		I can keep up.

				MALCOLM
		You're going home.  I'm sending a
		radio call for the boats.  We'll all
		go down to the lagoon and wait for
		them.

				SARAH
		Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a
		high school vice-principal.

				MALCOLM
		I'm her father.

				KELLY
		Sure, now.

	Nick leans over and whispers to Eddie, gesturing to Malcolm
	and Kelly.

				NICK
		Do you see any family resemblance
		here?

				MALCOLM
		You can't stay, Kelly, that's it.
		It's too dangerous.

				SARAH
		If it's so dangerous, why'd you bring
		any of us?

				KELLY
		You're wrong, Dad.  I do know
		what's going on on this island.

				MALCOLM
		How could you possibly?

				KELLY
		Because you said so.  Maybe nobody
		else believed you, but I always
		did.

	He looks at her, touched.  Nick mutters to Eddie again.

				NICK
		The kid scores with cheap sentiment.

				SARAH
		Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've
		made two invasive landings in one
		day.  That'll have to go in any paper
		I write, and it will leave room for
		people to say our findings were
		contaminated.  You know the academic
		world as well as I do, once they
		smell blood in the water, you're
		dead.  Our presence has got to be one
		hundred percent antiseptic.  That
		means if we bend a blade of grass, we
		bend it right back the way it-

	A low sound has been rising while she speaks, and now it comes
	BOOMING over the jungle around them, a THUNDEROUS racket that
	shakes the very ground beneath them.  Suddenly, three C-130
	military cargo planes THUNDER overhead and ROAR toward the
	island interior, flying very low.  The planes are enormous,
	fat-assed creatures, their rear cargo doors hanging open.

	AT A RIDGE,

	the members of the gatherer expedition hit the dirt and peer
	over a ledge, watching as the airplanes bank and circle over a
	specific spot.

	Eddie raises a pair of field glasses.

	DOWN BELOW,

	huge metal equipment containers are shoved out the back of the
	cargo bays.  They SNAP off trees like matchsticks, CRUSH flat
	anything foolish enough to exist where they want to land.

	Now MEN pour out the rear of the planes, their low-altitude
	parachutes billowing open behind them.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick looks at Sarah.

				NICK
		You were saying something about
		antiseptic?

	EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - DAY

	Metal container doors CLANG to the ground, jeep engines ROAR
	to life in a cloud of thick black diesel smoke, blue laser
	barriers SIZZLE and BURN through foliage as this group of
	HUNTERS establishes a perimeter around their new camp.

	PETER LUDLOW, dressed in brand new Banana Republic safari
	wear, steps into the center of the camp and surveys the
	surroundings.  He turns to DR. ROBERT BURKE, a ragged,
	pony-tailed man in wire-rimmed glasses.

				LUDLOW
		Welcome to your dream come true, Dr.
		Burke.

	Burke has a detailed set of satellite recon photographs that
	he spreads out on the hood of a jeep.

				BURKE
		I believe the large herbivores forage
		in open plains, like bison, which
		would explain the great variety of
		heat dots we're reading in the
		flatlands around this waterhole.
		Right -- here.

				LUDLOW
		Then that's where we're going.

	Burke flips open a manifest that he will carry with him at all
	times.  Inside, there are dozens of sketches of various kinds
	underneath.  As each vehicle ROARS out of the equipment
	container, Burke slips a waterproof eight by ten card with an
	icon of the various dinosaurs on the island into a slot in the
	dashboard.

				BURKE
			(calling them off)
		Hadrosaurus!  Carinthosaurus!
		Maiasaurus!

	As the procession goes on, Ludlow turns to DIETER STARK, the
	man we saw welding earlier.

				LUDLOW
		This is as good a place as any for
		base camp.  First priority is the
		laser barriers, I want them all up
		and running in thirty minutes.  Half
		an hour, understand?

	Dieter nods and turns to some of the HUNTERS, who number about
	twenty in all, that are working nearby.  But someone steps in
	front of Dieter, cutting him off.  It's ROLAND TEMBO, the
	hunter from the bar in Mombassa.

				ROLAND
		Cancel that, Dieter.

				LUDLOW
		What?  Why?

	Roland points to a stream running nearby.

				ROLAND
		Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do
		you want to set up base camp or an
		all-you-can-eat people bar?

				LUDLOW
			(thinks)
		You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new
		spot.  And remember, we're after
		herbivores only -- no unnecessary
		risks.

	Dieter SIGHS and goes to work.  Roland puts an arm around
	Ludlow and pulls him aside.

				ROLAND
		Peter, if you want me to run your
		little camping trip, there are two
		conditions.  First -- I'm in
		charge, and when I'm not around,
		Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the
		checks, tell us we're doing a good
		job, and open your case of scotch
		when we have a good day.  Second
		condition -- my fee.  You can keep
		it.  All I want in exchange for my
		services is the right to hunt one of
		the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck
		only.  Why and how are my business.
		If you don't  like either of those
		conditions, you're on your own.  Go
		ahead and set up your camp right
		here, or in a swamp, or in the middle
		of a rex nest, for all I care.  But
		I've been on too many safaris with
		rich dentists to listen to any more
		suicidal ideas.  Okay?

				LUDLOW
			(what else can he say?)
		Okay.

				ROLAND
		Good lad.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE

	The jungle foliage shivers, quakes, and finally falls as the
	Hunters' convoy ROARS into the hart of the jungle.  DIETER
	STARK stands in the front of the lead vehicle, the
	"speedbird," waving the convoy forward, his Driver (CARTER) at
	the wheel beside him.

	LUDLOW is in the back seat of the speedbird next to DR. BURKE.
	ROLAND and AJAY, his tracker, are in the second jeep.  They
	look up as the brakelights on the speedbird flash and the car
	stops, forcing the rest of the convoy to halt as well.

	In the front, the speedbird flashes its lights at something in
	front of it.  Dieter climbs out, plainly irritated.  He walks
	around the front of the car and sees --

	-- four PACHYCEPHALOSAURS eating grass in the middle of the
	jungle trail.  They're about five feet tall, thick, heavy-set
	animals whose distinctive feature is an enormous skull casing,
	a tall, impressive crown that rises on the tops of their
	heads.  Dieter doesn't seem impressed.  He looks back at
	Ludlow, who look at Dr. Burke.

	Burke stands up in his seat, a look of wonder on his face.

				BURKE
		Pachycephalosaurus!

				LUDLOW
		Carnivore?

				BURKE
			(enchanted)
		Huh?  No!  No, herbivore, late
		Cretaceous.  Very unusual plant
		eater, see that distinctive domed
		skull?  That's nine inches of solid
		bone.

				LUDLOW
			(who cares?)
		Just get them out of the way, Dieter.

				DIETER
		COME ON, MOVE IT!!

	The pachys look up at him sluggishly, still eating, like cows
	chewing their cuds.  As unimpressive with him as he is with
	them, they go back to their grass.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		Oh, for God's --

	He slings his rifle off his  shoulder and aims it at the
	closest animal.  Behind him, Roland has climbed out of the
	second jeep.

				ROLAND
		Dieter.  This is a round-up, not a
		war.  Use your powers of persuasion.

	Dieter gestures to the speedbird to pull ahead, which it does,
	slowly, toward the animals.  The pachys look up, alert, but do
	not move.  Dieter walks toward them.

				DIETER
		Come on, come on, don't have all
		day!

				BURKE
			(going on to no one in
			 particular)
		See, the pachy's neck attaches at the
		bottom of its skull instead of the
		back of its head, as with reptiles.

	The speedbird draws closer.  The first pachy stares at it
	intently.  The lead vehicle gets closer, closer --

	-- and BANGS into the pachy, knocking it back a few feet, out
	of the way.

				BURKE (cont'd)
		So when it lowers its head, its neck
		lines up directly with its
		backbone --

	BEHIND DIETER,

	Ajay is staring at something on the ground at his feet.  He
	takes a few steps further into the foliage, then turns back
	toward Roland.

				AJAY
		Roland.

	UP AT THE FRONT,

	the pachys turn and hop away.  Dieter turns and heads back to
	the speedbird.  As he reaches for the door, a VOICE calls
	"look out!" from behind him.  Dieter spins around, just in
	time to see --

	-- the first pachy in full charge.  It SLAMS headfirst into
	the speedbird, SMASHING the headlights and denting the grill.

				BURKE
			(concluding his lecture)
		Which is perfect for absorbing
		impact.

	Dieter turns and runs around to the front of the car.  The
	pachy has backed up  for another run and is now CHARGING RIGHT
	AT HIM.

	Dieter retreats, quickly, and rips open the passenger door to
	protect himself.

	SLAM!  The pachy clobbers the door, sending Dieter flying
	against the car, knocking the wind out of him.

	In the other jeeps, the rest of the HUNTERS stand up or lean
	out the window for a better look, laughing.

	POW!!  The pachy head-butts the tire next to Dieter.  It
	bounces off, tumbles to the ground, and rolls to its feet as
	Dieter gets to his knees and crawls toward the back of the
	speedbird.

	But the pachy is quicker and lunges at Dieter again.  He's
	forced to hit the dirt and crawls quickly underneath the
	speedbird, just as the animal SLAMS into the rear of the
	vehicle.

	Now the other three animals join the jun.  Ludlow and the
	Driver have to cover their heads as the animals lunge at the
	car again and again, SMASHING the steel-meshed windows and
	MANGLING the quarter panels.  The rest of the group watches,
	vastly amused.

	A FEW STEPS INTO THE JUNGLE,

	Ajay and Roland are staring at something on the ground -- an
	animal footprint, three-toed, enormous.

				AJAY
		It matches the pictures.

				ROLAND
		It certainly does.

	Roland gets up and goes back to his vehicle, ignoring the
	pachy demolition derby that continues up at the speedbird.
	Roland opens a case in the back of the jeep, revealing --

	-- his gun.  It's an antique elephant gun, a double barreled
	.600 Nitro Express.  Nearly a hundred years old, it's still in
	immaculate condition, its rosewood stock buttery smooth,
	bisons delicately engraved along its silver breach.

	The barrels are twenty-four inches long, topped with an ivory
	bead foresight at the business end.  Roland scoops up the gun,
	breaks the breach, and pulls two rounds of ammunition from his
	shirt pocket.

	Four inches long and three-quarters of an inch in diameter,
	these are the largest full metal jacket cartridges ever made.
	He slips one into each barrel and heads back into the bush.

	Roland pauses before he goes, as if noticing the animals
	trashing the speedbird for the first time.

				ROLAND
		HEY!

	The pachys all freeze, staring at him.  Roland waves one hand,
	HISSES sharply between his teeth --

	-- and the pachys scatter, back into the jungle.  Takes care
	of that problem.  Roland turns and heads back into the jungle,
	calling out over his shoulder to Ludlow.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Don't worry about us.  We'll catch
		up.

				LUDLOW
		Where do you think you're going?!

				ROLAND
		To collect my fee.

	And with that he disappears into the foliage.

	The Driver of the Speedbird drops it into gear and the
	battered car GROANS forward.  As it moves ahead, it reveals
	DIETER, lying underneath it, ego bruised worse than body.

	IN THE JUNGLE,

	Ajay takes a step into the bush, but at a ninety degree
	angle away from the direction in which the animals tracks
	lead.

				ROLAND
		Ajay.

	Ajay turns.  Roland points in the direction in which the
	footprints lead.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		I'm no tracker, but even I can read
		this spoor.

				AJAY
		Do you wish to go where the animal
		has been, or where the animal is?

	Roland smiles.  Ajay sets off in his direction and Roland
	follows.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. ISLAND RIDGE - DAY

	Seen from a ridge above them, the hunters' convoy continues to
	plow through the jungle.  But how the hunters themselves are
	being tracked, followed by the GATHERERS.  They scurry along
	as fast as they can, trying to keep pace with the moving
	vehicle below.

				EDDIE
		Why didn't you tell us about these
		guys, Ian?!

				MALCOLM
		Because I didn't know!  I don't have
		the faintest idea what they're doing
		here.

				NICK
			(angry)
		Ruining everything, that's what
		they're doing.  You could choke on
		the diesel smoke already!

				SARAH
		Ian, nothing we observe will be valid
		if we're trailing along in the wake
		of an army.

	Kelly has a pair of binoculars and is studying the vehicles as
	they move below.

				KELLY
		"InGen."  What's InGen?

				MALCOLM
		Where does it say that?

				KELLY
		On the side of that one truck.

	Malcolm takes the binoculars and stares down there himself.

				JUTTSON
		InGen is a genetics corporation,
		isn't it?

				NICK
			(to Malcolm)
		Is that who we're really working
		for?!  Gene splicers?!

				MALCOLM
		No!  We're an independently funded
		expedition.

				SARAH
		Funded by whom?

				MALCOLM
		John Hammond.

				JUTTSON
		But he's the head of InGen!

				NICK
		You gotta be kidding.
			(to Malcolm)
		You dragged me out of Greenpeace to
		be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't
		get anybody else?

				KELLY
		Yeah, what have you done, Dad?

				SARAH
		We'd better keep moving, or we'll
		lose them.

	The group moves on ahead, but Malcolm lingers, angry, staring
	through the binoculars.

				MALCOLM
		What are you doing to me, John?

							CUT TO:

	EXT. THE CAVES - DAY

	AJAY and ROLAND make their way through the foliage and come
	into a small clearing, where a cluster of caves is carved into
	the rock.  Ajay freezes, gesturing ahead, to the cave on the
	far left.

	Roland pulls up a handful of grass and releases it on the
	breeze.  It floats back between his legs.  That's good.

	He proceeds toward the cave, carefully, Ajay behind him.  They
	can see nothing beyond the yawning mouth of the cave, only a
	black interior.

	Roland pauses, looking down.  On the ground to his right he
	sees the partially eastern leg of a creature.  It's old,
	crawling with white maggots and flies.

	Roland continues on.  Closer to the cave, he now passes the
	skull of a large animal, some of the flesh and green skin
	still adhering to the bone.  It, too, is covered with flies.

	Still he continues on.  A short rise leads into the cave, and
	they edge up it.  From inside the cave, they can hear an odd
	SQUEAKING sound, very high-pitched.

	Crawling now, Roland and Ajay scale a four-foot circular
	rampart of dried mud, and peer into --

	-- the tyrannosaur nest.  It's flattered inside, about ten
	feet in diameter, completely encircled by earthen walls.

	A BABY TYRANNOSAUR, about four and a half feet long, is in the
	center of the nest.  It has a large head, very large eyes, and
	its body is covered with a fluffy red down, which gives it a
	scraggly appearance.

	It SQUEAKS repeatedly, tearing awkwardly at the remains of a
	chunk of animal flesh, biting decisively with tiny, sharp
	teeth.

	The cave itself is a foul boneyard.  ANIMAL CARCASSES litter
	the edges, flies BUZZ in the captive air.  Roland raises a
	bandana to his nose to cover the stench.  He  turns to Ajay and
	WHISPERS.

				ROLAND
		It's the rex nest.

	Ajay nods.  The baby tyrannosaur hears the whisper and looks
	up, cocking its head in curiosity.

				AJAY
		Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck
		to return?

				ROLAND
			(shakes his head no)
		If the nest is upwind, so are we.
		When he comes back, he'll know we're
		here before we have a chance.  The
		truck --

	In the nest below, the baby SQUEAKS angrily at the intruders.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		-- is to get him to come where we
		want him.

	The baby SQUEAKS again, indignant.  Roland turns and looks
	down at it.  Thinking.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. RIDGE - DUSK

	As the sun glows bright orange on the horizon, NICK raises a
	pair of binoculars to his eyes and peers down at the vista
	below the ridge.

	In the lenses of the binoculars, we can clearly see a mixed
	herd of midsized herbivores -- HARDOSAURS, PACHYCEPHALOSAURS,
	and CALLIMIMUSES -- racing across the plain below.
	
	MALCOLM, also staring through binoculars, lies on the ridge
	beside him.  SARAH is several feet behind them, her back
	pressed against a tree, unwilling to go to the lip of the
	ridge.

	THROUGH NICK'S BINOCULARS

	We see a shaky point of view of the herd running.  The
	binoculars whip to the right --

	-- revealing a jeep chasing the herd  Not just one jeep, in
	fact, but a whole FLEET OF HUNTER PURSUIT VEHICLES!

	There are two herding jeeps, one motorcycle, as speedier
	mini-jeep, and, further behind, a container truck and a
	wrangler's pickup truck.

	Although there's a great deal of commotion below, up here it's
	almost eerily silent.

	ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick lowers the binoculars, angry.  When he raises them again,
	the sun FLARES off the lens --

	EXT. THE PLAIN - DUSK

	-- and when the brilliant flare clears, we're right down in
	the middle of the roundup.  Engines ROAR, wheels spin and dig
	in the dirt, men SHOUT and radios SQUAWK as the hunter
	vehicles pursue the fleeting herd they're flushed.

	The HUNTER SHOUT and SHRIEK with glee, incredulous and
	thrilled by the spectacular animals they're pursuing.

				HUNTER
		LOOK AT THESE THINGS!

				HUNTER 2
		THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL, MAN, THEY'RE
		BEAUTIFUL!!!

	One of the pursuit vehicles (a "snagger"), pulls ahead of the
	others.  DIETER STARK stands in the passenger seat, holding a
	long pole with a noose dangling from the end of it.

	He swings the pole out over the side of the jeep and SHOUTS to
	the driver.

				DIETER
		FASTER!

	The Driver hits the gas and the snagger leaps forward, gaining
	on the herd.  Aware of the danger behind them, the herd veers
	to the right, toward the cover of thick jungle --

	-- but the motorcycle ROARS in from the right side, cutting
	them off, herding them back out into the open.

	BACK IN THE CONTAINER TRUCK,

	PETER LUDLOW stands in a "conning tower," a command post in
	the heaviest pursuit vehicle.  He BARKS into a walkie-talkie.

				LUDLOW
		Alive, Dieter, and uninjured!

	BACK ON THE SNAGGER,

	the Driver can barely keep up with the twists and feints
	thrown by the herd ahead of him.  Dieter CURSES and throws the
	lasso pole into the back of the jeep.  Ludlow's voice
	continues over the radio in Dieter's jeep.

				LUDLOW (o.s.)
		Those are very expensive animals!
		Can you hear me?!

				DIETER
			(to the Driver)
		Turn that off!

	The Driver SNAPS off the radio as Dieter grabs a long-barreled
	rifle from the back of the vehicle.

	THE MOTORCYCLE

	guns it again, forcing the herd back into the middle of the 
	plain.  From the trees to the left, two heads on enormous
	necks rise up in alarm.  Two APATOSAURS are startled from the
	bush and lumber out across the middle of the plain.

	The herd doesn't even break stride, but keeps running,
	scampering after the giants and stampeding right between their
	massive legs.

	One smaller pachycephalosaur bolts loose, but the motorcycle
	cuts it off and herds it back into the middle, which now takes
	the motorcycle right through the rising and falling legs of
	the apotosaurs.

	The bike chases the pachy out the other side, and as the
	apatosaurs disappear into the distance, the cycle isolates the
	juvenile.

	Another truck, a "scissor rig," spots the isolated animal.
	High in the back of the truck, a HUNTER mans a tranquilizer
	cannon, drawing a bead on the pachy as the cycle runs it down.

	He FIRES and the tranquilizer dart hits the animal in the
	neck.  Its pace slows and another HUNTER from the truck tosses
	a lasso around its neck.

	They crank a winch, reeling in the animal.

	As the truck gain on it, two six-foot padded arms with what
	look like heavy airbags on the insides open up on the front of
	the truck.

	As the animal is pulled in, the scissors close with a
	hydraulic WHIR, trapping the animal between its airbags.

	Now a pick-up rig ROARS up and drops its back gate.  The
	scissor rig rolls forward, depositing the squirming pachy in
	this dino-contaiment vehicle.

	Two HUNTERS throw levers on the side of the scissor bars and
	the scissor rig backs away, leaving the animal, still pinched
	between the bars, imprisoned in the back of the pick-up rig.

	The Hunters quickly fit new scissor bars onto the scissor rig
	and it takes off, back into the hunt.

	BACK ON THE SNAGGER,

	Dieter, rifle in hand, drops down into the passenger seat,
	whips a harness over himself and CLICKS it into place.  He
	jabs his thumb into a flashing red button in the dashboard.

	Immediately, a motor underneath the seat HUMS to life and the
	seat itself telescopes, extending a good four feet out to

	Dieter raises the gun, picks a CARINTHOSAUR, a red-crested
	herbivore, from the rear of the fleeting herd, and takes aim.

	BANG!!

	The carinthosaur staggers as a tranquilizer dart sticks in
	its left hindquarter.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	there is utter quiet.  Nick and the others stare wordlessly at
	the spectacle below.

	DOWN ON THE PLAIN,

	the snagger SHUDDERS to a halt in the dirt, kicking up a huge
	cloud of dust and dirt.

	The motorcycle spins to a stop beside it, its DRIVER pushing
	his mask up to reveal his sweat and dirt-streaked face.

	The wrangler truck backs up and drops its rear door, which
	CLANGS heavily to the ground.

	FOUR WRANGLERS carrying wire noose poles and chains race down
	the ramp and out of the truck.

	Dieter jumps off the snagger.  He puts down his tranquilizer
	gun, picks up a long steel rod, and walks forward slowly.
	Ahead of him, the carinthosaur is still on its feet.

	The sedated animal staggers, fighting to retain its balance
	while it is surrounded by the wary Wranglers.

				DIETER
		Easy -- easy -- not too close!
		Full extension!

	The Wranglers adjust their poles, extending them another three
	feet, which allows them to stay further from the reeling, ten
	foot tall animal.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		Now!

	Almost as one, the Wranglers flip their noose over the
	stunned animal's neck.  It thrashes, but the Wranglers hold
	their poles tightly, surrounding and immobilizing it.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick turns away.  He can't watch.

	DOWN ON THE PLAIN,

	a bolero-type device, a rope with a round weight at either
	end, whips around the carinthosaur's legs.  The animal THUDS
	to the dirt with a SNORT of a defeat.

	Ludlow steps up next to Dieter and both of them stare down at
	the helpless animal.  Ludlow's breathing heavily, eyes
	glowing.

	The animal is still thrashing, pumping its legs crazily.
	Dieter turns a knob on the side of the steel rod he's holding
	and thrusts it into the defenseless animal's neck.

	A blue arc of electricity CRACKS and dances over the
	carinthosaur's body.  The animal convulses in pain, a
	horrible, high-pitched SQUEALING rips the air.

	DR. BURKE, their paleontologist, hurries forward with a
	syringe.

	He draws a certain amount of tranquilizer from a bottle and
	injects it into the animal's thigh.

	CARTER, Dieter's Driver, steps up with a can of spray paint
	and quickly tags the animal with an ID number in day-glo
	orange.

	Dieter pulls the card with an icon of a carinthosaur from the
	dashboard of the jeep and marks a black X over the drawing of
	the animal.

				DIETER
		Next case.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. RIDGE - NIGHT

	Night has fallen over the island.  The hunters have
	established base camp in an area they have trampled and
	cleared just below the ridge.  Blue laser fences encircle the
	perimeter.  Inside, half a dozen tents are set up around a
	central campfire.

	The vehicles are all parked at one end, away from the tents.
	At the other end, there is a row of at least a dozen "capture
	containers," cages that hold the imprisoned dinosaurs they
	have already rounded up.

	SARAH, MALCOLM, and NICK stand at the edge of the ridge above,
	looking down at the scene.  Sarah stands a bit further back
	from the others, not wanting to get too close to the edge.
	VOICES waft up to them, raucous, LAUGHING, some even SINGING.

	DR. JUTTSON has a pair of night-vision binoculars trained on
	the cages.

				JUTTSON
		Carinthosaurus -- compsognathus --
		triceratops -- pachycephalosaurus --
		or small scavengers only.

	Malcolm, also with binoculars, furrows his brow, seeing
	something below.

	THROUGH MALCOLM'S BINOCULARS,

	he sees PETER LUDLOW, standing in the middle of the camp,
	pointing, giving orders.

	ON THE RIDGE,

	Malcolm drops the binoculars.

				MALCOLM
		Ludlow.  That's why Hammond was in
		such a hurry for me to get here.  He
		knew they were coming.

	He gives the binoculars to Sarah, who moves forward gingerly.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		You okay?

				SARAH
			(irritated)
		Heights, I can't help it.  Put your
		arm here, will you?

	She puts his arm around her waits, to steady her while she is
	close to the cliff edge.

				JUTTSON
		What do they want?

				MALCOLM
		They want their money back.  To
		InGen, this island is nothing more
		than a bed investment.

				JUTTSON
		We should get back to base camp.
		Eddie's waiting for us.

				MALCOLM
		I can't believe Peter Ludlow's
		running all this.

				SARAH
		He isn't.  Check out the guy walking
		past the fire.

	She hands the binoculars to Malcolm.

	THROUGH THE BINOCULARS,

	Malcolm sees ROLAND, who's walking with AJAY, weapons and
	equipment slung over their shoulders.

				SARAH (o.s.)
		I've seen him before.  In Brazil.  He
		and that guy with him were
		spearhunting jaguars.  Said it was
		immoral to go after them any other
		way.  He's not just a hunter, he's a
		philosopher.  Kind of guy who beats
		you up with your own argument.

	BACK ON THE RIDGE,

				SARAH (cont'd)
		He's the one in charge.

				MALCOLM
		Well, if that's true -- the man in
		charge just left camp.

	Nick, who has been quietly fuming next to them, now steps
	forward.

				NICK
		Then this is our chance.

				MALCOLM
		Our chance to do what?

				NICK
		I don't know these guys, but I know
		'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese
		whalers, French barges trying to dump
		barrels of nuclear waste in the North
		Atlantic.  They're all the same.
		They spray us with water cannon when
		we try to stop 'em, sink our boats,
		and then call us crazy.

	He rummages through his pack, coming up with various tools.  A
	hunting knife.  A bolt cutter.

				NICK (cont'd)
		Nobody has to come with me.  I've
		done this before.

				SARAH
		Why, Nick.  You are a tree-hugger.

	He looks at her, hurt.

				NICK
		There' no reason for name calling.

				MALCOLM
		Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back
		to camp right away.  Leave the other
		car for us and we'll meet you there
		in an hour or so.

				KELLY
		What are you guys gonna do?

				MALCOLM
			(signs)
		Exactly what John Hammond wanted us
		to do.

							CUT TO:

	INT. TENT - HUNTER'S CAMP - NIGHT

	In the hunters' supply tent, a case of twelve-year-old scotch
	sits open amid crate after crate of weapons and ammunition.
	PETER LUDLOW reaches in and pulls a bottle out.

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	In the jungle, LUDLOW approaches a small clearing.  ROLAND is
	bent over a small stake in the ground, chaining something to
	it.  As Ludlow approaches and walks around him, he sees what
	protest.  Roland looks up.

				ROLAND
		Offering a little incentive.

	Ludlow laughs and shakes his head.  He takes a drink and
	offers Roland one.  Roland accepts.  Ludlow notices Roland's
	gun leaning against a tree.

				LUDLOW
		What kind of gun is that?

				ROLAND
		My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made
		in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to
		him after he took down his last
		elephant.  8700 foot pound striking
		force.

				LUDLOW
		How close do you have to be?

				ROLAND
		Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume
		it'll take a slug in the brain case
		to bring him down.

				LUDLOW
		Why not just use a scope and a poison
		dart and snipe him from a hill?

	Roland just looks at him.

				ROLAND
		Or a laser beam from a satellite?

	Ludlow leans down, close to the baby rex, and examines it
	while it thrashes on its chain.  Its mouth has been bound shut
	with a leather strap.

				LUDLOW
		You rally think this'll draw the
		parent?

				ROLAND
		I once saw a bull elephant die
		charging a jeep.  All the jeep had
		done was startle the bull's calves.
		I saw a lioness carry wounded prey
		four and a half miles, all the way
		back to its den, just to teach its
		cubs how to finish off a kill.

				LUDLOW
		Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.

				ROLAND
		Rex won't be any different.  It'll
		come.

				LUDLOW
		You're kidding yourself.  An adult
		T-rex cares about one thing --
		filling its own belly.  It acts the
		way people wish they could, that's
		why everyone's fascinated by it.  If
		people had the chance to see one
		dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine
		percent would --

	He stops, an idea on his face.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Wait.  Why not?  Sedatives...
		growth inhibitors...

				ROLAND
		What?

				LUDLOW
		I hadn't planned on bringing
		carnivores back because of the
		liability risk, but I only thought of
		adults, it never occurred to me --
			(close to the animal)
		You are a billion dollar idea, my
		little f-

	CRACK!  The tyrannosaur, even with its jaws clamped shut,
	lunges at Ludlow's face, head-butting him right across the
	bridge of the nose.  Ludlow staggers back, WAITING in pain,
	clutching his bleeding face.

	Roland laughs.  Ludlow, like an enraged child, snatches up
	Roland's gun and brings the butt down viciously on the rex's
	leg.  The bone breaks with a dry SNAP and the animal HOWLS in
	pain.

	Roland lunges and throws Ludlow to the ground, but the damage
	is done.

				ROLAND
		What the hell you do that for?!

	As his pain eases, Ludlow feels a bit foolish, but he attempts
	to cover.

				LUDLOW
		Had to.  To keep him still for the
		trip.

				ROLAND
		You've broken its leg!

				LUDLOW
		We've got to transport it seven
		thousand miles.  Would you prefer it
		bit off the leg of a crew member?

	He gets up, brushes himself off, and heads back to the camp,
	trying to salvage his dignity.  Roland watches him go.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. EDGE OF HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	At the edge of the hunters' camp, NICK, SARAH, and MALCOLM
	scramble down a hillside and stop at the edge of the laser
	barriers.  There are three beams, each about two feet apart,
	the tallest almost six feet off the ground.

	Nick reaches the edge and crouches.  Sarah, helped by Malcolm,
	steps up onto his back and jumps over the top, landing with a
	CRUNCH.  Nick is next, given a boost by Malcolm, who is then
	left alone on the other side.

	He backs up a few steps, jogs right at the lasers, then
	springs off his good leg --

	-- and does the Fosburry Flop right over the top.  He lands
	with a THUD, to the silent admiration of the other two.

	FURTHER IN THE CAMP,

	the three of them creep along, hiding behind a stack of fuel
	barrels.  They lean around the edge for a look.  They're
	directly behind the row of vehicle.

	They move, into the open, covering the ground between them and
	the jeeps.  Reaching them, Nick hits the dirt and wriggles
	under the first one.  Malcolm and Sarah stand lookout.

	UNDER THE JEEP,

	Nick pulls the bolt cutter from his back pocket.  He squirms
	along until he finds the jeep's fuel line --

	-- and he snips it.  He ducks out of the way just as the
	stream of fuel begins to pour into the dirt.

	MALCOLM AND SARAH

	move slowly down the line, standing watch as Nick crawls out
	from under the first jeep and proceeds to the second.  They
	hear another SNIP, then keep moving, to cover him as he moves
	to the third.

	From in the distance, Malcolm hears a sound, a faint,
	high-pitched SCREECHING.  He turns and looks to that
	direction.

	EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT

	It's the baby T-rex, still SCREENING.  Up in a nearby tree,
	ROLAND and AJAY have spread some broken branches crosswise to
	form a high hide of their own about ten feet off the ground.

	They wait.

	Roland raises his binoculars.  The light of the camp spills
	all the way out here, illuminating some of the jungle.  He
	scans it, searching for any sign of movement.

	EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	Back in the camp, Sarah, Malcolm, and Nick have finished with
	all of the vehicles except the badly battered one, which is
	parked some distance away, undergoing repairs.  The motor pool
	area is now a soggy lake of spilled gasoline.

	The saboteurs walk casually across the camp, unnoticed in the
	drunken revelry.  They pass several tents, the shadows of the
	partiers visible as they move inside.

	They continue across the camp and arrive at the other side --

	-- to face the caged animals.  The carinthosaur that was
	tranquilized earlier stands there dully, eyes heavy and
	glassy, still under the effects.  They pass a stegosaur, its
	row of fine bristling.

	And finally they reach the largest cage, which houses a
	triceratops the size of a pickup truck, Nick pulls out his
	trusty bolt cutters.  He looks at them, a glint in his eye.

				NICK
		Hang on.  We may encounter some
		turbulence.

	INT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	In one of the hunter tents, PETER LUDLOW leans over the
	satellite recon pictures of the island, planning the next
	day's assault with DIETER and DR. BURKE, their paleontologist.
	There are small wooden dinosaur models scattered around the
	photos, indicating where certain species can be found.

				BURKE
		If you're really interested in
		infants, we'll have better luck at
		the seaside, because the sands offer
		a cushioning surface where the egg
		clutches can -- can --

	He trails off.  A low RUMBLING sound can be heard outside, and
	the little wooden dinosaurs start shaking on the board.

	They look at each other.  The RUMBLING gets louder.  Outside,
	someone SHOUTS; on the board, the little dinosaurs start
	hopping and bouncing from the vibrations, the SHOUTS outside
	turn to SCREAMS, they turn and look at the back of the tent --

	-- and the triceratops bursts right through the canvas!

	EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

	HUNTERS go flying as the tent-covered triceratops, its horns
	tearing through the canvas, RUMBLES across the camp.  Men
	SHOUT in alarm, the triceratops BELLOWS in anger and
	confusion, chaos reigns.

	In the crush of PEOPLE running every which way, MALCOLM and
	SARAH are swept off in one direction while NICK is buffeted
	in another.  They SHOUT, but cannot be heard over the frey.

	The triceratops, blinded by the canvas shroud, stomps right
	through the fire in the middle of the camp AND THE TENT BURSTS
	INTO FLAME.

	Now really upset, the animal panics and lashes out in all
	directions, blasting through tents, demolishing and/or setting
	ablaze anything that gets in its way.  Its considerable
	hindquarters SLAM into a parked jeep, sending it rolling
	across the camp.

	The jeep flattens the largest tent and SLAMS down on its side.
	Its broken gas line SPRAYS gas over the ground, the gas hits
	one of the dozens of small blazes the triceratops has left in
	its wake, and the flame shoots up the ribbon of gas.

	The jeep explodes.

	OUT IN THE JUNGLE CLEARING,

	Roland and Ajay, up in the tree, leap to their feet as a
	fireball rises up from the camp in the distance.

				ROLAND
		What in God's -- !

	BACK IN THE CAMP,

	the rest of the newly-freed animals now storm through the
	camp.  The blue laser barriers bounce crazily and go out as
	the sending units are trampled underfoot by the fleeing
	animals.

	AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP,

	Nick takes advantage of the downed lasers to slip part the
	bordere of the camp and disappear into the jungle in one
	direction, while Malcolm and Sarah vanish in the other.

	The burning tent, which was the equipment tent, now detonates
	in a series of smaller EXPLOSIONS.

	Dieter and several others are knocked to the ground by the
	series of concessive blasts.  He drags himself up onto all
	fours, charred and bruised.  A burning tire rolls slowly past
	him, spinning to a stop --

	-- at ROLAND's feet.  Dieter looks up at him.

				ROLAND
		Last time I leave you in charge.

	OUT IN THE JUNGLE,

	Nick breaks out into the jungle clearing, the same one where
	Ajay and Roland had their blind.  He sees the baby tyrannosaur
	chained to the stake.

				NICK
		Sick bastards.

	He goes to the animal, which now BLEATS in pain, its broken
	leg hanging at an odd angle.  With one strong tug, Nick pulls
	the stake out of the ground.

	BACK IN THE CAMP,

	Roland surveys the destruction.  The fire has spread and
	several tents are now tongues of flame flapping in the air,
	the animals are gone or going, and their personnel are
	scattered and terrified.  PETER LUDLOW, breathless, face
	smeared with dirt, and smoke, staggers up to Roland.

				LUDLOW
		What in Christ's name is going on?!

				ROLAND
		Isn't it obvious?

	He holds up the sniped padlock from one of the animal cages.

				NICK (cont'd)
		We're not alone on this island.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	MALCOLM and SARAH race back up onto the ridge trail, where the
	green AAV is parked.  NICK bursts around from the other side
	of the car.

				SARAH
		Nick, thank God, we didn't know
		if --

	Malcolm opens the rear door.

				NICK
		Wait, don't ---

	With a piercing SHRIEK, the BABY TYRANNOSAUR, now in the back
	of the AAV, flings itself at the open doorway, jaws SNAPPING
	just short of Malcolm's nose.

				MALCOLM
		HOLY SHIT!!

	He SLAMS the door.

	DOWN IN THE HUNTERS' CAMP,

	Roland hears the commotion up on the ridge and looks up.

				ROLAND
		Do we have anyone up there?

	BACK UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Malcolm is confronting Nick.

				MALCOLM
		?!

 NICK 		It has a broken leg!

 MALCOLM 		So do it a favor and put it out of
		its misery!

 NICK 		No!  Get in the car before they hear 
		us!

	He runs around and leaps in the driver's seat.  Sarah slips
	into the passenger seat, quickly, leaving Malcolm no choice
	but the rear.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT 
	The AAV SLAPS through the jungle foliage.  From inside the
	car, we can hear the baby tyrannosaur SCREAMING in anger.

 INT. AAV - NIGHT 
	The baby writhes on the base seat next to Malcolm, who has
	flattened himself against the door, as far away from the
	animal as possible.

 SARAH 		Ian, close the window, it's going to
		wake every predator in the jungle!

	Malcolm leans over the enraged animal and cranks up its
	window.  The tyrannosaur SLASHES with one of its powerful hind
	legs, ripping the flesh of his forearm.  He SHOUTS in pain.

	Outside, the listening jungle whizzes by.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Up in the high hide, EDDIE, DR. JUTTSON, and KELLY are
	standing watch, scanning the jungle for any sign of their
	returning comrades.

	Juttson yanks the night-vision binoculars away from his face
	as he spots the AAV, pulling up to the base camp a couple
	hundred yards away.

 JUTTSON 		There they are!

	They all turn and look, but Eddie furrows his brow, watching
	them pull the wounded animal from the back seat.

 EDDIE 		What is that they have with them?

 EXT. CAMP - NIGHT 
	SARAH and NICK carry the SCREECHING baby tyrannosaur in their
	arms, headed for the trailer.  MALCOLM, holding his bleeding
	arm, isn't far behind.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	SARAH and NICK bring the SCREAMING infant to the metal dining
	table and hold it down.  MALCOLM is right behind them.

 MALCOLM 		This is exceedingly unwise.

	Sarah turns away from a drawer of medical supplies, holding a
	small syringe.  Her shirt is streaked with blood from the
	baby's injured leg.

 SARAH 		Too late to worry about that!  Hold
		him together, Nick!

	Nick tightens his grip on the animal and Sarah makes an
	injection into its thigh, over its loudly voiced objections.

 MALCOLM 		Just do whatever you have to do and
		get it out of here as quickly as
		possible.

	Sarah picks up a small ultrasound transducer and runs it over
	the animal's leg.  A green and white skeletal image appears on
	a monitor next to the table.

 SARAH 		Okay, there's the metatarsals --
		tibia, fibula -- there it is!  See
		it?  That's a fracture, just above
		the epiphysis.

	They peer closely at the monitor.

 NICK 		That little black line?

 SARAH 		That little black line means death
		for this infant.  The fibula won't
		heal straight, so the ankle joint
		can't pivot when he stands on his
		hind feet.  The baby won't be able to
		run, and probably can't even walk.
		It'll be crippled, and a predator
		will pick it off before it gets more
		than a few weeks old.

 MALCOLM 		Can you set up?

 SARAH 			(thinking)
		It has to be temporary, something
		that'll break apart and fall off as
		the animal grows...

 MALCOLM 		Think fast, Sarah.

	The tyrannosaur, still in pain, SHRIEKS again.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Through their binoculars, the rest of the group watches the
	trailer carefully.  Even inside, the animal's SCREECHES are
	clearly audible.  Kelly is getting scared.

 KELLY 		What are they doing?  Why don't
		they hurry?!

 EDDIE 		Give me the radio.

	From the trailer, the baby lets out a long, plaintive
 SHRIEK -- 
	One by one, Eddie, Kelly, and Juttson turn around and stare
	into the night jungle.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	NICK holds the animal while SARAH fits an aluminum foil cuff
	around its injured leg and paints it with a coating of resin.
	MALCOLM, at the window, stares out anxiously.  The animal
	thrashes again.

 NICK 		Give it more morphine!

 SARAH 		We'll kill it with too much, we'll
		put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm
		almost done.  Damn it, I need
		another adhesive, something pliable I
		can --

	Her eyes fall on Nick.  She holds out her hand, urgently.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Spit!

	He spits his bubblegum into the palm of her hand.  The baby
	rex CRIES OUT again.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	From the swaying jungle, there is another answering ROAR.

	And this one's closer.

	In the high hide, the rest of the group stares, trembling.  In
	the distance, a flock of birds SHRIEKS and takes flight as the
	tops of some trees move, a whole section of forest suddenly
	coming alive, as if brushed by wind.

	But it's not the wind.

	They hear noises, THUDS in the jungle.  And then another
	section of forest trembles.  Closer.  Another flock of birds
	bursts out of the treetops and swarms past the high hide.

 KELLY 		What is it?

	Dr. Juttson puts an arm around Kelly, instinctively pulling
	her closer to him.  Eddie WHISPERS urgently into the
	walkie-talkie.

 EDDIE 		Sarah, come in!

 JUTTSON 		It's moving.  Fast.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	There is a radio box mounted on the far wall of the trailer.
	The speaker BUZZES urgently with Eddie's VOICE.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Sarah, Malcolm, can you hear me?!

	On the table, Sarah is frantically molding Nick's bubblegum
	into place on the makeshift splint.  But the baby rex,
	regaining its strength, is thrashing again.

 SARAH 		Hold it down, Nick!

 NICK 		I'm trying!

				EDDIE (o.s.)
			(from the radio)
		Is anybody there?!

	Malcolm moves to answer the radio, but Sarah SHOUTS to him.

 SARAH 		Ian, get the bottle of amoxicillin
		and fill a syringe!  Quick injection
		of antibiotics and I can get it out
		of here!

	Forsaking the radio, Malcolm moves to the medicine drawer and
	comes up with what she wants.  Working fast, he draws twenty
	cc's of the pink liquid.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
			(still from the radio, now
			 desperate)
 SARAH OR IAN, ANSWER ME! 
	They ignore him as Sarah grabs the syringe and makes the
	injection.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
 WHATEVER YOU BROUGHT INTO THE TRAILER, GET IT OUT NOW! 
 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Eddie has given up on whispering as he clutches the radio
	desperately.

 EDDIE WE ESTIMATE TWO LARGE ADULTS HEADED IN YOUR DIRECTION! I REPEAT -- 
 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Nick, Sarah, and Malcolm spin around at hearing that terrible
	piece of information.

 MALCOLM 		Oh, Christ.

	He bolts over to the wall speaker and hits the button.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Let me talk to Kelly, is she--

	A deafening ROAR sound from just outside the trailer,
	followed immediately by a CRASHING sound.  They whirl and look
	to the window, just in time to see --

	--  the AAV tumbling by, rolling on its side!

	There is another ROAR, and the baby, on the table, ROARS in
	response.  Outside the window, the head of a full-grown
	TYRANNOSAURUS REX lowers and peers inside.

	Malcolm, Sarah, and Nick all freeze in absolute terror.

	The rex outside GURGLES, making material cooing noises.  The
	baby rex, calm for the first time, GURGLES back.

	But across the trailer, in the opposite window, ANOTHER T-REX
 HEAD SUDDENLY APPEARS. 
	This one ROARS, deeply, a roar so low and loud it rattles
	anything in the trailer that isn't tied down.

 NICK 		What do they want?!

 MALCOLM 		What do you think they want?!

 SARAH 		That's impossible, they can't have
		the sensory equipment to track it all
		the way here!

 MALCOLM 		Current evidence seems to be to the
		contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT
 TO THEM! 
	Nick, hands shaking, grabs the shoulder video camera he used
	earlier.  He whips out the cassette that's in there, hurls it
	into an open duffel bag with half a dozen others, SLAMS a
	fresh cassette in, and flicks the "ON" switch.

	Sarah and Malcolm, meanwhile, hurry to the other end of the
	trailer, carrying the baby rex.  Outside, the two adult rexes
	stay with them, walking in the same direction, watching them
	through the window.

 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Seen from outside, the light inside the trailers clearly
	illuminates Sarah and Malcolm as they carry the bay rex.  The
	adult rexes tower over the trailer, twice as tall and nearly
	as long.  They walk slowly alongside it, hunched over,
	watching their infant.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	At the door to the trailer, Sarah un-muzzles the frantic baby.

 SARAH 		Ready?

	Malcolm reaches for the door handle.

 NICK 		Wait!

	He dives down on the floor under them, pointing the video
	camera up at the door, getting the best shot.  Malcolm takes a
	breath, turns the knob, and throws open the door.

	Outside, the enormous rex heads pause for a moment, staring,
	surprised.

	Although terrified, Sarah actually starts to sing.

 SARAH 			(softly)
		Born free, as free as the wind blows.
		As free as the grass grows --

 MALCOLM 		Are you insane?!

 SARAH 		I swear to God, it works with lions
		sometimes!  There we are -- your baby
		is free --

	The baby, excited, wriggles free of them and lands on the
	ground outside.  Not wasting a second, Malcolm SLAMS the door
	shut.

	The three of them freeze, not daring to breath.  Outside, they
	can hear the SNUFFLING and COOING of the animals as they
	inspect their young --

	-- and then the soft THUD of their footsteps, growing fainter
	as they move away.

	From the wall, EDDIE'S VOICE comes over the radio, relieved.

 EDDIE 		They're going back into the jungle.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	EDDIE, JUTTSON, and KELLY sag back against the railings of the
	high hide.

 EDDIE 		Thank God.  Thank God.

	MALCOLM'S VOICE comes over the radio.

				MALCOLM (o.s.)
		Kelly?  Are you all right?

	She takes the radio, her voice shaky.

 KELLY 		Uh huh.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM is at the radio.

 MALCOLM 		Wait there.  I'll come up in a
		minute.  Don't move, understand?

				KELLY (o.s.)
		I understand.

	Malcolm slump against the wall of the trailer.  SARAH and
	NICK sit on the floor leaning against the opposite wall,
	completely drained.  Sarah pulls out her pocket recorder and
	speaks shakily into it.

 SARAH 		Note to Dr. Juttson -- Tyrannosaurus
		rex does nurture its young.

	They laugh weakly.

 NICK 		There's, uh -- there's an unwritten
		rule when a news crew is in a war
		zone.  You stop the van every two
		miles and decide whether or not to go
		on.  Whether or not you feel lucky.
		One "no" from anybody in the group
		and you turn around right there, no
		question asked, nobody embarrassed.
			(pause)
		Well?  Do we go on?
	Immediately:

 SARAH 		No.

 MALCOLM 		No.

 NICK 		No way.

	They all laugh.

 MALCOLM 		All right.  I'm satisfied with the
		evidence we have right now.
		I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will
		too.
			(to Sarah)
		Do you have enough to publish?

 SARAH 		They will come after me.  But I can
		collect some stool samples, for DNA
		with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest
		of you to back me up, it should stand
		when we get back.

 MALCOLM 			(getting up)
		Then the only thing left to do is
		make sure we do get back.  I'll
		call the mainland on the satellite
		phone and have them send the boat
		right now.  This expedition is over.

	He goes to the desk and picks up the heavy gray satellite
	phone that's resting in a battery pack.  The front panel
	lights up, a brilliant green.

	But from the wall speaker, the radio CRACKLES and EDDIE'S
	VOICE breaks through, soft and empty.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Oh, God.  I am so sorry.

	Malcolm and Sarah look at the speaker box.

 MALCOLM 		What the hell is he sorry f-

	A low RATTLE sneaks into the trailer.  Malcolm, Sarah, and
	Nick takes a step forward from the walls, looking around.  The
	RATTLE gets louder, the trailer shakes and vibrates,
	everything in it starts to BANG against the walls --

	-- and something huge SMASHES into the side of the trailer.

	They're all thrown against the far wall, there is an
	earsplitting CRACK of electricity, the entire trailer rocks
	and sparks a brilliant blue, and then everything goes black.

	The satellite phone flies out of Malcolm's hands and SMACKS
	against the wall.  It lands on the floor, its number pad still
	glowing green.

	Nick crawls over and looks out one of the windows.  Outside,
	the flank of one of the tyrannosaurs wipes past the window,
	revealing the second tyrannosaur, charging straight at the
	trailer!

 NICK HANG ON TO SOMETHING! 
	They hurl themselves at the nearest solid object and hang on
	for dear life.  The charging rex SLAM into the side of the
	trailer, which rocks up on one side, BANGS back  down, and is
	quickly RAMMED again by the furious animal.  This time the
	entire trailer rolls over, completely upside down.

	Sarah, Nick, and Malcolm let go of their precarious handholds
	and drop onto the ceiling.  The tables, chairs, lab equipment,
	everything that's bolted down clings to the floor above them;
	everything that isn't RAINS DOWN ON THEM.

	But the rexes aren't done.  The trailer JOLTS INTO MOTION,
	sliding forwards.

 SEEN FROM OUTSIDE, 
	the upside down trailer, which is the rear of the two
	trailers, slides along the muddy ground, pushing up earth in
	front of it.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
 SARAH 		They're pushing us!

	Malcolm, frantic, crawls up to a window to get a look outside.
	He looks down and sees a T-rex footprint in the earth outside
	as they move past it.

	He cranks his head to get a look at the direction in which
	they are being pushed.  His eyes widen at something he sees
	outside the window.

 MALCOLM 		Oh, God.

 SARAH 		What?!

 MALCOLM 		They're pushing us over the cliff.

	Sure enough, out the back window, we see a few more feet of
	muddy earth, and then nothing but inky black.  The three of
	them look at each other for a moment --

	-- and then crawl like hell toward the other end of the
	trailer.  The opposite end reaches the edge of the cliff and
	starts up to tip ever-so-slightly downward.  They reach the
	accordion-like connector and Malcolm crawls into it.

 THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF THE FRONT TRAILER, 
	which is right-side-up, Malcolm can see the two rexes hard at
	it, pushing the front end of the trailer.

 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	Nick has a pretty good grip at the top of the trailer, but
	Sarah can only cling to an air vent in the ceiling as stuff
	starts to roll and tumble past her, headed downhill.

	The angle increases, the trailer dips, and now stuff starts to
	freefall, right past her, some SMASHING her in the head.

	Malcolm, still in the connecting tube, grabs hold.  Sarah,
	starting to be pulled downward, paws at the refrigerator,
	getting a g rip on the handle.  The door, held by a safety
	latch, doesn't open.

	Below Sarah, debris falls to the rear window of the trailer.
	Through the CRACKING glass, we can see the surf, CRASHING five
	hundred feet below.

	The refrigerator bolts suddenly CRUNCH free of the wall.  The
	box strains on its power cord.

	Still clinging to the handle, Sarah swings wildly as it starts
	to come loose, swaying above her.

	The safety latch on the door gives, it swings open, and a
	shower of food BANGS off of her as gravity empties the
	contents.

	Sarah loses her grip and plummets through the now-vertical
	trailer.  She SCREAMS, covers her head, and SMASHES into the
	rear window.  The glass spiderwebs, but does not break.

 FIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW, 
	an enormous wave POUNDS the rocky shore.  Above, Sarah is a
	tiny figure, sprawled out on the glass, held invisibly by the
	breaking window.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Nick SHOUTS to her.

 NICK SARAH! DON'T MOVE! 
	Sarah, stunned by the fall, blinks a few times, regaining her
	senses.  She looks down, at the crashing surf so far below.
	For a person with a fear of heights, this is a real drag.  As
	she stares, the rocks seem to move even farther away from her.
	She blanches; the world spins around her.

 SARAH 		OH... GOD ... please...

	Her breath fogs the cracked glass.  Slowly, she tries to get
	up, caaaaaarefully pulling herself up to her hands and knees.

	But as she puts pressures on her hands, the glass CRACKS even
	more, tiny spiderwebs shooting out around her fingers.  The
	whole glass panel sags, bowing out around the bottom of the
	trailer.

 UP ABOVE HER, 
	Malcolm looks down and sees the satellite phone precariously
	balanced on one leg of the kitchen table, its number pad still
	glowing green.  Nick is closest to it.

 MALCOLM 		Nick!  Grab the phone!

 SARAH 
	looks to her right, at a metal grating that runs along the
	wall of the trailer.  She shifts her weight, leaning on one
	hand to reach for the grating with the other.

 NICK 
	reaches for the satellite phone, its antenna just six inches
	from his outstretched fingers.

 SARAH 
	leans toward the metal grating, all hairline cracks shoot out
	around her pivot hand, shaking through the glass.  The
	splintered glass spread like a disease, it reaches the edge
	of the frame --

	-- and her hand CRACKS right through the glass.  She GASPS and
	pulls her hand out, but now she knees SMASH through the
	glass.

 NICK 
	has two fingers on the phone, but suddenly the whole trailer
	shudders and the heavy phone tips off the table leg and falls.

 NICK SARAH LOOK OUT! 
 SARAH 
	lunges for the metal grating and clings to it just as the
	heavy phone whizzes past her head and SMASHES into the glass,
	opening up a huge hole in the center of the back window.

 UNDERNEATH THE TRAILER, 
	glass, food, lab equipment, and the precious satellite phone
	fall out the broken window and SMASH on the rocks far below.

 IN THE CLEANING, 
	the trailers are split, like an L, the rear trailer hanging
	straight down, the forward one resting on the edge of the
	cliff.  Satisfied with their work, the T-rexes turn and lumber
	back into the jungle.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Sarah climbs carefully up the metal grating.  Above her, Nick
	lowers himself as far as he can, reaching for her.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE, 
	we realize the hanging trailer halted its descent because one
	corner of it is wedged in the branches of a tree that grows
	out from the muddy cliff.

	But now those branches SPLINTER.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Malcolm sees the bellows, the connector between the trailers,
	stretch as the lower trailer JERKS and dips lower.

 BELOW HIM, 
	Sarah mountain-climbs through the trailer's kitchen,
	inadvertently kicking the faucet on as she struggles for
	purchase.

 OUTSIDE, 
	the tree branch SNAPS and the trailer jerks, stretching down
	again.  The bellows expands to its full length, stretching
	like a Slinky.

 INSIDE, 
	Nick knows he has to hurry.  He climbs down, bouncing off the
	built-in furniture, moving ever closer to Sarah.

	But Sarah slips and loses her grip, dropping a few feet.  She
	gabs hold of the sink, the flowing water spraying her face.

 EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT 
	EDDIE CARR is in the driver's seat of the jeep, racing through
	the jungle as fast as he can.

 EDDIE 		Hang on -- hang on --

	The foliage SMACKS the windshield, then clears suddenly,
	revealing the endangered trailers on the cliffside ahead of
	him.  The jeep bounces through the deep footprints left by the
	rex and SKIDS to a halt.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Sarah loses her grip on the sink and falls, SMASHING into the
	frame of the half-broken rear window again.

 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie bolts out of the car and runs to the front trailer.  He
	SHOUTS in through the broken front window.

 EDDIE HEY! HELLO?! 
 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	The three look up from their precarious positions.

 MALCOLM WE'RE IN HERE! GET SOME ROPE! 
 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie turns and run back to the jeep.  He grabs a coil of
	rope, secures one end around a tree, and hurries back to the
	trailer.

 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	Eddie dashes over the mess in the front trailer and crawls out
	into the extended connector.  He peers over the edge, down
	into the second trailer, and tosses the rope.

 EDDIE 		Catch!

	The rope falls through the center of the trailer, its end
	dangling all the way out the smashed rear window.  But the
	trailer SHUDDERS, starting to move again.

 SARAH 		We're sliding!

 EDDIE 		Climbs up if you can!

 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie runs out of the trailer in time to see the wheels
	dragging forward through the mud as the weight of the dangling
	trailer pulls the whole thing toward the edge of the cliff.

	He runs for the jeep and grabs hold of the power winch on the
	front grill.

	Behind him, the trailer rolls closer to the edge of the cliff.

	Eddie races back to the trailer, pulling out a length of cable
	behind him.  He runs up to the still-moving trailer, dives for
	its towing hook, the cable goes taut --

	-- and he falls short.  Just by six inches, but he's out of
	cable.

 EDDIE 		Damn it!

 INSIDE THE TRAILER, 
	Nick and Sarah are now together, clinging to the rope near the
	bottom of the trailer as it shifts around them.  Malcolm is
	further up, also clinging to the rope.

 OUTSIDE, 
	dirt and rocks pile up around the wheels and spill over the
	edge of the cliff.

	Eddie, back at the jeep, reels out more winch cable.  He turns
	and races back to the trailer just as gravity starts to LIFT
 THE FRONT END OFF THE GROUND! 
	Eddie dives again, and this time the cable hook CLICKS
	securely into the trailer's towing hook.  The trailer lurches
	toward the edge of the cliff and stops.

	But the jeep is jerked forward by the sudden pressure.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Malcolm clings to the rope in the middle of the trailer while
	Nick and Sarah try to struggle up it, but a sudden dig knocks
	them back, and their hands slide down the line.  SCREAMING,
	they slide through the trailer and their feet SMASH through
	the remains of the rear window.

	Regaining hold of the rope at the very end, the two of them
	now find themselves hanging out of the rear end of the trailer,
	dangling over the rocky shore below.

 IN THE JEEP, 
	Eddie hits the gas and the tires slosh in the mud, trying to
	get a grip.  The jeep pulls just enough to lower the front
	trailer back to earth.  But the tires spin, fighting to hold
	it there.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE 
	Sarah and Nick dangle, desperate.

 IN THE JEEP 
	Eddie CHUNKS the shifter into four wheel drive and GUNS the
	engine.  As the motor ROARS, the sound is topped by another
	ROAR, in the distance.

	And this one's not a machine.  But Eddie doesn't hear it.  He
	GUNS the engine again.  There is another ROAR from the jungle.

	Eddie hears this one.  He darts a look at the side view
	mirror.  In it, he sees one of the TYRANNOSAURS bolt out of
	the jungle behind him.

	He GASPS and looks at the other side view.  In it, he sees the
	OTHER REX racing toward him.

	The tyrannosaurs STOMP forward to confront the ROARING jeep.
	The first rex bends over, CHOMPS down on the rear tire, and
	lifts the car to its teeth.

	But the spinning tire LINGS in the rex's mouth, burning it.
	Surprised by the fight in this foe, the rex loses its grip and
	the jeep BANGS back down onto the ground.

	Eddie, horrified, dives down under the steering wheel, to get
	away.  The gas pedal pops up --

	-- which makes the trailer pitch over the side of the cliff.

	But the rex STOMPS down on the jeep to prevent its escape.
	The trailers stop.

	Now the rexes lean down, over the jeep, and focus on Eddie,
	who still covers under the steering wheel.  The first rex
	SNAPS at him, hitting the steering column with it, leaving Eddie fully
	exposed.

	He SCREAMS and the second rex lashes in, seizing him in its
	teeth and tossing him out of the car.

	Eddie pops up into the air between the two rexes, both their
	heads flash at him at the same time, and in a split-second, he
	disappears between their teeth.

	Now completely ignored, the jeep rolls freely forward and the
	trailers drop over the edge of the cliff.

 INSIDE THE TRAILER, 
	Nick, Sarah and Malcolm cling to each other and the rope as
	the trailers fall around them.  The windows flash by as the
	trailers plummet, equipment BANGS and SCRAPES them, but they
	hold on to the rope, still tied to the tree, for dear life.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE, 
	the trailers slide the rest of the way, exposing the three,
	who pop out the space where the front windshield was.
	Dangling from the rope, they look up and see the jeep, which
	is now rolling to the edge of the cliff.

	It falls, past them, and the whole mess EXPLODES on the rocks
	below.  Finally, it is silent, except for the sound of the
	surf.

 EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT 
	It's quiet up here too, the rexes nowhere to be seen.  At the
	cliff, a hand appears from over the edge.  Then another.
	SARAH pulls herself up, back onto solid ground, then comes
	NICK, then both of them reach over and help MALCOLM up over
	the edge.

	They collapse there, in the mud, completely exhausted.

 MALCOLM 			(softly)
		Eddie?

	He looks at the other two.  They glance around, then drop
	their heads.  Sarah hears a SOUND in the distance.

 SARAH 		Oh, God.  Now what?

	From the edge of the jungle, a cris-cross of flashlight beams
	moves toward them.  But rather than the three or four that
	would signify their own group, there are nearly twenty of
	them.

	The HUNTERS, PETER LUDLOW is in the lead, ROLAND and AJAY
	with him.  DIETER is there too, shepherding KELLY and DR.
	JUTTSON along in front of him.

	Malcolm sees Kelly, they call out to each other, and race
	together.  Malcolm falls to his knees and hugs her as tightly
	as he possibly can.

 MALCOLM 		Are you all right?!  Anything broken?

 KELLY 		I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I
		thought you, are you okay?!

 MALCOLM 		I'm fine... I'm fine...

	Roland looks around, at the mess that was their base camp.

 ROLAND 			(mostly to himself)
		That's what you think.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. RUINED BASE CAMP - NIGHT 
	In the ruins of the first team's base camp, the survivors of
	the night's two separate catastrophes stand face to face, in a
	heated argument.

	MALCOLM sits off to the side, still holding Kelly in his arms,
	just looking down at the ground and shaking his head.  There's
	something about his posture of defeat that is far more ominous
	than any of the hot tempers that are flaring.  LUDLOW rants to
	SARAH while DIETER looms menacingly over NICK.

 LUDLOW 		Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go
		to jail just for being here, did
		you know that?

 SARAH 		Don't start a legal argument with me,
		this island isn't your property, and
		neither are these animals!

	DR. JUTTSON has encountered DR. BURKE.

 JUTTSON 		What are you doing here, Burke?
		There's no TV cameras, what's the
		point?

 BURKE 		Dr. Juttson, you exist outside the
		classroom.  I am amazed.

	Dieter continues to get in Nick's face.

 NICK 		Are you looking for a problem?

 JUTTSON 			(an urgent whisper)
		Everyone, keep your voices down!

 ROLAND 		Back off, Dieter.

 JUTTSON 		Listen to me, by moving the baby
		rex into our camp, we changed the
		adults' perceived territory!

 LUDLOW 		Their what?

 SARAH 			(she understands)
		Oh, God.

 JUTTSON 		That's why they persisted in
		destroying the trailers, they now
		feel they have to defend this entire
		area!  We're not safe here.

 LUDLOW 			(of Sarah and Nick)
		Thanks to you people.

 SARAH 		Hey, we came here to observe, you
		came here to strip-mine the place!
		It's a looter mentality, all you care
		about is what you can take.

 ROLAND 		None of that matters.  Our
		communications equipment's been
		destroyed.  If your radio and
		satellite phone were in those
		trailers that went off the cliff, and
		I'm guessing by the look on his
		face --

	He points at Malcolm, who is still off to the side, sitting in
	stunned silence.  Malcolm looks up and nods, slowly.  The
	grimness of their situation sinks in.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		We are stuck here, ladies and
		gentlemen.  And we're stuck together.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT 
	Back in the hunters' now-demolished camp, members of the two
	groups combine their diminished supplies.  They have half a
	dozen large plastic containers of water, thirty-seven
	containers of food, ranging from Ziploc bags to aluminum tins,
	a variety of weapons, mot of them borne on the hips or
	shoulders of the HUNTER team, the charred and scraggly
	remnants of several pieces of now-useless electrical
	equipment, a flare gun and several flares, somebody's tattered
	paperback ("Crime and Punishment"), a box of Hershey bars, and
	a cartoon of Marlboros.

	ROLAND supervises the assembling of the resources, which are
	displayed in front of him.  LUDLOW, NICK, SARAH, JUTTSON, and
	MALCOLM, who is still holding KELLY close to him, are with
	him.  They hold their discussion in quiet tones.

 ROLAND 		If we can't stay in the rex's
		territory, we have to move tonight.

 SARAH 		Move where?  Our boat's not coming
		for two days, your airlift is waiting
		for an order you have no way to
		send --

	Ludlow refers to the charred and trampled satellite
	photographs of the island, which are still mostly legible.

 LUDLOW 		There's a communication center, here,
		in the old worker village.  Hammond
		put in some kind of renewable power
		source replenishing.  It may still
		work.  If we could get there, we
		could send a radio call for the
		airlift.

 NICK 		How far is the village?

 LUDLOW 		I said if we could get there.

 NICK 		Well, how far is it?

 LUDLOW 		A day's walk, maybe more.  That's not
		the problem.

 ROLAND 		What is?

 LUDLOW 		The velociraptors.

	Malcolm looks up sharply.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Our infrareds show their nesting
		sites are concentrated in the island
		interior.  That's why we planned on
		keeping to the outer rim.

	Malcolm shepherds Kelly away from the conversation and mutters
	something to her quietly in the background.

 DIETER 		What are velociraptors?

 JUTTSON 		Carnivores.  Pack hunters.  About six
		feet long, three or four hundred
		pounds, and very, very fast.

	Dieter brandishes his weapon.

 DIETER 		I think we can handle ourselves
		against them.

	Malcolm rejoins the conversation, alone.  He keeps his voice
	low.

 MALCOLM 		No.  I'm quite certain you can't.

 ROLAND 		Look, we have two choices.  We can
		hike back down to the lagoon, where
		we can sit for two days, in the open,
		next to a heavily used water source
		while we're waiting for your boat to
		arrive, or we can head for the
		village, where we might find some
		shelter and we can call for help.

 MALCOLM 		We'd never make it past the raptors.
		Trust me, I have some experience in
		this matter.

	Roland looks at him.

 ROLAND 		That may be.  But you weren't with
		me at the time.

	Malcolm just shakes his head, then turns and walks back to
	Kelly.  Roland turns to the others.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Load up.  Let's get this moveable
		feast underway.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ISLAND - NIGHT 
	The SURVIVORS set forth, marching through the jungle in a
	column.  Two HUNTERS strap on small shoulder-mounted
	servo-flashlights.  Wires run from the lights end in
	sensor pads which they stick to the skin of their necks.  Thus
	attached, when the hunters turn their heads, the servo-lights
	turn with them, illuminating whatever direction they look in.

	MALCOLM screws the barrel into the Lindstradt rifle and slings
	it over his shoulder as he marches, limping heavily.  He looks
	down at KELLY, who is marching alongside him.  His face shows
	the deepest of regret.  He shakes his head, cursing himself.

 MALCOLM 		Damn it.

	He looks away as Kelly looks up at him, questioning.  ROLAND
	falls into step with Malcolm and notices his limp.

 ROLAND 		You all right?

	Malcolm looks at him, then looks away without answering.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Wrong question?

 MALCOLM 		You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?

 ROLAND 		What's that?

 MALCOLM 		A statistical phenomenon.  Says
		everything in the world goes in
		streaks.  It's real, you see it
		everywhere -- in weather, in river
		flooding, in baseball, in blackjack,
		in stock markets.  Once things go
		bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad
		things cluster.  They go to hell
		together.

 ROLAND 		Feeling a bit blue, are we?

	Malcolm glances at Kelly, who has taken a slightly faster pace
	and is a few steps ahead of them now.

 MALCOLM 		Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.

 ROLAND 		Why did you come here?

 MALCOLM 		So that others would know about this
		place?

 ROLAND 		Why should they?

 MALCOLM 		Because it exists.

 ROLAND 		It'll still exit if they go on not
		knowing, won't it?

 MALCOLM 		Yes.  And people will live in the
		absence of truth.

 ROLAND 		So the truth is more important to you
		than your life?

 MALCOLM 			(lowers is voice)
		I don't care about my life.  But if
		I'd ever thought for a second that
		she would be in danger --

	Roland follows his gaze forward, to Kelly, who's about ten
	yards ahead now.

 ROLAND 		She yours?

 AHEAD OF THEM, 
	Kelly can hear their voices, faint, but clear.  They are not
	as far away as they think they are.

				MALCOLM (o.s.)
		I'm afraid so.  I don't know what the
		hell I'm doing with kids.  I never
		should have had her.

	Kelly's face shows she heard that part.

 BEHIND HER, 
	Malcolm, unaware, continues with Roland.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Why are you here?

 ROLAND 		Somewhere on this island, there
		exits the greatest predator that
		ever lived.  And the second greatest
		predator must take him down.

 MALCOLM 		But why?

 ROLAND 		You remember that guy, about twenty
		years ago, I forget his name, but he
		climbed Everest without any oxygen,
		came down almost dead.  And they
		asked him, "why did you go up there
		to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I
		went up there to live."

 MALCOLM 			(nods)
		It's called self-testing.  But in
		your case, it sounds more like
		self-destruction.  A uniquely human
		characteristic.  In fact, human
		beings destroy things so well that I
		sometimes think that's our function.
		Maybe every few sons, some animal
		comes along that kills off the rest
		of the world, clears the decks, and
		lets evolution proceed to his next
		phase.  Maybe death and destruction
		are our job, maybe we're supposed
		to destroy ourselves and every other
		living thing that-

	Every person on the trail within earshot has stopped and is
	staring at Malcolm, shaken by his words.  Roland grabs Malcolm
	by the shirt collar and pulls him close, GROWLING in his ear.

 ROLAND 		Tell you what.  You can see whatever
		you want to, to me, but you will not
		spew any more nihilist rants at
		anyone else in the group.  I'm
		fighting panic, and you push the
		wrong buttons.  Understand?

	Malcolm just blinks.  This guy's in charge.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - DAWN 
	As a purple dawn dissolves the night sky, the SURVIVORS
	stagger on, exhausted.  Some are starting to tire, and there
	are spaces in the column.  MALCOLM's limp seems to be getting
	worse.  NICK reaches out, to take Malcolm's pack, but Malcolm
	swats his hand away.

	KELLY, still ahead of him, falls into step with SARAH.

 KELLY 		I don't think -- my dad doesn't
		think we're going to make it.

	Sarah looks at her.

 SARAH 		Your dad is wrong.  About a lot more
		than he knows.

	She puts an arm around her.  Kelly looks up at her, grateful.
	The long march continues.

 UP AT THE FRONT, 
	NICK catches up to ROLAND.

 NICK 		I think you should call a break.

 ROLAND 		Another half hour.

 NICK 		Some of them won't make another half
		hour.  We didn't come this far to
		start dropping in the middle of the
		jungle.  If you don't call it, I
		will.

	Roland looks at him, steely, then SHOUTS to the group.

 ROLAND FIVE MINUTES BREAK! 
	Immediately, the marchers drop where they stood, absolutely
	drained.

 AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP, 
	DRS. BURKE and JUTTSON are bickering.

 JUTTSON 		I can't believe you're still angry
		about that.

 BURKE 		You know, it's very easy to criticize
		the first person who studies
		something.

 JUTTSON 		No, it's easy to criticize sloppy
		research and hasty conclusions.

 NEARBY, 
	MALCOLM checks Nick's bag of videotapes, making sure they're
	still dry and undamaged.  Sarah comes up, watching him.

 SARAH 		You know, even if we do get those
		tapes back, people are going to say
		it's just another hoax.  Ian
		Malcolm's alien autopsy.

 MALCOLM 		Maybe.  Maybe not.

 SARAH 		Ian, they will misplace our evidence,
		shoot holes in our testimony, and say
		some special effects genius created
		the animals.  The only way people
		will ever believe that dinosaurs
		exist is if you dump a T-rex in the
		middle of times Square.

	He doesn't look at her.  She sits down beside her.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		There's something more important that
		you should be thinking about instead.

 BEHIND THEM, 
	Dr. Burke, furious, has stalked away from Juttson and sits
	down on a rock.  H does a double take, noticing something
	behind the rock.  He leans over and picks it up.

	It's an oval shape about eight inches long, with a pebbled
	exterior.  A dinosaur egg.

	Burke's face lights up, fascinated, and he carefully pieces
	the egg in a satchel he wears over one shoulder.

 AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP, 
	DIETER STARK pulls a wad of toilet paper from his pack, drops
	the pack on the ground, and turns to the Hunter nearest him --
	CARTER, his driver, who has his back turned.

 DIETER 		Wait here for me, would ya Carter?

	He steps off the path, into the jungle.  But as we come around
	the front of Carter, we see he's wearing a Walkman, the
	headphone BLARING tinnily in his ears.

	And he didn't hear a word.

 EXT. THICK OF THE JUNGLE - DAY 
	Only a few feet off the path, it's primary forest, the growth
	so thick that almost all sunlight is obscured.  DIETER claws
	forward until he finds a suitable spot to relieve himself.

	He clears away a bunch of leaves and debris and raises his
	hand to his belt buckle.  He freezes, hearing something we
	didn't.  He glances around, head darting, alert to any danger.

	Nothing there.  Just a few distant ANIMAL CALLS--

	-- and s SCURRYING around to his left.

	Dieter snaps his head in that direction.  At first, he sees
	nothing, but as he moves closer, gun extended in front of him,
	he sees a small dinosaur, a COMPSOGRATHUS, the same
	chicken-sized animal Cathy saw on the beach so long ago.

 DIETER 		It's not polite to --

	He pulls the steel rod out of a loop in his belt and touches
	it to the compy's back.  The blue bolt of electricity CRACKS
	and dances over the compy's body and it convulses in pain.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		-- sneak up on people.

	The wounded compsognathus scurries back into the jungle,
	whimpering.  Dieter clambers through the foliage ten or twelve
	paces, pushes aside two large palm fronds, and steps out
	into --

	-- more jungle.  He stops, puzzled, not sure if he went back
	or forward.

	He looks behind him.  He pauses, recalculating the path he
	took coming into the jungle, MUTTERING to himself, gesturing
	with his hands, retracing his steps.

	He adjusts his angle slightly to the right and heads off in
	that direction.  But after five or six hard-fought steps, he
	stops again.  Still nothing but jungle.

 DIETER HEY! CARTER! YELL OR SOMETHING, I GOT TURNED AROUND IN HERE! 
 ON THE TRAIL, 
	Dieter's cries are faint, but audible.  The only Marchers hear
	enough to hear him is CARTER, but the Walkman is blaring in
	his ears.

				DIETER (o.s.)
		...Carter... me?...

 IN THE JUNGLE, 
	Dieter hears that SCURRYING sound again, this time from his
	right.  He adjusts his angle again and SCRAPES through the
	foliage, moving faster and faster.

	Panicking, he ties to run, but the roots rise high out of the
	ground in the jungle, and he trips on one and falls flat on
	his face.

	He looks up.  The SCURRYING sound comes again, this time ten
	times louder than before, like a hundred feet coming at him.

	Dieter GASPS as something rushes in at him.

	He whirls to his right.  Whatever it is rushes in from that
	side as well.  And the left.  And behind him.  Dieter
	scrambles up into a sitting position --

	-- and laughs.  He is surrounded by at least forty compys now,
	the same as the one he wounded.

	For a long moment, they just stare at him.  Slowly, he brings
	his gun around, to point it at them.

 DIETER 		Easy -- wait -- one more sec-

	As one, the compys SHRIEK and hurl themselves forward,
	covering Dieter's body.  Their teeth and claws FLASH as they
	each try to grab a scrap of his flesh, tearing savagely.

	Dieter SCREAMS and flails, waving his arms and legs wildly.
	Some of the tiny animals lose their grip and sail off,
	SMASHING into trees or the ground.  But dozens of others hang
	on, and Dieter falls over backwards, now lying on his back on
	the ground.

	Hysterical, he fights like hell to get to his feet, SCREAMING,
	shaking, swatting the compys loose.  He spins, and that tactic
	seems to work, as the compys themselves begin to panic and
	drop off of him.  But he also loses his grip on his weapon,
	which goes flying, landing in the thick foliage five or six
	feet from him.

	Losing the attack, the compys turn and dart away en masse,
	stopping ten yards away from him.

	But they turn and regroup, facing him in a line, hopping up
	and down, CHIRPING and SHRIEKING.

	Dieter bounds into the foliage, looking for his gun.  But the
	compys follow him in and he's forced to flee, abandoning his
	lost weapon.

	Ten feet on, he stops, knowing he's screwed without the gun.
	He turns to face the pursuing compys.

	They stop.

	Dieter charges them, SHOUTING, waving his arms.

	The compys turn and run.  Dieter stops.

	The compys stop.  They stare back at him.  There is a moment
	of quiet, then they start to hop again, CHIRPING and
 SQUEALING. 
	Dieter, tired of this game, turns and runs away.

	The compys follow.

 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	From the front of the convoy, ROLAND SHOUTS out.

 ROLAND 		Break's over, move on!

	The exhausted marchers drag themselves back to their feet and
	start to march again.  At the rear of the group, someone taps
	Carter, who is still listening to his music.  Carter gets up,
	hoists his backpack, and marches away.

	Behind him, Dieter's pack is left, forgotten, on the jungle
	trail.

 EXT. DEEP IN THE JUNGLE - DAY 
	DIETER stumbles along, exhausted.  He reaches the edge of a
	stream that runs under the foliage, and his feet slip on the
	stones.  He falls, into the rocky stream.

	Behind him, the army of compys pours over the little hill he
	just crested.  They disappear for a moment, down an incline --

	-- And then swarm over his body.  In a frenzy of splashing,
	Dieter shrugs them off and crawls away, through the stream.
	He gets to his feet but falls again, this time over a log.  A
	geyser of water splashes up in the air behind the log as
	Dieter drops out of sight.

	The compys leap over the log and disappear from view too,
	throwing up their own splashes of water.  SCREECHING,
	CHIRPING, and the sound of TEARING flesh mixes with Dieter's
 SCREAMS. 
	Now, as more compys leap over the log and splash into the
	water below, the geysers that shoot up into our field of view
	are pink.

	And then they're a deep, deep red.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	The group has stopped again.  Near the rear, SARAH, NICK,
	MALCOLM, LUDLOW, and ROLAND are in a tense conversation with
 CARTER. 
 ROLAND 		How long ago was this?

 CARTER 		Seven, eight minutes.

	Roland looks at them, thinking.  Finally:

 ROLAND 		Then he's dead.  Nobody tells the
		little girl.  Last thing we need is
		screaming hysterics.

	He turns and heads back to the front of the column.

 SARAH 		We have to send someone to look for
		him!

 ROLAND 		You go if you like, but we're not
		waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!

	They look at each other, appalled, but the column starts to
	move.  Numbed, shocked, but left with no choice, they move on,
	one by one.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ISLAND RIDGE - DUSK 
	The column of MARCHERS has finally reached the island ridge,
	where they are silhouetted against the setting sun.  They're
	taking a break, sprawled out on rocks or over the ground.

	MALCOLM sits next to KELLY, who's sitting on a log.

 MALCOLM 		You okay?

	She doesn't look at him, just gets up and walks away, going to
	sit over next to SARAH.

	Malcolm watches, pained, but Sarah puts an arm around her and
	makes a "she's okay" gesture to Malcolm.

 AT THE RIDGE, 
	ROLAND steps up to the very edge and peers into the island
	interior.  From his vantage point, he's able to see all the
	way to the far side of the island, a rim of herd black cliff,
	miles away.  Between here and the cliffs there is nothing but
	gently undulating jungle.

	He refers to one of the satellite recon photos.

 ROLAND 		Looks like the worker village is down
		in there, about a mile and a half
		northeast from the base of these
		cliffs.

	MALCOLM is next to him.

 MALCOLM 		There must be a game trail, some kind
		of path that goes down there.

	Roland looks around at the exhausted MARCHERS.

 ROLAND 		They'll have to rest before we look
		for it.  Eat.  Sleep.  Two hours.
		Then we hit it.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT 
	The group has made camp in the jungle.  The mood is somber,
	most of the MARCHERS asleep already.  Three or four tents have
	been put up.

 IN ONE TENT, 
	KELLY sits quietly in a corner, her eyes wide, knees hugged up
	to his chest.  SARAH comes in.

 SARAH 		There you are.  Your dad's looking
		for you.

 KELLY 		I doubt that.

	Sarah takes off her outer shirt and hangs it over a bar to dry
	the broad red smear across its front.

 SARAH 		Oh, come on.  Go talk to him.

 KELLY 		Why?  He likes to be alone.  I can
		stay with you.

 IN THE CAMPSITE, 
	all is still.  The nocturnal jungle HOOTS and BUZZES around
	the sleeping marchers.

	In his tent, ROLAND abruptly sits up.  As if he heard
	something.  He looks out the open flap.  In the middle of the
	campsite, he sees AJAY stop in his tracks, head cocked.

	Roland gets up and goes outside, joining Ajay in the middle of
	the camp.

 ROLAND 		You hear something?

 AJAY 		No.  I feel something.

	Roland looks at him.  This isn't so good.  He looks out at the
	shifting jungle.  He notices a thin plume of smoke rising up
	over the trees just barely outside the edge of camp.

 ROLAND 		Oh, no.

 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Kelly and Sarah have laid down on top of sleeping bags, trying
	to get a few minutes' rest.  Sarah's shirt hangs over them,
	swaying in the gentle breeze coming through the open flap.

	As the shirt dangles there, swinging softly from side to side,
	we notice the broad red smear across the front.  Oh, that's
	right -- it's blood.

	The baby T-rex's blood.

 AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP, 
	the thin plume of smoke leads down to a tiny cooking fire
	that's been lit by DR. BURKE.

	He's set a small frying pan on top of it, and now he CRACKS
	the dinosaur egg he picked up earlier into the pan.

	Roland and Ajay run up behind him.

 ROLAND 			(hisses)
 ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?! 
	Burke leaps out of the way as Roland kicks dirt on the fire.

 BMBB! 
	Roland, Ajay, and Burke all freeze.  What was that?

 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Sarah and Kelly sit up.  They felt it too.

 BMBB! 
 AT THE COCKING FIRE, 
 ROLAND 		Get my weapon.

	Ajay turns and trots away a few steps, then stops cold,
	staring down at the ground.

 BMBB! 
	A recent rain has all left puddles scattered around the camp, and
	impact tremors now create ripples in the puddles -- concentric
	circles spreading to the outer edges.

 BMBB! 
 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Sarah and Kelly are frantically sealing up any opened food
	into Ziploc bags.

 BMBB! 
	Now they leap into Sarah's sleeping bag, to seal themselves,
	and draw the zipper up, all the way around.

	Outside, the silhouette of the rex's head passes by the tent.
	Sarah works faster, her fingers struggling to close the last
	few inches, but --

	-- the rex head pokes through the flap of the tent.  It
	sniffs, SNORTING the air in and out.  It looks around the
	tent.

	It sniffs Sarah's hanging shirt, the one that is stained with
	the blood of the baby tyrannosaur.  The adult tyrannosaur
	GURGLES again, COOING and cocking its head curiously.

	In the sleeping bag, Sarah and Kelly's eyes are barely
	visible, wide in panic.  The rex sniffs and nudges the bag,
	trying to figure out what this thing is.

	It rolls the bag over once, decides it's uninteresting, and
	then rises, straights up --

	-- taking the whole tent with it!  The stakes pop out of the
	ground as the tent rises high up into the air and flutters
	away, leaving the sleeping bag fully exposed on the ground
	beneath it.

 IN THE CAMPSITE, 
	the SECOND TYRANNOSAUR now steps out of the jungle, joining
	the first.  Panic hits the camp as the sleeping HUNTERS wake
	up.  Many of them start to run.

	Roland scrambles toward his tent, where he can see his weapon
	lying near the open flap.  As he draws close, an enormous
	T-rex foot stomps down on the tent, driving the rifle deep
	into the mud.

	Roland, weaponless, stands frozen, watching as the panicked
	Hunters flee in all directions.

 ROLAND FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, DON'T RUN! 
	But they ignore him, sweeping him up in the wave of flushed
	prey that pours across the campsite.  Some toss random and
	ill-aimed GUNSHOTS back at the rexes.

 ACROSS THE CAMPSITE, 
	NICK bursts out of the crowd, sees Kelly and Sarah struggling
	to get out of the sleeping bag, and grabs each by an arm.  He
	rips them to their feet and sweeps them off ahead of him, into
	the jungle.

 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD, 
	MALCOLM, blinking back sleep, stands a good head above the
	rest of the panicking crowd.  Frantically, he scans the group.

 MALCOLM KELLY? KEEEEELLLY?! 
	But he can't see her.

 AT THE EDGE OF CAMP, 
	the two rexes join forces, herding the fleeing Hunters into a
	narrow ravine.

 UP ON A ROCK RACE, 
	Roland scrambles up a steep rock face.  No way in hell he's
	going down  that ravine.  He sees Malcolm, still in the middle
	of the camp, start to head for the ravine.

 ROLAND MALCOLM! OVER HERE! 
	Malcolm runs over and hurls himself at the rock face,
	scrambling to climb up the smooth, steep boulders.

	Behind him, one of the rexes spots him and lunges across the
	camp toward him.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
 FASTER!! 
	Malcolm gives it everything he's got, clawing his way up the
	rock face --

	-- and rex draws closer and pounces at his legs --

	-- and Roland reaches down, grabs Malcolm by the hair and
	pulls him up, out of the rex's grasp.

	The rex falls short, but he's close enough that we can hear
	his teeth SNAP together, closing around nothing but air.  It
	turns, sees easier prey in the fleeing Hunters, and takes off
	after them.

	Malcolm lands on top of the rock ledge with a CRUNCH.  Roland
	unceremoniously dumps a fistful of hair in his lap.

 IN THE RAVINE, 
	Kelly, in the middle of the fleeing crowd with Sarah and Nick,
	hears her father screaming her name and looks up.  Malcolm and
	Roland are on the rock ridge above them, keeping pace.

 MALCOLM 			(shouting)
 KELLY, UP HERE! 
	But Kelly continues to flee, as the rexes are in the ravine
	now, and drawing closer to the group.

	Some Hunters try to leap up and scale the rocks, but the
	ravine is deepening, there's no way out.  One rex grabs hold
	of a Hunter in its teeth and hurls him against the rock face.

	The second rex picks up another Hunter and snaps its massive
	head left and right quickly, to break its victim's neck.  The
	Hunter goes flying forward and crashes into --

	-- CARTER, Dieter's driver, who stumbles and falls.  The rest
	of the fleeing humans run around or over him, but when the
	rex lifts its foot, we see Carter is actually stuck to the
	bottom of it --

	-- and when the animal takes its next step it CRUSHES him into
	the earth.

 UP ON TH ROCK FACE, 
	Malcolm is frantic.

 MALCOLM 		I gotta get down there!

 DOWN IN THE RAVINE, 
	it's obvious no one is going to outrun the rexes, and Nick
	knows it.  He bursts ahead of Sarah and Kelly and spots
	something off to his left.

	It's a waterfall, apparently right in front of a sheer rock
	face.  But there's something about the way the water is
	falling that tells him something.

 NICK SARAH KELLY COME HERE! 
	He grabs each of them and hauls them forward, running straight
	at the waterfall.  Apparently, he intends to jump right into
	the rock, and he's dragging them along with him.

 SARAH WHAT ARE YOU- 
 NICK JUMP! 
	The three of them spring right at the waterfall and disappear
	THROUGH the water.

	DR. BURKE, fleeing along with everyone else, is watching as
	they vanish.

 BEHIND THE WATERFALL, 
	there is a small recess, which is what Nick had hoped for.
	It's small, only four or five feet deep, but it's just enough
	for him, Sarah, and Kelly to cover behind the flowing water.
	Breathless, terrified, they can hear the mayhem outside.

 NICK 		Shhhh... shhhh...

	With an enormous SPLASH, something bursts through the
	cascading water and crashes into them.

	Dr. Burke.

 BURKE 		Get out of the way!

	He pulls his way up against the far wall, as far away from the
	water as he can.

	FOOOOM!  Now another shape bursts through the watery curtain.

	A Tyrannosaur head.  Burke gave away the hiding spot.

	The four SCREAM as the rex's jaws SNAP left and right,
	searching for them, falling just inches short.  They squeeze
	as far back against the wall as they can get.

	The rex can't quite get its head all the way through the
	opening --

	-- so it uses its tongue.  A long, dark blue shape slithers
	out of its mouth and touches the humans, trying to wrap around
	them, to pull them out of the cave.

	Burke, blind with panic, forces himself even further into the
	cave, which pushes Kelly further out.

 SARAH STOP IT YOU'RE PUSHED HER OUT STOP IT! 
	But Burke doesn't listen, throwing elbows to make room for
	himself.  His movements dislodge a portion of muddy earth, and
	a flurry of enormous cockroaches, eight or nine inches long
	each, pour out of the wall and swarm over his face and neck.

	Burke SCREAMS and instinctively leaps away, toward the flowing
	water.

	And that's all the leverage the rex needs.  It curls its
	tongue, wrapping Burke up in it and pulling him between its
	teeth.  SCREAMING hideously, he is dragged out, through the
	waterfall, and disappears.

	Sarah, Nick, and Kelly stare in horror as the white screen of
	water turn pink.

 UP ON THE ROCK FACE, 
	Malcolm and Roland see the rex walk away from the waterfall
	with Burke, leaving the hiding place unmolested.  Malcolm is
	nearly hysterical.

 ROLAND 		She's okay!  They'll stay in there,
		she's okay!

 IN A JUNGLE CLEARING, 
	routed Hunters emerge from the gully at the edge of he
	jungle.  Ahead of them, there is a large open plain covered by
	long "elephant" grass.

	AJAY, running along with them, stops abruptly at the edge of
	the grass, SHOUTING to the others.

 AWAY NO! DON'T GO INTO THE LONG GRASS! 
	Not in the frenzy, they ignore him.  Behind Ajay, the enormous
	shadows of the two pursuing tyrannosaurs stop as well, holding
	up at the edge of the jungle.

	Ajay, torn between a sense of responsibility and his better
	judgement, opts for the former and races into the grass after
	the other Hunters, waving his arms.

 UP ABOVE THEM, 
	Roland and Malcolm come out onto a rocky ledge that has a view
	of the plain below.  Roland can see the Hunters leaving trails
	as they plow through the grass.

 ROLAND 		Elephant grass!

 ON THE PLAIN, 
	the groups of Hunters wades into the middle of the long grass.
	One of them stops and turns, looking back at the jungle trees.

 HUNTER 		They gave up!  They're not chasing
		us!

	There are CHEERS, SIGHS OF relief.  In the distance, AJAY'S
	VOICE can be heard, faintly calling to them to come back.  Up
	on the rock in the distance, they can see Roland, waving his
	arms madly.

	But in the giddiness of their escape, they pay it no mind.
	They continue plowing into the high grass, anything to get
	further away from the tyrannosaurs.

 ABOUT FIFTY YARDS AWAY, 
	the tops of three animal heads rise up slowly, backlit by
	the full moon.  In the distance, the heads can seethe Hunter
	party.  The heads descend, back into the grass.

 BACK WITH THE HUNTERS, 
	they continue forward, oblivious.  Now behind them, four
	more heads rise up in the grass.  As then descend.

	On all sides of the Hunters, the grass ripples as animals move
	forward toward them, undetected, inexorable as torpedoes.

	And these torpedoes are on target.  One Hunter is suddenly
	dragged down, yanked silently below the surface of the tall
	grass.

	In his place, a long, lizard-like tail rises up as the animal
	drops its head to make the kill.

	Behind him, two more Hunters are taken down, and two more
	animal tails rise up in their place.  A Hunter ahead hears the
	RUSTLING and turns.  His face turns white as, behind him --

	-- a VELOCIRAPTOR springs out of the grass.

	Velociraptor runs upright on its powerfully muscled hind legs,
	the second tow of each foot bearing an extra-large curved
	claw, carried in a retracted position, with which it slashes
	on attack.

	Like now.  This raptor SNARLS and SLAMS into the body of the
	Hunter, taking him down.  A feeding frenzy ensues.  The
	Hunters run in all directions, but are pulled down and vanish
	into the twitching long grass.

	Another raptor enters from the right, leaps high into the air,
	past the full moon, SLAMS into the chest of more human prey,
	and takes him down, into the grass.

	Behind them, Ajay's face falls, defeated.  He looks around,
	realizing he too is now stranded in the middle of the long
	grass.

	Around him, four torpedo trails head straight for him.

	Ajay simply closes his eyes.

 UP ON THE ROCK, 
	Roland turns away from the carnage, pained.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. RUINED CAMPSITE - NIGHT 
	SARAH, MALCOLM, KELLY, NICK, ROLAND, DR. JUTTSON, and PETER
	LUDLOW stand in the ruins of their campsite, their ranks
	decimated, spirits shattered.

	Roland is at the hole in the ground where his tent once was.
	He has pulled his .800 Nitro Express from the mud and more or
	less cleaned it, now he's checking the loads.

	Kelly, nearly catatonic with fear, clings to Sarah, and it
	doesn't look as if she'll ever let go.  Malcolm, who is on his
	knees picking through the wreckage of a tent, looks over at
	them, but Sarah waves him off -- "she's okay."

	Roland appears, standing over the group.  He looks at Malcolm,
	who has found the Lindstradt rifle, intact.

 ROLAND 		How many rounds did you find for that
		weapon?

 MALCOLM 		Four, counting the one in the
		chamber.

 ROLAND 		Don't let it out of your hands again.
			(to Sara, but looking at
			 Kelly)
		Can the kid walk?

 SARAH 		Ask her.

 ROLAND 		Can the kid walk?

 KELLY 		I can.  I can walk.

	While he addresses the group, Roland straps on one of the
	servo-lights, the shoulder-mounted flashlights that follow
	your gaze.

 ROLAND 		We're going to find a path down into
		the interior of the island.  Load up
		whatever you think you need, and I
		mean need.  If you can't carry it
		indefinitely, don't bring it.  We'll
		hit the worker village in a couple
		hours and be out of here before dawn.

 AT THE EDGE OF CAMP, 
	Roland bends over one of the three-toed footprints left by the
	rex.  Behind him, the rest of the group is packing up,
	slinging the remnants of their equipment over their shoulders.

	Roland bends over and SNIFFS the footprint.  It's filled with
	a liquid of some kind.

	He takes his canteen, dumps the remaining water into the
	ground, and plunges the canteen into the footprint, filling
	it.  Ludlow hovers over his shoulder.

 LUDLOW 		What is that?

 ROLAND 		Piss.

	Ludlow doesn't ask.

 NOW AT THE FIRE, 
	Roland stares down at the ashes of the cooking fire that led
	to such disaster.  He grabs a handful of the ash and shoves it
	in his pants pocket.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT 
	ROLAND and LUDLOW (who, along with Sarah and Malcolm, is also
	wearing a servo-light now) maneuver down a rugged hillside and
	come out in a flattened area.  Ludlow GASPS, looking ahead in
	wonderment.  MALCOLM breaks through the hillside's foliage a
	moment later.  He too stares in amazement.

	SARAH and KELLY come next, then NICK, then JUTTSON.  One by
	one, they all stop and stare.

 SARAH 		God help us.

	They're standing in a flat, sandy area lined with boulders at
	the sides.  The flat area stretches fifty yards from side to
	side and as far as they can see ahead.  But that's not what
	amazes them so.

	Everywhere, the sand is dotted with dinosaur skeletons.  Some
	are huge, apatosaurs, sixty feet from head to tail tip.
	Others are smaller, herbivores of many different kinds.  The
	more intact skeletons lie on their sides, their ribcages arcs
	of pale bone.  but just as many have been ripped apart, bits
	of carcass tossed in every direction.

 NICK 		I do not feel lucky.

 ROLAND 		Keep moving.

	They march on, tiny figures moving among the mountainous
	skeletons by the light of the full moon.  Roland notices one
	carcass in particular, a recent kill.  It's an enormous
	HADROSAUR with fresh bites taken out of it.

	He bends down, studying the soft earth around it for
	footprints.

 FURTHER ON, 
	Malcolm looks up, noticing the bony shapes around them, which
	fall in heavy shadows like cell bars, seem to be changing.

	He turns, and his servo-light shines on the bones.  But
	they're not bones any more at all, they're pipes, the animal
	graveyard now given over to the lifeless skeletons of manmade
	objects -- twisted, rotting machinery.

 LUDLOW 		We made it!

	They hurry over a small rise --

 EXT. WORKER VILLAGE - NIGHT 
	-- and find themselves at the edge of what was once Isla
	Sorna's worker village.  The size of a football field, the
	town is divided by a main street that's dotted on both sides
	by stores, residences, cafes, a gas station.  All the way at
	the far end is a large, blocky, four-story building.

	But the town is a mess.  The hurricane that hit here must have
	been ferocious, for everywhere things are smashed, broken,
	upended.  And the jungle has stepped into the breath, growing
	up, around, and over everything.  Huge root systems snake
	through the street, making it almost impassable.

 MALCOLM 		The jungle.  It's always ready to
		return.

	Roland catches up and looks at Ludlow.

 ROLAND 		Where's the power and radio setup?

 LUDLOW 		Operations building.  Far end of the
		street.

	A light rain falls as they start down the street, carefully,
	silently, Roland and Malcolm with their weapons at the ready.

	They pass the skeleton of a fallen water tower.  An empty gas
	station, its vine-snarled pumps now useless.  The only sound
	is the low mechanical HUM of the servo-lights as they follow
	the group's gazes obediently.

	Every few feet, the group encounters strange, grayish lumps
	that lies in random places in the middle of the street.
	Malcolm, curious, stops and taps one of them.  It's a rock-hard.
	Nick looks over his shoulder.

 NICK 		Lava?

 MALCOLM 		No.

 NICK 		What are they?

 MALCOLM 		I don't know.

	Finally, they reach the operation building, at the far end of
	the town.

 LUDLOW 		The radio rig is inside.  It runs
		directly from the geothermal
		generator, so power shouldn't be a
		problem.

 ROLAND 		Good.

	He pulls out his canteen.  Ludlow watches as he screws the top
	off, moves toward the building, and starts splashing the
	contents on the outside of it.

	The rest of the group just stares at him.

 MALCOLM 		What's he got in there?

 LUDLOW 		Piss.

 SARAH 		What?

 LUDLOW 		Don't ask me.  The guy's completely
		out to lunch.

 NICK 		What in God's name would he want
		with-

	Roland rejoins them.

 ROLAND 		Tyrannosaur urine.  I don't want
		anything to do with it, and neither
		does any other animal on this island.
		This building is now demarcated as
		the rex's territory.  As long as you 
		stay in that building, you'll all be
		safe until the helicopter comes.

	He drops his pack, swings his gun off his shoulder, and checks
	the load.  Dr. Juttson looks fearful.

 JUTTSON 		Where are you going?

 ROLAND 		After the rex.  I saw a fresh kill
		back in the valley with tyrannosaur
		tracks all around it.  If I'm not
		back in time, don't wait for me.

 SARAH 		You've got to be kidding.

 ROLAND 		Runs against my nature to hole up in
		a cave and wait.

 LUDLOW 		Do you think the rex might have the
		infant with it?

 ROLAND 		Possible.

	Ludlow takes off his hat and turns to Nick.

 LUDLOW 		You know how to work a radio, don't
		you?

 SARAH 		You're going too?

 LUDLOW 		I lost everything I came after on
		this trip, but one T-rex in one theme
		park could single-handedly bail
		InGen out of Chapter 11.

	He takes a slip of paper from the brim of his hat and hands it
	to Nick.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		This is the broadcast frequency.  ID
		yourself as "Harvest Leader."  You
		know what to tell 'em.

 MALCOLM 		You gentlemen feel you have to do
		this now?

 ROLAND 		Now's the perfect time.  The animal
		just fed, so it won't stalk us for
		food.  Predators don't hurt when
		they're not hungry.

	Ludlow double checks the clip on his semi-automatic rifle --

 NICK 		No.

	-- and SMACKS it back into the belly of the gun.

				NICK (cont'd)
		Only humans do.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT 
	The console of a sophisticated radio set-up glows brightly,
	all green, red, and yellow.  NICK tunes the dial to a specific
	frequency.  The radio WHINES and HISSES tuning in.

 NICK 			(into microphone)
		CQ, CQ.  This is InGen Operation
		Harvest Leader to Harvest Base.  Come
		in, please.

	The remaining SURVIVORS, minus Ludlow and Roland, shine their
	flashlights around the dusty, vine-hung interior of the
	communications room.  On the wall a row of chrome letters says
	"We Make The Future,"  but the words are obscured by a tangle
	of vines.  Mushrooms and fungi sprout from the carpet.

	On one wall, there is a mural of what the completed Jurassic
	Park would have looked like.  Big hotels, Ford Explorers with
	tourists leaning out the windows taking pictures, big crowds
	at the fences around the animal exhibits.  But none of it came
	true, and now even the mural is runny and dust-covered.

	There is a pause, filed only with radio static.  Sarah looks
	at Nick tensely, waiting.  Finally, a VOICE comes over the
	radio, clean as can be.

				VOICE (o.s.)
		Go ahead, Harvest Leader.

	They all breath a sign of relief.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	With Roland and Ludlow gone on the hunt and the rest of the
	group inside the operations building, main street stands
	deserted and silent.

	Nearly deserted, anyway.  Moonlight shadows lengthen at one
	end of the street --

	-- and FIVE VELOCIRAPTORS STROLL INTO TOWN.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT 
	ROLAND AND LUDLOW are back in the valley of death, standing
	amid the giant skeletons of long-dead animals.  Roland bends
	down, checking the carcass of the freshly-chewed HADROSAUR he
	saw earlier.

	A set of giant three-toed rex tracks leads away from the
	carcass, down the stream bed.  Roland follows them.  Ludlow
	follows Roland.

	As they near a bend in the stream, Roland looks down, at the
	surface of the water.  A pattern of ripples moves toward them,
	washing over their ankles.  Roland follows the ripples with
	his eyes.  From up head, around the bend, he can hear the
	sound of an animal eating and drinking.  A very large animal.

	He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a  pinch of the ashes
	from the cooking fire that he scooped up earlier and releases
	that on the wind.  They float there for a second, suspended,
	then blow back at him.

 LUDLOW 		We're downwind.  Good.

	Roland darts a contemptuous look at him.  He puts a finger to
	his lips, gesturing for silence, then steps up, onto the
	shore.  Ludlow follows.

	They creep forward, toward the sounds.  They round the bend
	and Roland hits his belly, edging up over a small rise.

	Over the rise, he sees the TYRANNOSAUR, about a hundred yards
	ahead.  It's stooped over the stream bed, drinking.  Like a
	bird, it dips its head in the water and then straightens up,
	to let the water fall down its throat.  A dozen COMPYS are at
	the water as well, drinking.

	Roland gently FLICKS the safety on his gun to "off."

	Ludlow edges toward the cover of a low-hanging branch.  As he
	puts his weight on one knee, it presses down hard on the
	middle of a small stick, which CRACKS in half.  Roland turns,
	eyes blazing.

	Out in the open, the tyrannosaur snaps its head sharply as
	well, staring in the direction of the sound.  But since
	Roland's own head is turned, he doesn't see the dinosaur's
	reaction.  Roland holds a warning finger out to Ludlow.

	Roland turns his head back.  The tyrannosaur is gone.

 FURTHER ON, 
	the trail of three-toed tyrannosaur footprints stops abruptly.
	Roland stops too, gesturing for Ludlow to freeze behind him.
	Roland glances both ways, looking for any sign of the track.

	To the right, the ground gives way to hard black volcanic rock.
	A short distance behind them, the rock is solid, a massive,
	green, pebbled boulder ten feet high.  Roland frowns and
	WHISPERS in Ludlow's ear again.

 ROLAND 		We took to the rock.

 LUDLOW 		Why?

	In front of Roland, a palm frond sways gently in the night
	breeze.  Roland's eyes widen.  He pulls out another pinch of
	campfire ash and releases it on the wind.

	This time, the ash blows off, straight away from him.

 ROLAND 		Wind shift.

	They freeze, terrified.  Behind them, the enormous green
	pebbled boulder --

	-- opens an eye.

	That's no boulder, that's the MALE TYRANNOSAUR, standing
	rock-solid still, its natural camouflage blending into the
	surrounding foliage perfectly.  Very slowly and almost
	silently, the rex brings its head all the way around until it
	is staring directly down at them from about ten feet away.

	Roland and Ludlow stand frozen, their back to the rex,
	unaware of its presence.

	Until it exhales.  The soft SNORT of its breath isn't quite
	audible, but it brushes the hair on the backs of their necks
	ever so slightly.

	Their hearts drop into their stomachs.  Ludlow speaks, his
	voice a queasy HISS.

 LUDLOW 		It's... behind... us.

 ROLAND 			(the very softest whisper)
		It's just fed.  It won't attack unless
		it's threatened.  Don't move.

	As the rex silently cocks its head, sizing up the danger from
	these intruders, it breathes again.  A few strands of Ludlow's
	hair flap in the exhalation.  He closes his eyes, near tears.

	He can't take it.  His eyes dart, glancing down at the weapon
	he holds in his hands.  Unfortunately, it's extended in front
	of him, away from the rex.

	He risks another HISS.

 LUDLOW 		If I don't move, I can't shoot it.

 ROLAND 		Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.

	Behind them, the rex appears satisfied.  It starts to swing
	its massive head around, back toward the jungle.  It lifts one
	great leg and takes a step into the trees.

	Roland signs and closes his eyes, relieved.

	But Ludlow seizes the opportunity.  He whips his weapon around
	and drops to one knee.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
 NO! 
	The rex is infinitely quicker.  Ludlow just has time to
	squeeze off a short burst of semi-automatic gunfire when the
	animal whirls, takes one elegant step forward, and POUNCES.

	Ludlow's bullets rip harmlessly through the foliage between
	the rex's legs as its big head snaps forward and comes down,
	jaws wide.  They close around Ludlow's body, lift his straight
	up into the air, and toss him once, readjusting their grip so
	it is firmly around his midsection.

	The whole combination of movements takes but half a second.
	By the time Roland turns around, the animal has pivoted and
	darted back into the jungle, carrying Ludlow, still SCREAMING
	and writhing in its mouth.

	Roland raises his gun, to draw a bead on the animal, but
	through the shivering trees, he can only see that the
	tyrannosaur is gone.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM SARAH, NICK, KELLY, and DR. JUTTSON wait nervously in
	the communications room.  An empty can of Dr. Pepper sitting
	on one of the countertops begins to RATTLE.  They look over at
	it, confused, as the lightweight aluminum can CHATTERS on the
	formica counter.

	Other objects in the lab begin to rattle too.  Glass jars
	CLANK against one another, books start to drop off the
	shelves, a stool shudders across the floor.

 KELLY 		What's going on?!

	Above them, the rotting wooden roof of the building starts to
	actually tear away, chunks of moldy timber flying up into
	the night.  They look up, a deafening ROAR fills the room --

	-- and a helicopter's searchlight floods in!

	As the chopper dips lower, looking for a place to land, the
	violent prop wash rips away huge chunks of the roof over their
	heads.

 INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT 
	Up above the operations building, the helicopter circles.  The
	roof of the building is all arches and rotten timber,
	impossible to land open.

	Below, the PILOTS see the SURVIVORS through the torn roof of
	the building.  They wave frantically, their flashlight beams
	piercing the night sky.

 PILOT 		There they are!

	The Co-Pilot scans the street below, but it's choked with
	overturned cars and fallen trees.

 CO-PILOT 		No LZ in the street, too much debris!

 PILOT 		Check the other buildings!

	The Co-Pilot nods and they peel off, swooping over the rest of
	the village.

	At the far end of the street, the Co-Pilot brings the
	searchlight to bear on the large, flat roof of a three story
	building.

	The Pilot gives him a thumbs-up.

 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM, SARAH, KELLY, NICK and finally DR. JUTTSON run out
	the front of the operations building.  At the end of the
	street, they can see the helicopter as it descends slowly over
	the building, to land on its roof.

 MALCOLM 		There it is!

	Happily, the group double-times it down the street, headed for
	the chopper.  Again, those strange rock formations are
	everywhere.  Some seem to be on the sides of buildings, as if
	they once dripped there and then turned to stone.

	This time Sarah pauses at one that is dripping over to the side
	of a car like solidified lava.  Her face falls as a thought
	occurs to her.

 SARAH 		Ian.  It's guano.

 MALCOLM 		What?

 SARAH 		These formations.  They're dried --

 MALCOLM 		Birdshit?

	A VELOCIRAPTORS jumps onto a fallen tree trunk behind them.

	They don't see it.

 NICK 		Who cares?  Let's go!

	Unaware of the raptor's presence, they resume their trot
	toward the helicopter.  Behind them, the raptor crouches and
	SNARLS, but the sound is lost under the WHINE of the
	helicopter's engines.  It springs, covering the distance
	between them quickly.

	The animal SLAMS into JUTTSON, the last person in the group,
	and takes him down.  Juttson is thrown forward, into the
	others, who fall like dominoes.

	Juttson SCREAMS, his voice an unnatural, high-pitched SQUEAL,
	as the raptor flips him over and lowers its jaws into him.

	Sarah looks up, panicked.  Her eyes widen at the sight of a
	SECOND RAPTOR, this one running straight at hr at top speed.
	She buries her face in the dirt, covering her head with her
	hands --

	-- and the raptor's foot SLAMS into the ground between her
	legs as it bounds over her and dives onto Juttson, joining the
	first raptor in the kill.

	Panicked, the group scatters in all directions.  Kelly jumps
	up and scrambles into the middle of the street, where she hits
	the dirt and crawls under a fallen shed in the middle of the
	road.

	Malcolm rolls over to the space where Kelly was, but she's
	gone now.  He looks around frantically.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly?!  KELLY?!

	Sarah rolls onto her feet and sprints toward the building
	nearest her.

	Behind her, a THIRD RAPTOR gives chase, bounding after her
	with horrifying speed.  Sarah runs flat-out, but her speed is
	nothing compared to the raptor's, and it gains on her rapidly.

	The walls of a structure of some kind close in around Sarah,
	and as she leaps across a leather seat and SLAMS a door behind
	her, we realize she's crawled into the back seat of an
	abandoned car.

	But the car door is thin protection against the charging
	raptor, which SLAMS into the window, head first.  The window
	spinderwebs, but does not yield.  The raptor crumples to the
	ground.

	Sarah looks up, through a three inch hole in the middle of the
	web.  The raptor leaps back to its feet and plunges its nose
	into the tiny hole, thrashing, widening it.

	Sarah SCREAMS and the animal forces its entire head through
	the hole, SNAPPING its jaws just short of her face.

	She hurls herself over the seat and into the front as the
	animal penetrates even further into the car, but its torso
	will not fit through the window opening.  It pulls away.

	In the front seat, Sarah gets some very bad news.

	There's no windshield.

	The raptor springs up onto the hood, its claws CLATTERING on
	the sheet metal, and tosses its body through the opening --

	-- just as Sarah hurls herself out the door.  While the raptor
	struggles to right itself in the front seat, Sarah runs to the
	nearest building, ducks inside, and SLAMS the heavy wooden
	door.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM races between the idled gas pumps and into the gas
	station building, closing the door behind him.  A moment
	later, a raptor bounds after him, SLAMMING into the door.

	Meeting resistance, it bounces off, notices the plate glass
	window next to the door, and pounces at that.  The window
	SHATTERS and the raptor clings to the ledge, staring inside,
	its tail hanging out.

	Just as it gets inside, Malcolm opens the door and comes back
	out, keeping the place of wall between them.  He pulls the
	Lindstradt rifle off his back and tries to take aim --

	-- but the raptor whirls and springs, forcing him back inside,
	through the door again.

	Willing to play along, the raptor turns and jumps through the
	window again.

 INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	Balancing on the window frame, the raptor HISSES and crouches,
	ready to spring at Malcolm.

	Malcolm takes cover behind the door, which is hanging open
	between them.  He raises the rifle.

	Th raptor springs into the door, BLASTING it off its hinges,
	knocking Malcolm right through a window behind him.

	But the door SMACKS up against the wall, covering the window,
	preventing the raptor from following Malcolm out that way.

	For the moment.

 EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	Malcolm flies through the window and CRUNCHES to the ground.
	He GROANS  in agony and rolls off his bad leg, which is twisted
	unnaturally beneath him, and claws in the mud for the gun.

	ROUGH HANDS reach down, grab him by the shirt, and haul him to
	his feet.  It's NICK.  He drags Malcolm away, but in the
	commotion Nick's duffel slips off his shoulder and lands in
	the street, spilling some of the precious videotapes.

	Malcolm scoops them up.

 NICK 		Come on!

 MALCOLM 		Where's Kelly?

 NICK 		She's with Sarah!

	They race off, down the street.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. KILN HOUSE - NIGHT 
	High above SARAH, we see she is standing alone in a three
	story kiln house, a windowless shed used for firing pottery
	and other construction projects.  Catwalks lined with heavy
	chains hang above her, and onto the floor below, she turns in
	circles, wondering what to do now.

	From outside the kiln house, she hears SCRATCHING, digging
	sounds.  From the other side of the door comes an animal
	SNORT, and a small puff of dust and dirt billows up through
	the crack along the ground.

 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, 
	the claws of one of the raptors dig furiously, trying to
	tunnel underneath.

 INSIDE, 
	Sarah runs to the opposite wall, falls to her knees, and
	starts digging a tunnel of her own, clawing frantically at the
	ganging tools always and CLANKS as it tears at the earth below
	it.

	Sarah digs faster.  So does the raptor.

	With about eight inches of space under the wall, Sarah grabs
	hold of the bottom of one of the plans and pries it up as
	hard as she can.  It snaps off with a loud CRACK.

	At the door, the raptor stops digging.  It's silent for a
	moment.

	Sarah has a good foot and a half of space under her wall now.
	She starts to lower her body into it --

 -- JUST AS THE RAPTOR'S CLAWS FLASH THROUGH FROM THE OTHER SIDE! 
	Sarah falls back, SCREAMING, leaps to her feet, and jumps up,
	grabbing hold of one of the catwalks above.  She starts to
	climb, up, anywhere up, as the RAPTOR now squirms and thrashes
	its way inside, coming in through her hole.

	Sarah climbs, hauling herself up, leaping from one catwalk to
	another.

	The raptor leaps up onto a catwalk as well and follows her.

 EXT. KILM HOUSE - NIGHT 
	A window in the slanted roof of the kiln house EXPLODES in a
	shower of glass as SARAH kicks through it and climbs outside.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	Nick drags a badly limping MALCOLM down the main street.  They
	can see helicopter at the far end, engine ROARING and
	searchlight playing over them as they draw closer.  They
	approach a rusted, abandoned pickup in the middle of the
	street --

	-- and a RAPTOR leaps on top of it.  Its claws CLACK on the
	roof as it goes into its pre-attack crouch.

	They don't stick around to negotiate.  Nick hauls Malcolm off
	into the nearest building.

 INT. WORKER HOTEL - NIGHT 
	NICK and MALCOLM hurry inside and SLAM the door behind them.
	They're standing in the lobby of a hotel of some kind,
	probably used for overnight guests and day workers who had to
	spend the night.  The room and staircase wind around a large,
	open-aired central area four stories tall.  They SHOUT at each
	other, frantic.

 MALCOLM 		We can't stay in here!

 NICK 		We're sure as hell not going back out
		there"

 MALCOLM 		This is single-wall construction!
		It's just a shack!

 NICK 		It'll hold!

 MALCOLM 		For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at
		this!
			(RAPS on the door with his
			 knuckles)
		You could-

	With a CRASH, the wood SPRINTERS around the lock and the door
	swings open violently.  Malcolm is thrown aside, landing hard
	on the floor.

	A VELOCIRAPTOR stands HISSING in the doorway.  Nick throws his
	weight against the door.  SLAMMING it hard against the raptor.

	Malcolm rolls over and paws the gun off his back.

	SLAM!  The raptor charges the door again, this time BLASTING
	it off its hinges, knocking Nick to the floor beneath it.  The
	raptor turns and SNARLS at Malcolm.

	Malcolm swings the gun around --

	-- the raptor lunges at him --

	-- Malcolm's finger closes on the trigger --

	-- and the raptor lands on top of him.

	The weight of the animal CRUSHES him into the floor, but the
	gun barrel now stands between them.  The raptor CHOMPS down
	hard on the barrel, its teeth GRINDING on the metal, and SNAPS
	its head, to tear it from Malcolm's hands.

	Malcolm pulls the trigger.

	The raptor's eyes pop wide as the dart SLAMS into the back of
	its throat.  It makes a GURGLING sound, then convulses
	violently and rolls off of Malcolm, yanking the gun from his
	hands as it falls and dies.

	Nick scrambles out from under the door.  Malcolm tries to
	wrench the gun from the raptor's clenched jaws, but it won't
	budge.

 NICK 			(helping him out)
		Head for the roof!

 MALCOLM 		I have to find Kelly!

 NICK 		I think she's with Sarah!

 MALCOLM DAMN IT, BE SURE!! 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	KELLY remains huddled under the fallen shed, trembling with
	fear.  She holds her breath and freezes, as just outside, only
	two feet from where she's hiding --

	-- a RAPTOR'S FEET pick their way past her, down the middle of
	the street.

	Kelly closes her eyes and suppresses a scream.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
	NICK and MALCOLM burst onto the roof of the now-burning
	hotel and SLAM the door behind them.  The helicopter is now
	only three rooftops away.  They turn and head for it, Nick in
	the lead, but there's an eight foot gap between the buildings.

 MALCOLM 		It's too wide!

	Nick looks around, desperate.  A fallen power pole leans
	against the building they're standing on, its lines gone
	slack.

 NICK 		Help me push this!

	Malcolm understands.  He and Nick throw a shoulder into the
	pole and give it a mighty push, tipping it over in the other
	direction.  One good hard shove and it falls to the far
	building, THUDDING against it solidly.

	Its power lines are not taut, a lifeline from this rooftop to
	the next.  Nick grabs hold and starts to pull himself across
	the gap, hand over hand.

	Behind them, the door of the building SPLINTERS and CRASHES
	open as a raptor throws all its weight into it.  Malcolm leaps
	onto the power line without hesitation and starts pulling
	himself across.

	But even with the door wide open, the raptor on the other side
	hesitates.  It SNARLS and backs away, refusing to come out
	onto the roof.

 ON THE OTHER ROOFTOP, 
	Malcolm lands next to Nick on the second rooftop.  They look
	back at the frightened animal, which takes tow steps out onto
	the roof, SNARLS, and backs into the doorway again.

 NICK 		It's afraid to come onto the roof!

	Malcolm looks around, at the rooftop.  Strange bits of scrap
	and debris seem to have been arranged there, in an odd,
	concentric pattern.

 MALCOLM 		Something's wrong.

 NICK 		Look!  Sarah!

	He points to the roof of the kilm house, in the distance.
	Malcolm turns, and sees SARAH crawling across the tile.  His
	face turns white.

 MALCOLM SHE'S ALONE!! 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. KILM HOUSE ROOF - NIGHT 
	SARAH has problems.  Still on top of the kilm house, she
	reaches the edge and pushes off the roof, leaping to the roof
	of the next building.

	She lands at the peak of the intersection of the two sides of
	sloping roof.  As she pulls herself up --

	-- a RAPTOR appears on the rooftop behind her.  In full
	stride, it leaps, sails over her, and lands on the roof
	ahead of her.

	Sarah swings to her left and starts to crawl down the slope,
	away from the raptor.  Suddenly the roof board under her
	SPRINTERS and CRACKS under her weight.  The whole section
	pulls up and starts to slide off the roof.  Sarah, clinging to
	it, rides the roof  planks down, away from the raptor.

	She looks over her shoulder, down --

	-- and sees ANOTHER RAPTOR, waiting for her on the roof of the
	building below.

	Sarah quickly rolls off the sliding section of roof, which
	keeps sliding, falling.  The raptor below jumps up, just in
	time to get WHACKED in the head by the falling roof section.

	Sarah tries to cling to the Spanish tile roof, fingers and
	nails slipping on the slick ceramic surface.  She slides all
	the way to the edge, grabs hold of the gutter, and dangles
	there, suspended above one raptor and trapped below another.

	The raptor above works its way down.  The one below leaps up,
	at her dangling legs.  She has left them in time with its
	jumps, to avoid losing her feet.  This can't go on for long.

	Desperate, she pulls one of the Spanish tiles up from the roof
	and hurls it at the raptor below.  It hits the animal in the
	head, for all the good that does.

	But Sarah keeps on, pulling and throwing more tiles.  She
	edges to the right, toward a fresh supply.

	The raptor above edges even closer, claws CLICKING on the
	slick roof.

	Something interesting is happening.  As Sarah pulls the loose
	tiles free, the ones above slide down, to take their place.
	Sarah sees this and pulls more free, knocking them out of the
	way as fast as she can.

	Suddenly an avalanche of loose tiles breaks loose and the
	footing underneath the raptor above disintegrates.  The
	animal's feet flail and grasp, it slides towards the edge amid
	the tumbling tiles.

	Sarah, seeing it coming, swings in close to the building,
	hugging it as closely as she can.  The raptor falls off the
	roof, right past her --

	-- and CRUNCHES into the raptor below.  Both animals SNARK and
	attack one another.

	Now Sarah, her grip exhausted, falls too, landing right next
	to the enraged animals.  They fight and roll, RIGHT OVER HER.
	She GROANS and hugs the wood below her, the raptors continue
	to thrash and bite, they roll back, toward her, she rolls out
	of their way --

	-- and plunges through a hole in the roof.

 INT. LAB - NIGHT 
	Sarah falls through the roof of a deserted laboratory and
	lands in the tray of an old-fashioned hanging fluorescent
	light fixture.

	One end of the fixture's support SNAPS, it drops at a 45
	degree angle, Sarah slides out the other end and CRASHES
	through a window.

 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
	Sarah lands in the mud in the street below.

 CUT TO: 
EXT. BETWEEN TWO BUILDING - NIGHT 
	With a THUD, MALCOLM lands in the mud between two other
	building, one of which he has just climbed off of.  Panicked,
	he leaps to his feet and starts to SHOUT.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly!  KELLY!

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	SARAH sprints down the main street as fast as she can, toward
	the building on which sits the helicopter.  Above her, she can
	see NICK has now reached the helicopter and is waving to her.

	Sarah reaches the fallen water tower, which is next to the
	helicopter building, and starts to climb it.

 ELSEWHERE IN THE STREET, 
	KELLY is still covering underneath the fallen shed.  In the
	distance, she can see the helicopter.  But she is trembling
	with fear, unable to move.

	The whole shed suddenly RATTLES as something heavy hits it
	outside.  Kelly's mouth drops open to scream, but her terror
	is so complex that no sound comes out.  She raises her hands
	in self-defense, whatever's outside ROARS with effort, the
	entire shed is suddenly RIPPED right up off of her, and she
	looks up --

	-- into her father's eyes.

 KELLY 		Dad!

 MALCOLM 		Come on!

	He grabs her by the hand and they take off down the street.

 ON THE ROOFTOP, 
	Sarah emerges at the top of the water tower structure and
	leaps onto the roof, into Nick's arms.

 NICK 		Where's Kelly?

 SARAH 		Where's Ian?

	Eyes wide with panic, they both turn and look down at the
	street below, where they see KELLY and MALCOLM, racing at top
	speed down the middle of the street --

 -- WITH A VELOCIRAPTOR CHASING THEM. 
 DOWN IN THE STREET, 
	Malcolm and Kelly have a twenty yard advantage on the animal.
	They're pretty fast, but it's faster.

	Above them, Nick and Sarah are at the edge of the roof,
	SHOUTING and urging them on.  They push it, faster.

	They reach the base of the fallen water tower, the jumble of
	struts and metal poles that Sarah climbed.

 MALCOLM CLIMB! 
	Kelly leaps ahead of him and grabs hold of one of the poles,
	pulling herself neatly up to her feet and reaching for the
	next one.

	Malcolm stretches and makes the same effort, but for him it's
	much harder.

	Below them, the raptor springs and SLAMS into the struts,
	shaking the whole structure.  It pulls itself up.

	Higher up, Kelly climbs fast, hands gliding over the poles.
	She breaks out into the open, where a long, narrow pole runs
	on a slight incline up to the roof.  She scampers across it,
	running the balance beam.

	She reaches the other side, on a ledge below the roofline, and
	looks back.  Malcolm is at the other end, hesitating, drained,
	breathing hard.

 KELLY DAD, COME ON! 
	Below him, the raptor closes in.  Malcolm sets out across the
	beam, his legs shaking.  He places his feet carefully, he
	doesn't have nearly the balance Kelly did.

	The raptor draws closer.

				KELLY (cont'd)
 FASTER! 
	Malcolm slips.

	One foot twists right off the bar and he spins, arms flailing,
	trying to regain his tenuous balance.

	But he overcompensates and his whole body, wrenches out from
	under him.  He falls, the bar SMACKS him hard in the chest,
	knocking the wind out of him, and he drops, flipping right off
	the bar and bouncing painfully through the maze of bars below.

	He drops right past the pursuing velociraptor, CRUNCHING to
	a halt in a nest of bars ten feet off the ground, probably
	cracking a rib.  Kelly SCREAMS from above him.

				KELLY (cont'd)
 DAD! 
	She stares down in horror at her father.  Wrenched in among
	the bars, Malcolm is helpless as the animal crouches only six
	feet above him now, with an open attack route.

	The animal SNARKS and goes into its pre-attack crouch.

	Up above, Kelly wipes the palms of her hands on her jeans
	and leaps out into space, grabbing hold of one of the bars.

	The raptor springs.

	Kelly spins around, over the top of the bar, and, at the very
	peak of her trajectory, she lets go.

	The raptor sails through down from above, feet first, SLAMMING
	both of them squarely into the raptor's side, sending it
	hurtling into space.

	She lands hard and awkwardly, CLANGING into the spidery
	scaffolding next to Malcolm as the raptor SMASHES to the
	ground below.  But Kelly manages to hold on.

 KELLY GET UP! 
	She grabs hold of Malcolm and pulls him to his feet.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	Kelly and Malcolm appear over the roofline.  The PILOTS SHOUTS
	from inside.

 PILOT LET'S GO LET'S GO LET'S GO!! 
	Malcolm and Kelly scramble toward the helicopter.  But at the
	opposite side of the roof, a RAPTOR claws its way over the
	edge as well.

	Malcolm sees it and they lunge for the helicopter, but the
	animal is far faster.  It's only ten feet away, then five,
	they're surely done for this time, when --

 -- KA-BOOM! 
	There comes the loudest single gunshot anyone has ever heard,
	and the raptor flies off its feet and lands ten feet across
	the roof, dead.  They look up, to the source of the
	gunshot.

	It's ROLAND, standing at the edge of the roof, holding his
	smoking .600 Nitro Express.

	But there's no time for celebration, as suddenly the
	helicopter's left skid CRACKS right through the surface of the
	roof.

 PILOT HURRY! THE ROOF'S GIVING WAY! 
	The skid dips even further, ripping right through the
	thatch-and-wood construction.  Kelly, who had one foot in the
	helicopter, loses her balance --

	-- as the roof caves in beneath her.

 MALCOLM KELLY! 
	She falls,  SCREAMING, through the hole and down, into the
	building below.

 ONE FLOOR DOWN, 
	Kelly lands with a CRUNCH on the floor immediately below the
	roof, about nine feet down.  But her landing is cushioned by
	an inordinate amount of straw and leaves that have been
	arranged there.  She lifts one hand, and a yellowy, viscous
	substance drips off of it.

	It's yolk.  She looks around, noticing half a dozen large,
	oblong shapes.  Eggs.

	Above her, Malcolm is scrambling, climbing down to her through
	the wreckage of the CREAKING, crumbling roof.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly!  I'm coming!

	Kelly climbs to her knees, but behind her, a large, dark shape
	is moving.  Rising.  Unfolding, in a way.

 IT'S A PTERANODON. 
	Yep, flying dinosaur.  The enormous animal raises its head, a
	brilliant blue crest extending two feet behind its long,
	saber-like beak.  It SQUAWKS at Kelly in fury.  She can only
	stare, spellbound.

	Malcolm reaches her and grabs hold as the angry animal unfurls
	its massive twenty-two foot wingspread.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	the helicopter lurches as it sinks further into the crumbling
	roof, and now the skids are getting tangled in the debris.
	Roland races over to the hole, climbs in a few feet, and
	starts kicking at it, making it larger.

 ROLAND 		Give me a ladder!

 IN THE PTERANODON NEST, 
	Malcolm tries to haul Kelly back up the way he came, but a
	SECOND PTERANODON now appears from the depths of the building,
	SCREECHING in fury at these invaders who have landed in the
	middle of their clutch of eggs.

	An emergency rescue ladder drops through the hole in the roof.
	Malcolm grabs Kelly with one arm and the ladder with the other
	and they start to climb out of the nest.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	Malcolm and Kelly climb the ladder and are pulled into the
	belly of the chopper just as two enormous beaks break
	through the surface of the roof around them.

	The pteranodons are emerging.

 MALCOLM GO GO GO GO GOG GO! 
	The helicopter lurches up a few feet, but it yanked to an
	abrupt stop.  The engines WHINE, the chopper just hovers
	there.

 PILOT 		We're snagged on something!

	They loos down. BOTH PTERANODONS have come out through the
	hole in the roof and are clinging to the skids of the
	helicopter.  They flap their gigantic wings in unison, and
	drag the helicopter off, into the air, away from the nest --

	-- and let go.  Freed, the helicopter gains altitude quickly.

 IN THE HELICOPTER, 
	the PILOTS gape as the pteranodons coast along, right next to
	the helicopter.

 PILOT 		Hang on!  If I tip it hard, I can cut
		'em with the rotors!

 SARAH 		NO!  Don't!  They're not attacking!

	They look out the windows, where, indeed, the magnificent
	animals are merely accompanying them, flying escort as the
	chopper gains altitude.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		They're protecting their nest.
		That's all.  That's all they're
		doing.

	Kelly, completely drained, sits between Sarah and Malcolm,
	each of whom has a protective arm around her.  She sags
	against her father's chest, nothing left.

	He holds her tight and WHISPERS in her ear.

 MALCOLM 		Thank you.  Kelly, thank God.  Thank
		God for you...

 IN THE NIGHT SKY, 
	over the island, the helicopter steadily gains altitude.  A
	hundred feet.  Three hundred.  A thousand.

	As the helicopter is clearly leaving the island, the
	pteranodons now peel off, their job done.  One of them banks
	sharply, right in front of the moon.  The moonlight
	silhouettes it, shining right through its membranous wings,
	lighting it up like a Halloween skeleton.

	Below, the tiny green island melts away into the vastness of
	the wine-dark sea.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. TYRANNOSAUR NEST - NIGHT 
	Elsewhere in the forest, it's not such a happy story.  PETER
	LUDLOW, still alive, drops through the air and CRUNCHES to the
	muddy ground.  Dizzy, bleeding, the breath knocked out of him,
	he opens his eyes and sees a sloping bank of dried mud.

	From behind him, he hears a CHIRPING sound.  He turns.

	He's in the tyrannosaur nest.

	The BABY TYRANNOSAUR faces him, still with a strange
	aluminum-foil cast on its leg.  The baby SQUEAKS with
	excitement as it toddles toward him.

	Ludlow scrambles to his feet, unsure what to do.  Both ADULT
	TYRANNOSAURS stand outside the nest, staring down at him.

	The baby runs toward Ludlow, so he turns and runs away.

	But in an instant, the male brings its head down, knocking
	Ludlow to the ground.  Then it raises its head again.
	Watching.  Waiting.

	Ludlow gets up again and tries to run, but now the female rex
	strikes, knocking him over again.

	Ludlow tries to crawl away, on all fours.  The male bends down
	and closes its jaws around one of his legs, holding it
	tightly.  Ludlow SCREAMS --

	-- and the rex bits down decisively.  The bone breaks with a
	dry SNAP.  Ludlow HOWLS in pain, unable to move, and the baby
	toddles forward eagerly.  Ludlow can only stare as it leaps
	up, onto his chest, and opens its jaws wide.

	Peter Ludlow SCREAMS.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. CEMETERY - DAY 
	Snow falls in a gray midwinter sky.  In a cemetery, a group of
	fifty MOURNERS is grouped around a gravesite next to a coffin
	that is festooned with cascades of flowers.  On a table, there
	is an array of framed photographs --

	-- of JOHN HAMMOND.  A MINISTER reads from the Bible while the
	Mourners wipe away tears.  IAN MALCOLM stands a respectful
	distance from the group, KELLY right beside him.  Malcolm's
	face is blank, tired, his sunburn out of place with the white
	winter setting around him.

	At gravesite, a Young Woman turns, looking back over her
	shoulder.  About sixteen, she's lovely, with long blonde hair
	and an honest, open face.  She notices Malcolm, recognizes
	him.

	She nudges a Young Man next to her, about thirteen years old.
	The Young Man turns and breaks into a smile just as welcoming.

	As the ceremony breaks up, they walk over to him.

 MALCOLM 		Hello, Lex.  Tim.

	LEX stands on her tiptoes and kisses Malcolm on the cheek.
	TIM extends a hand and Malcolm shakes it.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		This is Kelly.  My daughter.

	They nod their hellos.

 LEX 		I'm glad you came, Dr. Malcolm

 MALCOLM 		I'm sorry about your grandfather.

 TIM 		Thank you.

 LEX 		We were going to call you, in a few
		days.  Tim and I have been thinking,
		and we've decided we want people to
		know about the island.  About what we
		all saw.

 TIM 		We think it's something our
		grandfather would want us to do.

 MALCOLM 			(pause)
		Why?

 LEX 		Because it's true.

	Malcolm looks at her for a long moment.

 MALCOLM 		I know, Lex.  But even if we're the
		only ones who ever know, it'll still
		be true.  You see, I've decided
		that if the world found out about
		what your grandfather created, it
		wouldn't be around for very long.

 LEX 		But -- it was real.  You can't let
		people go on saying it's not.

 MALCOLM 		That's the thing about reality.

	He looks down at Kelly.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Even when people stop believing in
		it, it doesn't go away.

	Kelly smiles and takes his hand, her slender fingers
	interlocking with his.

 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	Back on Isla Sorna, we float over the deserted worker village,
	moving lightly, as in a dream.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		Do you feel the cold wind blowing on
		your face?  That's real.

	We sweep low, landing on the roof the helicopter took off
	from, the nest below now careful rebuilt with straw and
	scrap, a dozen unblemished eggs in the middle of it.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		Do you see the four of us, standing
		here together, alive?  That's real.

	A PTERANODON land gently on the nest.  Ever so carefully, it
	positions itself over the eggs, lowers itself to roosting
	position, and folds its giant wings around its body.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		And maybe that's still that matters.

	The animal raises its head, opens its beak, and SQUAWKS
	approvingly up at the heavens.

We hear labored breathing.

QUOTE FADES OUT

WE STAY ON BLACK
...breathing continues...

Then a MAN'S VOICE talks over the breathing;



                    MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Do you find me sadistic?

                                                       CUT TO:

BLACK AND WHITE CU of a WOMAN
lying on the floor, looking up. The woman on the floor has
just taken a severe spaghetti-western-style gang beating. Her
face is bloody, beaten up, and torn. The high contrast B/W
turning the red blood into black blood.

A hand belonging to the off-screen Man's Voice ENTERS FRAME
holding a white handkerchief with the name "BILL" sewn in the
corner, and begins tenderly wiping away the blood from the
young woman's face. Little by little as the Male Voice
speaks, the beautiful face underneath is revealed to the
audience.
But what can't be wiped away, is the white hot hate that
shines in both eyes at the man who stands over her, the
"BILL" of the title.

In another    age men who shook the world for their    own purposes
were called    conquerors. In our age, the men who    shake the
planet for    their own power and greed are called    corrupters.
And of the    world's corrupters Bill stands alone.    For while he

corrupts the world, inside himself he is pure.



                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
          I bet I could fry an egg on your
          head about now, if I wanted to.

He continues wiping away the blood.



                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
          No kiddo, I'd like to believe, even
          now, you're aware enough to know
          there isn't a trace of sadism in
          my actions... Okay - Maybe towards
          these other jokers - bot not your.

OVERHEAD SHOT
We see for a moment, A WIDE SHOT looking down at the woman on
the floor. Bill (from behind) bent down over her. Four others
in black suits, standing over her (three are female, one is
male). And about four DEAD BODIES lying in their own blood.
We also see we're in a wedding chapel that's been redecorated
by blood death and gunfire. And firstly or lastly, depending
on the viewer, that the woman on the floor is dressed in a
white bridal gown.
This woman is our Heroine, and from this moment forth she
will only be referred to as The BRIDE.

Back to CU of The BRIDE.

The BRIDE on the floor. Her pretty face is wiped clean.



                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
          No Kiddo at this moment, this is me
          at my most masochistic.

While still in her CU The Bride speaks for the first time in
the picture. She looks up at the man standing over her and
says;



                    THE BRIDE
          Bill, I'm pregnant. It's your baby.

After saying the "y" in "baby", we hear a BANG and The Bride
receives a bullet in the side of her head.

B/W CU of a Young MAN in a TUXEDO. Shot to death.

The BRIDE speaks to us in a VO;



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's Tim, Arthur's best friend.

CU A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN in a frilly pink dress with two
bullet holes in her.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's his girlfriend Janeen.

CU A PLUMP YOUNG WOMAN, shot to death, wedding bouquet still
clutched in her dead fist.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's my best friend from work
          Erica.

AN OLDER MAN IN A BLACK SUIT shot fulla holes.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's the minister. I think his
          name was Reverend Hillhouse.

A DEAD OLDER WOMAN by his side in an old-fashioned flower
print dress.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's his wife.

A DEAD OLDER WOMAN slumped over an organ.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          Organ player, don't know her name.

A YOUNG MAN IN A TUXEDO WITH HIS FACE BLOWN OFF.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's Arthur. Arthur Plympton. The

          name on his driver's license was
          Charles Arthur Plympton, but for
          some reason he preferred Arthur.
          Maybe if he went by Carles people
          would have called him Charlie. If
          that was his reason for going by
          Arthur I can understand it.
          Nothing wrong with the name
          Charlie, except he didn't look like
          a Charlie, he looked like an
          Arthur.
          Obviously you'll have to take my
          word on this. Speaking of names, I
          was about two seconds away from
          becoming Mrs. Charles Arthur
          Plympton.

And then finally, The Bride.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          And that, that's me. I'm the Bride.

We do a DISSOLVE from the Bride looking dead in the bridal
gown

To

The Bride, still in B/W, still in a bridal gown, but the
asswippin she took in the scene before must have been in the
past, because she looks like a million dollars
now.......three million even.



INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

The Bride behind the wheel of a Volkswagen Karman Ghia
convertible. Her long blodne hair whipping in the wind. A
PROCESS SHOT PLAYS behind her.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          Looked dead, didn't I? Well I
          wasn't, but it wasn'T for lack fo
          trying, I can tell you that.
          Actually Bill's last bullet put me
          in a coma. A coma I was to lie in
          for five years.
          When I woke up, ...I went on what
          the movie advertisements refer to
          as a Roaring Rampage of Revenge. I
          roarded and I rampaged and I got
          bloody satisfaction. In all, I've
          killed 33 people to get to this
          piont right now.
          I have only one more.
          The last one.

          The one I'M driving to right now.
          The only one left.
          And when I arrive at my
          destination.....
          .... I'm gonna Kill Bill.


TITLE SEQUENCE

As a female-sung ballad of heartbreaking lament plays on the
soundtrack, we see the credits of "Kill Bill" play over the
Bride in her bridal gown, driving to the film's climax.

The sequence ends with the Bride arriving at Bill's home.

                                           WE FADE TO BLACK

EX CU The BRIDE's EYEBALL IN GLORIOUS COLOR
WE CUT OUT ONE...TWO...THREE...TO A
CU of The BRIDE IN GLORIOUS COLOR
She's sitting in a parked pickup truck. Her eyes focused on
something.

The BRIDE'S POV:
A very homey three-bedroom house in the affluent suburb of
Pasadena, California. A purple Dodge Neon sits parked in the
driveway. A tricylce, a big wheel, and a few toys sprinkle
the grass on the front yard. A mailbox with the name "The
BELLS" on it sits out in front of the lawn. We hear but don't
see ice cream truck bells.

SUBTITLE APPEARS AT SCREEN BOTTOM:


                        "The city of
                   PASADENA, CALIFORNIA"


We hear a Car Door Open and Close....THEN....The Bride Walks
into the shot, heading for the front door.

EX CU: A long, white female finger pushes a doorbell.



EXT. RESIDENTIAL PASADENA STREET - DAY

The front door opens and an attractive black HOUSEWIFE the
same age as The Bride stands in the doorway.
The Housewife's face shows immediate recognition of the
blonde on her doorstep.

The BRIDE
on the porch; we do a quick Shaw-Brothers-style Zoom into her
eyes.

FLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE
(That means our Heroine is remembering something, and we see
it with an orange filter.) We're back inside the wedding
chapel. The Bride is taking the beating of her life by four
people in black suits. A black woman PUNCHES HER in the
face... WE see it's the black housewife, five years earlier.

The BRIDE ON THE PORCH
We Zoom quick out of her eyes to CU, a VENGEANCE THEME PLAYS
LOUD ON THE SOUNDTRACK. (Whenever we hear this theme
throughout the picture, we'll quickly learn what accompanies
it is The Bride goin Krakatoa all over whoever's ass happens
to be in front of her at that moment.) As the Vengeance Theme
plays, a Vein in The Bride's forehead begins to pulsate. When
the Vengeance Theme stops, The Bride ATTACKS The Housewife.



INT. HOUSEWIFE'S NICE HOME - DAY

The white woman and the black woman FLY into the center of
the living room, CRASHING onto her coffe table in front of
the sofa.

These two wildcats go at each other savagely, TUMBLING OVER
the couch, clawing and scratching all the way, landing
together on the plush carpet.

The HOUSEWIFE
KICKS The Bride, sending her CRASHING backwards into the
small table where the phone, a note pad (for messages), and
the mail is kept.

The Housewife scrambles up on her feet, but is caught by a
FLYING TACKLE from behind by The Bride that sends them both
into........

An ornamental iron and tempered-glass bookcase that has
framed family photos, display toys, some African art, and a
collection of painted commemorative plates depicting the
negro experience in the American military. Starting with a
plate featuring Cripis Atkins in the revolutionary war, negro
troops in union blue during the civil war, Buffalo soldiers
fighting Indians, the Jim Crow troops of the first world war,
the colored troops of world war two, Korea, Vietnam, and
finally Colin Powell....The Bride and The Housewife CRASH
THROUGH all this reducing everything to rubble.

They land hard on the floor covered in broken glass, locked
in grapple, each trying to get the best of the other one,...
When The Housewife HEADBUTTS The Bride in the nose.

The HOUSEWIFE
hops off The Bride, runs into the kitchen, opens a drawer and
comes out with a HUGE MOTHERFUCKIN BUTCHER KNIFE.

The BRIDE
rises from the floor, and WHIPS OUT a KNIFE in a sheath
hanging from her belt known as a SOG. (A SOG is a long,
double-edged knife that's as sharp as a razor, and is what
Navy Seals use to kill humans with.)

The Bride backs up into the mess of the now totally
demolished living room.

The two    woman stalk each other, each holding her blade, each
looking    like they know how to use it, each waiting for the
other to    make a mistake so they can plunge their blade deep
into the    other one.

Blood and sweat dript off of the faces of the two women
locked in life and death combat......

....When The back kitchen door opens, and a FOUR-YEAR-OLD
LITTLE GIRL, carrying a lunch box steps inside.



                       FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL
             Mommy, I'm home!

The two warrior women whose eyes reflect only combat
concentration, suddenly switch upon hearing the four-year
old's voice. The Housewife's eyes flash a look of pleading to
the eyes of The Bride.

The Bride seems to answer back; "Okay."

The Black woman and the white woman hide their edged weapons
behind their backs, as the Four-Year-Old Little Girl walks
into the newly destroyed living room.

The Housewife switches to her mommy voice.



                       THE HOUSEWIFE
             Hey baby, how was school?

The Little Girl is flabbergasted at the mess, and the
condition of her mother, who looks like she's just been in a
bar room brawl.



                        LITTLE GIRL
             Mommy, what happened to you and the
             T.V. Room?

                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Oh, that good for nothin dog of
          yours, got his little ass in the
          living room and acted a damn fool,
          that's what happened.



                    LITTLE GIRL
          Barney did this?

She says it with the slightest hint of skepticism, then tries
to enter the living room.



                    THE    HOUSEWIFE
          Now baby, you    can't come in here,
          there's broken    glass all over the
          floor, and you    gonna cut yourself.

The little girl's eyes go to the blonde lady in the living
room who she ain't never seen before, who also looks like
she's been fighting.

The Bride smiles at the confused Little Girl.



                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          This is a old friend of mommy's I
          ain't seen in a long time.



                     THE BRIDE
          Hello sweety, I'm *(BLEEP)*, what's
          your name?

* Whenever during the picture somebody says The Bride's real
name, it will be BLEEPED OUT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, ...that is,
till I want you to know. *

The shy, suspicious little girl doesn't say anything, she
just stares at the blond lady.



                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Her name is Nikki.



                     THE BRIDE
          Nikki. What a pretty name for such
          a pretty little girl. How old are
          you Nikki?

Nikki still says nothing, only stares.

                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Nikki, *(BLEEP)* aked you a
          question.



                    NIKKI
              (to The Bride)
          I'm four.



                       THE BRIDE
          Four years    old, aye. You know I
          once had a    little girl. She'd be
          five right    now. Maybe you two could
          of played    with each other.



                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Now baby, me an *(BLEEP)* have some
          grown-up talk to talk about, so you
          go in your room now and leave us
          alone till I tell you to come out.

The child doesn't move, so the mother repeats herself.



                    THE HOUSEWIFE
              (snapping her fingers)
          Nikkia - in your room - now.

The little girl slowly walks away and disappears behind the
door of her bedroom.

The two women turn to face each other, masquerade and combat
both finished.



                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Want some coffee?



                    THE BRIDE
          Yeah, sure.

The two women move into the kitchen. The Bride re-sheaths her
SOG, and The Housewife puts the butcher knife back in the
drawer.

The Bride sits down at the kitchen table, while The Housewife
pours both of them coffee.

                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Cream and sugar?



                    THE BRIDE
          Both, please.

As The Housewife fixes the coffee, we hear The Bride's
VOICEOVER ON THE SOUNDTRACK:



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          This Pasadena homemaker's name is
          Jeanne Bell. Her husband is Dr.
          Lawrence Bell. But back when we
          were acquainted, five years ago,
          her name was VERNITA GREEN. Her
          code name, was "COBRA"..... Mine
          was BLACK MAMBA.

The two combat artists sit at the kitchen table, drinking
coffee out of Vernita's coffee mugs.



                    THE BRIDE
          Were you expecting me?



                    VERNITA
          Yes and no. Bill got in touch with
          me right after you woke up, and
          then again a little later after
          your episode in Japan.
              (pause)
          So I suppose it's a little late for
          a apology, huh?



                    THE BRIDE
          You suppose correctly.



                    VERNITA
          Even if I was sincere?



                    THE BRIDE
          Oh. I'm quite positive you're
          sorry, now.

Vernita says to the Bride across the table furiously but with
low volume;

                    VERNITA
          Look bitch, I need to know if
          you're gonna start anymore shit
          around my baby girl!



                    THE BRIDE
          You can relax for now. I'm not
          going to murder you in front of
          your daughter.



                    VERNITA
          That's being more rational than
          Bill led me to believe you were
          capable of.



                    THE BRIDE
          Well that's a demonstration of
          Bill's complete ignorance when it
          comes to the subject of me, and
          what I'm thinking, and what I might
          do. It's mercy, compassion, and
          forgiveness I lack, not
          rationality.

She pauses for effect -- the ham.



                    THE BRIDE
          I'll wait for now, but I won't wait
          for long. I'll allow you to choose
          a time and place for us to meet
          again, preferably as far away from
          Nikki as possible.
          I could have just HIT you, I
          didn't, I demand respect for that.
          Since this is not a HIT, consider
          it a DUEL. And as two former Deadly
          Vipers, we will observe Viper rules
          of honor. One on one - no help - no
          bushwhackin - no treacherous
          weapons - on weapon of choice - our
          skill and our bodies.

Vernita says her name;



                      VERNITA
          *(BLEEP)*

                    THE BRIDE
          - I'm not through telling you.
          Failure to keep our date, or
          duplicity of any kind, will result
          in me putting a xoxo hollow point
          bullet into the back of your skull
          from a window of a building across
          the street from Nikki's elementary
          school. Now, feel free to respond.



                    VERNITA
          Look...I know I fucked you over. I
          fucked you over bad. I wish to God
          I hadn't, but I did.

The blonde listens to the black woman with a poker face.



                    VERNITA
          If I could go back in a machine I
          would, but I can't. All I can tell
          you is I'm a different person now.



                    THE BRIDE
          I don't care.



                    VERNITA
          Be that as it may, I know I do not
          deserve mercy or forgiveness.
          However, I beseech you for both on
          behalf of my daughter.



                    THE BRIDE
          -- Bitch, you can stop right there.

The B-word stops Vernita short, almost like a cold-handed
slap in the face (it should affect the audience that way as
well).



                    THE BRIDE
              (leans in close)
          Just because I have no wish to
          murder you before the eyes of your
          daughter, does not mean parading
          her around in front of me is going
          to inspire sympathy. You and I have
          unfinished business.

          And not    a goddamn fuckin thing
          you've    done in the subsequent five
          years -    including getting knocked
          up - is    going to change that.



                    VERNITA
          You have every right to wanna get
          even --



                    THE BRIDE
          -- But that's where you're wrong,
          Vernita. I don't want to get even.
          To get even, even Steven. I would
          have to kill you, go into Nikki's
          room, kill her, then wait for your
          old man, Dr. Bell, to come home and
          kill him. That would make us even.
          No, my unborn daughter will just
          hafta be satisfied with your death
          at her mother's hands.

Vernita knows no matter what else is said, blood will spill.



                    VERNITA
          When do we do this?



                     THE BRIDE
          It all depends... When do you want
          to die? Tomorrow? The day after
          tomorrow? That's about as long as
          I'll wait.



                    VERNITA
          How bout tonight, bitch?



                    THE BRIDE
          Spendid. Where?



                    VERNITA
          There's a baseball diamond where
          our little league has its games,
          about a mile from here. We meet
          there around two-thirty in the
          morning, dressed all in black, your
          hair in a black stocking, and we
          have us a knife fight, we won't be

          bothered. I have to fix Nikki's
          cereal.

As they continue to talk, Vernita pulls down a cereal bowl
for her daughter and lays it on the kitchen counter.



                    THE BRIDE
          Bill said you were one of the best
          ladies he'd ever seen with an edged
          weapon.

Vernita moves to another kitchen cabinet, and pulls down a
box of the sugar cereal, "Kaboom."



                    VERNITA
          Fuck you, bitch, I know he didn't
          qualify it, so you can just kiss my
          motherfuckin ass, Black Mamba.
              (snorts to herself)
          Black Mamba, I shoulda been
          motherfuckin Black Mamba.

As the two females continue to talk, Vernita reaches her hand
inside the cereal box.



                    THE BRIDE
          Weapon of choice? And if you want
          to stick with your butcher knife,
          I'm cool with that.



                    VERNITA
          Very funny.

Vernita FIRES A GUN from inside the cereal box at The
Bride....

.... The bullet explodes out of the cardboard box, and HITS
the coffee mugh directly in front of The Bride, BLOWING IT TO
SMITHEREENS.

The Bride THROWS HERSELF ON THE FLOOR....

Vernita pulls the gun out of the cereal box and FIREES
again...

...The bullet HITS THE FLOOR of the tiny kitchen...

...The Bride moves under the kitchen table, then using her
back, LIFTS THE TABLE OFF THE GROUND, RAMMING IT STRAIGHT
INTO Vernita, pinning her flat up against the table top, and
the kitchen counter.

While her left hand holds the table,    her right hand goes to
the SOG on her belt, her fingers wrap    around the blade's
grip, lifting it up out of the sheath    and PLUNGING IT THROUGH
THE TABLE TOP up to the handle, with    all the SOG's steel
entering Vernita's abdomen.

The table falls back to the floor with the dying homemaker
pinned to it. The two former colleagues meet eyes.



                       VERNITA
             Sorry, bout the bushwhack. Please
             don't...



                        THE BRIDE
             Do to your daughter, what you did
             to mine...
                 (she takes her hand)
             ...I won't.

Vernita dies.

The Bride removes her Sog, looks up and sees little Nikki
standing in the doorway of her room. The little girl sees her
mother dead on the floor, lying in her own blood. And she
sees the blonde lady standing over her mother, bloody knife
still in her hand. But oddly enough, Nikki doesn't cry. The
little girl locks eyes with the big girl, and holds her
stare.

As she    talks to the little girl, she removes an already
stained    with blood white handkerchief with the name "BILL"
sewn on    it. And the blonde wipes the girl's mother's blood
off her    blade.



                       THE BRIDE
             It was not my intention to do this
             in front of you. For that I'm
             sorry. But you can take my word for
             it, your mother had it coming. When
             you grow up, if you still feel raw
             about it, I'll be waiting.

And with that apology, statement, and invitation, The Bride
walks out the kitchen side door, leaving the little girl to
her mourning.



EXT. VERNITA'S HOME - DAY

The Bride walks down the dead woman's driveway to her
vehicle. She glances at the lawn toys one more time as she
makes here getaway.

She climbs into her big, yellow pickup truck, with the words
"Pussy Wagon" written across the flatbed's hatch door in a
pimpy font. She takes out a ringed notebook and turns to a
page that's headline reads;


                        DEATH LIST FIVE

On the pager are five names numbered going down the page
written in red ink.

The first name has a line drawn through it with black ink.

The second name on the list is;


                         VERNITA GREEN
                             COBRA

The Bride takes a black felt pen and draws a line through
Vernita's name. Turns on the truck's engine and drives out of
the residential district.

                                            FADE TO BLACK.

one, she's in her hospital room; two, she's alone; three,
it's night; and four, one hellva RAINSTORM is pounding
outside.

The car door opens and two yellow galoshes step out into the

                                    ON TOP    of the woman's
                                    blonde    head.


INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The door marked "ladies" is opened, and a beautiful 6-foot
blonde in a white nurse's uniform, with a matching white eye
patch over her left eye, steps out, carrying the nurse's tray
with the "Goodbye forever"-filled syringe on it.
She walks down the corridor towards The sleeping Bride's
room.

                    STAY WITH ELLE'S SIDE



INT. THE BRIDE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

The Bride, alone in her bed, alone in her coma, alone in her
room.

Elle Driver opens the door to her room and steps inside.
The female assassin approaches the comatose woman.

EX CU ELLE DRIVER'S EYE AND WHITE EYE PATCH
looking down at her sleeping target, victim, rival, and
opposite number.

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYES
wide open - blank stare.

Elle standing over The Bride's hospital bed, says to her;



                    ELLE
          I might never of liked you. Point
          in fact I despise you. But that
          doesn't suggest I don't respect
          you. You were a master of a
          profession that's most difficult to
          master.
          Dying in our sleep is a luxury our
          kind is rarely afforded. My gift to
          you.

As she lifts the syringe off the tray....

Her cell phone RINGS....

She curses to herself...there can be only one person on the
other end....she answers it.



                    ELLE
          Hello, Bill.
              (pause)
          Affirmative.
              (pause)
          Comatose.
              (pause)
          I'm standing over her right now.
              (pause)
          What!

The female assassin turns away from the wide-eyed stare of
The Bride, and paces the hospital room talking in the cell
phone.



                    ELLE
          Don't fuckin ssshhh me! If you
          think I came all the way down to
          Texas - in a dog and cat rainstorm
          no less - just to tuck sleeping
          beauty in bed - you got another
          fuckin thing comin -
              (pause, then real loud)
          You don't owe her Shit!!
              (then again, but quieter)
          You don't owe her shit.
              (pause)
          Man, fuck that bitch!
              (pause)
          Oh you're not are you? Well Bill,
          you never leave a job half done.
          A great teacher taught me that
          once, he looked a whole lot like

          you.

Elle pauses as Bill on the other line has his say. We don't
hear his side, we stay with Elle as he talks. We can tell by
her face, he's making some sense. After awhile she answers
back;



                    ELLE
          I guess.
              (pause)
          No, I don't need to guess, I know.
              (pause)
          Affirmative.
              (pause)
          I love you too, bye bye.

The female assassin puts the phone away and looks down at The
comatose Bride with the open eyes. Even though her face is
expressionless, she almost seems to be smiling.



                    ELLE
          Thought that was pretty funny
          didn't ya? Word of advice shithead,
          don't you ever wake up.

Elle leans closer to the Bride's face.



                    ELLE
          Ya know now I get a better look at
          you, you're not so damn pretty.
          Yeah, you go that Venus thing going
          for you but...ya know, now I get a
          closer look at you you're kinda
          weird looking. You got this big
          nose that doesn't fit with the rest
          of your face, your eyes are two
          different sizes. And look at your
          skin...My complexion is way better
          than yours --

The Bride does one of her motor reflex functions...She SPITS
in Elle's face.

Elle springs up, wipes the spit off her cheek and looks down
at The comatose Bride in her bed.



                    ELLE
          Oh, no you didn't.

She grabs The Bride by the front of her hospital gown...

....Yanks Her up to a sitting position...

...And PUNCHES her hard in the face three times.



                    ELLE
          If you ever take your ass out of
          this Goddamn bed for as long as you
          fuckin live, I will beat you into
          the ground, bitch!



INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Elle Driver in her nurse's uniform, angrily walks down the
hallway. She passes by a DOCTOR, STRUGGLING WITH A PATIENT
BLEEDING PROFUSELY on a gurney.



                    DOCTOR
              (yelling)
          Nurse come here quick, we're losing
          this man!

Elle doesn't even look back.



                    ELLE
          Tough titty, I quit.

She walks out of the SHOT.

                                            FADE TO BLACK.

INT. THE COMATOSE BRIDE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

The CAMERA is in a corner of the ceiling, looking down on the
comatose Bride, who lies motionless in her bed.

WE HEAR the sound of a BUZZING MOSQUITO, doing loop de loops
and figure eights in the air, looking for some warm blood.

The BUZZING stops....

MACRO CU
of mosquito on The Bride's forearm, its stinger dug in her
flesh, visibly drawing blood from its host.

CU MOSQUITO'S FACE
drinking her blood.

MACROSHOT OF MOSQUITO ON FOREARM

SQUASHES the bug flat. Her fingers FLICK the dead bug away.

CU The Bride
her wide-open eyes, that have stared in a constant gaze for
the last five years,
finally...slowly...softly...shut.

BEAT

They SUDDENLY POP OPEN.

The BRIDE SITS BOLD UPRIGHT IN BED.
She has no idea where the fuck she is. WE DO A SHAW BROTHERS
STYLE QUICK ZOOM INTO A CU OF HER FACE.

QUICK CUT TO A FLASHBACK SPAGHETTI-WESTERN STYLE
back at the wedding chapel, gun pointed down at our face.

THE BARREL EXPLODES LEAT AT US - BANG!

QUICK CUT BACK TO The BRIDE IN HER HOSPITAL BED,
BANK still echoing in her ears. She lets out a SCREAM OF PAIN
and her hand goes to the side of her head, as if she were
just shot.

Her hand feels the metal plate embedded in the side of her
skull where the hole was. She knocks against it with her
knuckle...it goes...TINK...TINK.

Suddenly she says out loud;



                      THE BRIDE
          My baby.

Her hand goes down to her belly, unly to find it not swollen
but flat. She doesn't understand, lifts up her hospital gown
and sees a JAGGED SCAR which runs down her abdomen. Her
fingertips trace it.

She quickly looks at the palm of her and and counts the
lines.

MACRO CU The LINES IN HER PALM look like a road map.

She stops counting, shocked;



                      THE BRIDE

              (to herself)
          Five years.

She counts again.



                    THE BRIDE
              (a statement)
          Five years.

The Bride's two eyes fill with tears as she realizes her baby
is long gone.

WHEN SUDDENLY...

She hears the STEP...STEP...STEP...OF BILL'S BOOTS WALKING
TOWARDS HER ROOM....

WE SEE THE CINEMATIC EQUIVALENT OF A COMIC BOOK THOUGHT
BALLOON by her head. INSIDE OF IT WE SEE BILL'S BLACK BOOTS
walking across the wood floor of the wedding chapel.



INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (THE BRIDE'S FLOOR) - NIGHT

We see a HOSPITAL ORDERLY'S bright red and white Reeboks
softly slapping against the smooth surface of the
institution's floor. They make a sound nothing like Bill's
shoes.

                   SCREEN GOES TO SPLIT SCREEN

          LEFT SIDE                       RIGHT SIDE
The BRIDE listening to them            Orderly's Reeboks walking
getting closer. WE HEAR the            down the hospital
STEP...STEP...STEP...in time           corridor.
with Orderly's sneakers.

                                       CAMERA MOVES UP TO
                                       Orderly's face, leading
                                       two TRUCKDRIVERS.
The Bride HEARS BILL'S
VOICE SPEAK FOR THE ORDERLY;


       BILL'S VOICE                            ORDERLY
      (in time)                              (in time)
   She's right in here.                She's right in here.


                      SPLIT SCREEN FINISHES
                   STAY WITH The BRIDE'S SCREEN

The Bride decides the best course    of action,    till she gets
her bearings, is to play possum.    She throws    herself back down
on the bed, just as the three men    enter her    room.
They see just what they expected    to see, The    Bride lying in
her bed in her coma.

She duplicates her comatose eyes-wide-open-fixed stare.
Except knowing she's awake, and sees everything in front of
her, creates a slightly different effect.

The Bride, however, while she sees the Two Truckdrivers for
what they are, when she sees The Orderly she sees Bill, when
The Orderly talks she hears Bill. WE HOWEVER WILL NEVER SEE
BILL'S FACE COMPLETELY.

The Orderly takes her shee covering off, and hitches up her
hospital gown till her blonde pussy is exposed. He does kind
of a "TA-DA" presentation of her vagina.



                    THE ORDERLY
          Now is that the cutest little
          blonde pussy you ever saw, or is
          that the cutest little blonde
          pussy, YOU-EVEA-SAW?

Trucker #2 (Gerald) would tend to agree, Trucker #1 (Warren)
fronts.



                    WARREN
          I seen better.

CU The BRIDE
EYES WIDE OPEN PLAYING POSSUM. She can't believe she's being
exhibited in this manner. A look of chagrin crosses her
trying-to-be expressionless face, "I've seen a fuck load
better than you, fatass."



                    THE ORDERLY
          Yeah, in a movie - maybe. But I
          know damn well this is the best
          pussy you ever saw you had touchin
          rights to. The price is seventy
          five dollars a fuck gentlemen, you
          gittin your freak on or what?

The Truckers pay the bill of fare.

As The Orderly counts The Truckers' money, he lays out the
rules;



                    THE ORDERLY
          Here's the rules; Rule    number one;
          no punchin 'er.
          Nurse comes in tomorrow    an she got
          'er a shiner - or less    some teeth,
          jig's up. So no knuckle    sandwiches
          under no circumstances.    And by the

          way, this little cunt's a spitter -
          it's a motor reflex thing but spit
          or no, no punchin. Now are we
          absolutely positively clear about
          rule number one?



                    TWO TRUCKERS
          Yeah.



                    THE ORDERLY
          Rule number two;
          No monkey bites, no hickeys - in
          fact no leavin no marks of no kind.
          But after that, it's allll goooood.
          Her plummin down there don't work
          no more, so feel free to cum in 'er
          all ya wont. Keep the noise down -
          try not to make a mess, and I'll be
          back in twenty.

The Orderly turns to leave, then remembers something, and
turns back. He takes out the most disgusting jar of vaseline
in the history of cinema, and hands it to Warren.



                     THE ORDERLY
          Oh by the way, not all the time,
          but sometimes this cunt's cunt can
          get drier than a bucket of sand.
          If she dry, lube up with this and
          you'll be goo to go. BON-APPETIT,
          gentlemen.

And with that, The Orderly's gone.

The BRIDE'S POV:
As soon as he leaves the Two Truckers start giggling. Warren
begins to unbuckle the belt that lies beneath his belly.
While he looks down to accomplish this, The BRIDE'S POV
BLINKS.



                    GERALD
          Hey Warren, she just blinked.



                    WARREN
          He said she can't blink.



                    GERALD
          I know what he said, I'm tellin ya

          she just did.

Warren drops his Levi's to his ankles.



                    WARREN
          Just wait, when I get through with
          this little dumbbell, she gonna
          stand up and recite the Gettysburg
          Ad-dress.

Warren begins to climb up on the bed and mount The Bride.
Before he does he stops, and looks back to Gerald.



                    WARREN
          Hey, Gerald.



                    GERALD
          Yeah?



                    WARREN
          This shit ain't no peep show. Go
          out in the hall and I'll let ya
          know when it's your turn.



                    GERALD
          Awww c'mon, I gotta leave the room?



                    WARREN
          I can't get no errection wit you
          lookin at me, so go on.



                    GERALD
          Well, just hurry up then.

Gerald leaves the room; we go out with him in the hallway.



INT. HALLWAY (HOSPITAL) - NIGHT

Gerald paces, waiting for his turn behind the door.

THEN...

He hears behind the door a commotion, then Warren SCREAM LIKE
A BITCH. He bangs on the closed door and says;

                    GERALD
          He man, keep it down in there, I
          can hear your ass out here.

More falsetto SCREAMS behind the door...

THEN...

The HEAVY THUD of a body falling. Not what the expected.



INT. THE BRIDE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Gerald pushes open the door to see one hellva sight. His
buddy, bloody and lying motionless on the floor, and The
Bride lying haphazardly on the bed, in her coma.

He moves to his buddy, who's dead. Then moves to The comatose
Bride... Who SUDDENLY SPRINGS TO LIFE, GRABBING him by the
front of his shirt, YANKING HIM DOWN TO HER, and PLUNGING the
I.V. NEEDLE in her arm DEEP INTO HIS TEMPLE, THEN TWISTING IT
AROUND and AROUND, turning the right side of his brain into
scrambled eggs a la The BRIDE.
She tosses the now brain-dead Gerald to the floor.

The BRIDE
upon waking, without leaving the bed    where she lay the last
five years, has just killed two men.    She throws off the
bloody blankets, whips her legs off    the side of the bed, and
tries to stand - THEN QUICKLY FALLS    OUT OF FRAME. WE HEAR THE
CRASH BELOW FRAME.

The Bride is flat on the floor. Her legs and feet don't work.
Which means she's stuck on the floor with only a functioning
top half, and a completely useless bottom half. What's a girl
to do?



INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The elevator doors open, and The Orderly steps out.

BACK TO The BRIDE
She hears the sound of Bill's boots approaching the room...
STEP...STEP...STEP...

She sees Gerald has a Trucker's knife in a holster attached
to his belt. Her hands removes it.

The Orderly swaggers down the hall to The Bride's room, red
Reeboks slapping against the smooth floor.

CU The BRIDE
She SNAPS the knife's BLADE OPEN in her CU.

The Orderly pushes open The Bride's door, stopping in shock.

The ORDERLY'S POV:
He sees an empty bed with bloodstains on it, Two dead
Truckers on the floor, and no Bride.



                       ORDERLY
          Oh shit!

WE GO TO SLOW MOTION    as he freaks, Then PAN DOWN HIM... Past
shirts - pants - to    his Reeboks...Once on the floor WE SEE
The BRIDE, curled up    low next to the doorway, behind his
ankles, knife ready.    WE GO BACK TO 24 FRAMES A SECOND. He
steps into the room;    when he does The Bride reaches out and
SLASHES both of his    Achilles tendons.

The STANDING ORDERLY
lets out a "YELP," adn FALLS OUT OF FRAME.

IMPACT CUT
The Orderly HITTING the floor face first. The boy is stunned.

The BRIDE (Confined to the floor)
crawls over and drags the stunned fucker across the floor,
placing his melon head between the door and the door frame.
Then taking the door in her right hand.

                                 SLAM!

                                 SLAM!

                                 SLAM!

SLAMMING HIS HEAD THREE TIMES BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE DOOR
FRAME.

The ORDERLY
lies on the floor in a stange state of consciousness. He's in
both excruciating pain, and quite sure he's lost his mind,
since at this moment he's lying on the floor, looking up at
The comatose Bride asking him questions.



                    THE BRIDE
          Where's Bill?



                       THE ORDERLY
                 (hurt and confused)
          Who?

                                 SLAM!

He screams.

                    THE BRIDE
          Bill! Where is Bill!



                    THE ORDERLY
          I dunno no Bill.

                           SLAM!



                    THE BRIDE
          I saw him here myself.....
              SLAM!
          ....Now do you tell me where he is,
          or do I beat your fuckin brains in?

                           SLAM!



                    THE ORDERLY
          Please please stop, don't hit me
          again!



                    THE BRIDE
          Where is Bill?

                           SLAM!

Suddenly The Bride sees the gold coke straw around his neck,
that she thought she'd seen earlier on Bill. She snatches it
from around his neck.



                    THE BRIDE
          Where did you get this from?



                    THE ORDERLY
          That's mine.

                           SLAM!



                    THE BRIDE
          Bullshit! I saw Bill wearing it in
          this room ten minutes ago.

                           SLAM!

Then The Bride looks down and sees two tatoos on the
Orderly's hand - one spelling "B.U.C.K." on each finger of

his left hand. And another spelling "F.U.C.K." on the fingers
of his right.

The Bride seems to look inside her own mind - Whenever she
does this A SPECIAL THEME MUSIC WILL PLAY (We'll call it her
REMEMBERING THEME).

WE DO A    QUICK SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM INTO HER EYES -
We see    Buck enter her room that first night, five years
ago....    He's holding in his hand one of those big flashlights
you use    in a tent when camping. -- It gives off a soft blue
light.    Buck examines The Bride through the blue.



                       BUCK
             Well, ain't you the slice of cutie
             pie they all said you wuz. Well
             Ma'am, I'm from Longview Texas, my
             name's Buck, and I'm here to fuck.

He starts to unbuckle his belt.

WE ZOOM OUT OF HER EYES INTO A CU. The REMEMBERING THEME CUTS
OFF. She looks down at Buck and says;



                       THE BRIDE
             Your name's Buck, right? And you
             came to fuck, right?

A "how the fuck does she know look," crosses his face.

The Bride looks down at him....The VENGEANCE THEME BEGINS
PLAYING LOUDLY ON The SOUNDTRACK, and the VEIN IN HER
FOREHEAD BECOMES PRONOUNCED and begins to PULSATE IN TIME
WITH The MUSIC. Every time The Bride comes face to face with
a tormenter, this Theme will play on the soundtrack. By mid
movie this music should drive the audience wild with orgasmic
anticipation of the carnage to come...

...and With the door in her hand and one mighty slam, this
Longview Texas boy is sent to the Promised Land.

She searches the dead man's    pockets,    coming up with a brown
wallet that says on it, "BIG    EL PASO    PIMPIN," loaded with
lettuce. She also pulls out    a set of    car keys on a pickup
truck key chain that has the    words,    "Pussy Wagon" on it
written in a pimpy font. She    gathers    up all these items, and
Gerald's knife, then begins    to strip    Buck of his orderly
uniform.



INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The elevator doors to the hospital's underground parking lot
open, revealing The Bride in Buck's orderly scrubs in a
wheelchair.

She wheels out of the elevator fast into the parking lot. Her
arms spinning the wheels as she goes down the line of cars,
looking for a pickup truck that Buck would own...she stops.

What made The Bride stop. The ass end of a big, yellow 4x4
hard-body pickup truck, with flames painted along the side,
and the words, "PUSSY WAGON," written along the flat-bed
hatch door. Pimpy font.

The Bride looks at Buck's key chain in her hand.

EX CU CAR KEY in truck door lock, it turns.

EX CU TRUCK DOOR LOCK POPS UP OPEN.



INT. BACKSEAT OF BUCK'S TRUCK - NIGHT

The Bride pulls herself up into the backseat of Buck's pickup
truck. Once in the backseat, she shoves the wheelchair away.

It rolls out of control down the parking ramp, and CRASHES.

Now The Bride's lying vertically in    Buck's truck's backseat.
Seemingly out of danger - at least    out of sight - but she's
still stuck hiding in the hospital.    And until she regains
full use of her legs and feet, this    little Bride ain't goin
anywhere or doin anything.

Lying flat, with the back of her head propped up against the
door, her long, lifeless legs stretched out in front of her,
her two bare feet at the end of them, pointing to the sky,
the Bride focusses her eyes, her stare, her thoughts, her
strength, and all her concentration....on her big toe.

SLOW ZOOM INTO BIG TOE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO HER FACE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO BIG TOE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO FACE.



                    THE BRIDE
              (monotone)
          Wiggle your big toe.

Toe doesn't move an inch.



                    THE BRIDE
          Wiggle your big toe.

It doesn't move.

                          THE BRIDE
                Wiggle your big toe.
                    (VOICE OVER)
                As I lay in the back of Buck's
                pickup truck, trying to will my
                limbs out of entropy, I could see
                the faces of the cunts who did this
                to me, and the dick responsible.
                Members all of Bill's brainchild;
                "The Deadly Viper Assassination
                Squad."

WE MOVE INTO A HEAD and SHOULDERS CU OF The BRIDE'S BLACK
SILHOUETTE.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          Now after five years of beauty
          sleep I knew absolutely nothing
          about my enemies' strengths
          weakness or whereabouts. But as
          fated by God vengeance would have
          it, I who knew nothing - knew one
          thing. As sure as God made little
          green apples...

WE MOVE FAST TO O-REN ISHII'S SILHOUETTE, The SILHOUETTE
BECOMES A POSED PICTURE OF O-REN in all her Deadly Viper
glory.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
              (continued)
          ....if O-Ren Ishii, the first name
          on my Death List, was still
          alive... she'd live in Japan. O-Ren
          Ishii, made her first acquaintance
          with death at the age of eleven.

FLASH ON
CU O-REN (11-years old), hiding under a bed, watching...

...her FATHER (dressed in the uniform of a sergeant for the
American Army) fighting THREE YAKUZA GANGSTERS. He kills one
with his bare hands. The other two slice him to death with
samurai swords...

...and her MOTHER being raped by the same men. When they
finish, they SHOOT her.

Little O-Ren watches, hidden from sight, withi the eyes and
face of a stone.



                       THE BRIDE (V.O.)
             It was at that age, a half-Chinese,
             half-Japanese American Army brat
             witnessed the murder of her Master
             Sergeant father. And the rape, then
             murder of her mother at the hands
             of Japan's most ruthless Yakuza
             boss, Boss Matsumoto. She swore
             revenge...luckily for her, Boss
             Matsumoto was a pedophile.

SHOCK CUT
O-REN ON TOP OF BOSS MATSUMOTO PLUNGING A HUGE KNIFE INTO HIS
CHEST. A STREAM OF RED BLOOD SHOOTS UP OUT OF HIM like a
geyser. Boss is naked, O-Ren wears a Japanese schoolgirl
uniform.



                       THE BRIDE (V.O.)
             At thirteen, she got her revenge.

The Boss's screams cause TWO OF BOSS'S MEN to run into the
room, only to be SHOT DOWN by O-Ren, as she removes a gun
from a holster strapped to her thigh.

The 20-YEAR OLD O-REN ISHII
on a rooftop with a high-powered, scope-sight rifle up to her
eye. Her EYE is HUGELY MAGNIFIED in the SCOPE.



                       THE BRIDE
             By twenty, she was one of the tip
             top of female assassins in the
             world.

She fires.



INT. CAR - DAY

A Central American General riding backseat    of his government
vehicle. TWO BEAUTIFUL LATIN WOMEN in one-   piece bathing suits
sit on either side of him. They both wear    sashes down their
front; one reads, "Miss Panama," the other    reads, "Miss
Venezuela." As we cut to this shot, he has    both hands on each
of their bare knees. He's laughing as the    TOP OF HIS HEAD is
BLOWN OFF.

The 23-YEAR OLD O-REN ISHII
stands before Bill and The Bride. (Bill is not clearly
viewed.)



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          At twenty-three she joined Bill's
          Deadly Vipers...

The 25-YEAR-OLD O-REN ISHII
BEATING UP the pregnant Bride with the other Vipers...



                     THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          At twenty five she did her part in
          the killing of eight innocent
          people, including my unborn
          daughter, in a small wedding chapel
          in El Paso Texas. But on that day,
          five years ago, she made one big
          mistake...

POSED FIGURE of the BRIDE in all her pre-beating bridal gown
glory.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          ...she Should of killed nine.
          However, before statisfaction would
          be mine, first things first...

INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY

Pavement of the parking lot. We HEAR a CAR DOOR OPEN
OFFSCREEN, then The Bride's bare foot comes from above FRAME,
stepping down INTO The SHOT.

She walks around to the driver's side and climbs in.

She sticks Buck's ignition key in its slot and turns.

The truck's engine RUMBLES to life.

She spies a pair of Elvis T.C.B. SUNGLASSES lying on the
dash. She puts them on.



EXT. TEXAS STREETS/ INT. TEXAS STORES - DAY

The Bride drives Buck's big, yellow pussy wagon all over El
Paso buying supplies.

WE FOLLOW Her bare feet into a clothing store.

Her feet, legs, and ass slip into a new pair of LEVI'S.

Her hands grab a pair of CHERRY BROWN COWBOY BOOTS.

Then slips on the cowboy boots.

Chooses another TOP.

And finds a warm JACKET.

She opens Buck's "BIG EL PASO PIMPIN" wallet, and pays for
the items.

She emerges from the store wearing her new outfit, and climbs
back in the truck.

She drives, stopping at a DEPARTMENT STORE, and walking
inside.

She picks up a SHOVEL, a HAND PICKAXE, a big CAMPING
FLASHLIGHT, a MAP OF TEXAS, a writing NOTEBOOK, and a bunch

of RED and BLACK FELT PENS.

While the Bride is buying items in the department store we'll
CROSSCUT....

....with her driving the pussy wagon up to a low-rent motel
called, "The Texican"....

...Her Registering with the OLD BASTARD of a desk clerk,
getting the key, and paying him out of the "BIG EL PASO
PIMPIN" wallet....

...her drawing a bath in the bathroom of the motel room...

Shampoo is taken off the shelf of the department store...

...conditioner...

...a bar of soap...

...hot water runs out of the bathtub faucet...

...steam rises off the hot bathwater...

...she pulls down a bunch of bath products, like bubble bath,
salts, apricot this - kiwi that, we see her pour all the
items in the bathwater...

...then we see her bare foot enter the bathwater...

...then Lower her whole body into the bathwater...

...now submerged in the warm bathwater, by herself, perfect
MUSIC CUE ON SOUNDTRACK, she begins to cry...her poor heart
has been shattered and five years of tears come flooding out
of her.

She cries for her baby...

She cries for the motherhood robbed from her...

She cries for all the innocent people at the wedding chapel,
who died simply because they were unlucky enough to cross her
path...

She cries for the betrayal at the hands of her lover...

She cries for the treachery at the hands of her comrades...

She cries for the five years of life snatched from her...

She cries for the countless violations she endured while
incapacitated...

And finally, she cries for all the misery she will cause the
undeserving......enroute to Bill's retribution. Retribution
that begins the minute she steps out of this bathtub.

She curls up into a fetal position inside the tub of warm
water...weeping.

We DOLLY back...to give our heroine some privacy...WE
DISSOLVE through the bathroom door...Till we're on the other
side, filming a closed door with crying on the other side.

When she's finished shedding tears, is when she'll begin
shedding blood.

When the bathroom door opens, the woman that emerges, has
closed out all of her emotions...save from one...revenge.

It's that woman, in her new outfit, that climbs into the
yellow pussy wagon, puts the T.C.B. Sunglasses over her eyes,
and starts the engine that sets into motion the gory story to
follow.

EXT./INT. BUCK'S TRUCK DRIVING IN DESERT (MOVING) - NIGHT

POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD:
The truck shines its headlight beams on an open patch of
prairie wasteland. We see dirt, rocks, plants, and an oil
derrick pumping up and down.

The Bride STOPS the truck.

Taking her flashlight with her, The Bride walks into the
headlight beams towards one rock on the ground in particular.

She lifts it off the ground, there's an X on it's underside.

She    smiles.    If the X hadn't been there, she would have taken
it    as a sign    that her vengeance quest was never meant to be.
But    as it is    there, it would appear that fortune has smiled
on    The Bride    and her bloody intentions.

She walks back to the truck, takes the shovel and the hand
pickaxe out from the flatbed, reaches into the truck cab and
CHANGES THE MUSIC TO A POUNDING HEAVY METAL ANTHEM.

CU The BRIDE'S COWBOY BOOTS
next to the X ROCK
IN TIME WITH The METAL, The Bride's cowboy boots count out
ten paces from the rock.
When the boots stop, the flashlight ENTERS THE SHOT
illuminating the spot, THEN...the shovel ENTERS, striking
deep in the unmarked earth.



EXT. TEXAS DESERT - NIGHT

Deep in the middle of Fuck-Knows Texas, lit by the headlights
of Buck's 4x4, The Bride digs a hole in the
ground......TILL...

She HITS SOMETHING HARD.

She gets down on her knees, hacking away at the dirt with the
hand pickaxe, till a large box covered in plastic is
revealed. She hoists it up out of the earth.

She rips off the plastic, revealing a large, green Army
footlocker, untouched by the condensation of being buried in
the ground for over five years. Flipping the two locks open,
she lifts the lid, placing the big camping flashlight on the
rim.

Unfolding a sleeping bag long-ways, she bought at the
department store. The Bride begins collecting the contents of
her buried treasure, and laying them on the sleeping bag.

We see her remove them from the footlocker, one by one.

The HEAVY METAL CONTINUES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.

pieces is a HIGH-POWERED, SCOPE-SIGHT RIFLE.

1 MANILA ENVELOPE.
She reaches in and pulls out a PHOTOCOPY OF HER SONOGRAM.
There on the page is a photocopy of her unborn baby girl. A
fierce grimness crosses her face as she places the sonogram
back in the envelope.

1 CLEAR ZIP-LOCK BAG containing a PHONY I.D. and BANK BOOK
both w/ the name "CANDY RALSTON" on them. Reaching back in
the locker she pulls out the final item,

1 SMALL KEY attached to a "DEALY VIPERS" KEY CHAIN.

She rolls up the weapons in the sleeping bag, and drives off.
The HEAVY METAL CONTINUES...

The ENTRANCE to a tiny sushi bar, covered by a Japanese
curtain....

                           "The City of
                         OKINAWA, JAPAN"

....The fabric is moved aside, and The Bride enters the shot,
and the tiny establishment.

The little fish and sake bar is the definition of the word
cozy. Besides The Bride, the only other person inside is The
SUSHI CHEF, who smiles at her behind the midget bar.

This Japanese man in his mid-fifties greets the tall, blonde
western girl with a turned-on-for-the-tourists affability.



                     SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          English?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Almost -- American.



                     SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

          Ahhhh,...America, welcome...
          Welcome... My English -- Very good.

The Bride smiles at this and walks further inside. She
doesn't come across as one of the world's deadliest
assassins, but instead as a sweet, slightly airheaded,
American tourist.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Domo.

The Sushi Chef gives an exaggerated look of surprise, and
says;



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Oh, "Domo", Very good -- very good,
          you speak Japanese?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Nooo, just a few words I learned
          since yesterday. - May I sit at the
          bar?



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Sure sure sure - sit. What other
          words did you learn - excuse me --

The Sushi Chef YELLS IN JAPANESE, to someone OFFSCREEN.

The Bride thinks the restaurant so small it's almost hard to
imagine there could be a back room to it.

Before getting a response from whoever it was he was yelling
to a moment ago, The Sushi Chef turns back to The Bride.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          -- What other Japanese you learn?

The Bride puts on a thinking face.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Oh...let's see..."Arigato."



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          "Arigato"...Very good.

                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          ..."Ah-So"...



                    SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
          "Ah-So!" You know what "Ah-So"
          meansß



                     THE BRIDE
          "I See."



                    SUSHI CHEF
          I see - Very good.



                    THE BRIDE
          I already said "Domo", right?



                     SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Yes.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          "Kon-netie-wa."

The Sushi Chef goes "Oooh" like he's just discovered the
answer to a mystery.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          ..."Kon-nichi-wa"...repeat please.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          "Kon-nichi-wa?"

Saying with surprise and admiration;



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Most impressive...you say Japanese
          words, like you Japanese.

The Bride smiles and lets loose with a girlish giggle.

                    THE BRIDE
          Now you're making fun of me.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          No no no - serious business.
          Pronunciation - very good. You say
          "Arigato" ...like we say "Arigato."



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Well, thank you - I mean...arigato.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          You should learn Japanese - very
          easy.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          No kidding, I heard it's kinda
          hard.

Whenever the Sushi Chef doesn't either hear your or
understand you, he yells the word;



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          What!

And everybody always speaks LOUDER and CLEARER immediately
afterwards.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          I always heard it was difficult.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Yes yes yes - most difficult. But
          you have Japanese tongue.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Maybe I was Japanese in another
          life.

The Sushi Chef proclaims as if he should know;

                       SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
             Most definitely, most definitely
             Japanese in another life.

He sets an order of colorful, raw fish in front of the young
blonde woman, that not only looks good, it looks beautiful.



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
             How did you know tuna's my
             favorite?



                         SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
             What!



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
             Tuna's my favorite.



                       SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
             Ah, thank you very much.

He YELLS    OFFSCREEN in Japanese agai. A little BALD JAPANESE
MAN with    a shitty attitude, comes out from the back room. He
heads for    the tall blonde asking in a grumbly voice in
Japanese,    "What she wants to drink?"



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
                 (to the bald man)
             I beg your pardon?

The Sushi Chef pantomimes drinking.



                         SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
             - Drink -



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
             Oh yes, a bottle of warm sake.



                        SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
             Ahhh sake,
                 (he holds up his thumb)
             Very good.

In Japanese he YELLS/ORDERS the warm sake, the little Bald
Man disappears. The Bride takes a bite out of her fish.

                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          First time in Japan?



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          A-huh.



                       SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          What!



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Yes, this is my first time.

As the chef slices the next portion with a large knife, he
asks;



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          What brings you to Okinawa?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          I came to see a man.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Aaahh, you have friend live in
          Okinawa?



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Not quite.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Not friend?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          I've never met him.

The Sushi Chef continues slicing.....



                       SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

          Who is he, may I ask?



                    THE BRIDE
          Hattori Hanzo.

There's a break in the Sushi Chef's slicing. After a beat, he
brings a bloody finger INTO FRAME and sticks it in his mouth.

The little Bald man appears with a bottle of warm sake, he
pours one for The Bride, then disappears again.

As The Bride sips the sake, she looks at the chef.

As The Sushi Chef sucks his finger, he looks at The Bride.

The Sushi Chef drops the voice he had been using up to that
point...and IN JAPANESE SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH asks;



                    SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
          What do you want with Hattori
          Hanzo?

The Bride answers in Japanese;



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I need Japanese steel.



                    SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
          Why do you need Japanese steel?



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I have vermin to kill.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          You must have big rats you need
          Hattori Hanzo steel.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Huge.



INT. HATTORI HANZO'S ATTIC - DAY

The trap door in the floor opens up, and HATTORI HANZO (Sushi
Chef), climbs inside the room, followed by The Bride.

The room has many handcrafted samurai swords in hand-carved
wooden sheaths resting on wooden racks running the length of
the second half of the attic.

The Bride walks down the row of Japanese steel, looking and
touching the shiny wood. She looks behind her to Hanzo who is
still by the trap door, and says;



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          May I?

The Sushi Chef answers in ENGLISH;



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          Yes you may.....

She starts reaching for one...



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          ...try the second one down in the
          sixth row on your left.

She finds it lying sleeping in its shiny, black sheath.

Her hand lifts it from the rack.

She UNSHEATHS the steel, partially....then with GREAT
FLOURISH....completely.

Hanzo's mouth froms a smile.



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          Funny, you like samurai swords...

He pulls a baseball out of his pocket.



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          ...I like baseball.

THEN SUDDENLY - HE THROWS THE BASEBALL HARD, right at The
Bride's head....

QUICK AS A WHIP, SHE SLICES THE BALL IN HALF, IN MID AIR.

The two perfectly cut baseball pieces, hit the floor.

He gives her a slight nod, then crosses the attic towards
her.

                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          I wanted to show you these....
          However someone as you, who knows
          so much must surely know, I no
          longer make instruments of death. I
          keep these here for their ascetic
          and sentimental value.
              (he takes both sword and
               sheath from her...)
          Yet proud tho I am of my life's
          work...
              (...he closes them
               together)
          I am retired.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Then give me one of these.



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          These are not for sale.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          I didn't say, sell me. I said, give
          me.



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          And why should I be obliged to
          assist you in the extermination of
          your vermin?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Because my vermin, is a former
          student of yours. And considering
          the student, I'd say you had a
          rather large obligation.

Hattori Hanzo goes to a dusty window, and writes the name,
"BILL" on it with his finger.

The blonde girl nods her head yes.

The proud warrior moves over to the door in the floor,
throwing it open.

He points into a corner...

                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          ...You can sleep there...

.....starts to descend....



                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          ...it will take me a week to make
          the sword...

.....before his head disappears, he says;



                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          ...I suggest you spend it
          practicing.

...he closes the door behind him.

She smiles slightly...then moves over to the window, takes
out a handkerchief, and wipes Bill's name off.

                                            FADE TO BLACK.



OVER BLACK
TITLE APPEARS:


                        "One week later"

Under black we hear Hattori Hanzo's voice in Japanese and
read the subtitles;



                    HANZO (V.O.; JAPANESE)
          I'm done doing what I swore an oath
          to God 28 years ago to never do
          again. I've created, "something
          that kills people." And in that
          purpose I was a success.

                                                FADE UP ON



CU HATTORI HANZO



                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          I've done this, because
          philosophically I'm sympathetic to
          your aim.

EX CU The HANZO SWORD

TRACKING EX CU of the Hanzo sword in its shiny, black wood
sheath. At the base of the sheath, by the handle, he's carved
the face of a lioness...



                      HANZO (V.O.; JAPANESE)
            I can tell you with no ego, this is
            my finest sword. If on your
            journey, you should encounter God,
            God will be cut.

CU HANZO.



                      HANZO (JAPANESE)
            Revenge is never a straight line.
            It's a forest. And like a forest
            it's easy to lose your way...to get
            lost...
            to forget where you came in. To
            serve as a compass, a combat
            philosophy must be adopted that can
            be found in the secret doctrine of
            the Yagu Ninja. And now my yellow
            haired warrior, repeat after me;

We go back and forth between CU of HANZO reciting the
doctrine like a samurai drill instructor and the Bride
repeating it.



                      HANZO (JAPANESE)
            "When engaged in combat, the
            vanquishing of thine enemy can be
            the warrior's only concern...

The Bride repeats this...



                      HANZO (JAPANESE)
            ...This is the first and cardinal
            rule of combat...

The Bride repeats this...



                      HANZO (JAPANESE)
            ...Suppress all human emotion and
            compassion...

The Bride repeats this...



                      HANZO (JAPANESE)

          ...Kill whoever stands in thy way,
          even if that be Lord God, or Buddha
          himself...

The Bride repeats this...



                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          This truth lies at the heart of the
          art of combat. Once it is
          mastered... Thou shall fear no
          one... Though the devil himself may
          bar thy way...

The Bride repeats this... Her eyes look at the greatest maker
of swords on this earth and says;



                       THE BRIDE
          Domo.

EX CU The Hanzo Sword,
her white hand with her long fingers COMES INTO FRAME and
removes the beautiful, artful instrument of vengeance.

                                              FADE TO BLACK.

A BLANK PIECE    OF DRAWING PAPER
A hand comes    in and, as the Bride talks over this image,
draws with a    piece of charcoal, a portrait of the geisha
regaled O-REN    ISHII.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          When fortune smiles on something as
          violent and ugly as revenge, at the
          time it seems proof like no other,
          that not only does God exist,
          you're doing his will. At a time
          when I knew the last about my
          enemies, the first name on my death
          list, was the easiest to find. But

          of course,    when one manages the
          difficult    task of becoming queen of
          the Tokyo    underworld, one doesn't
          keep it a    secret, does one?

The charcoal drawing gets color and becomes ANIMATED, turning
into a JAPAMATION O-REN...

JAPANESE ANIMATION SEQUENCE
We see Japamation-style images of The Bride's verbiage.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          At the age of twenty, Bill backed
          his Nippon progeny financially and
          philosophically in her
          Shakespearian-in-magnitude power
          struggle with the other Yakuza
          clans, over who would rule vice in
          the city of Tokyo.

Japamation images of O-Ren and her Army, taking on ANOTHER
YAKUZA ARMY, among falling cherry blossoms.

WE CUT BACK AND FORTH between cartoon images of this and the
real life real McCoy samurai sword battle.

O-Ren's ability is simply amazing.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          When it was all over, it was the
          geisha-regaled O-Ren Ishii that
          proved the victor.



INT. JAPANESE NIGHT CLUB

O-Ren has just become the official leader of crime in the
city of Tokyo. The six Yakuza clan bosses, each with TWO
BODYGUARDS standing behind them, toast their new leader, with
much laughter and drinking...all except one...BOSS TANAKA.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          And just in case you're wondering
          how could a half breed Japanese
          Chinese American become the boss of
          all criminal activity in Tokyo,
          Japan,... I'll tell you. The
          subject of O-Ren's blood and
          nationality came up before the
          council only once. The night O-Ren
          assumed power over the crime
          council.

Boss Tanaka is the picture of angered ambiance among the
alcohol-fueled frivolity.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          The man who seems bound and
          determined to break the mood is
          Boss Tanaka. And what Boss Tanaka
          thinks is...

Boss Tanaka brings his fist down on the table, smashing the
plate in front of him into itty bitty pieces.

The party comes to a halt as all eyes go to the leader of the
Tanaka Crime Family.



                    CRIME FAMILY LEADER #2 (JAPANESE)
          Tanaka? What's the meaning of this
          outburst? This is a time for
          celebration.



                    BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
          And what exactly should I be
          celebrating? The perversion of our
          illustrious council?

The Bosses all react with shock and outrage...O-Ren remains
cool. She raises her voice for the first word, but lowers it
for the rest of the sentence.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Gentlemen...Boss Tanaka obviously
          has something on his mind. Allow
          him to express it.



                    BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
          My father...
              (looking at a clan head)
          ...along with yours and...
              (looking at another)
          ...along With yours, started this
          council. And while you drink like
          fish and laugh like donkeys, they
          weep in the afterlife over the
          perversion committed today.

The BOSSES react again...O-Ren;



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)

           Silence!
               (then composed)
           Of what perversion do you speak,
           Tanaka?

Boss Tanaka looks at the female half-breed American and says;



                     BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
           I speak, Mistress Ishii,....of the
           perversion done to this council,
           which I love more than my own
           children,...by making a half
           Chinese American its leader.

Then...

Faster than you can say Jimminy Cricket,...

O-Ren's samurai sword is unsheathed...

Boss Tanaka's head is liberated from its body...

The head hits the floor...

And from the spot between its shoulder blades, a geyser of
blood shoots up in the air.

The BOSSES who were shocked at Tanaka's words are even more
flabbergasted at O-Ren's resonse.

The two bodyguard's, standing behind Boss Tanaka, hands go to
their swords and draw them.

O-Ren turns her blade in their direction.

The Bosses and their bodyguards say nothing,...only watch.

The lady looks across at the two men and says in and
authoritative voice;



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Fight me or work for me.

They look at her for a moment, then they lower their swords.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Drop them on the ground.

They do.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Get behind me.

They do.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Get on your knees.

They do.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Put your foreheads on the floor.

They do.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Keep your mouths shut.

You better believe they do.

The mistress' eyes got to the other bosses looking at her.

As she speaks English, bodyguard translators translate for
their bosses.



                     O-REN
           I'm going to say this in English so
           you know how serious I am. As your
           leader, I encourage you to -- from
           time to time and always in a
           respectful manner, and with the
           complete knowledge that my decision
           is final -- to question my logic.
           If you're unconvinced a particular
           plan of action I've decided is the
           wisest, tell me so. But allow me to
           convince you. And I will promise
           you, right here and now, no subject
           will be taboo...except the subject
           that was just under discussion.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
               (to a bodyguard)
           Hand me that head.

He picks it off the floor and meekly offers it to the Queen.

She takes it by the hair and holds it up as she speaks.



                     O-REN (ENGLISH)

          The price you pay for bringing up
          either my Chinese or my American
          heritage as a negative is, I
          collect your fuckin head.
              (now completely American)
          Just like this fucker here. Now if
          any of you sonsabitches got
          anything else to say, now's the
          fuckin time.

Nobody says anything.



                    O-REN (ENGLISH)
          I didn't think so.
              (pause)
          Meeting adjourned.



EXT. THE HOUSE OF BLUE LEAVES - JAPANESE RESTAURANT

The entire O-Ren Ishii crew moves through the restaurant. The
CUSTOMERS all look up now as the crew passes. The restaurant
staff acts as if the Shogun himself has just showed up on
their doorstep demanding a meal. No doubt if the meal is not
satisfactory the staff will gladly slice off a finger. The
door to a private dining room is slid open, the crew steps
inside, the door is slid shut.



INT. PRIVATE DINING AREA (RESTAURANT) - NIGHT

The private dining area of the Japanese restaurant. The
patrons are surrounded by white paper walls. The CAMERA
CIRCLES around O-REN ISHII.

Sitting in between her, two personal bodyguards, the Yubari
sisters, YUKI AND GO GO. The Yubari sisters are younger than
O-Ren; Yuki is sixteen and Go Go is seventeen. Both girls are
dressed in Japanese schoolgirl uniforms complete with plaid
skirts and matching blazers.

FLASH ON
EX CU OF AN EYEBALL (The BRIDE's)

On her right is her French and Japanese lawyer, SOFIE FATALE.

FLASH ON
EX CU OF AN EYEBALL

The bunch of mop-topped young men, who all wear black suits,
white shirts, thin black ties and Kato masks over their eyes,
are her soldiers, "The CRAZY 88."

FLASH ON
EX CU OF AN EAR, The Bride's fingers come into FRAME and move
blonde hair out of the sensory appendage's way.

And finally there's a tall dark American in a black suit sans
Kato mask -- that's O-Ren's head of security, MR. BARREL.

They're all drinking and having a good time as Sofie tells a
joke in Japanese.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          The mop tops in black suits and
          Kato masks were O-Ren's soldiers,
          "The Crazy 88." The two young girls
          in the schoolgirl uniforms are her
          personal bodyguards, the Yubari
          sisters. Yuki, aged sixteen, and Go
          Go, aged seventeen. The pretty lady
          who's dressed like she's a villain
          on Star Trek is O-Ren's best friend
          and her lawyer, Sofie Fatale. And
          finally, the American in the black
          suit but sans Kato mask, O-Ren's
          head of security, Mr. Barrel.

SUDDENLY O-Ren hears something. Like a deer in the forest,
her head springs up on alert. It's almost as if she's
listening to The Bride's narration.

The Bride's NARRATION SUDDENLY STOPS IN MIDSENTENCE --

O-Ren removes a SMALL DAGGER-DART from the folds of her robe
and THROWS IT in the direction of the sound.

CU The BRIDE dressed in a kimono
on the other side of the private dining room's paper wall.
The DART FLIES THROUGH The PAPER, STREAKS BY HER FACE, almost
taking off the tip of her nose in the process.

INSERT: DART EMBEDS ITSELF IN A WOOD POST.

O-Ren's action instantly brings the room's frivolity to a
halt. Mistress Ishii silently orders Go Go and Yuki to
retrieve the eavesdropper.



INT. JAPANESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The white paper door to O-Ren's dining room SLAMS OPEN. Yuki
and Go Go step into the corridor.

All trace of the Bride has vanished.

They look out over the restaurant, patrons look normal.

Whoever was there is gone now.

Go Go removes the small dagger from the wood post and the
Yubari sisters go back into the private dining room, SLAMMING
the door behind them.

ONE SHOT

CU The BRIDE
at the bar, in her kimono, drinking a colorful cocktail. She
observes all the activity by O-Ren's private dining room.
When the Yubari sisters go back inside, the Bride climbs off
her barstool and goes through the restaurant...into the
parking area...and up to her rental car. She opens the door.
Takes off her Japanese kimono, underneath is a one-piece
yellow track suit with a black stripe going down both sides,
like the one Bruce Lee wears in "Game of Death." She tosses
the kimono in the trunk, then removes the sheathed Hanzo
sword. With the sword of vengeance in her hand, we follow her
back inside the restaurant. She looks upstairs to the O-Ren
dining room. We see Yuki Yubari and Sofie Fatale, slide open
the door, and walk down the stairs together. When they get to
the bottom, they give each other a kiss goodbye, and Yuki
leaves the restaurant, while Sofie makes her way to the
bathroom...only to have The Bride, now dressed in her Bruce
Lee yellow outfit and samurai sword in her hand, bar her way.

                                                 END OF SHOT
BACK AND FORTH
between CU's of the two women, face to face.



                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)
               (to Bride)
           Can I help you?



                     THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
           Yes, I am looking for the attorney
           of O-Ren Ishii, Sofie Fatale. Would
           that be you?



                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)
           I'm Mistress Ishii's attorney. How
           can I help you?

The Bride PUNCHES her in the face.



INT. O-REN'S PRIVATE ROOM

Aside from drinking like fishes, what is the queen of the
Tokyo underworld - Mistress O-Ren Ishii - and her private
army doing when we cut back?

Singing karaoke, of course.

It's Crazy 88 MIKI's turn at the mike and he's having a whale

of a good time singing Dionne Warwick's "Walk On By," in
Japanese....

WHEN...

A COMMOTION is heard being made by the restaurant staff and
the other patrons, from the other side of the white paper
wall...Just as they all start to notice it, they hear;



                    THE BRIDE (O.S., JAPANESE)
          O-Ren Ishii! You and I have
          unfinished business!

The Crazy 88 spring to their feet. One slides open the door.

They see O-Ren's lawyer, Sofie Fatale, standing in the middle
of the restaurant, her left arm completely outstretched, hand
gripped around a post. She has a terrified look on her face.
Before anybody on O-Ren's side of the room can say anything
...The Bride steps out from behind Sofie.

O-REN'S
reaction shows how effective the element of surprise turned
out to be. She says The Bride's name softly to herself; it's
BLEEPED OUT.

The Bride
The VENGEANCE THEME BURSTS ON THE SOUNDTRACK...The Vein on
her forehead begins to pulsate. WE DO A QUICK SHAW BROTHERS
ZOOM INTO HER EYES. A SPAGHETTI-WESTERN FLASHBACK of O-Ren
beating the shit outta her at the wedding chapel IS
SUPERIMPOSED OVER HER EYES. The FLASHBACK DISSOLVES, we ZOOM
BACK INTO A CU, the vein stops pulsating, and the theme STOPS
PLAYING OVER THE SOUNDTRACK, LEAVING A CLEAN, COLORFUL CU of
The Bride loaded for bear.

She raises her Hanzo sword, and Slices off Sofie's Arm at the
Shoulder with one stroke.

SOFIE
Spewing and Gushing Blood from her stump, twists her body in
agony, painting the floor and the walls with giant Splashes
of Red, as her body hits the floor, twitching in both
surprise and shock.

The CRAZY 88
run out into the dining area and create a human wall between
themselves and their Mistress.

MR. BARREL AND GO GO
take positions on either side of O-Ren.

O-REN
seated in a shogun's seat, rises furiously to her feet.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)

          You bastard!

The Bride does a swipe in the air with her sword; Sofie's
blood flies off the blade.

The entire floor of the dining room lies between the two
warring parties.


                          The Bride
                             vs.
                         The Crazy 88

The restaurant's STAFF and PATRONS sit or stand rigidly in
fear.

O-Ren says loudly to the room;



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Sorry everybody, but I'm afraid
          we're going to have to close the
          place. There's some private
          business that we must attend to
          now.

The Staff and The Customers Stampede the exits.

The Bride, The Crazy 88, and O-Ren hold    their ground without
moving a muscle, till the dining room,    as well as the entire
restaurant known as "The House of Blue    Leaves," is deserted
of every human not engaged in the face-   off that precedes
combat.

O-Ren gives a simple order;



                    O-REN
          Miki.

MIKI, one of The Crazy 88 (The little one), steps forward,
unsheaths his sword, and yells at the yellow clad blonde.



                    MIKI (JAPANESE)
          You had it coming bastard!

Raising his samurai sword high, he Charges, Screaming A
Banzai Scream...

The Bride turns to face him.

Miki Charging and Screaming...

The Bride slowly raises the Hanzo Sword into Striking
Position.

Miki Charging and Screaming, almost on top of her.

The Bride, sword in position, waits for her opponent to
arrive.

Miki arrives at his destination, he Swings...

The Bride Swings...

The Hanzo Sword Slices Miki's inferior blade in half. Miki
looks down at the impotent weapon in his hand.

The Bride Thrusts her sword through Miki's abdomen, then
Lifts the little guy off the ground straight up in the air.

Miki screaming, Impaled on her blade like a fish at the end
of a spear. Held up in the air, restaurant light fixtures in
the B.G.

O-Ren and her crew watch stunned.

The Bride Drops the shishkabobbed Miki into the koi pond that
starts outside the restaurant and ends inside, with a huge
blue splash. Koi pond - Blue water - Orange and yellow fish -
Red blood - Dead man.

The BRIDE
looks up from the pond, across the length of the    floor, into
the eyes of O-Ren Ishii.
She takes one step forward, hears the slightest    noise, Twirls
the samurai sword in the air once, drops to one    knee, and
thrusts the sword into the beige-colored carpet-   covered
floor. The sword sticks in the floor half way...

The Sound of human death rises from underneath the floor...

OVERHEAD SHOT
Looking down on The    Bride at one end and O-Ren and her crew
at the other. A Red    Circle appears where the blade is buried
in the floor...The    red circle grows larger...and larger...and
larger...and larger    still...

Leaving the sword stuck in the floor, handle sticking
straight up in the air, The Bride rises up from her one knee,
and straight and tall, staring down the queen of the Tokyo
underworld.

O-Ren
her eyes narrow with rage. She screams out another order;



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Tear the bitch apart!

The six remaining Crazy 88 unsheath their swords at the same
time with a GREAT SOUND EFFECT.

They circle the Bride.

The BRIDE
Inside the circle of Combatants who surrounded her. She Whips
the sword out of the floor and raises her blade diagonally in
front of her. Her eyes are reflected in the shiny steel.

Holding her sword in the diagonal position, The Bride can see
reflected in the shiny blade, whoever stands behind her.

The six Crazy 88 Attack...

The BRIDE
does a Zatoichi-like SWISH-SLASH-SWISH with her steel blade.

Four boys die an    immediate samurai blade-inflicted death,
SCREAMING GRUNT,    TWITCHING BODY, FROZEN IN THE STANCE IT WAS
SLASHED IN, RED    BLOOD SQUIRTING FROM WOUNDS, THEN A CRASHING
COLLAPSE TO THE    FLOOR.

The last two put up more of a fight...but then one of them is
SLASHED and FALLS and the last one is SLASHED AND CRASHES
THROUGH the restaurant's big picture window.

EX CU The EYES
of The Bride, pointed down at the bodies by her feet,

...BEAT

...they Look back up at O-Ren.

O-REN
standing in between Go Go and Mr. Barrel. Her eyes narrow.

The BRIDE
swipes the air with her sword, the blood of the dead
attackers flies off.

GO GO and MR. BARREL
unsheath their swords.

WHEN...

We hear a LOUD SOUND of many ENGINES behind the Bride. Then
behind her, through the broken pictures window we see
seventeen motorcycles pull up to the parking lot. All the
riders wear black suits with kato masks, and all carry
samurai swords.

The BRIDE
looks from the reinforcements to O-Ren.

O-REN
smiles.



                     O   -REN (ENGLISH)
              (to the     Bride)
          You didn't     think it was going to be
          that easy,     did you?

                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
              (to O-Ren)
          You know, for a second there, yeah
          I did.

O-Ren smiles...



                    O-REN (ENGLISH)
          Silly rabbit...

Both O-Ren and the Bride finish the phrase together,...



                    O-REN/THE BRIDE
          ...Trix Are for kids.

This is something they used to say back when they fought
alongside of each other as "Vipers."

The seventeen Crazy 88 reinforcements come running into the
restaurant and with drawn swords surround The Bride.

As a HEAVY METAL COMBAT BEAT begins to PULSATE ON THE
SOUNDTRACK, The Boys and The Bride have a Spaghetti Western
Stand-off.

We do a 360 INSIDE the CIRCLE of The Crazy 88, who surround
the yellow-haired warrior. Not all have Samurai swords; one
JUGGLES TWO HATCHETS, another TWIRLS A THREE-STAFF TRIPLE
IRON over his head.

As the Heavy Metal music builds...We Cut to various Shots of
The Two Opposing Forces Preparing to Strike....Hands on Sword
Handles...Feet finding Combat Stance...etc...

....Until Heavy Metal reaches its Breaking Point...

...At that point, the Metal EXPLODES OVER THE SOUNDTRACK...IN
TIME WITH The BRIDE EXPLODING INTO A VIOLENT KILLING MACHINE
ON SCREEN.

As she matches skill with the army of black-suited boys, arms
flailing, silver blade Clashing and Slashing, long blonde
hair whipping like a whirling dervish....
...She's a Goddess of War Venus.

Not only is the FIGHT CUT TO THE HEAVY METAL MUSIC, but The
Bride seems to be somewhat dancing to it as she fights.

This explosion of furious violence is punctuated
CINEMATICALLY BY THE COLOR IN THE FILM POPPING OFF, and the
fight being filmed in HIGH CONTRAST BLACK AND WHITE, turning
the squirting, spewing geysers of BLOOD FROM CRIMSON RED TO
OIL BLACK.

Many members of The Crazy 88 are Sliced, Slashed, and
liberated from the limbs they were born with at The Bride's
blade.

Some SPECIFIC MOMENTS

While Clashing swords, The Bride whips the silver Boomerang
out of its holster, and Throws it...

....It Twirls Through the Air...

...Embedding itself longways in one of the boy's faces.

The Bride does a Mid-Air Somersault over the head of an
Attacker, landing solid on her feet behind him...Slash, he's
Out.

The Bride is knocked to the floor, her Attacker stands over
her to Spear the young blonde, Her Legs Spring Up In The Air,
Ankles Lock Around The Boy's Neck.

She throws him down to the ground. With his neck still in the
vise-like grip of her ankles, She removes The SOG Knife from
its sheath and Plunges it Deep Into The Boy's Chest.

While still on the ground, an Attacker Charges at her.
Yanking the Boomerang out of the Dead Boy's Face, She Sends
It Flying in the Charging Man's path...

...Boomerang Twirling Through the Air Close to the Ground...

...Chopping Off the Charging Attacker's Foot in Mid Step, he
falls flat.

The Bride jumps up onto an attacker's shoulders. She locks
her legs around him so he's helpless at shaking her off.

...she swings down with her sword, and cuts the man's hands
off.

So while the helpless man with no hands screams, the now nine
foot tall Bride fights with the others.

When she's through she brings the blade across the man she's
perched on's throat. He falls to his knees, bringing the
Bride back to the floor like an alevator.

As soon as her soles touch ground, she's off his shoulders,
somersaulting on the floor, bringing her blade up between an
attacker's legs into his groin.

He lets out a scream, as she yanks her blade free.

ONE ATTACKER steps out from the rest, "The Best One." He
Twirls his sword expertly, challenging the young woman to,
"Come get a piece."

The Bride does a screaming charge towards him....
...Sword raised, The Attacker stands his ground, calm -
steady, waiting for the blonde-haired locomotive to

collide.....They meet.....

SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE - SWING - CLASH - SPIN -
CLASH - LOCK - TWIRL - SEPARATE -

They match each other blow for blow, till one makes a
mistake. It's the male. The Bride's swing, that's neither
clashed or blocked, slices off his right arm.

...The arm, still gripping the samurai sword, drops to the
floor.

The Bride pushes the Hanzo Sword right through the middle of
his chest.

Only half of the Crazy 88s that started the fight remain
alive, or intact...They start to approach...The Bride, still
holding the sword that's still impaling the skilled Attacker,
backs up, keeping his body between her and the remaining
killers.

Like a boxer, The Bride uses the momentary break in the
action, to rest on her feet.....THEN...yanks the blade from
his chest cavity....The Body Twitches - Spasms - Grunts and
Crashes to the floor.

The Attackers start to close in...The Bride readies herself
for their attack....THEN (in perfect time with the Heavy
Metal)...Drops to the floor on her back, Spinning like a top.
She Swings and Slashes and Cuts down below at their legs and
feet, like some hellish samurai sword-weilding turtle flipped
over on its shell....

Many black-suited, mask-wearing boys drop to the ground.

...Still Spinning like a break dancer, she spins up on top of
her head, and Pops back up on her feet.

And then there were seven.

The seven remaining sword-weilding, black-suited boys moved
out of range of the Bride's blade when she dropped to the
floor. Now spread out, they make a large half-circle.

The Bride, slowly points the tip of her blade to the floor,
lowers herself to one knee and slightly bows her head. In
repose.

EX CU The Bride's eyes
pointed up, watch them move closer, COLOR COMES BACK INTO THE
FILM. We see her face is splashed with blood.

O-REN
WHIPS OPEN a red fan.

GO GO stands by the restaurant's junction box, she flips the
switch.

The room goes dark.

The Crazy 7 make a wide circle around the blonde who's still
on the floor....

...Looking down on her breathing hard in the shadows. As she
breathes in and out, The FACE OF A LIONESS IS SUPERIMPOSED
OVER HER FACE.

Breathe in (Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) - Breathe in
(Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) .....

The Bride rises to her feet...

The Crazy 7 move in a circle around The Bride, she moves in a
circle inside of their circle, all eight of them move in
rhythm with the Metal...

The Heavy Metal Music builds....to a big finish...THEN both
Music and The Bride Explode!

WIDE SHOT - FRAMED LIKE A KABUKI STAGE
With the lights off, The White paper wall the eight killers
fight in front of turns a Psychedelic Bright Blue. The snow
falling outside is reflected against the paper wall like
black snow falling on a blue shadow puppet stage.

The eight samurais are Black Silhouettes against the blue
backdrop. They begin to combat in a dance of blood, steel and
death. The Bride does a sword-weilding dosey-doe with all
sword-weilding partners.

She CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASHES with all of them - They
seperate - stalk each other for a moment to the beat - then
CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASH again, with The Bride killing or
hacking the limbs of one unlucky dance partner at each
encounter - Sometimes during the separation, The Bride
crouches down low in repose while the others continue to
circle stalk...THEN...She Strikes again.

We Cut in closer whenever we need to.

Finally the last of O-Ren's soldiers falls to the Bride's
sword.

GO GO
Standing by the junction box, flips a switch turning the
lights back on. The electricity shines light on...

The BRIDE
Splashed all over with blood. Blood painting the floor, walls
and ceiling. Dead bodies, several limbs, and horribly wounded
men who have yet to die, litter the ground.

With a big "Whoosh" in the air, the blood of O-Ren's
subordinates fly off the blonde avenger's blade.

Then saying to the foes who litter the ground.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

          Those    of you lucky enough to still
          have    your lives. Take them with
          you.    But leave the limbs you've
          lost.    They belong to me now.

The wounded men, crawl out of the restaurant.

The yellow-haired crimson-covered woman, looks to the last
remaining combatants...Mr. Barrel, Go Go Yubari, and O-Ren
Ishii.

Go Go
steps forward and removes her weapon, it's not a samurai
sword. It's a heavy metal ball at the end of a long chain.
She begins TWIRLING it above her head. Each rotation makes a
WHOOSH sound in the air.

BALL AND CHAIN
in a 3-D-like effect, the metal ball comes right at us.

The BRIDE
ducks out of the way, the heavy ball destroying a large chunk
of wood post behind her.

Go Go
eyes focused on her enemy...WHOOSH....WHOOSH....WHOOSH...she
lets fly...

The ball and chains wrap around the blade of the Hanzo
sword...

...Go Go yanks...

...the Hanzo sword FLIES out of her grip.

GO GO
smiles...then...WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

The BRIDE
removes her boomerang and THROWS it at Go Go.

The BOOMERANG
TWIRLS through the air heading right for Go Go.

BAM

The young bodyguard    swats it out of the air with her ball and
chain. She lifts up    her chain and the boomerang lies bent, on
the floor. She looks    across at her opponent...WHOOSH...
WHOOSH...WHOOSH..she    LETS FLY. It Strikes the Bride in the
chest, knocking her    on her back...

...Go Go twirls it over her head and sends it towards the
Bride on the floor. The Bride rolls out of the way, the metal
ball PUNCHES a hole in an overturned table instead.

The weaponless Bride wrestles a table leg loose from its
purpose.

She hops up on a table, table leg in hand, ready to fight.

Go Go hops up on a table...

As they fight they hop from table to table...

Go Go throws her ball and chain...

...The Bride - QUICK AS A WHIP...

BATS it away with the table leg.

Go Go lets loose with the balls and chain...it wraps around
the Bride's ankle...Go Go YANKS...

...The Bride's leg is yanked out from under her, she FALL
CRASHING through another table.

Go Go jumps on top of the Bride, attacking her with a samurai
short sword. The Bride uses the table leg to block it.

The women fight fiercely, locked in grapple, each face ugly
with struggle. Go Go lets her left earlobe get too close to
the Bride's mouth...the Bride BITES DOWN on it. Go Go screams
as the lower part of the appendage is bitten off, and she
rolls off the Bride. The Bride comes at her, bringing the
table leg -- WHOOPS UPSIDE HER HEAD -- WHOOP-WHOOP-SIDES-HER
HEAD.

The girl in the schoolgirl uniform falls on her back, and
delivers a powerful "C.K." to the Bride from below, dropping
her to her knees.

O-Ren is UP, and wraps the chain around the Bride's neck and
begins to strangle.

The chain digs into the Bride's throat.

The Bride brings the table    leg, which    has a couple of    nasty
looking nails in it, hard    against the    Japanese girl's    thigh.
The nails cut through the    plaid school    uniform skirt    into her
flesh...the Bride rips out    the nails,    taking some leg    meat
with them.

Go Go lets out a horrific scream.

The Bride brings the table leg down on the toe of the young
girl's white tennis shoe. The nails stick in, the white shoe
becomes stained with red.

Go Go SCREAMS letting loose of the chain...falling on the
floor.

The Bride unwraps the chain around her neck, and begins
breathing air into her lungs.

Go Go tries to escape, dragging her fucked-up leg with her...

The Bride rises from the floor and begins, twirling Go Go's
weapon above her head.

Go Go, fast as she can, climbs up the stairs to the second
floor...

The Bride stands at the bottom of the stairs, twirling the
ball and chain over her head.

Go Go frantically, and in great pain, climbs the stairs...
She gets to the top.

The Bride lets loose with the ball and chain...

It HITS the female bodyguard and one half of the Yubari
sisters, smack DAB in the back of the head.

CU GO GO
We see her face as she's delivered a death blow right behind
it. We see behind her eyes and features, her life and spirit
shatter like a teapot.

Like a discarded rag doll, Go Go Yubari TUMBLES down the
staircase landing in a pile at the Bride's feet. Dead before
the tumble began.

The Bride throws the ball and chain to the floor. Her eyes go
to the last two remaining combatants...

...Mr. Barrel and O-Ren Ishii.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Any more subordinates for me to
          kill, O-Ren?

Mr. Barrel says;



                    MR. BARREL
          One last one.



                    THE BRIDE
          You're Mr. Barrel, right?



                    MR. BARREL
          And you're Black Mamba.



                    THE BRIDE
          Our reputations precede us.



                    MR. BARREL
          Apparently.

                    THE BRIDE
          Tell me Mr. Barrel, why don't you
          wear your Kato mask? Are you and
          iconoclast?

Mr. Barrel takes out a kato mask on a stick, like from a 17th
Century costume ball, and holds it over his eyes.



                    MR. BARREL
          I don't like that rubber band. It
          fucks up my hair.



                    THE BRIDE
          You shouldn't work for her.



                      MR. BARREL
          Too late.



                    THE BRIDE
          It's not too late to quit.



                    MR. BARREL
          Do you have choices?



                      THE BRIDE
          No.



                    MR. BARREL
          I know exactly how you feel.



                    THE BRIDE
          This has nothing to do with You and
          I, and everything to do with me
          taking satisfaction from that bitch
          behind you. And there's absolutely
          positively no way I'M going to
          leave here without taking that
          satisfaction. So Mr. Barrel, you
          have to stand aside. And that means
          you must quit, right now.

                     MR. BARREL
          I can't.



                    THE BRIDE
          Yes you can.



                    MR. BARREL
          No I can't.



                    THE BRIDE
          Don't say "Can't", there are no
          "Cant's." Yes - You - Can.....

O-REN ISHII
Screams at her "...last line of defense;"



                    O-REN (ENGLISH)
          What are you waiting for? Are you
          on a date? Attack her you fool!



                    THE BRIDE
          Oh my God...
              (pause)
          ...She just called you a fool. She
          just called you a fool in front of
          me. Not only am I your opponent.
          I'm a female fellow countryman.
          And you're going to risk your life -
          to say nothing of harming me - for
          a woman who refers to you as a
          fool?

O-REN
is furious, and slaps Mr. Barrel on the shoulder.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Attack, Goddamn you!

The Bride acts like she's embarrassed to witness what she
just saw.

Mr. Barrel spins in O-Ren's direction shooting her a look
she's never seen from him before.

He then looks back to the Bride.

Her eyes are waiting for his. She says with just the
slightest hint of plea in her voice;



                      THE BRIDE
            I'll owe ya one.

He looks at her a BEAT longer...then says as he resheaths his
sword;



                      MR. BARREL
            The things I do for a pretty face.

INSERT: The Blade sliding back down into the Sheath, The
Handle locks into place with a Click.

He looks back over his shoulder at his former Mistress, and
says;



                      MR. BARREL (JAPANESE)
            I quit.

O-Ren fries and egg on her head.

Then   with his sheathed Sword    in his right hand, and his left
hand   in his pants pocket, he    walks across the carnage-strewn
room   and out the front door.    As he walks, when he's parallel
with   the Bride, He stops and    says;



                      MR. BARREL
            About that one you owe me.



                      THE BRIDE
            Yes?



                      MR. BARREL
            I'm gonna collect someday, you
            know?



                      THE BRIDE
            I'll be disappointed if you don't.

He continues walking without a look back. Before he Exits the
restaurant, he throws a look in Sofie's direction, Who's
lying minus her arm in a pool of her own blood, and says;

                    MR. BARREL
          Tough luck bout that arm Sofe.

He exits the Movie.

O-REN and The BRIDE
match eyes. The Japanese gal says;



                    O-REN (ENGLISH)
          Very funny.
              (pause)
          Your instrument is quite
          impressive.



                      THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Domo.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Where was it made?



                      THE BRIDE
          Okinawa.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Whom in Okinawa made you this
          steel?



                    THE BRIDE
          This is Hattori Hanzo steel.



                      O-REN (JAPANESE)
          YOU LIE!!

The Bride just smiles at her rival's response.

O-Ren's composure returns.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Swords however never get tired. I
          hope you've saved your energy. If
          you haven't, you might not last
          five minutes.
              (pause)

          Have you seen the garden in this
          establishment?



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          No.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Oh, you really should. It's quite
          beautiful. Allow me.

O-Ren moves out of the position she's stood in for the entire
battle. She steps on the doormat of a corpse, that serves the
same purpose of a bottom step, and moves over to the white
paper wall and slides it open....REVEALING....

.....A WHITE WINTER WONDERLAND, set against a Jet Black sky.
A Snow-covered Japanese Garden awaits right outside. Snow
falls from the sky (Slightly artificial, not phony - but
Operatic/Theatrical). O-Ren stands next to the Bride in the
doorway looking out into the white night.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          As last looks go, you could do
          worse.

The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld steps outside...

The Bride follows her...



INT. SNOW-COVERED JAPANESE GARDEN - NIGHT

As snow falls around them, they stand the correct distance
from one another.

COMBAT MUSIC BEGINS PLAYING, but not Japanese drums - Spanish
Flamenco Guitar.......

The Bride Unsheaths her Sword Quickly...Holding it out in
front of her...Tip of Blade pointed at O-Ren...Sword's Handle
and her Fingers wrapped around that handle, up by her
cheek...Her eyes are Reflected on the Blade...Snow falls
around her.

O-Ren begins walking forward towards the Bride...She raises
up her Sword, still in its sheath, in front of her face
vertically...then begins slowly unsheathing it...Snow falls
around her.

O-REN'S FEET
White socks in wooden clogs, walk forward, Crunching Snow
underneath them...

The BRIDE
Holding Sword...Eyes reflected in Blade...her Yellow Sneakers
Crunching snow underneath them...

O-REN
when her Sword is fully unsheathed, the Japanese combat
artist holds both arms straight out at her sides, Sword in
one hand - Wood sheath in the other, like a bird....

....The Two Women circle each other....

They SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE...CIRCLE...SWING -
CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE...

O-REN LEAPS in the air
does a Somersault over the Bride's head, landing behind her
opponent. She brings her Sword down in a Slashing Swing...

SLASHING The BRIDE
across her back - Spinning her around...

O-Ren goes in for the kill...The Bride meets her blade... The
Blades Clash and Lock...The Two Women's faces come together
as the Blades become entangled...

O-Ren moves her arm in a counter-clockwise motion that
loosens the grip enough to bring her sword handle hard into
The Bride's mouth...

Knocking her backwards over a small, stone bench - Flat on
her ass in a koi pond.

- The Combat Guitar Stops -

O-Ren doesn't charge the fallen blonde, She laughs;



                    O-REN (ENGLISH)
          Silly Caucasian girl likes to play
          with samurai swords. Bill might of
          humored you, but you will find
          neither humor nor mercy at my
          blade. Now unless you intend to
          commit sepeku among the koi, stand
          up and fight. You may not be able
          to fight like a samurai, but you
          can at least die like a samurai.

The Combat Guitar starts again...As The Bride slowly rises
out of the koi pond. She brings up her sword and Says Calmly
to O-Ren in Japanese;



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Attack me. With everything you
          have.

The Two Women Clash Swords furiously, their attack ends with

The Bride's Striking O-Ren - not fatally - but deep. They
separate...

...breathing hard...Cold Air coming out of their mouths like
two locomotives...

O-Ren looks down to her wound, then back up to The Bride. The
respect for the Bride's ability is transparent.

The Two Women Circle Stalk each other again...

Red Blood running down Yellow Legs onto Yellow Sneakers...

Wooden Clogs crunching the Snow, Blood trail dripping down
legs staining White Socks with Red...

They Attack, the Geisha figurine and The tall western girl
with the mane of Whipping Blonde Hair. They Swing - Twist -
Turn - Clash, matching blow for blow till they both back off.

Both Women are out of breath and have    to stop to recuperate.
As they both drink the harsh cold air    into their lungs,
leaving red blood stains in the white    snow, the two females
have the same thought. The next clash    will be their last.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          I apologize for ridiculing you
          earlier.



                      THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Accepted.

They continue breathing...



                      THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Ready?



                      O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Yes.

The Flamenco Guitar begins again, as The Two Women Circle
each other for their final attack.

With all the quickness and skill at their command, they clash
in a superb display of Samurai Swordplay...TILL...They Find
themselves on opposite sides of a garden wall...

...The Bride and O-Ren both begin Running diagonally through
the snow, Swords held up high, Facing each other, Continuing
to run even after they passed the wall, Screaming their
Samurai hearts out...

UNTIL...

They both SWING...

...can't tell who got who...

A SCALP OF LONG, BLACK HAIR FLIES THROUGH THE AIR, landing in
the white snow.

CU O-REN ISHII
facing away from the Bride. Sword still in her hand. We see
she doesn't have the TOP OF HER HEAD ON. A touch of her BRAIN
is exposed. Blood Droplets streak her face like raindrops.
The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld, who's regime has just
ended with one swing, stares off into space.



                     O-REN (ENGLISH)
           That really was a Hattori Hanzo
           sword...

Her sword FALLS from her grip...in the snow by her feet.



                     O-REN (ENGLISH)
           I always dreamed of owning one...

O-Ren FALLS to her knees, toppling forward.

Left Cheek in the snow, just barely alive, She says;



                     O-REN (ENGLISH)
           Did he make it for you?



                     THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
           Yes.

The Last thing she says before she dies;



                     O-REN (ENGLISH)
           ...He must of liked you.

With her cheek resting against the snow, her eyes close and
she's gone.

The BRIDE
removes a white handkerchief (The One we saw her sewing
earlier with "Bill" in the corner), and uses it to wipe the
blood, once belonging to the first name on her death list,
off her Hanzo Steel.

EX CU THE HANZO SWORD

is returned back to its sheath. The LION'S HEAD that Hanzo
carved into the wood seems pleased.

                                                  CUT TO:

The BRIDE
now wearing a yellow, faceless motorcycle crash helmet on her
head, stands FRAMED in a TRUNK SHOT.

SOFIE FATALE
Minus an arm, lies curled up in the trunk of her MAZDA XOXO.

The BRIDE slams the trunk, SCREEN BOES BLACK...

The MAZDA driving down the road at supersonic speed.

The BRIDE
behind the wheel wearing her crash helmet. It looks like an
insert from "GRAND PRIX."

POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD
car speeding...then stopping.

BLACK SCREEN
The BRIDE lifts up trunk lid, we look up at her FRAMED in the
TRUNK SHOT. Helmet on head making her faceless, gold Deadly
Viper syringe in her hand.

When she speaks it comes out of a VOICE BOX at the bottom of
the helmet. Turning her voice deeper and electronically
spooky. The two women speak Japanese to each other.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I've kept you alive for one reason.
          Information. Being O-Ren's lawyer,
          I take it you're familiar with
          Bill?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          Yes.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          In fact, I'd guesstimate, you
          worked for Bill before O-Ren, and
          that's how it is you came to work
          for O-Ren. Am I correct?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          Yes.

                     THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I thought so. Give me the arm you
          have left.



                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          Why?



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I want information. Now gimme your
          arm.

Sofie offers up her remaining arm.

She injects Sofie with the gold syringe.



                    THE BRIDE    (JAPANESE)
          The cocktail racing    through your
          bloodstream at this    moment is
          Bill's own recipe.    He calls it "The
          Undisputed Truth."

Sofie is injected.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Okay, first things first. Where was
          the other Yubari sister? Yuki?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          Yuki's sick. She went home early.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Do tell? What's wrong with her?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          She has a cold.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Awwww poor baby. What do you think
          she'll do when she finds out what
          happened?



                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)

          She'll wail with grief.

                                               SHOCK CUT TO

YUKI YUBARI upon hearing the news of her sister's death...

She SCREAMS!

BACK TO SOFIE



                    SOFIE
          She'll drink excessively.

BACK TO YUKI
Big bottle of sake in her mouth pointed bottom up.

BACK TO SOFIE



                    SOFIE
          She'll start trouble.

BACK TO YUKI
sitting at a bar in drunken stupor. An OLDER JAPANESE MAN in
a business suit sits next to her at the bar...he puts the
make on her.



                    BUSINESS SUIT (JAPANESE)
          Do you like Ferraris?

Yuki staring out into space, says with a drunken voice;



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Ferrari...Italian trash.

She slowly turns to face the older Japanese man in the
business suit.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Do you find me hot?

The man in the business suit giggles at her boldness; she
gets annoyed;



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Don't laugh! Do you want to fuck
          me, yes or no?

                       BUSINESS SUIT (JAPANESE)
          Yes.

THEN...

He lets out a GRUNT coming from below.

We see she has stabbed him in the belly with a samurai short
sword, and is slowly dragging the blade across his abdomen,
creating a big red grin across his mid-section.

TWO SHOT YUKI AND BUSINESS SUIT
Yuki focused, Business Suit penetrated...She opens him up
more...he feels every inch of the blade's progress.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          How bout now, big boy, do you still
          wish to penetrate me...

Blade cuts deeper...



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Or is it I who has penetrated you.

And with her last line, does the final disemboweling slice
that sends his insides spilling out onto the barroom floor.

BACK TO SOFIE



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          When she stops shedding tears,
          she'll start shedding blood.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Best guess, what will she do?



                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          I don't hafta guess, she'll come
          after you.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Will she ever give up?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          She won't have to. When she finds

          you, I don't know who will win. But
          what I do know is, she will find
          you.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Is she more skilled than I?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          Skilled won't be the word.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Don't be coy with me, bitch. What
          would be the word?



                    SOFIE
          Crazy.

The Bride takes this in...then moves on.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Okay, now I want all the
          information on the Deadly
          Vipers,... What they've been doing
          and where I can find them.



EXT. TOKYO GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The big hospital of TOKYO is located by a hill by the
highway. Sofie's MAZDA pulls off the highway to the side.

The Bride hops out of the car, runs to the back, opens the
trunk, takes out Sofie's body, and rolls it down the
hill....Sofie stops rolling in front of the entrance of the
huge hospital.

                                                 CUT TO:

CU SOFIE
in a hospital environment. Bill's voice speaks to her OFF
SCREEN;



                    BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)
          Sofie, Sofie, my Sofie, I'm so
          sorry.

                    SOFIE (ENGLISH)
          Please forgive my betrayal --

He shhhh's her off screen;



                    BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)
          -- no more of that. I invented that
          truth serum. Once it entered your
          bloodstream, you no longer had a
          choice.



                    SOFIE (ENGLISH)
          But, still --



                    BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)
          -- But still -- nothing, except my
          aching heart over what she's done
          to my beautiful and brilliant
          Sofie.
              (pause)
          If you had to guess why she left
          you alive, what would be your
          guess?



                    SOFIE (ENGLISH)
          Guessing won't be necessary. She
          informed me.

BACK TO THE BRIDE AT THE TRUNK



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          I'm allowing you to keep your
          wicked life for one reason and one
          reason only. So you can tell him,
          in person, everything that happened
          here tonight. I want him to witness
          the extent of my mercy..., by
          witnessing your deformed body. I
          want you to tell him, all the
          information you just told me. I
          want him to know what I know. I
          want him to know I want him to
          know.

Then with SUPERMAN X-RAY VISION we see through the helmet to
the Bride's face inside as she says the last line.

                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          And I want them all to know,
          they'll all soon be as dead as O
          REN.

                                              WE CUT TO A

CU of SOFIE
WE PAN to a CU of YUKI

Bill says off screen;



                    BILL (O.S.; JAPANESE)
          If O-Ren was number one, unless
          she's being tricky, Vernita Green
          will be number two.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Where is Vernita Green?



                    BILL (O.S., JAPANESE)
          Los Angeles. Vernita's in Pasadena.
          But the woman you want will hold up
          in a low budget motel, fifteen of
          twenty minutes away from stepping
          on board a plane departing LAX. If
          I had to bet...I'd say Hawthorne.

Yuki blows a pink bubble gum bubble, it pops and she says in
English;



                    YUKI (ENGLISH)
          California, here I come.

                                                   CUT TO:

CU HATTORI HANZO
He's sewing something that requires a lot of concentration.

CU The BRIDE'S BARE BACK
What he's sewing is, the NASTY SLASH O-Ren gave the Bride on
her back, closed with a simple needle and thread.

CU The BRIDE
lies naked on her stomach, head up, chin resting on her
folded hand, feeling no pain at the needle piercing her
flesh. The sleeping giant is awake, and in her eyes we see
she's filled with a terrible resolve.

As Hanzo sews, he recites in Japanese the Yagu mantra, the
Bride recites in Japanese after him.

EX CU: O-REN ISHII'S name written in the Bride's notebook

                          YUKI'S REVENGE


We hear music under this card...

MONTAGE OF YUKI coming to Los Angeles cut to music.

We see YUKI dressed in her Japanese private schoolgirl outfit
with white blouse, plaid skirt, bobby socks, blazer, and
barrettes in her hair, flying on a jet enroute to Los
Angeles. She paints her fingernails with bubble gum-colored
nail polish.

Yuki walks through LAX.

She points at a car in front of her.

We see her cool convertible sports car and her finger
pointing at it.

We see Yuki behind the wheel of the sports car, driving as
fast as she can through the twists and turns of the Hollywood
Hills, laughing all the way.

We see Yuki running around all over LA, Hollywood and
Disneyland taking pictures with her disposable Barbie camera.

We stay with Yuki's side as she stops across the street from
the Bride. During their face-off we only see the Bride at a
distance.

The Bride is in the b.g., back to us packing her trunk, just
about ready to make a clean getaway...

WHEN...

Yuki yells to the figure across the street.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Conigute wa!

We see the back-turned figure of the Bride slightly freeze
upon hearing the Japanese greeting. Without turning around
she says;



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Conigute wa.
              (pause)
          Yuki?



                    YUKI (ENGLISH)
          Bingo!

THRILLER MUSIC begins on the soundtrack.

The Bride turns around to face the young avenger.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Can I help you?



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          You can kill yourself.

Yuki giggles.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Taking a trip?



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I was.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          You still are. One way.

                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I know you feel you must avenge
          your sister. But I beg you...walk
          away.

Yuki giggles.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          You call that begging? You can beg
          better than that.

Yuki giggles. Then she takes out a flashlight, and switches
on the beam.



                    YUKI    (JAPANESE)
          Can I see your    face? I've heard
          your beauty is    exquisite. I would
          like to see for    myself.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Sure.

Yuki shines the flashlight beam in the Bride's face.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Ohhhh,...look how pretty your face
          is. Oooohhh,... I want to touch it.



                    THE BRIDE
          Domo.



                    YUKI    (JAPANESE)
          Your face is so    pretty, I just want
          to put both of    my palms against
          your cheeks and    give you little
          tiny kisses.

Yuki then shines the flashlight up into her own face.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          How do I look?



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

          Very pretty.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          You're just saying that 'cause I
          told you how pretty you are.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Yuki, you're gorgeous.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Really? Is that how you'd describe
          me to somebody if I wasn't here?
          Yuki's gorgeous?



                     THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          You bet.

Yuki giggles.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Don't make me kill you.



                     YUKI (ENGLISH)
          Okay.

Yuki removes the Israel sub-machine gun from behind her back
and FIRES A LOUD INTENSE VOLUME of firepower at The Bride.

The Bride dives out of her way, just as her yellow pussy
wagon is demolished by the ammo.

The Bride, with her samurai sword in her hand, and her
backpack full of money, takes off running across a couple of
front lawns...

Yuki chases her with machine gun fire...

The Bride LEAPS over a long hedge...disappearing Behind it.

Yuki runs after her, firing all the way, destroying the
hedge...

The Bride darts across the street, she hits the ground and
rolls under a Volkswagen van.

Bullet FIRE EXPLODES all around the Bride as she rolls out on
the other side. She removes her 9mm automatic and returns
fire from behind the van.

Yuki yells to her in English;



                    YUKI (ENGLISH)
          You think you're safe! I say; Ha!

She takes out a hand grenade, removes the pin with her teeth,
and slides it towards the Bride.

The Bride sees the live hand grenade skidding and sliding on
the asphalt towards her...

She takes off running...as the Volkswagen van EXPLODES BEHIND
HER.

She cuts through the backyard of a house -- THE CAMERA TAKING
OFF WITH HER -- over their fence, in the backyard over the
fence into another yard. She trips, falling into the other
house's swimming pool. Instead of splashing around, the Bride
swims like she was in the Olympics, till she's in the shallow
end. Without breaking her stride, she runs out of the pool.
Now with her gun out, the sopping wet Bride gets to the front
of the house. It's located on a cul de sac.

WHEN...

Yuki's sports car pulls up at the end of the street.

Both women see the other.

Yuki hits the gas, firing her machine gun out the window of
her car as she speeds down the dead-end street.

The Bride, runs across lawns and hides behind parked cars on
the street, as the bullets rip up homes, lawns, and
automobiles.

When Yuki's car reaches the end of the dead end,...

She jerks the wheel...

SPINNING the car around, pointing it in the opposite
direction.

SHE HITS THE GAS AGAIN...

SHE PULLS THE MACHINE GUN TRIGGER AGAIN...

BULLETS TEAR UP the cars lining the street.

In the hail of bullets, the Bride tries to fire back.

Yuki reaches the end of the street and spins the car around.

She gets ready to make a third pass.

Some PEOPLE in the house behind the Bride, look out of their
front door.

The Bride yells at them;



                     THE BRIDE
          Stay in your house and stay down on
          the floor!

Yuki speeds after her, but this time she pops the curb and
drives across the front lawns on the street heading right for
her.

The Bride runs into the house she's in front of.

She runs through the living room, to the kitchen and the back
door, but the kitchen's where the family that lives here is
hiding and they block the door.

Yuki's sports car pulls up in front of the house. She stands
up in the convertible. Takes out a grenade, pulls the pin and
says;



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Time for the rabbit to come out of
          her hole!

She lobs the grenade up on the porch, then throws herself
face down on the lawn.

The porch and the front of the house explodes into splinters.

Everybody in the kitchen is blown back.

Realizing there's no getting out of the back door, the Bride
runs back into the living room that's now missing a wall, and
runs up the home's staircase leading to the bedrooms.

Yuki steps into the house, sub-machine gun in hand...

The Bride makes it to the top of the stairs, and is just
about to disappear behind the upstairs hallway wall...

WHEN...

Yuki fires up at her, hitting her twice in the leg.

The upstairs hallway, two bedroom doorways line both sides of
the hallway. The Bride crashes to the floor -- SCREAMING --
blood pours out of her gunshots.

Yuki charges up the stairs...machine gun blazing, tearing up
the house.

The Bride aims her 9mm where she expects Yuki to emerge.

Yuki gets to the top of the stairs, and steps into the
hallway.

The Bride fires...

The Bride's bullet wings Yuki in the left breast, knocking
her through a bedroom doorway.



                    THE BRIDE
              (to herself)
          Gotcha!

Yuki screams like a little girl at the pain. She yells from
the doorway into the hallway;



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          You fucking bitch! You shot me in
          my breast! They're not fully
          developed yet, you fucking asshole!
          Now I'm always gonna have a dimple!

The Bride answers Yuki back with an imitation of Yuki's
giggle, which makes the youngin blow her top.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Piss me off!

She fires her machine gun around the corner, tearing up
everything around the Bride.

When the young girl stops firing, the Bride yells;



                    THE BRIDE    (JAPANESE)
          Yuki, in about two    minutes there's
          going to be an army    of police here.
          So if you're gonna    kill me, now's
          the time.

From her hiding place, Yuki snorts a line of baby blue
powder. It gives her energy.



                    THE BRIDE (O.S., ENGLISH)
          So what's it gonna be bitch?

Slapping a new clip in her machine gun.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          That fucking does it!

Yuki comes around the corner FIRING her machine gun in the

Bride's direction, ripping up everything around her.

The Bride lying flat on the floor fires her 9mm.

The explosion of ammo creates the hysteria of warfare combat.

Yuki charges the Bride, Kamakazi style.

Three more bullets rip into the Bride, the Bride fires up at
Yuki, hitting her three times in the body, knocking her off
her feet, and sending her tumbling down the stairs.

The Bride shot up, pulls herself to the top of the stairs.
She sees Yuki lying at the bottom, dead.

Yuki's face, dead,    eyes closed...then they pop up open...
Guess what...she's    not dead. Though she's bloody and her
schoolgirl uniform    is filled with bullet holes she rises. Her
head turns in the    direction of the Bride...

The Bride sees this and can't believe it...

They lock eyes...

...Yuki, who no longer has the machine gun, takes out a
deadly looking knife and snaps it open with a smile that
builds to a scream...

She charges up the steps at the Bride.

The startled Bride fires at her...the 9mm's empty...

Yuki charging up the steps, yelling, knife raised high...

The Bride, hurriedly removes the pistol she keeps in her
ankle holster.

Yuki chargin...

The Bride cocks back the hammer...

...Yuki charging, getting closer...

The Bride FIRES

Bullet hits Yuki, stops her for a quarter of a second, but
she keeps charging...

The Bride fires again...

Yuki jerks but keeps on charging...

Bride fires...

Yuki jerks, but keeps charging...

Bride fires...

Yuki jerks, keeps chargin, almost at her, knife raised
high...

The Bride FIRES

Yuki jerks, but keeps charging, knife ready to do its duty...

The Bride fires, but her gun jams...

Yuki leaps on her with the knife...

They struggle for a moment...

...TILL...

...The Bride realizes Yuki's dead. She tosses her to the
side.



                       THE BRIDE
             Goddamn, what a wildcat.



INT. NURSE OWEN'S HOME - NIGHT

The phone rings and a black woman in a nurse's uniform with a
name tag on it that reads, "B. Owens," answers the phone.



                       NURSE OWENS
             Hello.

CU The Bride
on her cell phone, a business card in her hand, with a number
written on the back that says, "B. Owens," and her phone
number. She's bleeding from her five bullet holes. Sitting in
a pool of her own blood. She's starting to tremble. We can't
see where she's at, but it's somewhere surrounded by wood
planks. The moon shines into the structure.



                       THE BRIDE
             Hello, I'm calling Nurse Owens --



                       NURSE OWENS
             Who is this.



                       THE BRIDE
             You don't know me, but --



                       NURSE OWENS
             -- And I don't want to neither. Now

I don't know how you got my number,
but you can just rip that shit up,
because --



          THE BRIDE
-- I've been shot five times --



          NURSE OWENS
-- Stop, I don't wanna hear no
more. I got problems of my own.



             THE BRIDE
I'm dying.



          NURSE OWENS
Then bitch, you better call
yourself a ambulance, cause I don't
do this shit no more.



          THE BRIDE
I can't call an ambulance.



             NURSE OWENS
--    No, you can call a ambulance,
you    just don't want to. But if your
ass    is really dying, you ain't got
no    motherfuckin choice.



          THE BRIDE
I do have a choice, and I'm
choosing to call you. If you refuse
to help me, I'll die. And that will
be your choice.



          NURSE OWENS
Bitch, I don't even know you!



          THE BRIDE
What do you need to know? I'm from
Earth, I'm a woman, I'm dying, and
only you can help me.

Her last line has an effect on the hard-hearted nurse.



                    NURSE OWENS
          Okay, where you at?



                    THE BRIDE
          I'm in Hawthorne. I'm hiding in a
          kids treehouse. It's a street
          called, "Dimmick". 1-7-3-6 Dimmick
          Avenue. There's a bunch of police
          cars and firetrucks, about two
          blocks away.



                    NURSE OWENS
          Whatcha do, crawl two blocks?



                    THE BRIDE
          If you can't walk, you better
          crawl.

Nurse Owens likes that last line.



                    NURSE OWENS
          You got you some money dontcha, or
          am I doin this out of the goodness
          of my heart?



                    THE BRIDE
          You come and get me, today's pay
          day.



                    NURSE OWENS
          You ain't too far away. You gonna
          bleed to death I get there in a
          half a hour?



                      THE BRIDE
          Probably.



                    NURSE OWENS
          Okay, I'll be there in fifteen
          minutes.

                    THE BRIDE
          Is that Pacific Standard Time, or
          C.P.T.?



                    NURSE OWENS
          Just you better be there    when I get
          there, and you better be    shot five
          times, and your bony ass    better be
          on your last motherfuckin    legs.



                    THE BRIDE
          How do you know I have a bony ass?



                    NURSE OWENS
          You sound like you have a bony ass.

The Nurse hangs up the phone.



INT. TREEHOUSE - NIGHT

The Bride sits in her own blood waiting for Nurse Owens.

Nurse Owens' head pops up from the door in the floor.



                    THE BRIDE
          Glad you made it.



                    NURSE OWENS
          There's cops all over here, I had
          to be cool. They tend to notice
          things like Negroes sneaking around
          people's backyards.

The nurse hands the Bride a big bottle of Wild Turkey.



                    THE BRIDE
          What's that?



                    NURSE OWENS
          This shit's gonna hurt, and I ain't
          got no anesthetic.

              (refers to the bottle)
          So git busy.



INT. NURSE OWEN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

OVERHEAD SHOT
The Bride laid out on Nurse Owens' kitchen table, while the
nurse extracts the bullets.

The Bride screams.

The TV is turned up loud to hide the screams.

The fifth slug is placed in an ashtray next to three
cigarette butts and other balls of lead.

The Bride, drunk as a skunk, says to her savior;



                    THE BRIDE
          That fuckin smarts.

Smoking her menthol Kool, Nurse Owens says;



                    NURSE OWENS
          Yeah, bullets are bad news. In the
          future, you should avoid them if
          you can.



                    THE BRIDE
          I'll keep that in mind. So, do I
          have a future?



                    NURSE OWENS
          You'll live to kill again.



                      THE BRIDE
          Splendid.

She passes out.

                                             FADE TO BLACK.

EX CU SLOT IN DOOR
is slid open revealing two male eyes on the other side.



                       DOORMAN (O.S.)
          Yes?



                    TWO EYES (O.S.)
          I heard you had a game?



                    DOORMAN (O.S.)
          Who are you?



                    TWO EYES (O.S.)
          They call me Bill.



                       DOORMAN (O.S.)
          Bill what?



                    BILL (O.S.)
          That, no one ever calls me.

A FEMALE VOICE FROM OFF SCREEN says to the Doorman;



                    FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Open the door Alburt, let's see
          what this Bill looks like.

The door opens revealing BILL to the other side of the door,
and for the first time, to the audience. He looks cool.



INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Bill looks inside and sees a fancy hotel room converted into
a crap game. A crap table has been erected in the middle of
the suite. SEVEN MEN stand around the table trying their
luck. All playing has stopped at the opening of the door.

One woman in a beautiful black dress, stands at the head of
the table...It's her game...her name is L.F. O'BOYLE.

Bill stands in the doorway. ALBURT the doorman, who wears a

tux, waits for L.F.'s word.



                       L.F. O'BOYLE
             Are you a policeman, Bill?



                       BILL
             Not anymore?

L.F. laughs.



                       L.F.
             Let him play, Alburt.

Bill steps inside and the game continues in earnest.



                       L.F.
                 (to the players)
             We now return to the game already
             in progress. The point is nine
             gentlemen, nine is the point...

As Alburt    frisks him, Bill takes in the room. There are five
other men    all wearing black tuxedos, all carrying samurai
swords (as    is Alburt), all working for Miss O'Boyle. In his
hand Bill    holds his sheathed Hanzo sword. Referring to the
sword;



                       ALBURT
             I'll take that.



                       BILL
             You'll have to.

The two men stare...



                       L.F.
             Now now boys...Mr. Bill, do you
             intend to start any shit with that
             sword?



                       BILL
             I give you my word of honor, I will
             start nothing.

                    L.F.
          Good enough for me.
              (back to game)



                    ALBURT
          Miss O'Boyle required a two-hundred
          dollar membership fee.



                    BILL
          That's rather pricey.



                    ALBURT
          You wanna play for free, go to
          Vegas. You start now you'll be
          there by sundown.

Bill takes out a roll of bills that would choke a rodeo bull
to death. He peels off two hundred.



                    BILL
          I think I'll stay here. I'm
          thirsty.



                      ALBURT
          That way.

Bill walks over to the suite's bar, a YOUNG WOMAN tends it.



                      BILL
          Beer.



                    BARTENDER
          Twenty dollars.



                    BILL
          Twenty dollars for a beer?



                    BARTENDER
          High cost of living shooter. You
          don't like it, go to Vegas. You can

          get a prime rib dinner there for
          3.95.



                    BILL
          What am I going to do, I'm thirsty.
              (throws a 20 on the bar)
          Pour the beer.

The Bartender produces a dixie cup, and a can of Budweiser.
She pops the top and fills the cup, leaving half of the beer
inside the can. She then offers only the cup to Bill.



                    BILL
              (pointing to the can)
          I don't get that?

The Bartender slowly shakes her head, no.

He lifts the dixie cup to his lips, and says;



                    BILL
          Cheers.

Bill approaches the table with his dixie cup of beer.



                    L.F.
          Gentlemen, let's    see if the new kid
          in school wants    to play right away.
              (to Bill)
          How bout it new    kid, you wanna
          handle my bones,    or do you just
          like to watch?

Dropping his money roll on the table...



                    BILL
          I came to play.

Color L.F. impressed.



                    L.F.
          Boys take a look at this man, he's
          what Webster's calls, a gambler.
          The dice belong to you , sir.

With her table stick, she pushes the dice to Bill. He takes
them and inspects them.

                    L.F.
          I hope you're not implying
          anything, friend?



                    BILL
              (as he inspects dice)
          I'm not implying anything.

Alburt starts to move from his position by the door.



                    ALBURT
          That did it fuckhead, you're out
          the door --

L.F. motions him back to his position.

The players watch L.F. And Bill, an opposite ends of the
table, trade quips.

Bill looks from the dice to L.F.



                    BILL
          You looked me over when I stood in
          your doorway. I'm looking you over
          as I step up to your table. If I
          don't know, I don't throw.



                    L.F.
          Are you satisfied?



                    BILL
          More or less.



                    L.F.
          I think we're getting into a
          antagonistic relationship.



                    BILL
          Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were
          trying to take my money, and I was
          trying to take yours.

                    L.F.
          It's just a game.

Bill throws ten thousand dollars on the table, the room
reacts.



                     BILL
          If you're game, take my bet
          sportsman.



                     L.F.
          Covered.

Bill smiles as he rolls the dice in his hand, then
throws...7...The room reacts...L.F. smiles and pushes the
money and the dice back to Bill with her stick. He picks up
his winnings, tosses them back on the table, and says;



                    BILL
          Shoot it all.

The room reacts.



                     L.F.
          Covered.

He holds the dice in his fist...and throws...5...



                    L.F.
          The point is five, gentlemen, five
          is the point.

Bill throws...5...more reaction...more money...



                    BILL
          Shoot it all.



                     L.F.
          Covered.

He shoots again, he wins again...

L.F. MOVES THE MONEY in front of him.

Bill picks up the stack of moola...L.F. Stands behind her
table, stick in her hand, eyes on her opponent.

In the midst of this silence, his beeper goes off. His eyes
go to it. It reads; ELLE DRIVER.

He raises his eyes from the beeper to L.F., casually tosses
the green on the felt and says;



                    BILL
          Shoot it all.



                    L.F.
          Pretty lucky tonight, huh?



                    BILL
          Play a game of luck long enough
          you're bound to meet some lucky
          people.



                    L.F.
          You know we've never been properly
          introduced, I'm L.F. O'Boyle.



                    BILL
          And I'm not interested.



                    L.F.
          No, you're rude. Why so rude rude
          boy, I'm only trying to be
          friendly.



                    BILL
          I didn't come here to make friends.
          I came here to shoot a little crap.
          But then your boy over there hits
          me up for a two hundred dollar
          privilege to play fee --



                    L.F.
          -- That's a membership fee, good
          for --



                    BILL

-- You and nobody else. You sell at
the bar a half can of warm piss, at
twenty bucks a shot. How much did
the six-pack cost you? 5.60, 5.65?
You're greedy O'Boyle. You're just
too Goddamn greedy. You know what I
like to do when I meet greedy
people? Take every fuckin thing
they got. Leave em with nothing.



          L.F.
So that's your game, you want to
teach me a lesson?



             BILL
I wanna    burn you    down. When I'm
through    with you,    you won't have a
pot to    piss, or a    window to throw
it out    of. You'll    thumb a ride out
of L.A.    wearing a    barrel.



          L.F.
I could always save myself this
horrible fate by not taking your
bet.



          BILL
To be replaced by a different fate.
The embarrassing truth that you run
a gutless game. I won't forget it.
I'm sure these gentlemen won't
forget it. I'm sure they'll tell
people who won't forget it. And we
won't come back. If we don't come
back, you won't get our money.
Couple of weeks, you won't have a
game.



          L.F.
You got a big mouth, lucky boy. And
the idea of taking everything
you've won away, and sending you
out the door with nothing but a red
face, is so appealing to me, that I
will take your bet. But.....not
with those dice.



             BILL

          Oooohhh, that's....



                    L.F.
          The house's perogative and you know
          it.

She holds out her palm and two new pair of dice (black) are
placed in her hand by one of her bodyguards. She sets the
dice on the table, and moves them in front of Bill with her
stick.

Bill looks down at them.



                    L.F.
          Maybe you would like to change your
          bet?



                    BILL
          Yes I would.....Shoot it
          all.....Against myself.

His hand scoops the dice off the table.

He catches the young lady by surprise.



                     L.F.
          What?



                    BILL
          Did I stutter, I'm changing my bet.
          I'm betting I don't make it.

From the door Alburt says;



                    ALBURT
          You can't do that.



                    BILL
          Oh yes I can. It's the shooter's
          perogative, and she knows it.



                     L.F.
          Covered.

He throws....

....................BOXCARS.

The spectators go apeshit.

Bill scoops up his money and looks to the lady who's game he
just busted.



                    BILL
          Can I use your phone?



                    L.F.
          Sure it's next to the bed.



INT. BED AREA OF HOTEL ROOM

Bill sits on the bed talking with Elle Driver on the phone.

In the b.g. L.F. is throwing everybody out.



                    L.F.
          Game's over, get out! Get the fuck
          out! No more tonight, go home....



                    BILL
              (into phone)
          Vernita's dead? When?
              (pause)
          What about her family?
              (pause)
          Nice to see Kiddo hasn't gone
          completely apeshit. No idea where
          she is?
              (pause)
          Okay that did it, we're going to
          Texas and talk sense into Budd
          before (BLEEP) makes him number
          three.

He looks over and L.F. is sitting on the floor of the bed.
All the players have left, only L.F. and her five tuxedo boys
remain.



                    BILL
          We're going to have a talk about
          this later.
              (pause)

          Well, I'm not exactly among friends
          at the moment.
              (pause...he laughs)
          I'll keep that in mind, bye bye.

He hangs up.



                    BILL
          Got a nose problem?



                    L.F.
          I said you could use my phone. I
          didn't say I wouldn't listen.



                    BILL
          This is true.



                    L.F.
          You didn't burn me down you know?



                     BILL
          Course not. First rule of any
          house, ya gotta have LUCKY GUY
          comes in and wipes the place out
          insurance.



                     L.F.
          If there weren't losers it wouldn't
          be a game.

Standing up, folding his winnings into his inside jacket
pocket, looking at L.F. and her boys, he says;



                    BILL
          I sincerely hope you mean that.

Without another word he exits the hotel room.

Nobody makes a move to stop him.

L.F. O'Boyle and her henchmen stand still as they wait for
the sound of the elevator in the hall.

The Bride's Voice comes on the soundtrack;

                       THE BRIDE (V.O.)
             What L.F. O'Boyle didn't know was,
             the real game was just beginning.
             Bill was on the job, and she was
             the target. Now Bill was the
             greatest assassin of the 20th
             century. In fact the term HITMAN
             was coined for him. And he rarely
             performs actual assassinations
             anymore. However every once in
             awhile - to keep his hand in - he
             does. Only he plays a game. He
             doesn't start big trouble...he lets
             them start it. If they do, they're
             dead. If they don't, not only won't
             he perform, he'll take the hit off
             the market. It's kind of fun
             watching people gamble when they
             don't know they're gambling, isn't
             it?

They hear the elevator in the hall.

L.F. O'Boyle tells her men;



                       L.F.
             Get my money back. Don't kill him.
             Chop off all his fingers.

Alburt smiles.

The Five men go out the door.



INT. HALLWAY HOTEL

The Five tuxedo-clad bodyguards hit the hallway, only to
see....BILL, with his Hanzo sword unsheathed, standing at the
end.

This wasn't expected, they unsheath their swords.

He Charges at them.

In the    hotel's hallway, Bill cuts through the five men. His
mastery    of the Hanzo sword in his hand is peerless. He cuts
through    the first four rather quickly. The fifth one, Alburt,
is the    most skilled, but he too falls under the master's
blade.



INT. HOTEL ROOM

L.F. O'Boyle hides in her room, holding a gun, pointed at the
front door.

She sits in bushwhack mode, waiting for Bill, or anybody for
that matter, to step through the doorway.

WHEN...

The window her back is up against SHATTERS, and a black
gloved hand reaches inside and GRABS her by her hair, and
YANKS her out the window.



EXT. HOTEL WINDOW LEDGE - NIGHT

Bill on the ledge of the hotel window (the 26th floor),
outside L.F. O'Boyle's room.

He's yanked her outside and he's dangling her over the side
by her hair.



                    BILL
          Do you know a Jessica?

L.F. Is too hysterical to answer.



                    BILL
          Well, she knows you.

He drops her......

............... SHE FALLS....

...................................SHE SPLATS.

Bill watches her all the way down. When he's confident her
fall was fatal, he leaves the ledge.

                                            FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER - DAY

A small camper trailer sits all by its lonesome in the middle
of a barren Texas wasteland.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS under this image;

                           "The city of
                          Austin Texas."

A fist knocks on the trailer door.

It opens, revealing    Bill's    brother, BUDD. Not the Slick
Willie Budd with the    black    suit and the silver-tipped black
cowboy boots we saw    earlier    at the wedding chapel massacre.
No, the Budd we see    now is    the Budd who climbed into a bottle
five years ago, got    himself    comfortable, and decided to live
there.

Bill, looking like    a cool million, stands out in the dirt and
dust of Budd's lot    of land, looking up at his brother in his
natural habitat. In    the B.G. we can see Elle Driver lounging
in the passenger's    seat.

Budd, surprised by the visitor, says;



                    BUDD
          Great day in the morning. Brother
          Bill livin up to his familia
          obligation.



                    BILL
          How ya doin' Budd?



                    BUDD
          Oh, you know my life, Bill, just a
          mad rush of wild parties and
          wealthy women.

Budd squints into the sun at the woman in Bill's ear.



                    BUDD
          Is that that tall blonde one-eyed
          Viking bitch in the passenger seat?



                    BILL
          It's Elle. Want to say hello?



                    BUDD
          Never said "bye," can't seem to
          think of a reason to say, "hi."

INSERT: INT. - BILL'S CAR

Elle inside, blasting both the stereo and the air
conditioner. She watches the brotherly scene play out through
the car windshield. Obviously there's no love lost between
Elle and Budd.



                    BUDD
          What'd ya wanna talk about?



                    BILL
          Are you not going to invite me in?



                    BUDD
          No.



                    BILL
          May I ask why not?



                    BUDD
          It stinks in there, that's why. Now
          what's so important it requires a
          reunion?

                                                TIME CUT

The estranged brothers continue their conversation. Budd sits
in the doorway of his trailer, bottle of jack in his hand.
Bill stands.



                    BUDD
          You tryin to tell me she cut her
          way through eighty-eight bodyguards
          'fore she got to O-Ren?



                    BILL
          No. There wasn't really eighty
          eight of them, they just called
          themselves The Crazy 88.



                    BUDD
          Why.



                    BILL

          I dunno, I guess they thought it
          sounded cool. Anyhow, she had about
          26 or 27 around her when (BLEEP)
          attacked. They all fell under her
          Hanzo sword.

The mention of a Hattori Hanzo sword gets Budd's attention.



                    BUDD
          She got 'er a Hattori Hanzo sword?

Bill nods his head, "yes."



                    BILL
          She has a Hanzo Jingi sword.



                    BUDD
          He made her one? Didn't he swear a
          blood oath never to make another
          sword?



                    BILL
          It would appear he's broken it.

Budd doesn't say anything at first...THEN;



                    BUDD
          Them Japs know how to carry a
          grudge don't they? Or is it just
          you tend to bring that out in
          people?



                    BILL
              (pause)
          I know this is a ridiculous
          question before I ask, but you by
          any chance haven't kept up with
          your swordplay?



                    BUDD
          Hell, I pawned that years ago.



                    BILL
          You pawned a Hattori Hanzo sword?

                    BUDD
          Yep.

The disrespect is pain.



                    BILL
          It was priceless.



                    BUDD
          Not in El Paso it ain't. In El Pso
          I got me 250 Dollars for it.



                    BILL
          Since it was a gift from me, why
          didn't you offer me the chance to
          buy it back?



                    BUDD
          Because that would've required me
          to acknowledge your existence.
          Drunken bum though I may be, I
          don't need booze that bad. But who
          the hell gives a crap anyway. That
          bitch ain't gittin no Bushido
          points for killin a white trash
          piece of shit like me with a
          samurai sword. I'm a bouncer in a
          titty bar, Bill. If she wants to
          fight me, all she gotta do is come
          down to the Club, start some shit,
          and we'll be in a a fight.



                    BILL
          -- Budd, you need to listen to me.
          I know we haven't spoken for quite
          some time, and the last time we
          spoke wasn't the most pleasant. But
          you need to get over being mad at
          me, and start becoming afraid of
          Bea. Because she is coming, and
          she's coming to kill you. And
          unless you accept my assistance, I
          have no doubt she will succeed.

Budd sees Bill's true concern for his welfare.

Bill tries to charm his brother.

                       BILL
             Can't we forget the past, and look
             at the happy side of all this?

Budd chuckles.



                       BUDD
             And what would that happy side be?



                       BILL
             She's brought "the boys" back
             together.

Budd is touched by Bill's concern and chuckles to himself.



                       BUDD
             I appreciate the concern on your
             face, but there's a difference
             'tween "the boys", time can't
             erase. I don't dodge guilt. And I
             don't Jew outta payin my
             comeuppance. That woman deserves
             her revenge. And we deserve to die.
             But then again, so does she. So I
             guess we'll just see now, won't we.



EXT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - DAY

The    My-oh-my Club, is the sleazy titty bar that Budd works
at.    His job is tossin out the riff-raff that's worse than
him,    out on their ear - minus a few of the teeth they had
when    they came in. His beat-to-shit pickup truck pulls up to
the    front, and he climbs out of the automobile.



INT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - DAY

Budd walks into the wood-paneled titty bar. No strippin goin
on yet, just a few BARFLIES drinkin. The owner, TED, yells at
him as he walks by.



                       TED
             You're late, Budd, this shit ain't
             school, ya know.

Budd doesn't say anything, he just moves towards the back,

passing by a STRIPPER serving drinks.



                       STRIPPER
          Hey, Budd.



                    BUDD
          Hey, Lucky.

ANOTHER STRIPPER walks out of the ladies' room and says to
him;



                    STRIPPER
          Hey, Budd, honey, the toilet's at
          it again. There's shitty water all
          over the floor.



                    BUDD
          I'll take care of it, Suzie Pie.



EXT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - NIGHT

A brand new, enormous red pickup truck pulls into the parking
lot and stops.

The BRIDE
sits behind the wheel, looking at the bar and the bar's front
door. Using the rearview as a mirror, she grabs her long
blonde hair and pulls it back to a ponytail with a
rubberband. Then places a baseball cap on the top of her
noggin that reads, "STUBB'S BAR B-Q." She steps out of the
truck's cab. She's dressed like a little Texas two-stepper.
Levi's, cowboy boots, and a "HARLEY DAVIDSON: LOUD AND PROUD"
tee-shirt.



INT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - NIGHT

The Bride walks into the club just as the band on stage
explodes into honky tonk guitar. She walks up to the bar and
oders a;



                       THE BRIDE
          Shiner.

The BARTENDER gives her a beer bottle of Shiner Bock. As she
drinks the Texas brew...SHE....

...Watches the BAND....

...The crowd...

...Looking for Budd among the crowd...

...She sees him...

...He's the bouncer...

...She observes him...

...he's sitting on a stool, observing the crowd, moving his
head to the music...

SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM into her eyes; VENGEANCE THEME plays on
the soundtrack.

Her hand removes her sog from its sheath. She moves through
the crowd of Texas two-steppers, sog in hand, towards Budd
sitting oblivious on his stool....

WHEN...

Suddenly a BIG COWBOY stands up from his table -- spilling
every bottle and glass on it -- and BARFS all over.

Budd curses to himself, and heads over to the disaster area.

The Bride...observes Him...CLEAN UP THE PUKE.



EXT. TEXAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT

As the music from above continues, we see Budd driving his
pickup on an empty highway home from work.

He passes by The Bride's    new red pussy wagon parked on the
side of the road. After    he whizzes by, she starts up the
motor, but doesn't turn    the lights on. She follows him,
hanging way back in the    dark.

Budd driving, not seeing the automobile cloaked in darkness,
trailing him.



EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER HOME - NIGHT

Budd pulls his pickup truck in front of his small camper
home. He walks inside, shutting the door behind him.

The Bride rolls to a stop...Observing the lonely trailer out
of her windshield...

Texas tear-ass music begins coming out of the camper....We
see his figure pass the camper window, once or twice.

The Bride chooses her weapon -- Hattori Hanzo's samurai

sword.

She doesn't say anything, nor will an actress of Uma
Thurman's caliber indicate her feelings, but the astute
member of the audience will read the significance of her
choice. His current status be damned, the Budd who owes The
Bride satisfaction was a warrior. And it's that Budd she
intends to send to his maker.

She takes a black stocking cap, and slips it on top of her
skull, tucking her blonde hair underneath...

THEN...

...Rubs black make-up under both eyes, on top of both
eyelids, and down the bridge of her nose...

THEN...

Disconnects the cab lights above her, opens the truck door,
and slips out unseen into the Austin Texas night air.

THEN...

On her belly, Hattori Hanzo sword in sheath in hand, she
crawls across the desert floor towards Budd's trailer.

THEN...

Somewhere in the vast outdoors a cat jumps on a rat. Their
fight makes a LOUD racket.

The Bride stops and buries her face in the dirt.

From inside the trailer, we hear the needle being lifted off
the phonograph.

From a distance we see: The shadowy figure of Budd looking
out the window of the camper.

The Bride keeps her face in the dirt.

The figure of Budd at the window, seems to dismiss the sound
he heard for what it was -- a rat meeting its end at the
claws of a cat.

The curtain closes again.

The needle is placed back on the phonograph.

CU The BRIDE
face in the dirt...One Mississippi...Two Mississippi...her
eyes look up towards the trailer...All's clear...She begins
crawling towards the trailer again.

...She's now right outside the trailer home...We can hear the
sound of Budd sitting in a chair rocking back and forth.

She hears the sound of a screw top unscrewed...The sound of
pouring in a glass...The sound of a glass being laid heavy on

a table.

Crouched low on the balls of her feet, she, with great care,
slowly and silently unsheathes her Hanzo sword.

Through the bottom slit in the door, she sees the distorted
image of Budd's feet on the floor.

She slowly rises...removes her black stocking cap...blonde
hair falls around her shoulders...sword in right hand...left
hand grabs the front doorknob...

QUICK as a Texas lizard on glass -- She brings the sword's
handle down hard on the door lock --

EX CU Cheap Lock Busting.

She flings the front door open...

The BRIDE'S POV:
Brother Budd sitting calmly in a rocking chair, moving back
and forth to the Texas twang on his turntable, cradling a
DOUBLE-BARREL SHOTGUN aimed right at The Bride.

SERGIO LEONE CU:
The Bride Blinks.

Both barrels BLAST in our face.

The BRIDE
standing in the doorway is HIT SMACK DAB in the chest, and
PROPELLED THROUGH the AIR BACKWARDS.

Landing hard on her back in the dirt.

Budd casually rises from his rocking chair and lifts the
needle off the phonograph, cutting off the music.

Then with shotgun in hand, stands in the doorway of the
trailer looking down at The Bride.

BUDD'S POV:
The Bride laid out in the dirt below him -- Sword separated
from her grasp -- Bloody mess down her front -- Groan from
her throat.

Budd steps down from the trailer onto the dirt, standing over
The Bride.



                     BUDD
           Bet your sweet ass that don't sting
           like a bitch.

More groans coming out of The blood splattered Bride.



                     BUDD

          You done got a double dose of rock
          salt, right in the ole tit.
          Now not havin tits as fine or as
          big as yours, I can't even imagine
          how bad that shit stings...

He lowers down on his haunchers, over her.



                    BUDD
          ...But I don't wont to neather.

The Bride, hurting and incapacitated from the shotgun blast,
still nevertheless defiant, SPITS a gob of bloody saliva,
right in ole Budd's face.

Budd, gob of spit running down on his cheek and nose. The
cowboy removes a red bandana from his back pocket, and wipes
away the goo. Then his eyeballs go down to the spitter.



                    BUDD
          Now I know when it    comes to a rock
          salt burn, you're    feelin pretty
          much like a expert    bout now. But
          truth be told, you    ain't felt all
          rock salt's got to    offer till you
          took a double dose    in your
          backside.

With the help of his cowboy boot he rolls The Bride over onto
her stomach, exposing her butt.

SNAPPING the barrel closed, he takes aim and FIRES both
barrels -- EXECUTION STYLE -- right into her keister.

The Bride does the one thing she has yet to do with any
opponent during the movie up till now. Her head rears back
and she lets out a SCREAM!



                    BUDD
          That gentled ya down, didn't it?
          Yep...ain't nobody a badass with
          two barrels of rock salt dug deep
          in their backyard.

THEN...

Almost mercifully, the man once known as "Sidewinder," sticks
a syringe in her arm, dropping her unconscious.

THEN...

Knocking down a swig of Jack Daniels, he removes a small
silver cell phone from his pants pocket, raises the antenna,
and presses one button on the panel.

INT. ELLE DRIVER'S GYM - NIGHT

The six-foot tall, long-haired blonde with the codename
"California Mountain Snake," is doing a savage boxing workout
with her COACH.

This is one white bitch who can kick some serious FUCKIN ass.
With one mighty blow from her huge right arm (synched to the
sound of a CAR CRASH), her boxing Coach buys the farm.

Elle on cell phone. We cut Back and Forth.



                      ELLE
          Bill?



                    BUDD
          Wrong brother, you hateful bitch.



                      ELLE
          ....Budd?



                      BUDD
          Bingo.



                    ELLE
          And what do I owe this dubious
          pleasure?



                    BUDD
          I just caught me the cowgirl, ain't
          never been caught.

This gets Elle's attention.



                    ELLE
          Do you mean what I think you mean?



                    BUDD
          If you think I mean I got 'er, you
          thought right.

                    ELLE
          Did you kill her?



                    BUDD
          Not yet I ain't. But I can sure do
          it easy enough. She's so gentle
          right now, I could preform her coup
          de grace with a rock.



                    ELLE
          What are you waiting for, run outta
          liquid courage.



                    BUDD
          No. It's just...I ain't killed
          nobody in a long Goddamn time. And
          just 'tween you, me, and Jesus
          Christ, kinda made me a promise I
          wasn't gonna. Be that however it
          is. Back when I did kill people...I
          got paid for it. Just don't seem
          right...turn amateur this time of
          life.

We stay on Elle's side for the following exchange.



                    BUDD (O.S.)
          Anywho, guess what I'm holdin in my
          hand right now.

We cut back to Budd's side. And what he's holding is The
Bride's Hattori Hanzo sword.



                    BUDD
          A brand spankin new Hattori Hanzo
          sword. And I'm here to tell ya
          Elle, that's what I call sharp.



                      ELLE
          How much?



                    BUDD
          Oh, that's hard to say. Seein it's
          priceless and all.

          ELLE
I'll give you a hundred thousand
dollars for it.



          BUDD
I'm sure you would. But I'll take,
one million.



          ELLE
Jeez Budd, who'd ever guess you
were such a capitalist. I thought
drunks like yourself were beyond
such monetary concerns?



          BUDD
Well Elle, a million dollars buys a
whole lotta Jack.



          ELLE
Why then are you selling it to a
hateful bitch like me, when you
know Bill would pay more?



          BUDD
If I'm gonna drink myself to death,
...it won't be on Bill's dollar.
It's gonna be on yours.



          ELLE
What's the terms?



          BUDD
You buy a ticket to Texas, and I'll
see you here tomorrow mornin. You
give me a million in foldin cash,
I'll give you the greatest sword
ever made by a man. How's that
sound?



          ELLE
Sounds like we got a deal. One

          condition.



                       BUDD
          What?



                    ELLE
          You kill her tonight.
              (pause)
          And one more thing.



                    BUDD
          You said one condition.



                     ELLE
          It's a caveat to the same
          condition.



                       BUDD
          What?



                    ELLE
          She must suffer to her last breath.



                    BUDD
          That Elle darlin, I can pretty
          damwell guarantee.



                    ELLE
          Then I'll see you in the morning
          millionaire.

                                                 CUT TO:



OVERHEAD SHOT - EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

We look down on a spooky Texas graveyard...
Tombstones...Graves...Dirt...Low-hanging fog. This could be
the opening shot of a Texas zombie movie. We also see TWO MEN
WITH SHOVELS (one which is Budd, the other which is ERNIE)
digging up a grave. Budd's beat-to-shit pickup is in the shot
too. Its headlight beams shining on the two men. And last but
not least, The Bride, bound and gagged, lying in the flatbed

of Budd's pickup.

The BRIDE
She begins to come to from the shot in her arm.
Some dried blood lies caked around her wounds. Rope binds her
wrists tightly together in front of her.

A big leather cowboy belt is wrapped tight around her cherry
brown cowboy boots. Her eyelids flutter open...and she sees
stars. A giant, black Texas night sky full of them.

She has no idea where she is.

She turns her head to the left and sees,

Back window and Cab of truck.

She turns her head to the right and sees,

Hatch Gate to flatbed.

She listens...she hears,

Crickets...The sound of Two Men Digging...One of the Men says
something to the other in Spanish...

THEN...

She hears one of the Shovels HIT something buried...

The Two Men speak to each other in Unsubtitled Spanish...

THEN...

We hear them Lifting something heavy, we might assume is a
coffin. The Bride however knows not what to think.

BOOM...They set it down.

She hears boots approaching the flatbed, The crunching of
leaves leading in her direction...

TILL...

With a CLANG and a SCRAPE the latches on the Gate of the
flatbed are Yanked Out, and it lowers open with a CRASH.
Revealing Budd, looking down on her.



                    BUDD
          Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.

The grabs her by her collar, and yanks her out of the truck.

She FALLS to the dirt HARD.

Once in the dirt, The Bride sees an Old Coffin that's been
dup up.
Next to it is a brand new pine box coffin, straight out of

"Fistful of Dollars." And a freshly dug grave, with a pile of
dirt next to it, in front of an old tombstone that reads;
"PAULA SCHULTZ."

Budd and Ernie stand over her.

The Bride just GLARES up at the two tormentors, with the only
weapon she has left, the contempt in her stare.

Budd turns to Ernie and says in SPANISH, subtitled in
English;



                    BUDD (SPANISH)
          Look at those eyes. This bitch is
          furious. You grab her feet, I'll
          get her head.
              (ENGLISH)
          Got anything to say?

The Bride knows how these fiends derive satisfaction, and she
won't give it to them.



                    BUDD (SPANISH)
          In America white women call this
          the silent treatment.
              (laughing)
          And we let 'em think, we don't like
          it.

The two fiends laugh, then bend down to lift The Bride and
carry her over to the pine box. She struggles with her bound
legs and arms...Both men DROP her to the ground. Budd whips
out a can of mace from his pocket.



                    BUDD
          Hey hey hey, wiggle worm, look at
          this.

He holds the can of mace spray by her eyes. She stops. Her
eyes go to the nozzle of the spray can, then to Budd.



                    BUDD
          Looky here bitch, this is a can of
          mace. Now you're goin underground
          tonight, and that's all there is to
          it. But, when I bury ya, I was
          gonna bury you with this.

He removes a flashlight from behind his back and turns on the
beam.

                       BUDD
          But if    you're gonna act like    a
          horse's    ass, I'll spray this    whole
          Goddamn    can in your eyeballs.     Then
          you'll    be blind, burnin, and    buried
          alive.    So what's it gonna be
          sister?

Her eyes move to the right, indicating the flashlight.



                    BUDD
          You may be stupid, but at least you
          ain't bloody stupid.

The two men lift up The Bride, and carry her over to the pine
box and place her in.

Budd puts the flashlight inside.

He picks up the pine lid, and is just about to place it over
the coffin...

WHEN...

...He locks eyeballs with The Bride...

...her eyes hold his for as long as she can,

THEN...

...he places the lid over her face, closing the coffin.

THEN...

...with a hammer and nails the two men seal the coffin shut.



INT. PINE BOX

Dark, excerpt for the cracks of light seeping through between
the lid and the box. However with each nail pounded in, more
lights is cut off...

TILL...

...the only light left, is the crack by The Bride's head. The
last hammered nail obliterates that light source.

The Bride lies in TOTAL DARKNESS.



EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

The two men lift the pine box, and set it in the grave.

Budd scoops up a shovel full of dirt...



INT. PINE BOX

EX CU HER FINGERS turn on the flashlight.

CU The BRIDE
LIT by the flashlight beam...

BAM...

...a shovel of dirt has just landed hard on the lid, making
The Bride jump...

BAM...

...More dirt. She reacts again.

BAM...

The dirt just keeps falling, the bams becoming softer with
each new shovelful.

The Bride is starting to perspire...her breathing becoming
more rapid and panicked...her heartbeat begins to echo inside
the pine box.

We've never seen her like this before.

She's starting to lose it...She lets out a SCREAM...She
SCREAMS again...Her bound-at-the-wrist hands move to the
lid...She pounds on it...Her bound feet kick up at it...She
starts to cry...She's getting hysterical...Her fingers begin
clawing at the wood lid...

TILL...

They're ripped open and bleeding...

Leaving Blood Trails on the wood.

TILL...

She exhausts herself. All this while, she's been screaming
the words we can't even imagine coming out of her mouth;



                        THE BRIDE
             Help me.

The Bride halts her hysteria.

She wipes    her eyes, and runs her hands down her face,
mentally    sending the little girl she became, back to wherever
she came    from. The woman we know as The Bride is back. She
talks to    herself.

                     THE BRIDE
          Well, now that you've had a nice,
          good cry, let's figure out how to
          get out of here? You're breathing
          like you just been fuckin. Calm
          down...close your mouth, and start
          breathing short breaths, through
          your nose.

She does. The Bride continues in VO;



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's a lot better. But you're
          still too agitated. Can you hear
          your heart? It's like I'm buried
          alive with Buddy Rich. Turn off
          that flashlight.

Fear comes into her voice as she combats herself.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          No! I can't turn off the light. Yes
          you can. The darkness will have a
          calming effect. Now turn off that
          fucking light.

She does. The screen goes Jet Black



EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

Budd and Ernie are finished filling the grave. The old
coffin, with the body of Paula Schultz, in the back of the
flatbed. Before they climb into the truck and drive away,
Budd lays a dozen red roses on The Bride's grave.



INT. BUDD'S TRAILER (MOVING) - NIGHT

Budd behind the wheel. Ernie in the passenger's seat. Car
radio playing Mexican music. Budd's silver cell phone rings.



                    BUDD
              (into phone)
          Yellow?



INT. AIRPLANE (FLYING) - NIGHT

Elle Driver sits in a seat on a passenger jet enroute to the
great state of Texas. She calls Budd on the airplane phone.



                       ELLE
             Didja do it?



                       BUDD
             Elle darlin, she's sufferin as we
             speak.

A smile spreads across Elle's face. She rests her head back
against the seat's headrest. Her eyelids close. She slightly
parts her lips...and lets out a;

                        "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"

This is the face of satisfaction.

                                             FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - CHINA - DAY

We see a beautiful mountain range in the middle of China.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS UNDERNEATH:


                "SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF CHINA"

A VOICE OVER SPOKEN BY BILL, tells us a story over this
landscape;



                       BILL (V.O.)
             Once upon a time in China, some
             believe around the year, one-double
             knot-three.

As Bill tells this story, it will be illustrated On Screen by
footage from Old Shaw Brothers Martial arts flicks of the
70's. Especially Films that feature Chinese Actor LO LIEH as
the old, white-haired, white-eyebrowed Villian "PAI MEI."

                     BILL (V.O.; CONT'D)
          ...head priest of The White Lotus
          Clan, Pai Mei, was walking down the
          road, contemplating whatever a man
          with Pai Mei's infinite power would
          contemplate -- Which is another way
          of saying, who knows. When, a
          Shaolin monk appeared on the road
          traveling in the opposite
          direction. As the monk and the
          priest crossed paths...Pai Mei --
          in a practically unfathomable
          display of generosity, gave the
          monk the slightest of nods. The
          nod, was not returned. Was it the
          intention of the Shaolin monk to
          insult Pai Mei? Or, did he just
          fail to see the generous social
          gesture?
          The motives of the monk, remain,
          unknown. What is known, were the
          consequences. The next morning Pai
          Mei appeared at the Shaolin Temple,
          and demanded that the temple's head
          Abbot offer Pai Mei his neck, to
          repay the insult. The Abbot, at
          first, tried to console Pai Mei,
          only to find, Pai Mei was
          inconsolable. So began, the
          massacre of the Shaolin Temple, and
          all sixty of the monks inside, at
          the fists of the White Lotus. And
          so began, the legend of Pai Mei's
          Ten-Point Palm - Exploding Heart
          Technique.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          What praytell, is a ten-point palm -
          exploding heart technique?



                    BILL (V.O.)
          Quite simply, the deadliest blow in
          all of the martial arts. He hits
          you with his fingertips, at ten
          different pressure points on your
          body. And then, he lets you walk
          away. But once you've taken five
          steps, your heart explodes inside
          your body, and you fall to the
          floor dead.

We see on screen Pai Mei demonstrate this technique on five
shaolin monks. Who after being hit...take five steps...then

fall to the floor dead.



EXT. JEEP (MOVING) - DAY

Bill and The Bride, years earlier, driving in a jeep through
the mountains of China, enroute to PAI MEI's.



                    THE BRIDE
          Did he teach you that?



                    BILL
          No. He teaches no one the ten-point
          palm - exploding heart technique.
          But he is Nietzsche's psalm
          personified. If Pai Mei doesn't
          kill you, he will make you
          stronger. Now one of the things I
          always liked about you, Kiddo, is
          you appear wise beyond your years.
          Then allow me to impart, a word to
          the wise. Whatever - WHAT - EVER -
          Pai Mei says, Obey. If you flash
          him - even for an instant - a
          defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.
          And if you throw any American sass
          his way, he will snap your back and
          your neck like they were twigs, and
          that will be the story of you.



EXT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY

The Bride sits in the jeep, by herself, parked in front of
the Priest Pai Mei's home located high up on top of White
Lotus Mountain.

For over 100 years, his home used to be the temple of the
White Lotus Clan, and he was the temple's head priest. The
temple served as a home to over 60 priests and disciples. But
now - the year 1990 - the White Lotus Clan is no more. All
the priests have died. All that remains, is a very old man,
who once upon a time, some worshipped as a god and some
feared as a devil...neither was wrong.

A huge stone staircase of one hundred steps climb up a hill
leading to Pei Mei's home. Bill climbs down to the jeep.



                    BILL
          He'll accept you as his student.

                    THE BRIDE
          Caught him in a good mood, aye?



                    BILL
          More like a sadistic one.

She climbs out, and gets her bag out of the back.

Bill casts a glance at the stone steps he just decended.



                    BILL
          Just seeing those steps again makes
          me ache. You're gonna have plenty
          of fun carrying buckets of water up
          and down that fucker.



                    THE BRIDE
          Why did he accept me?



                    BILL
          Because he's a very very very old
          man. And like all rotten bastards,
          when they get old, they become
          lonely. Not that that has any
          effect on their disposition. But
          they do learn the value of company.



                    THE BRIDE
          When will I see you again?



                    BILL
          That's the title of my favorite
          soul song of the Seventies.



                    THE BRIDE
          What?



                    BILL
          Nothing. When he tells me you're
          done.

                    THE BRIDE
          When do you think that might be?



                    BILL
          That my dearest, all depends on
          you. Now remember, no backtalk, no
          sarcasm.
          Least not for the first year.
          You're going to have to let him
          warm up for you. He hates
          Caucasians, despises Americans, and
          has nothing but contempt for women,
          so in your case, that may take a
          little while. Adios.

ZOOM...

The jeep speeds off down the road...leaving the Bride all
alone, somewhere in the middle of China.

She begins the journey before her by ascending the 100 steps
to Pai Mei.



INT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE

The huge temple is exactly like it must have been a hundred
years ago, except now it's empty and dusty.

The Bride enters, She's winded from climbing up those fuckin
steps.



                    THE BRIDE
              (yelling)
          Hello!

Her Voice ECHOES in the cavernous temple.

PAI MEI's VOICE ECHOES back;



                    PAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Up the stairs, yankee woman!

A beautiful (but dusty) Mahagony staircase leads to Pai Mei's
private chamber.



                    THE BRIDE
              (to herself)
          More stairs, Jesus Christ.

The still unseen Man's voice BOOMS back;

                    PAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.)
          If it is Christ you seek, turn back
          now.

She climbs the wooden staircase.



INT. PAI MEI'S PRIVATE CHAMBER

PAI MEI'S POV: We see through Pei Mei's pupils, through a
sheer scarlet scrim that hangs down in front of his sitting
area. The Bride enters the room.

She approaches the old man, reaches the edge of his sitting
area in front of the scrim, lowers to one knee and bows her
head.

* From here on end, whenever ENGLISH is spoken     by The Bride,
or every once in awhile by Pai Mei, it will be     spoken in
ENGLISH IN LIVE SYNCH SOUND. However, whenever     MANDARIN is
supposedly spoken, it comes out of their mouths     as DUBBED
ENGLISH like in a 70's Shaw Brothers Chop Socky     Flick.



                     THE BRIDE *
          Teacher, I am unworthy to be your
          student --

Pai Mei is still unseen.



                    PAI MEI'S VOICE *
          Your Mandarin is lousy. I can't
          understand a single word you say.
          It causes my ears discomfort. You
          are not to speak unless spoken to.
          Do you understand Mandarin any
          better than you speak it?



                    THE BRIDE *
          I speak Japanese very well --



                    PAI    MEI'S VOICE *
          I didn't ask    if you speak Japanese,
          or Mongolian,    for that matter. I
          asked if you    understand Mandarin?



                    THE BRIDE *

          A little, I am still learning.



                    PAI MEI'S VOICE *
          You are here to learn the mysteries
          of Kung Fu, not linguistics. If you
          can't understand me, I will
          communicate with you like I would a
          dog. When I yell, when I point,
          When I beat you with my stick!

Her head remains bowed, eyes to the floor.

WE CUT TO PAI MEI
He's just like he was in the films earlier. Long White Hair,
Long White Beard, Long White Eyebrowes, same long flowing
White Robe. Everything's the same, except he's older, by
about a hundred years. He sits stone still in his sitting
area on the other side of the sheer scarlet scrim.



                    PAI MEI *
          Bill is your master, is he not?



                    THE BRIDE *
          Yes, he is.



                    PAI MEI *
          Your master tells me you're not
          entirely unschooled. What training
          do you possess?



                    THE BRIDE *
          I am proficient in a combination of
          Tiger and Crane style. And I am
          more than proficient in the
          exquisite art of the Samurai Sword.



                    PAI MEI *
              (he makes a SNORTING
               SOUND)
          The exquisite art of the samurai
          sword. Don't make me laugh. Your so
          called exquisite art, is only fit
          for Japanese fat heads. You really
          are a silly ass.

This brings up The Bride's eye...She GLARES at the old man.

                     PAI MEI *
           Impudent dog! You dare glare at me!

She lowers her eyes.



                     THE BRIDE *
           I'm sorry master --



                     PAI MEI *
           -- Silence! I do not wish to hear
           your unintelligible excuses.

Pause...

THEN...

Pai Mei softly LAUGHS to himself, and strokes his long white
beard...



                     PAI MEI *
           Your anger amuses me. Do you
           believe you are my match?



                       THE BRIDE *
           No.



                     PAI MEI *
           Are you aware I kill at will?



                       THE BRIDE *
           Yes.



                     PAI MEI *
           Is it your wish to die?



                       THE BRIDE *
           No.



                     PAI MEI *
           Then you must be stupid. Rise
           stupid, and let me get a better

             look at your ridiculous face.

She rises.

CU The BRIDE
through the scrim, eyes down.

Pai Mei laughs to himself again;



                       PAI MEI *
             You breathe hard. The one hundred
             steps robbed you of your wind. So
             your stupidity is matched only by
             your weakness. Is there anything
             you do well? -- Oh yes, you speak
             Japanese. I despise the Goddamn
             Japs. I would of thought an
             American would be immune to their
             pompous posturing. Apparently I was
             wrong. Go to that drawer.

The blonde woman goes to a large wooden drawer. She opens the
drawer; it's filled with just about every type of edged
weapon.



                       PAI MEI *
             Remove the sword.

The Bride removes a large heavy steel Chinese Sword.

Pai Mei rises from his sitting position, for the first time,
parts the scrim, and approaches the Bride.



                       PAI    MEI *
             Let's see how    good you really are.
             Try and land    a blow. If you land a
             single blow,    I'll bow down and call
             you master.

The Bride doesn't need a second invitation, she ATTACKS with
the sword.

He deftly moves out of the way.

The fighting style is now like an old Shaw Brothers film,
with Pai Mei dodging at will all of her rapid sword slashes.

Quick and skillful as her moves are, they're also full of
Effort and Frustration. While Pai Mei effortlessly moves out
of the sword's path.

He's amused, and Speaks while they fight;

                    PAI MEI *
          Come now woman, can't you even hit
          an old man?

She tries more...



                    PAI MEI *
          Your ability really is quite poor.

He STRIKES her with a blow to her chest, delivered with an
open palm, that sends her flying back hard against the wall.
She clutches her chest, and coughs up some blood.

Pai Mei laughs as he strokes his long white beard.



                    PAI MEI *
          Ha ha ha ha ha! I've fought
          cripples who posed more of a
          challenge. Now fight, goddamn you!

She ATTACKS with a wild cat's fury.

He HOPS and DUCKS and DODGES her sword easily.

He LEAPS HIGH UP IN THE AIR, and LANDS STANDING on the Blade
of her Sword.

The Bride looks down the blade of her sword and can't believe
it.

Pai Mei smiles at her and says;



                    PAI MEI *
          From here you can get an excellent
          view of my foot.

He does a BACKFLIP off the sword, kicking the Bride in the
face in mid-somersault sending her CRASHING THROUGH A WOOD
WALL.

The Bride emerges from the hole in the wall.

Pai Mei stands waiting for her, TWIRLING THE SWORD in his
hand like a cheerleader twirling a baton, till the twirling
STOPS. The sword's handle is pointed towards the Bride.



                    PAI MEI *
          Give up? Or care to try again?

The BRIDE'S FACE
shows determination. Not to win, not even to land a blow,

that she knows is impossible. This man's ability is truly
amazing. However be that as it may, she's determined not to
quit, and through not quitting, she's determined to
distinguish herself in his eyes...in some way.

She takes the sword from him and tries again.

But this time, Pai Mei keeps grabbing her arm that holds the
sword, manipulating it into positions that would do the young
girl harm...Like bringing the blade up against her other
arm...Poised to cut it Off.



                    PAI MEI *
          That blade's sharp. Careful not to
          cut off your own arm.

...Then he TWISTS her arm, till the blade's against her own
throat....

...Then TWISTS again till it's against her hip...

...Then TWISTS again while KICKING her leg, till the blade's
edge is against her thigh...



                    PAI MEI *
          If you can't fight any better than
          that, what use do you have for a
          leg?

He lets go of her arms, she swings furiously at him...

...he calmly SPINS out of the way. Then, he KICKS her in the
stomach, doubling her over, then he brings the Sword between
her legs, Blade Edge against her Crotch.



                    PAI MEI *
          Now that really would be a shame.

He takes the sword from her grasp...

SWINGS once...

The BLADES's against her jugular.

He SWINGS twice...

The BLADE's against the pocket of her throat.

He SWINGS a third time...

The BLADE's against the nipple of her right breast.

                    PAI MEI *
          Your swordsmanship is amateur at
          best.

He tosses the sword in the air, catching it by the tip of the
blade. Then like a mallet, brings the handle end down hard on
the top of The Bride's head. She lets out a howl, and falls
to the floor, holding the lump on her noggin.



                    PAI MEI *
          I'm a hundred and fifty years old,
          and you can't even make me break a
          sweat.

He CHOPS the sword in half with his hand.



                    PAI MEI *
          Let's see your Tiger and Crane
          style match my Eagles's Claw.

Again she ATTACKS...again he eludes.

Like a Gordon Liu and Lo Lieh film, they do their animal
style martial arts dance.

As she STRIKES and he BLOCKS...he yells out;



                    PAI MEI *
          ...pathetic.....terrible...you
          idiot, you should've landed that
          blow...you call that crane?...
          Enough, I grow bored.

With little effort on his part, he reaches out and GRABS her
wrist, TWISTS...She's on the floor, with her arm stuck out in
the air behind her, her wrist still between his fingers. He
could literally break her arm in half.



                    PAI MEI *
          I asked you to show me what you
          know, and you did. Not a goddamn
          thing.

He TWISTS her wrist...

...The pain is excruciating.....



                    PAI MEI *
          Like all yankee women, the only
          thing you know how to do is order

          in restaurants and spend a man's
          money.

He TWISTS more...

She CRIES OUT.



                    PAI MEI *
          Excruciating isn't it? I asked you
          a question!

Through gritted teeth, she answers;



                     THE BRIDE *
          Yes!



                    PAI MEI *
          I could chop off your arm at will.
          I think I shall.

He raises his other hand to chop off her arm.

The Bride SCREAMS in ENGLISH;



                    THE BRIDE
          No please don't!



                    PAI MEI *
          If you wish to speak romantic
          languages, you've come to the wrong
          place.



                    THE BRIDE *
          Please don't cut my arm off!



                    PAI MEI *
          It's my arm now. I can do with it
          what I please. If you can stop me,
          I suggest you try.



                     THE BRIDE *
          I can't!

                    PAI MEI *
          Because you're helpless?



                    THE BRIDE *
          Yes!



                    PAI MEI *
          Have you ever felt this before?



                    THE BRIDE *
          No!



                    PAI MEI *
          Compared to me you're as helpless
          as a worm fighting an eagle, aren't
          you?



                    THE BRIDE *
          Yes!!!



                    PAI MEI *
          THAT'S THE BEGGING!

He lets go of her wrist. She cradles her still-throbbing arm.



                    PAI MEI *
          Is it your wish to learn how to
          make others as helpless as you
          were?



                    THE BRIDE *
          Yes.



                    PAI MEI *
          Can you cook?



                    THE BRIDE *
          Yes.

                    PAI MEI *
          I'll be the judge of    that.
              (pause)
          Draw me a bath...your    training will
          begin tomorrow. That    arm is still
          mine. You may lose it    yet.

                                                   TIME CUT



EXT. WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY

Pai Mei stands in front of a wood wall three inches in front
of him. His right fist is cocked back by his breastplate,
he's concentrating on a certain spot on the wall.

The Bride stands behind him, watching.

He lets out a SCREAM, and puts his fist THROUGH THE WALL.

He turns to the new student;



                    PAI MEI *
          Since your arm now belongs to me, I
          want it strong. Can you do that?



                    THE BRIDE *
          I can, but not that close.



                    PAI MEI *
          Then you can't do it.



                    THE BRIDE *
          I can put my hand through that at
          six inches.



                    PAI MEI *
          And you could shoot a man from a
          rooftop with a scope-sight rifle,
          if you so desired, but this is not
          what I asked. What if your enemy is
          three inches in front of you, what
          do you do then? Curl into a ball?
          Or do you put your fist through
          him.

He HITS the wall again leaving another hole.

                         PAI MEI *
            Now begin.

The Bride takes her place in front of the wall. She HITS it.
Only managing to stain the wall with the blood from her
scraped knuckles. Then again. And again....



INT. DINNER TABLE - NIGHT

Both Pai Mei    and The Bride sit at the dinner table. Pai Mei
concentrates    on eating. The Bride's hand is scraped bloody.
She tries to    eat a bowl of rice with chopsticks, but her
fingers won't    work. She puts down the sticks and takes a
scoop of rice    with her fingers.

Pai Mei WHACKS her on top of her head with his stick.



                      PAI MEI *
            If you want to eat like a dog, I
            will make you live and sleep like a
            dog. Outside. If you want to live
            and sleep like a human being, pick
            up those sticks.

She does.



THE WOOD WALL

The Bride HITTING it.

She looks at her fucked-up hand, then to the wall,
hesitating....Then Pai Mei's behind her.



                      PAI MEI *
            It's the wood that       should fear your
            hand, not the other       way around. No
            wonder you can't do       it, you
            acquiesce to defeat       before you even
            begin.

He walks off in a huff.



EXT. PIT - DAY

Pai Mei and The Bride stand at the edge of a large, round
deep pit, dug in the earth (by the Bride).

                    PAI MEI *
          In that pit, is a rat.

We see one lone rat in the huge pit.



                    PAI MEI *
          In the sky, is a bird.

Pai Mei brings a golden bow and arrow into Frame, and SHOOTS
up in the sky.

A BIRD FALLS to the earth with a golden arrow stuck through
it.



                    PAI MEI *
          You are to go into that pit, and
          catch that rat, with your bare
          hands. If you catch the rat, I will
          deem you the victor, and tonight
          you will dine on bird. But, if you
          can't catch the rat by sundown,
          I'll deem the victor the rat. And
          because of the disgrace to my
          student, I will be forced to kill
          it. And then I will force you, to
          consume his body. Because to be my
          student, you must develop a taste
          for victory.

She hops into the pit, gets down on the ground, lock eyes
with her rodent opponent, and goes after it.

The BRIDE
Practicing her Tiger/Crane combo Kung Fu.

MORE wall....

At NIGHT punching the wall in front of her in her sleep.

Trying to catch the rat to no avail.

WHEN...

A golden arrow kills the rat.

She looks up and sees Pai Mei, golden bow in his hand,
looking down on her. It's sundown.

She stands, dusting herself off (she's dirty from the chase)
and looks at her teacher.

She picks her dead foe up from the earth, and removes the
golden arrow. Then with the rat in her hand, she looks up to
her teacher.

                     THE BRIDE *
          I acknowledge defeat at the paws of
          this rat. However, I will not eat
          this filthy vermin. What I will
          do...
              (she RIPS the rat open
                like a pomegranate)
          ...is consume his victorious heart.
              (she snatches the tiny
                heart from the rodent's
                carcass. Holding it
                between her fingers.)
          But tomorrow, you kill a big bird.

She POPS the tiny rat heart in her mouth, and begins to chew.

Pai Mei looking down on her, says;



                    PAI MEI *
          How does victory taste?



                       THE BRIDE *
          Bitter.

We do a Shaw Brothers ZOOM into a CU on Pai Mei, he gives an
affirmative NOD and GRUNT.

The BRIDE'S FIST
goes through the wall.



                       THE BRIDE
                 (to herself)
          Wow!



INT. PAI MEI'S PRIVATE BATHROOM - DAY

Pai Mei splashing by himself in his huge bathtub, when he
hears a noise.



                    PAI MEI *
          Woman, is that you who disturbs my
          meditation?

She answers from outside the door;

                      THE BRIDE'S VOICE (O.S.)
            Yes, teacher.



                      PAI MEI *
            Enter.

She does, bowing to one knee.



                      PAI MEI *
            What news do you find so worthy, as
            to disrupt my bath?



                      THE BRIDE *
            I did it teacher. I put my fist
            through the wall.

                                                  TIME CUT

PAI MEI and the BRIDE
looking at the hole in the wall.



                      PAI MEI *
            Very good. Would you care to
            demonstrate?

She moves in front of the wall.....Takes her position...Her
right hand in a fist -- Locked and loaded into position....
With Her left hand she reaches out and touches the wall where
she'll strike....Like she's transferring her energy into the
wood...She removes her left hand...and...STRIKES!

She hits it HARD, but her fist doesn't go through.

Her eyes sneak a look at the old man, who wears no
expression.



                      THE BRIDE *
            I think you watching is making me
            nervous.



                      PAI MEI *
            Not only that, it has you speaking
            before you were spoken to. Try
            again.

She does.

And when she does, she DOES it.

CU PAI MEI
he says in ENGLISH;



                    PAI MEI
          Impressive.

She immediately goes down to her knees;



                    THE BRIDE *
          Thank you teacher --

He just as immediately, lifts her back up.



                    PAI MEI *
          You still fight better than you
          speak. Finally, a woman who
          understands what's important.

THEN...

He MOVES the wall one inch in front of her.



                    PAI MEI *
          Begin again.

Then the old man leaves to finish his bath.

The blonde gal begins again....Fist against wood...no
effect....starting all over.

                                                 CUT TO:



BACK TO COFFIN, SIX FEET UNDER

PITCH BLACK -- The Flashlight Beam turns on. CU The BRIDE in
Profile. Her breathing is normal. We can hear the soft beat
of her heart inside the pine box. Her composure is back.

Taking the flashlight, she Shines the beam on the lid above
her....Along the line of the coffin's rim and the lid where
many nails meet....Then down to her Red Cowboy Boots, bound
by a leather belt around her.

Raising her knees, as much as the coffin will allow, and
wiggling her feet, she slips her bare feet our of the boots
and the belt's binding...Then, using her bare feet, then her
bound-at-the-wrist hands, to pass one of the boots up to
her...When the red boot is in her grasp, she turns it upside
down....The STRAIGHT RAZOR falls out.

Opening the razor, she slices through the ropes that tie her
wrists, till both hands are free.

She positions the flashlight so its Beam Shines on the coffin
lid. The lid's about an inch and a half from the tip of her
nose, about three inches from her hand.

THEN...

AS COMBAT DRUMS BEGIN TO BEAT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, she begins
to concentrate. Her eyes focus on the wood above her, her
left hand reaches out, touches the pine, passing her energy
to it...

...Her long, white fingers, ball up into a FIST....

...and that FIST begins STRIKING the coffin lid above her.

With each Strike she lets out a KARATE SCREAM...

AGAIN...

And AGAIN...

Her FIST SMASHES into the wood, leaving BLOOD on the lid...

AGAIN...

And AGAIN...

A crack in the lid...

AGAIN...

Dirt begins to sift through the cracks onto the Bride...

AGAIN...

More dirt...

AGAIN...

Even more dirt...

AGAIN...

THE LID SMASHES and dirt pours into the coffin like water...

THEN...

Through six feet of dirt, we watch, the Bride - DIG - CLIMB -
SWIM - SPROUT - BURROW - trough the earth like a sprouting
plant and a burrowing mole combined, clawing for surface air.



EXT. PAULA SCHULTZ'S GRAVE - NIGHT

A SHOT straight out of an Italian horror film. We see the

tombstone of "PAULA SCHULTZ," and the mound of dirt over her
grave.

WHEN...

The Bride's hand breaks the surface...then like one of
Fulci's Zombies, Claws, Digs, and Pulls herself from mother
earth's womb.

Once extracted from her (almost) final resting place, she
rolls over on her back, exhausted. She drinks in the night's
air as if it were gulps of water.

DIRT is in, on, and under every crack, crevice, and wrinkle
on her body.

SHE looks like a beautiful sculpture, made out of dirt.



INT. DINER - NIGHT

A Texas diner across the street from the graveyard. A YOUNG
SODA JERK stands behind the counter, waiting for a customer,
when he sees something approaching through the restaurant's
big picture window that makes him look twice.

SODA JERK'S POV:
Through the picture window, we see the Bride, emerge from the
Texas night, and walk towards the diner looking for all the
world like a six-foot tall female version of the Peanuts
character "PIG PEN." With each of her footfalls, a smaller
mushroom cloud of dust comes off her.

The dirty blonde, walks into the diner, sits on a stool at
the counter directly across from the Soda Jerk, and says;



                    THE BRIDE
          I'd like a glass of water.

                                          FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. DESERT BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

The car stops in front of Budd's camper. She shuts off the
car and the radio.

The camper door opens, Budd squints outside through the
bright gold, hot desert morning, at the Tall Blonde Girl with
one Good Eye.



                    BUDD
          Want some breakfast?



INT. BUDD'S CAMPER'S KITCHEN - DAY

Budd and Elle in the tiny kitchen of Budd's tiny camper. Elle
sits a the kitchen table, a black suitcase by her feet. Budd
stands at a blender making them both breakfast margaritas, as
he finishes telling the tale of last night.



                    ELLE
          ...So that's called a Texas
          funeral?



                    BUDD
          Yep.



                    ELLE
          I got to give it to ya Budd, that's
          a pretty fucked up way to die.
          What's the name on the grave she's
          buried under?



                    BUDD
          Paula Schultz.

Budd turns on the NOISY blender, as Elle writes down the    name
Paula Schultz on a small notepad, placing it back inside    her
pocket. As the blender MASHES ICE, Elle looks around and    sees
the Bride's Hanzo sword in its sheath, leaning up against    the
T.V. In the front room. Budd shuts the blender off.



                    ELLE

          Can I look at the sword?



                    BUDD
          That's my money in that black case,
          isn't it?



                     ELLE
          Sure is.



                    BUDD
          Well then, it's your sword now.

The tall blonde girl steps into the living room, takes the
Hanzo sword, and sits back down on the kitchen chair.

She slowly removes the Japanese steel from its wood sheath.



                    ELLE
          So this, is a Hattori Hanzo sword.

Budd answers as he fills up two former peanut butter jars
with breakfast margaritas.



                    BUDD
          That's a Hanzo sword alright.



                    ELLE
          Bill tells me you once had one of
          your own.

Pause.



                     BUDD
          Once.



                    ELLE
          How does this one compare to that
          one?



                    BUDD
          If you're gonna compare a Hanzo
          sword, you compare it to every

          sword ever made -- wasn't made by
          Hattori Hanzo. Here, wrap your lips
          around this.

He hands her her margarita, she takes a sip. He takes a gulp.



                    BUDD
          So, which "R" you filled with?



                    ELLE
          What?



                    BUDD
          They say the number one killer of
          old people is retirement. People
          got'em a job to do, they tend to
          live a little longer so they can do
          it. I've always figured warriors
          and their enemies share the same
          relationship. So now you ain't
          gonna hafta face your enemy on the
          battlefield no more, which "R" are
          you filled with, Relief or Regret?



                    ELLE
          A little bit of both.



                     BUDD
          Bullshit. I'm sure you do feel a
          little bit of both. But I know damn
          well you feel one more than you
          feel the other. The question was
          which one?

Elle looks right at him with her eye, and says;



                    ELLE
          Regret.



                    BUDD
          Yeah you gotta hand it to the ol'
          girl. I never saw nobody buffalo
          Bill the way she buffaloed Bill.
          Bill useta think she was so damn
          smart. I tried to tell him... Bill,
          she's just smart for a blonde.

He looks over at Elle and grins.

Elle looks at him.



                    ELLE
          Want your money?

She gestures to the black suitcase by her feet.

He smiles and lifts it up on the table, unzipping it open.

Lying inside is a cool million, the thousand dollar bills are
inside stacks of a hundred thousand each. At the sight of all
this lettuce, Budd lets out a whistle.



                    BUDD
          Great day in the morning.

He lifts a stack out of the bag, then another, then
another...and when he lifts the third stack out, he looks
down and sees a BLACK MAMBA SNAKE coiled underneath.

The Black Mamba opens its WIDE JAWS...and LEAPS RIGHT AT
BUDD...

...STRIKING Budd in the face repeatedly in blurred succession
(three times in the face, and once in the forearm).

Budd topples out of the kitchen chair onto the floor, bundles
of money fall with him.

Elle takes a sip of her Margarita.

The Black Mamba leaves Budd and goes under the refridgerator.

Elle looks down, Budd    lies on his back on the kitchen floor
at her feet. His face    is already grotesquely swollen and
white as a sheet. The    serpent's extraordinarily potent venom
makes a full-frontal    assault on the cowboys's nervous system.



                    ELLE
          Oh, I'm sorry Budd, that was rude
          of me wasn't it? Budd -- I'd like
          to introduce my friend, The Black
          Mamba.
              (gesturing towards the
               refridgerator)
          Black Mamba -- this is Budd. You
          know before I picked up that little
          fella, I looked him up on the
          internet.
              (she removes her notepad
               from her pocket)

          Fascinating creature the Black
          Mamba. Listen to this,
              (reading from the notepad)
          "...In Africa, the saying goes, in
          the bush, an elephant can kill you.
          A leopard can kill you. And a Black
          Mamba can kill you. But only with
          the Mamba, and this has been true
          in Africa since the dawn of time,
          is death sure. Hence its handle;
          Death Incarnate."
              (looking up from the
               paper)
          Pretty cool, huh?
              (back to paper)
          "...Its neurotoxic venom is one of
          nature's most effective poisons,
          acting on the nervous system
          causing paralysis. The venom of a
          Black Mamba can kill a human in
          four hours, if say bitten on the
          ankle or the thumb. However, a bite
          to the face or torso can bring
          death from paralysis within twenty
          minutes.
              (up from paper to Budd)
          Now you should listen to this cause
          this concerns you.
              (reading from the paper)
          The amount of venom that can be
          delivered from a single bit can be
          gargantuan.
              (looks up from paper)
          -- You know I've always liked that
          word Gargantuan, and I so rarely
          have an opportunity to use it in a
          sentence.
              (back to paper)
          "If not treated quickly with anti
          venom, 10 to 15 milligrams can be
          fatal to human beings. However, the
          Black Mamba can deliver as much as
          100 to 400 milligrams of venom from
          a single bite."

Elle finishes reading and puts the paper away. She looks down
at Budd at her feet, going through all the symptoms she just
described.



                    ELLE
          Now in these last agonizing minutes
          of life you have left, let me
          answer the question you asked
          earlier, more thoroughly. When it
          comes to that bitch, I gotta lotta
          "R's" in me. Revenge is one.
          Retribution is another. Rivalry is
          definitely one. But I got another

          "R" for that bitch you might be
          surprised to find out. Respect. But
          right at this moment, the biggest
          "R" I feel, is Regret. Regret that
          maybe the greatest warrior I have
          ever met, met her end at the hands
          of a bushwhackin, scrub, alacky
          piece of shit like you. The woman
          deserved better.

Budd, dying, watches from the floor as Elle takes out her
cell phone and presses one button. The other party comes on
the line, but we never hear their side.



                    ELLE
              (into phone)
          Bill...Elle. I have some tragic
          news.
              (pause)
          Your brother's dead.
              (pause)
          I'm sorry baby.

Budd tries to make a sound from the floor, Elle calmly places
her foot over his mouth.



                    ELLE (CONT'D)
          She put a Black Mamba in his
          camper.
              (pause)
          I got her, sweety.
              (pause)
          She's dead.
              (pause)
          Let me put it this way. If you ever
          start feeling sentimental, go to
          Austin, Texas. When you get here,
          walk into a florist and buy a bunch
          of flowers. Then you take those
          flowers to Huntington cemetery on
          Fuller and Guadalupe, look for the
          headstone marked "Paula Schultz",
          then lay them on the grave. Because
          you will be standing at the final
          resting place of BEATRIX KIDDO.

She hangs up the cell phone, and looks down at the dead man
under her shoe.

Picking up the Hanzo sword, she climbs down on the floor on
her hands and knees to pick up the fallen money.

CU The BLACK MAMBA
out from under the refrigerator, behind Elle...

Elle senses it. And slowly turns her head to look back..

Both Black Mamba and Elle Driver LOCK EYES...

ZOOM INTO BOTH CU's tighter and tighter, till Elle says;



                    ELLE
          Bring it on, bitch.

The viper known as death incarnate, LEAPS at Elle.

Elle flicks her wrist slightly. She doesn't even swing the
blade. She just holds it.

The snake's head touches it, and is immediately SEPARATED
from its body.

ELLE'S EYES look down at the Japanese steel in her hand.

HANZO BLADE
a smidgen of crimson blood is on the silver steel.



                    ELLE
          Now that's what I call sharp.



EXT. BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

Elle exits the camper with both the sword and the black
suitcase in her hand.

She climbs into her gold and black Trans Am, starts up the
engine, turns on the radio....

WHEN...

...she thinks she hears something...she looks out her
driver's side car door window...

ELLE'S POV:
The dirty BLONDE BRIDE behind the wheel of her new, enormous
red pickup truck, HEADING RIGHT FOR HER...

CU ELLE
her jaw drops open. She's gobsmacked. Not only does she see
the dead walk, she sees the dead behind two tons of metal
coming at her at 100 MPH...

CRASH

The Red Pickup T-BONES the Trans Am, the gold and black car
FLIES through the air, then ROLLS OVER AND OVER about five
times in the desert sand and dirt...ending upside down.

The dirty blonde looks out her windshield at the wreckage of
the black and gold sports car. A smile with the slightest
hint of satisfaction, spreads across her face.

She hops out of the truck and into Budd's camper.

INT. BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

As she walks through the door, Budd's dead, swollen body
greets her. As does her serpent namesake, dead on the floor
from decapitation.

She begins searching the camper, quickly, for something in
particular. We don't have the slightest clue what it could
be.

FLASH ON
EX CU The BRIDE'S EYE.

The BRIDE'S POV:
She watches from a high perch, Budd practicing with a ...
SAMURAI SWORD.

The BRIDE
searching under his bed, she sees a sword on the floor,
resting in a shiny, black wood mahagony sheath. She removes
it from its hiding place.

WOOD SHEATH
Its one of Hanzo's sheaths. She opens it. It is a Hanzo
sword. Near the handle, etched in the steel, are the English
words; "To My Brother Budd, The Only Man I Ever Loved, from
Bill."

She closes the sheath, this will do. She sees a pair    of
cowboy boots. Picks one up and places the sole of the    boot
against the sole of her foot. Her feet and this man's    boot
are around the same size. She slips her dirty feet in    them.

She's good to go.



EXT. DESERT

Elle crawls from the wreckage of the Trans Am, holding the
Hanzo sword, looking like she's just been in a car wreck.

A cut on her head makes blood run down the side of her face.
Luckily for her, not the side with the good eye.

The camper door swings open. The Bride emerges from Budd's
home, looking like a Barbie doll that's been dug up after ten
years buried in the backyard, carrying a Hanzo sword. Every
footfall creating a cloud of dust.

The two women, each carrying a samurai sword, face each other
in showdown position.

A shark smile spreads across Elle's face.



                    ELLE
          Bravo, Bea. I actually thought that
          alacky had got the best of you.



                    THE BRIDE
          You thought wrong.

The Bride unsheaths her sword with great flourish.

Elle does the same.



                    ELLE
              (referring to the sword)
          What's that?



                    THE BRIDE
          Budd's Hanzo sword.



                    ELLE
          He said he pawned it.



                    THE BRIDE
          Guess that makes him a liar, don't
          it?

Without raising their swords into position, the two blonde
warriors circle each other.



                    THE BRIDE
              (question)
          Elle?

                       ELLE

          Bea.



                    THE BRIDE
          I was wondering, just 'tween us
          girls, what did you say to Pai Mei
          for him to snatch out your eye?

FLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE
of Pai Mei SNATCHING out Elle's eye with his Eagle's Claw.



                    ELLE
          I called him a bastard.



                    THE BRIDE
          Oooh, not so good.



                    ELLE
          Were I to do it over again, I'd
          bite my tongue.



                    THE BRIDE
          One more question?



                       ELLE
          Shoot.



                    THE BRIDE
          Where's Bill?

          Villa Quatro.



                    THE BRIDE
          Gulf of Mexico?

Elle nods her head 'yes.'

                    THE BRIDE
          You wouldn't lie to me now?



                            ELLE
          Why lie?

Elle raises up The Bride's Hanzo sword into position.

The Bride raises up her sword.



                    THE BRIDE
          I saw what you did to that little
          Mamba in there. Want to try that on
          somebody your own size?




                    ELLE
          I intend to.

The Bride completely drops her sword stance and her samurai
bearing.



                            THE BRIDE
          Oh    Elle,   I    should warn   you    before
          we get started. Hattori Hanzo
          swords are extremely sharp. They
          can    take   a    little   getting    used   to.
          Careful not to cut your own arm
          off.



                    ELLE
          I don't rattle, bitch!

The Bride brings her sword back into combat position.



                    THE BRIDE
          You're gonna bleed though, you're
          gonna bleed a lot.

THEN...

SPAGHETTI WESTERN MUSIC EXPLODES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.

The two blonde warriors....swords in position...no longer
circle each other....but instead move forward...closer and
closer to each other....one baby step at a time...

CU OF GIRLS.

EX CU'S OF:

Their separate GRIPS on the SWORD'S HANDLE.

Their FEET moving closer.

The Bride's eye.

Elle's eye.

The Tips of each other's Blade.

Their Blonde Hair.

As the Operatic Spaghetti Western Music Builds to a
crescendo...we CUT BACK AND FORTH between CU's of the two
women that get TIGHTER AND TIGHTER as we ZOOM in CLOSER and
CLOSER....UNTIL...We reach the THEME'S CLIMAX....

Both women let loose with a    Samurai Grunt and Swing.

EX CU: TWO SILVER BLADES CLASH.

EX CU: BLONDE HAIR WHIPPING.

EX CU: TWO SILVER BLADES CLASH AGAIN.

TWO SHOT: The TWO WOMEN WARRIORS stand their ground, STRIKING
and DEFENDING...When they stop, no one's been touched.

The TWO WOMEN - Swords in attack position - stare across to
the other one, as they prepare for their next attack...

Now they begin to circle again.

CU THEIR FEET making a circular walk.

They ATTACK...

EX CU BLADES MEET -- However this time we don't know who's on
the left or the right. One Blade maneuvers around the other.

EX EX CU: of TIP OF BLADE SLICING OPEN SKIN, about a quarter
of an inch. It looks like a scalpel cut. No blood. Just skin
separating. We don't know who's cut.

The TWO WOMEN stand and face each other. Neither knows if
it's them who has been struck. Neither woman bleeds.

We feel a count of...One Mississippi...

EX CU: ONE SILVER BLADE, clean as a whistle.

EX CU: ONE SILVER BLADE with a smudge of CRIMSON BLOOD on its
TIP.

We feel a count of Two Mississippi...

ELLE,

BLOOD begins to PROJECTILE SPRAY out of a slice in Elle's
neck only a quarter of an inch long. The Blood does not exit
the neck as liquid but as a FINE RED MIST, like that of an
aerosol can, we even HEAR the slight SPRAY WHISTLE. Elle
feels nothing. She turns her eyes towards the sound of the
spray, and sees the blood escaping her like air from a
balloon. She lifts her hand and places it in the path of the
spray, it's immediately BATHED IN RED.

Elle drops the Bride's sword.

As her blood continues to escape, both women look across each
other.

The effect is that Elle Driver is a balloon and her life is
escaping before both their very eyes. And now looking across
at each other, the two women see the other for the first
time, not as adversaries, or opponents, or as rivals, or as
bitches...but as sisters.

Elle no longer has enough life in her to stand up...She falls
to her knees in front of The Bride....

...then as she dies, she leans the side of her head against
The Bride's standing body. Her blood runs down The Bride's
leg. As she passes on, Elle gently wraps her arms around the
Bride's leg.

The Bride's hands go down to Elle's long blonde hair, and
begins gently stroking it, easing her pain as she expires.

Only in death do they find the sisterhood that could have
been theirs.

WIDE SHOT
The Bride standing, Elle on her knees, the desert surrounds
them.

The Bride has finished burying Elle. She sticks a jerry
rigged wood cross in the ground as a marker. Then using her

carves the name "L. DRIVER" on the cross.

                   "The blood-splattered
                           BRIDE"



INT. BILL'S HACIENDA - DAY

Bill on the patio of his beautiful hacienda home (named Villa
Quatro) located on the beach in Mexico. At the moment Bill
partaking of his current hobby......Flower Arranging.

With his hands among various flowers of BRIGHT COLORS, he
sorts and prunes a very pretty arrangement.

EX CU the BRIDE'S EYE
....watching....

Bill's Mexican housekeeper, JOSEPHINA, appears on the patio.



                    JOSEPHINA
          Mr. Bill, you wanted me to tell you
          to leave now.



                    BILL
              (finishing up)
          Yes, I got to go and meet the
          Duchess.
              (referring to the flowers)
          Do you like it?



                    JOSEPHINA
          Oh yes Mr. Bill, it's very pretty.



                    BILL
          Why don't you put it on the dinner
          table, so we can enjoy it tonight.



                    JOSEPHINA
              (she takes it)
          Good idea, she'll love it.

As he heads out the patio, he tells her;



                    BILL
          Oh and Josephina, take the
          remaining flowers and spread them
          around the house, if you would.

                    JOSEPHINA
          Yes, Mr. Bill.

He exits the patio, then turns around and pops his head back
in.



                    BILL
          You know I just had a great idea.
          Take the roses, and spread the
          petals on the bed I just got for
          her. That'd be a nice thing to come
          home to, wouldn't it, a bed of
          roses.



                    JOSEPHINA
          Oh, she'll love that Mr. Bill.



                    BILL
          You wouldn't mind doing that for
          me, would you Josephina?



                    JOSEPHINA
          No, not at all.

FLASH ON
EX CU The BRIDE'S EYE
....watching....

We follow behind Bill as he moves through his house...He
slips on his jacket...Grabs his keys...TWO energetic GERMAN
SHEPHERDS follow him out the front door onto his driveway.

On his way to his silver Porsche, he roughhouse plays with
the dogs, speaking to them in Spanish. When he gets to the
sports-car, the dogs won't leave him alone, and one jumps on
the Porsche. He yells at it in Spanish;



                    BILL (SPANISH)
          Get the fuck off the car, Lucy,
          Lucy, down!

FLASH ON
EX CU The BRIDE'S EYE
...watching...

The gates in front of Bill's Hacienda home open, and his
silver Porsche hits the streets running.

FLASH ON
EX CU The Bride
...watching...
A SUSPENSE THEME PLAYS OVER THE SHOTS of The Bride's Eye
every time we cut to it. Over the SHOTS OF BILL DRIVING we
hear a SPANISH TRAGIC LOVE BALLAD, coming from the car radio.

BILL
driving his convertible as the beach WHIZZES by in the
background.

The Bride's eye.

Dirt Road, lined by greener than green trees, the Porsche
kicks up dirt ZOOMING down it.

CU BILL
driving as the Spanish love song plays.

The Bride's eye.

A striking but antiseptic-looking INSTITUTION of some sort,
surrounded by the beautiful foliage of Mexico. Bill's silver
Porsche drives up its driveway.

The Bride's eye.



INT. INSTITUTION

The institution is not Spanish in style, but on the contrary
it's a clinical new-age box-like structure made up of clear
glass doors and walls and the color beige.

Bill walks through the glass doors, to a lone Asian FEMALE
RECEPTIONIST, her desk is the only furniture in the lobby. In
JAPANESE he explains to her his reason for being there.

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYE
...watching...we now leave any shot of Bill not from the
Bride's perspective. The SUSPENSE THEME is STRETCHED TIGHTER
and TIGHTER as we look through the Bride's POV and listen to
her VO;



                    THE    BRIDE (V.O.)
          The attentive    audience members
          among you will    have probably
          noticed, that    all my kills have
          been straight    up fights.

The Bride's POV: The Glass-enclosed Institution, and Bill
standing by himself in the empty lobby.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          Y'all figured I'd face him with my

          Hanzo sword, aye? Well, I figured
          Bill figured the same thing. I am
          the product of three godfathers.
          Bill, Pai Mei, and Hattori Hanzo.
          Different teachers teach you
          different things. But one thing I
          learned from all three, was "in
          combat, the opponent that does the
          unexpected, can usually expect to
          be the victor." Bill would never
          see this coming. Not from me. And
          least any of you judge me a
          bushwhacker, remember...It was Bill
          who taught me how to shoot.

As the Bride has said these things, WE'VE seen    INSERTS of her
putting together her high-powered scope rifle.    Snapping on
the scope sight. Setting the FOCUS through the    CROSSHAIRS.
Loading the heavy-duty AMMO. Curling her long    white finger
around the rifle's TRIGGER.

SCOPE SIGHT POV: Bill's head in between the Crosshairs.
SUSPENSE THEME is STRETCHED TIGHTER STILL...it will soon
break.

WIDE SHOT
looking through the Institution's glass wall. The elevator in
the lobby opens...and A LITTLE GIRL steps out, and runs into
Bill's arms. A LITTLE GIRL about five years old. A FIVE-YEAR
OLD LITTLE GIRL with blonde hair. Bill picks up the Little
Girl and lifts her HEAD into the CROSSHAIRS of the SCOPE
SIGHT.

SUSPENSE THEME SNAPS into an OPERATIC WAIL...

EX CU: The Bride's finger, pops off the trigger.

EX CU: The Bride's eye, A HUGE TEAR FALLS OUT...We move out
of the eyeball, into a MEDIUM CU of The Bride, tears falling
down her face...She can't believe what she's looking
at...that's her daughter...She's alive...

Her REMEMBERING THEME PLAYS...

FLASH ON
The Bride remembering, while she was in her wide-eyed coma
state, lying on an operating table, as DOCTORS AND NURSES
performed a Cesarean childbirth on her. The NEWBORN INFANT is
passed to other hands above her wide-eyed unblinking
expressionless face.

CU of The BRIDE
In one moment, Bill has managed to suddenly change the game.



EXT. LONG LONG LONG EMPTY ROAD IN MEXICO - DAY

Silence, except for a few birds.

THEN...

WE HEAR the Roaring of an Engine, and the Silver Porsche
WHIZZES into FRAME.



INT. PORSCHE (MOVING) - DAY

Bill behind the wheel, his little girl asleep in the
passenger seat. He sees something ahead.

A convertible Volkswagen Karman Ghia enters the road heading
in the opposite direction. It's a long long long way off, but
it will get closer every second.

Bill senses something about this automobile, and throws a
glance at his sleeping child.

His cell phone RINGS, he answers it.



                    BILL
          Hola.



INT. THE BRIDE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

The Bride behind the wheel of the convertible, her long
blonde hair whipping in the wind, talks to Bill for the first
time in five years and six months.



                    THE BRIDE
          Hello Bill.



                    BILL
          Kiddo, is that really you?



                    THE BRIDE
          Oh, it's me all right.



                    BILL
          I hear you were driving a truck?



                    THE BRIDE
          My pussy wagon died on me. Who's
          your little friend?

He glances down at the sleeping child.



                    BILL
          Oh, you mean the little tow head
          next to me, who looks
          extraordinarily like you?



                    THE BRIDE
          Yeah, that one.



                    BILL
          Her name is B.B.

The Bride gets choked up again, emotion betrays her voice.



                    THE BRIDE
          B.B.?



                    BILL
          Yes. Do you approve?

She wipes her eyes. Her hand moves under her shirt,
fingertips rest on scar.



                    THE BRIDE
          Yes. Can she hear us?



                    BILL
          Not now, she's in dream land.



                    THE BRIDE
          How old is she?



                    BILL
          What do you mean by that?



                    THE BRIDE
          How many years has she been alive?

          BILL
Don't ask how old she is, ask, if
she's five.



          THE BRIDE
Is she five?



          BILL
Aren't mothers like God, aren't you
supposed to automatically know?



          THE BRIDE
I did and I do.
    (pause)
I want to meet her.



          BILL
Have dinner with us at my hacienda
tonight. She's expecting you.



          THE BRIDE
What do you mean?



          BILL
I knew you were on your way, so I
told B.B. Her mommy was coming to
see her.



          THE BRIDE
    (confused)
What have you told her about me?



          BILL
That you were sick, that you were
asleep, but one day you'd wake up
and come back to her.
And she asked me, "If Mommy's been
asleep since I was born, how will
she know what I look like?" To
which I replied, "Because Mommy's
been dreaming of you." And she
said, "Then I'm gonna start
dreaming of her." So I gave her a

          picture of you --



                    THE BRIDE
          -- which one?



                    BILL
          The one I took of you in Paris,
          sitting on the steps with the
          baguette in your hand. Since she
          was one and a half years old, she's
          slept with that picture of you next
          to her bed.

The EXACT PHOTO DISSOLVES OVER The Bride's face, then
DISSOLVES AWAY.



                    THE BRIDE
          You know, prettier photos of me do
          exist.



                    BILL
          And she's seen them. But the one
          she wants looking after her while
          she sleeps is the one of you
          holding bread.
              (pause)
          We normally have dinner around
          seven, is that convenient?



                    THE BRIDE
          Yes.

Pause....The cars get closer...



                    THE BRIDE
          When do we cross swords?



                    BILL
          Well, it just so happens, my
          hacienda comes with its very own
          private beach. And my private
          beach, just so happens to look
          particularly beautiful bathed in
          moonlight. And there just so
          happens to be a full moon out
          tonight. So, swordfighter, if you

          want to sword fight, that's where I
          suggest. But if you wanna be old
          school about it - then we can wait
          till dawn, and slice each other up
          at sunrise, like a couple real life
          honest to goodness samurais. As per
          usual Kiddo, I'll leave the big
          decisions up to you.

The cars will soon pass...



                    THE BRIDE
          Do me a courtesy?



                      BILL
          Anything.



                    THE BRIDE
          Slow down as we pass...I want
          another look at her.



                    BILL
          Wear something nice tonight?



                    THE BRIDE
          I have a dress all picked out.



                    BILL
          Will I like it?



                    THE BRIDE
          You said I looked beautiful last
          time you saw me in it.



                    BILL
          I'll dress up too.

His foot moves off the gas, slowing the car; her foot does
the same.

The cars in SLOW MOTION start to pass.

The Bride looks into the other car.

We ZOOM past Bill to the little girl in the passenger seat.
We go ONE FRAME AT A TIME till the car moves past us, to Bill
holding a pistol with a large silencer pointing right at our
face. He FIRES. It emits only a tiny PHOOF.

The Bride throws herself across the passenger seat as the
driver's side window EXPLODES over her head.

The two cars pass each other.

The Bride straightens herself in the driver's seat. She looks
in the rearview as Bill and her daughter drive away. Grabbing
the cell phone she screams in it;



                    THE BRIDE
          You fucking maricone!

Bill on his cell, eyes on rearview.



                    BILL
          Now you just wait one second there
          little missy. Unless I'm confused,
          we are trying to kill each other
          aren't we? Now I wasn't planning on
          taking a shot at you in front of
          the squirt, but, she is asleep. And
          if you're gonna forget everything I
          ever taught you, and gawk like you
          ain't got good sense, I'm gonna
          take a shot, am I not?



                    THE BRIDE
          Did she wake up?



                    BILL
          Of course not. She's like you that
          way.
          I look forward to this evening. It
          was great speaking with you, Bea.

He hangs up.



INT. WHERE HATTORI HANZO SLEEPS - JAPAN - NIGHT

Hattori Hanzo lies sleeping on his mat...

WHEN...

His phone wakes him up in the middle of the night...He
hurriedly answers it.

                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
              (in phone; groggy)
          Hello....



INT. MEXICO HOTEL - DAY

The Bride's on the phone, calling Japan, in tears.



                     THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Hattori!



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          Beatrix, what's wrong?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          She's alive! My baby girl's alive!

                                                 CUT TO:



INT. THE BRIDE DRIVING TO BILL'S VILLA

The same shot we saw during the opening credits. She's
dressed in a white bridal gown, the exact replica of the one
she was bushwhacked in.

Over her CU we DISSOLVE TO A CU OF HANZO talking to her
earlier on the phone.



                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          Half of Bill's strength, lies in
          his talent for the unexpected.
          If you intend to vanquish this man,
          and claim your daughter, you must
          not only expect the unexpected. You
          must do the unexpected.

WE DISSOLVE BACK to The Bride.

We see the same shots as before of The Bride driving up to
Bill's villa, through his iron gates, and parking by his
front door. We see TWO BLACK-SUITED MALE SATELLITES approach
her.

Now comes the new stuff.

She climbs out of her vehicle, goes to the back, opens the
boot, and removes her MOSSBERG PUMP ACTION SHOTGUN.

The two satellites freeze...

She SLIDES THE PUMP once, and FIRES.

ONE is BLOWN APART by the blast.

She SLIDES THE PUMP a second time...BLAST.

TWO buys the farm.

She slides the PUMP again...

...and BLASTS the front door, kicking it open and stepping
inside.



INT. BILL'S VILLA - NIGHT

ANOTHER BLACK-SUITED SATELLITE hurries down the stairs,
reaching for his weapon...

She FIRES the shotgun into his kneecap...

He TUMBLES down the stairs landing at her feet.

She points the shotgun straight down at his face.



                    THE BRIDE
          Hello Manny.

She FIRES...Then moves further into the house.

Apparently, this is the do-the-unexpected part of her plan.
Fuck the charade, storm the camp, kill everyone she comes
across, send Bill to hell, scoop up her daughter, and head
for parts unknown.

So far, so good.

She enters the butcher block kitchen, and finds Bill's cook
and housekeeper, Josephina.

Josephina stares at the shotgun barrel pointed at her.



                    THE BRIDE
          Hello Josephina.



                    JOSEPHINA
          Hello Miss Beatrix.

She grabs the housekeeper, and shoves her into the kitchen
pantry.



                     THE BRIDE
          Stay in here and don't come out. If
          you leave this room I'll shoot you,
          comprende?



                    JOSEPHINA
          Yes.

She closes the pantry door, and moves into the hallway
leading to the living room.

With her back against the wall, holding her weapon tight, she
moves down the hall. As she creeps, an unseen Bill yells to
her from around the corner.



                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Kiddo! If you're through shooting
          the servants, I'm in the living
          room. You remember how to get to
          the living room, don'tcha? Go down
          to the end of the hall, and make a
          left.

Back against the wall she creeps down the hall to the end.
She pumps the slide, and TURNS THE CORNER - SHOTGUN RAISED -
READY TO FIRE...

WHEN...

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYES - blink once.

EX CU HER FINGER comes off the trigger.

What the Bride sees in front of her is, Bill in a    tuxedo,
holding a small, orange squirt gun pointed at her.    Standing
next to him is five-year-old little B.B., dressed    up in a
very pretty party dress, arm outstretched holding    a orange
squirt gun, aimed at The Bride.

The three look at each other for a moment, then Bill says;



                     BILL
              (loudly)
          Bang Bang!

Then he suddenly clutches his abdomen like he's just been
shot.

                    BILL
          Oh B.B., Mommy got us.

B.B. lowers her gun and plays out a big dying scene alongside
her dad...Bill falls to the floor.



                    BILL
          Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying...

B.B. parrots this.



                    B.B.
          Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying...

Bill on the floor, says up to his little girl;



                    BILL
          Fall down sweetheart, Mommy shot
          you.

The little girl falls down pretend dead.

The Bride, still absentmindedly pointing her weapon at them,
is truly thrown.

Bill delivers his lines from the floor, spoken like a dying
breath;



                    BILL
          You did it Quick Draw Kiddo. You
          are-the fastest.

And with these last words, pretends to die.

But then while pretending to be dead, he speaks in a dramatic
narrator's voice.



                    BILL
          But...little did Quick Draw Kiddo
          know,...that five-year-old B.B.
          Gunn was only playing possum, due
          to the fact she was impervious to
          bullets.

B.B. raises her head off the floor and says;



                     B.B.

              (to Mommy)
          I'm impervious to bullets, Mommy.



                    BILL
              (to B.B.)
          Hey, get back down there, you're
          playing possum.

The little girl's head drops back down.

Bill continues his dramatic narration;



                    BILL
          So, as the smirking killer
          approached, what she thought, was a
          bullet-ridden corpse,...that's when
          the little B.B. Gunn fired.

B.B. springs up holding her tiny orange squirt gun and says;



                       B.B.
          Bang bang!

The Bride continues watching in gobsmackery.

Bill raises his head off the floor, and says to her in his
normal voice;



                    BILL
          Mommy, you're dead - so die.

The Bride shakes off her confusion, and acts out a big death
scene fo her little girl.



                    THE BRIDE
          Oh, B.B., you got me. I should have
          known, you are the best.

She falls to the floor and pretends to die.

The little girl in her party dress, runs over to the big girl
in her wedding dress, and kneels over her mommy.

Mommy opens her eyes.



                    B.B.
          Don't die Mommy, I was just
          playing.

From the floor, looking up at her daughter, she speaks to her
for the first time.



                    MOMMY
          I know baby.

They embrace each other.



                    B.B.
          I waited a long time for you to
          wake up, Mommy. Did you dream of me
          - I dreamed of you?

The female killer says to her daughter as mommieness begins
to creep into her voice;



                    THE BRIDE
          Every single night, baby.

She holds her daughter out at arm's length to get a better
look at her.



                    THE BRIDE
          Now let me look at you. My my my...
          What a pretty girl you are.



                    B.B.
          You're pretty too, Mommy.

B.B. starts stroking her mother's long blonde hair.



                       THE BRIDE
          Thank you.

All of a sudden, Bill has joined them on the floor.



                    BILL
          When I showed you Mommy's picture,
          tell Mommy what you said.

The little girl gets shy.



                       BILL

          C'mon shy girl, you know what you
          said, tell Mommy, it'll make her
          fell good.

As she strokes her long blonde hair, little B.B. says;



                    B.B.
          I said - I said - You're the most
          beautiful woman I ever saw in the
          whole white world.



                    BILL
          That's the truth. That's what she
          said.

B.B. points to Manny's blood, which splashed a little on the
Bride's wedding gown.



                    B.B.
          What's that?



                    MOMMY
          Oh, Mommy spilled something on her
          dress.



                    B.B.
          Blood?



                    MOMMY
          No. Kool-Aid. Do you like Kool-Aid?



                    B.B.
          No.



                    BILL
          Do you not like it, or do you not
          know what it is?

Parroting Bill;



                    B.B.
          I do not know what it is.

                    MOMMY
          Well, it's a very tasty beverage
          that I used to drink, when I was a
          little girl. It comes in a lot of
          different flavors and colors, and
          it's really good. Maybe we should
          fix some sometime. Want to do that?

The little girl gives a big nod, yes.



                     BILL
          Speaking of fixing and drinking and
          eating, I think it's dinner time
          don't you?

B.B. does an exaggerated nod, yes.



                    BILL
              (to Mommy)
          When you were doin all that fancy
          shootin, you didn't happen to shoot
          a nice Mexican woman about forty
          five years old, did ya?



                    MOMMY
          No.



                     BILL
              (wiping imaginary sweat
               off his brow)
          Whew, then dinner should be done.
              (shouting to the other
               room)
          Josephina! You can come out now,
          we're ready for dinner.



                    JOSEPHINA (O.S.)
          Yes, Mr. Bill.

He offers his hand to Mommy, and helps her to her feet. Then
says to B.B.;



                    BILL
          Want to go on top of the world?

She says excitedly;



                      B.B.
          Yeah!

He scoops the little girl up, puts her on his shoulders, and
as the mommy and the daddy and their little girl walk through
the house towards the dinner table, Bill and B.B. Sing The
Carpenter's song, "Top Of The World." It's obviously one of
their songs.



INT. DINNER ROOM - NIGHT

The dining room of Bill's house. The family, mother father
and daughter, sit at the dinner table eating.



                    BILL
          B.B., don't you think Mommy has the
          prettiest hair in the whole wide
          world?



                      B.B.
          Yes I do.



                    BILL
          In fact it's better than pretty.
          What's better than pretty?



                      B.B.
          Gorgeous.



                    BILL
          Very good, gorgeous. Mommy is
          gorgeous.

The Bride shows no sign of thawing around Bill.



                    BILL
          You know baby, Mommy's kinda mad at
          Daddy.



                      B.B.

Why? Where you a bad daddy?



          BILL
I'm afraid I was. I was a real bad
daddy.
    (to Mommy)
Our little girl learned about life
and death the other day.
    (to B.B.)
You want to tell Mommy about what
happened to Emilio?



          B.B.
I killed him. I didn't mean to, but
I stepped on him and he stopped
moving.



          BILL
Emilio was her goldfish. She came
running into my room holding the
fish in her hand, crying, "Daddy
daddy, Emilio's dead." And I said,
"Really, that's so sad. How did he
die?" And what did you say?



          B.B.
I stepped on him.



          BILL
Actually young lady, the words you
so strategically used were, "I
accidentally stepped on him."
Right?



          B.B.
Yeah.



           BILL
To which I queried, "And just how
did your foot accidentally find its
way into Emilio's fishbowl?" And
she told me no no no, Emilio was on
the carpet when she stepped on him.
    (beat)
Hummmmmm, the plot thickens. And
just how did Emilio get on the

carpet? And Mommy, you would have
been real proud of her, because she
didn't lie. She said she took
Emilio out of his bowl, and put him
on the carpet. And what was Emilio
doing on the carpet, baby?



          B.B.
He was -- flapping.



          BILL
And then you stomped on him?



           B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
And when you lifted your foot up,
what was Emilio doing then?



           B.B.
Nothing.



          BILL
He stopped flapping, didn't he?



           B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
And you knew what that meant,
didn't you?



           B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
What did that mean?

          B.B.
He was dead.



          BILL
    (to Mommy)
She told me later, that the second
she lifted up her foot and saw him
not flapping, she knew he was dead.
Is that not the perfect visual
image of life and death? A fish
flapping on the carpet, and a fish
not flapping on the carpet. So
powerful even a five-year old child
with no concept of life and death
knew what it meant. Not only did
she know Emilio was dead, she knew
she had killed him. So she comes
running into my room, holding
Emilio in both of her little hands -
it was so cute - and she wanted me
to make Emilio better. And I asked
her, why did she step on Emilio?
And she said, she didn't know. But
I knew why. You didn't mean to hurt
Emilio, you just wanted to see what
would happen if you stepped on him,
right?



          B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
And what happens when you stomp on
Emilio, is you kill him. And you
discovered that, didn't you?



          B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
So we drove down to the beach, had
a little funeral, and gave Emilio a
burial at sea. And right now I'm
sure he's happy as can be, swimmin
around in fish heaven.
But the point being, our child
learned two very important lessons.
One, about life and death. The
other, somethings once you do, they

can't be undone. I knew just how
she felt
    (to B.B.)
You loved Emilio, didn't you?



            B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
Well sweety, I love Mommy, but I
did to Mommy what you did to
Emilio.



          B.B.
You stomped on Mommy?



          BILL
Worse.
    (making his finger a gun)
I shot Mommy. Not pretend shoot,
like we were just doing. I shot her
for real.



            B.B.
Why?



          BILL
I don't know.



          B.B.
Did you want to see what would
happen?



            BILL
No, I   knew what   would happen to
Mommy   if I shot   her. What I didn't
know,   is when I   shot Mommy, what
would   happen to   me.



          B.B.
What happened?

                    BILL
          I was very sad. And that was when I
          learned, somethings once you do,
          they can never be undone.



                    B.B.
          What happened to Mommy?



                    BILL
          Why don't you ask Mommy.



                    B.B.
          Are you okay Mommy. Does it hurt?



                    BILL
          No sweety, it doesn't hurt anymore.



                    B.B.
          Did it make you sick?



                    MOMMY
          It put me to sleep. That's why I
          haven't been with you B.B., I've
          been asleep.



                    B.B.
          But you're awake now, right?



                    MOMMY
          I'm wide awake, pretty girl.



EXT. PORCH - DAWN

Bill sits on the steps of his porch in the back of the house
drinking a glass of red wine. The steps lead to the beach and
the sea.

Beatrix steps out onto the porch, and sits down on the steps
across from him.

Between them the dawn sky breaks.



                    BILL
          Did she go to sleep easy?



                    THE BRIDE
          It took her a little bit. She was
          excited. She's quite the little
          chatterbox.



                    BILL
          Well, if she doesn't like you, you
          got to kill her to say hello. But
          if she likes you, you can't shut
          her up. She's a chip off the ole
          blonde in that regards.

He holds up the bottle of vino.



                      BILL
          Red wine?

She shakes her blonde head, no.



                    BILL
          C'mon, Bea, you're a whole lot more
          fun with a couple glasses of wine
          in ya.

She gives him a look.



                    BILL
              (pointing towards the
               beach)
          We're going to go out there and
          have at it, aren't we?

She shakes her blonde head, yes.



                    BILL
          Well, I've already had    a glass. So
          unless you want to win    by an unfair
          advantage, you should    have a glass
          of wine. So we're both    on the same
          footing wine wise.

She holds out the empty glass, and he fills it with red.



                    BILL
          You know, there's an old man down
          here, his name is Esteban Viharo.
          He was a pimp. I knew him when I
          was a child. He was a friend of my
          mother's. I told him about you.
          When I showed him your picture he
          smiles and said;
              (imitating his accent)
          "Yesss, I see the attraction." He
          told me a story about taking me to
          the movies when I was five. It was
          a movie which had Lana Turner in
          it. And whenever she would appear
          on screen, he said I would stick my
          thumb in my mouth and suck it, to
          an obscure amount. And he knew
          right then, this boy will be a fool
          for blondes.



                    THE BRIDE
          Who would of ever thought you'd be
          such a good father?



                    BILL
          Well not you, that's for damn sure.

She gives him another look.



                    THE BRIDE
          Must we have to endure your little
          zingers?



                    BILL
          No we mustn't. But if you're going
          to say sentences like that, in the
          future, I will resist the
          temptation.



                    THE BRIDE
          Baby, you don't have a future.

Bill drinks some wine.

                    BILL
          I sent you to L.A. and you never
          came back. I thought you'd been
          killed. Do you know how cruel it is
          to make someone think someone they
          love is dead? I mourned you. Then
          in the third month of my mourning,
          I track you down. I wasn't trying
          to track you down, I was trying to
          track down - the fucking assholes -
          who I thought killed you. And when
          I find you, what to I find? Not
          only are you not dead, you're
          getting married - to some fuckin
          jerk - and you're pregnant? How do
          you expect me to react?



                    THE BRIDE
          Why do you think I hid?



                    BILL
          Why did you leave in the first
          place? You have cold eyes towards
          me now. I understand their
          temperature, but they were warm the
          second to the last time I saw them,
          or was that just my imagination?



                       THE BRIDE
          No.

The Bride decides to tell all. As she tells this story, parts
will be shown on the screen.

To give herself a running start with the story she starts it
off in Japanese;



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          You sent me to L.A. to kill that
          lady scoundrel, Lisa Wong.

Bill interrupts her.



                    BILL (ENGLISH)
          You are you talking in Japanese?

The Bride explodes;

          THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
What the hell do you care what I
talk in? Don't you know when to
keep your mouth shut? I'm trying to
tell you what you want to know, if
you'll just shut up and listen and
stop talking! Now may I continue?



          BILL
You're right, I'm wrong, continue.



          THE BRIDE
The morning I left, I threw up. I
don't feel like speaking in
Japanese anymore - on the plane, I
threw up. When I got to my hotel, I
threw up. So naturally I started
thinking, maybe I might be
pregnant. So I bought one of those
home pregnancy kits. Went back to
my room and took the test. The
little strip said blue. I was going
to have a baby. I tried to call
you, but you weren't there, so I
just thought I'd call back later.



          BILL
But you never did.



          THE BRIDE
- Would you shut up, I'm trying to
tell you how I feel.



          BILL
My apologies, please continue.



          THE BRIDE
So I just figured I'd call you back
later. I was just so happy, I put
on music and danced by myself in
the hotel suite, holding my little
blue strip.
What I didn't know, was at some leg
of my journey, I was spotted. With
me in Los Angeles it didn't take
Lisa Wong long to figure out
someone put a hit out on her. So
she sent an assassin of her own to

          kill me in my hotel room. As I was
          dancing in euphoria, the killer
          came down the hall.

There's a knock on the hotel room door.

The Bride stops dancing and goes to the door's peephole.

PEEPHOLE POV: A pretty KOREAN WOMAN in the blazer and skirt
outfit of a hotel manager. She's holding a basket of flowers.

The Bride says through the door;



                    THE BRIDE
          Hello, can I help you?



                    HOTEL WOMAN
          Hello, I'm Karen Kim, I'm the
          hospitality manager of the hotel. I
          have a welcome gift from the
          management.

Seeing it through the peephole.



                    THE BRIDE
          Oh, it's beautiful. But I'm kinda
          busy at this second, could you
          possibly come back later?

As she talks, she accidentally drops the blue strip, she
bends down to pick it up...

WHEN...

A SHOTGUN BLAST BLOWS A HOLE in the door, right where the
bent over woman was previously standing.

Karen kicks open the door, Pump Action Shotgun in hand.

The Bride's on her back, on the floor below her.

Karen aims the shotgun down at her.

With her foot, The Bride kicks the front door.

It SLAMS BACK HITTING Karen in the face.

The Bride scrambles to her feet, running for cover.

Karen pushes the door aside, steps into the room, and FIRES
the shotgun The Bride's way.

The Bride DIVES out of the way.

The BLAST DESTROYS the side of the room it HITS.

The Bride comes up from the floor with her SOG in her hand,
and THROWS IT across the room at Karen...

Karen BLOCKS the thrown knife with her shotgun. The blade
sticking in the weapon's wooden stock. She removes the knife,
and drops it to the floor.

The Bride is a sitting duck. There's nothing she can do
except wait to get shot.



                    KAREN
          So you came here to kill Lisa Wong,
          huh? Well that's my sister, bitch.
          I'm Karen Wong, and I've come here
          to kill you.

She raises the shotgun, and takes aim at The Bride...



                    THE BRIDE
          Wait a second!

Karen stops.



                    THE BRIDE
          Yes, I'm an assassin. Yes I did
          come here to kill your sister. But
          I'm not gonna do that now.



                    KAREN
          Oh, I know you're not --



                    THE BRIDE
          - listen to me! I just found out,
          right now - not two minutes before
          you blew a hole in the door, I'm
          pregnant.

Karen looks at her, "what?".



                    THE BRIDE
          On that table is the    home pregnancy
          kit. On the floor by    the door is
          the strip that says    I'm pregnant.
          I'm telling you the    truth, I don't
          want to and I won't    kill your
          sister. I just want    to go home.

                    KAREN
          What is this, bullshit story number
          twelve in the female assassin's
          handbook?



                    THE BRIDE
          Any other time you'd be a hundred
          percent right. But this time you're
          a hundred percent wrong. I'm the
          deadliest woman in the world, but
          right now I'm scared shitless for
          my baby. Please, you hafta believe
          me. Look at the strip, it's on the
          floor.

Karen looks over to the door, and sees the tiny strip on the
floor.



                    KAREN
          Sit down on that bed and put your
          hands behind your head.

The Bride complies. Karen bends down and picks the strip off
the floor. Then takes the package it came in and reads the
directions on the box.



                    THE BRIDE
          Blue means pregnant.



                    KAREN
          I'll read it myself, thank you.

It is blue, Karen's starting to believe her.



                     KAREN
          Okay, say I were to believe you,
          what then?



                    THE BRIDE
          Just go home. I'll do the same.

Karen does...She starts backing out of the room...before she
leaves, she says;

                    KAREN
          You fucked with the Wong sisters.



BACK ON THE PORCH



                    THE BRIDE
          Facing Karen Wong, was the most
          frightening moment I have ever
          experienced. And that includes
          three years with that evil bastard
          Pai Mei. Before that strip turned
          blue, I was a woman, I was your
          woman. I was a killer, who killed
          for you. Before that strip turned
          blue, I would have jumped a
          motorcycle on to a speeding train
          ...for you. But once that strip
          turned blue, I could no longer do
          any of those things. Not anymore.
          Because now I was a mother. A
          mother who only had one thought on
          her mind. Please don't harm my
          baby. Can you understand that?



                    BILL
          Yes. But why tell me now, and not
          then?



                    THE BRIDE
          You wouldn't have let me go.
          Specially once you found out I was
          pregnant. You would've tried to
          talk me out of it. It would have
          been a big scene. I just said fuck
          it.

Starting to get mad.



                       BILL
          Fuck who?



                    THE BRIDE
          Bill, you couldn't know I was
          pregnant, once you knew, you'd
          claim it, and I didn't want that.

                    BILL
          That's not your decision to make.



                     THE BRIDE
          Yes, but it's the right decision.
          And I made it for my daughter.
          Everybody on this earth deserves to
          start with a clean slate. But with
          us - my daughter would be born into
          a world she shouldn't be. Robbing
          her of the one thing everybody
          deserves. She would be born with
          blood stains. I had to choose. I
          chose her.

She takes a sip of wine. It's morning now. And now it's her
turn.



                     THE BRIDE
          You know five years ago, if I had
          to make a list of impossible things
          that could never happen.
          You performing a coup de grace on
          me by bustin a cap in my crown,
          would be right at the top of the
          list.
              (beat)
          I'd've been wrong, wouldn't I?

Bill listens stoney, then;



                    BILL
          I'm sorry was that a question? Of
          impossible things that could never
          happen - yes in this instance you
          would have been wrong.

The Bride listens stoney, then;



                       THE BRIDE
          Well?



                       BILL
          Well what?



                    THE BRIDE
          Explain yourself.

                    BILL
          I already have. When I told you the
          story of when I thought you were
          dead. Didn't you get how badly I
          felt?



                    THE BRIDE
          You call that an explanation?



                     BILL
          Well if that's too cryptic let's
          get literal.
              (beat)
          There are consequences to breaking
          the heart of a murdering bastard.
          You experienced some of them.

That's his explanation.

She hears it.

They both understand one another.



                    THE BRIDE
          You and I have unfinished business.



                    BILL
          Baby, you ain't kidding.

They both laugh.



                     BILL
          You know how proud I am of you,
          don't you?



                    THE BRIDE
          Yes.



                     BILL
          You know I was rooting for you,
          don't you?

                       THE BRIDE
          I figured.



                    BILL
          You know on that beach out there I
          want you to be the victor?

She nods her head, yes.



                    BILL
          You also know you're going to have
          to defeat me. I can't just give it
          to you, even though I want to.



                    THE BRIDE
          It won't be necessary for you to
          give me anything. I've surpassed
          you. I'll take it.



                    BILL
          Well, as they say in Missouri, show
          me.



EXT. THE BEACH - MORNING

As the blue waves of the Gulf of Mexico crash on the beach,
The Bride in her bridal gown, and Bill, his tuxedo jacket
off, face each other in a combat stance.

The BRIDE
Breeze blowing her blonde hair, holding her Hanzo sword in
its sheath.

BILL
stares across the sand to the figure of the Bride, his
student, facing him at sunrise with a weapon he taught her to
use. This is where all who teach combat artistry may end up.
Facing a Frankenstein monster of their own creation. He
removes his Hanzo sword from its sheath with GREAT FLOURISH.

WIDE SHOT
The two combatants...quite far from each other...they intend
to charge/attack...stand in showdown stance.

The BRIDE
The VENGEANCE THEME EXPLODES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.
She takes her combat stance. But what she doesn't do is
remove her sword from its wood sheath. The fist of her left
hand is wrapped around the wood sheath's center. Her right

empty hand, raises and makes a beckoning gesture to Bill.
Then with a face completely devoid of emotion, says in
Japanese;



                       THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Attack me.

She's facing him, sword in sheath, hand far from handle, in a
standing still position, not moving a muscle of blinking an
eye, staring her laser beams in Bill's direction waiting for
his attack.

He stands in a combat position, sword raises in a combat
grip, to charge her.



                    BILL
              (to himself)
          That's my girl.

He screams a samurai scream...and charges her...

She stands motionless...

Unblinking...

Watching him coming...

No fear....

No expression...

We go back and forth, close, wide, low.

TILL...

They meet...

Using only her left arm, with the sheathed Hanzo sword in its
grip, she blocks all of his blows, right arm unmoving down at
her side...sort of like Pai Mei did to her earlier...his
sword and her sheath lock together...they're close to each
other, she brings up her right arm, sticks out two fingers,
and hits Bill on ten different pressure points on his body.
Then hits him straight on in the heart with her palm. His
body jolts, like he's just had a heart attack...he coughs up
a little blood...he looks at her.

Their faces are very close...

The face of the cold ice woman Ninja, melts away before our
eyes, and the face of Beatrix Kiddo is filled once again with
compassion.



                       BILL

          He taught you the ten point palm
          exploding heart technique?



                    THE BRIDE
          Of course he did.



                    BILL
          Why didn't you tell me?

She doesn't have an answer.

She looks at him apologetically;



                    THE BRIDE
          I don't know...Because...I'm
          a...bad person.

He smiles at her duplicitly, and says with blood on his lips;



                    BILL
          No. You're not a bad person. You're
          a terrific person. You're my
          favorite person. But every once in
          awhile...you can be a real cunt.

They smile at each other.

Then...

Bill turns his back to her...

And walks five steps in the opposite direction...with each
step his heart swells, on the fifth...

It BURSTS...WE HEAR A SOUND, like of a tire blowout...

He falls to the beach...dead.

The Bride walks over to his body.

She unsheaths her Hanzo sword.

Blood lies in a pool, by Bill's mouth.

She dips the tip of the blade in the blood, leaving the
tiniest of crimson smudges.

She then removes the Bill handkerchief, and wipes Bill's
blood from off the blade onto the white cloth.

She lets the Bill handkerchief drop onto his body.

The Jingi sword Hattori Hanzo created, just for her, for this
purpose, has come to the end of its journey.

Beatrix, in a moment    of enormous generosity, allows herself,
one final tear, shed    for her corrupter, her enemy, the father
of her child,...her    MAN. The tear is for her as well. For
she's very aware she    will never ever be completely any other
man's WOMAN.

EX CU The Hanzo BLADE slowly sliding into the wood sheath.

EX CU the single teardrop, sliding down her cheek.

The blade disappears inside the sheath.

The teardrop falls of her chin.

Her journey, her revenge, her victory, her unfinished
business, is completed.

The Bride exits the beach.

Bill doesn't.
SERIES OF SHOTS END FILM
As a female voice sings a song on the soundtrack.

We see the Bride, get B.B.

The Bride and B.B. are driving away.

The Bride and B.B. eating in a coffee shop.

The Bride and B.B. in a motel room. They both wear bath
towels and both of their blonde heads are wet. The Bride sits
behind her on the bed, combing the little one's head.

The Bride spooning B.B. from behind, both of them are asleep.

It's the morning...

B.B. Sits on the motel room bed, watching Saturday morning
cartoons on T.V.



INT. MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - MORNING

The Bride is on the floor of the motel room bathroom, crying
her eyes out.

She shoves a towel in her mouth so B.B. won't hear her.

We wonder for a moment what's wrong...

Till we see her face in CU...

Her tears are tears of joy.

She can't believe this is even happening.

Her daughter is alive. They're together. They get to begin
again.

She covers her mouth so B.B. won't hear her crying and get
worried or confused.

But as the deadliest woman on the planet, lies on the motel
room bathroom floor, smile on her face, twinkle in her eyes,
happier than she's ever been, she thinks one thought. Over
and over again....

Thank you god...thank you god...thank you god...thank you
god.

She washes her face in the sink, when she's presentable, she
walks out of the bathroom, jumps on the bed with her baby,
hugs her from behind as the two watch Saturday morning
cartoons.

TWO SHOT CU
Both blonde heads, the big one and the little one, next to
each other, watching T.V.

The lioness has been reunited with her cub, and all is right
in the jungle.

                              SLEAZY INVESTOR
                    Is he askin' for more money?
          
                              THUGISH INVESTOR
                    He's asking us to fund a wild goose-
                    chase.
          
                              DENHAM
                    I'm talking about a primitive world
                    ... never before seen by man! The
                    ruins of an entire civilisation - the
                    most spectacular thing you've ever
                    seen!
                             (dramatiC pause)
                    That's where I'll shoot my picture!
          
          SILENCE for a beat ... And then -
          
                              SLEAZY INVESTOR
                    Will there be boobies?
          
          DENHAM is momentarily SPEECHLESS.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Excuse me, boobies?
          
                                                                      9.
          
                              SLEAZY INVESTOR
                    Jigglies, jablongers, bazoomers! ...
                    In my experience people only go to
                    these films to observe the ...
                    undraped form of the native girls.
          
                              DENHAM
                    What are you - an idiot? You think
                    they asked De Mille to waste his time
                    on nudie shots? No - they respected
                    the film maker, they showed some
                    class! Not that you'd know what that
                    means - you cheap low-life!
          
          ZELMAN shifts uncomfortably in his seat as THUGGISH shoots him an
          ANGRY LOOK.
          
                              ZELMAN
                    Would you step outside for a moment,
                    Carl?
          
          DENHAM looks at them ... the INVESTORS avoid EYE CONTACT.

          AS DENHAM STEPS INTO THE LOBBY, PRESTON, HIS LONG SUFFERING
          ASSISTANT WAITS ON A SOFA.
          
          DENHAM points suddenly to the GLASS OF WATER on the TABLE next to
          PRESTON.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Gimme that - quick!
          
          PRESTON hands him the WATER.
          
                              PRESTON
                    You won't like it, it's non-alcoholic!
          
          DENHAM empties the GLASS into a POT PLANT.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Preston, you have a lot to learn about
                    the motion picture business.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM quietly places the GLASS against the SCREENING
          ROOM DOOR, and presses his ear against it.

                    some interesting pictures, he's had a

                       Get him back in.
          
          ANGLE ON: The YOUNG ASSISTANT opens the DOOR, steps into the LOBBY

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM and PRESTON hurrying down the CROWDED SIDEWALK -
          struggling under the weight of 8 FILM CANS! DENHAM is glancing
          back over his shoulder.
          
                              DENHAM
                    I want the cast and crew on the ship
                    within the hour.
          
                               RESTON
                     o Carl, you can't do this!

                    Tell `em the studio's pressured us
                    into an early departure.
          
                              PRESTON
                    It's not ethical!
          
                              DENHAM
                     hat are they gonna do - sue me? They
                    can get in line! I'm not going to let

          ANGLE ON: PRESTON follows DENHAM, who steps off the curb ... and
          flags a CAB down. He cuts across the BUSY ROAD, PRESTON hurrying
          behind.
          
                               RESTON
                     ou realize none of the camera
                    equipment is on board. We have no

                    We have no insurance, no foreign

                    currency of any kind -
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM looks back across the STREET and notices an angry
          INVESTOR heading towards him.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Get in there!
          
          PRESTON suddenly finds himself BUNDLED into the back of a CAB.
          
                              PRESTON
                     ho's gonna pay for the ship?
          
          QUICK MOMENT: The SLEAZY INVESTOR grabs at the PARTIALLY OPEN BACK
          WINDOW of the CAB.
          
                              SLEAZY INVESTOR
                    Get out of there!

          DENHAM hurriedly WINDS the WINDOW SHUT ... the SLEAZY INVESTOR
          yelps with PAIN, as he yanks his JAMMED FINGERS away from the CAB!
          
                                DENHAM
                       tep on it!

          ANGLE ON: PRESTON sprawled on the SEAT, amid a PILE of FILM CANS,
          as the CAB speeds away!
          
                                DENHAM
                       on't worry Preston - I've had a lot
                      of practice at this: I'm real good at
                      crapping the crappers.

                      You got it ... and tell Maureen - she
                      doesn't have six hours to put on her
                      face. If she wants to be in this

                    You said we were shooting in

                             (darkly)
                    I might have known.
          
         

          
                                                                  14.
          
          
          EXT. NY STREETS - DAY
          
          ANGLE ON: The CAB screeches to a SUDDEN HALT in MID-TRAFFIC ...
          DENHAM jumps out, leaving PRESTON in protest ...
          
                              PRESTON
                    We gotta delay the shoot - shut
                    production down ... We can't sail
                    tonight!
          
                              DENHAM
                    Not an option.
          
                                  RESTON
                    Carl!
          
                              DENHAM
                    I said I'd find a girl.
          
          DENHAM turns and looks at PRESTON briefly.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    For Godsake, Preston - think like a
                    winner. Call Jack ... I need that
                    Goddamn screenplay!
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM leans in the window, PRESTON looks on PERPLEXED.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    Defeat is always momentary.
          
          DENHAM bangs the CAB ROOF with his hand, and then strides off
          confidently along the street.
          
          
          EXT. BURLESQUE THEATRE - EVENING
          
          CLOSE ON: A series of PHOTOS of SEMI NAKED WOMEN, with feather
          boas and peacock fans ... gaudy banners proclaiming Miss Lily Rose
          ... Delaware Du Boise ... Velvet Cushions ...
          W
           IDER: DENHAM is standing outside a tacky BURLESQUE THEATRE. He
          straightens his tie and heads towards the DOOR.
          
          ANGLE ON: A couple of LARGE GIRLS, followed by a SMALLER GIRL,
          arrive for work and enter the BURLESQUE THEATRE ... DENHAM eyes
          the BIGGER GIRLS, then chooses to follow the SMALLER ONE.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM is reaching for the DOOR HANDLE to go inside,
          when he suddenly pauses, his eye caught by the REFLECTION in the
          GLASS DOOR ...
          
           LOSE ON: ANN ... standing in the MIDDLE of the SIDEWALK. She is
          unaware of DENHAM watching her. ANN stares grimly at the BURLESQUE
          HOARDINGS, the FLYER clutched in her hands, a small knot of anger
          forming in her stomach.
          
           LOSE ON: DENHAM's HAND lets go of the DOOR. His eyes lock on ANN
          through the sea of PEDESTRIANS.
          
                   

          
                                                                  15.
          
          ANN angrily CRUMPLES the FLYER, drops it in the GUTTER and walks
          C
          away from the THEATRE.
          
           LOSE ON: DENHAM ... watching her leave.
          
          
          EXT. FRUIT STALL - EVENING
          
          A BUSY FRUIT STALL on the SIDEWALK. The VENDOR is hurriedly
          handing out APPLES and pocketing NICKELS.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN walks slowly by ... her eyes on the FRUIT. She
          glances at the VENDOR, SWIPES an APPLE from the TRAY, and quickly
          moves on, slipping the APPLE into her POCKET.
          
          ANN'S arm is suddenly GRABBED! The ANGRY VENDOR pulls her     hand
          out of her pocket, which is still clutching the stolen apple.
          
                              VENDOR
                             (angry)
                    You gonna pay for this?
          
          ANN tries to pull away. The VENDOR's grip on her arm tightens.
          
                              DENHAM (O.S.)
                    Excuse me ...
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM steps up behind them up HOLDING a NICKEL ...
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    Ma'am, I think you dropped this.
          
          ANGLE ON: THE VENDOR snatches the NICKEL from DENHAM'S fingers.
          
          
          INT. NY DINER - EVENING
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN is eating from a FULL PLATE, trying to disguise her
          HUNGER. DENHAM walks over carrying a CUP of COFFEE.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Vaudeville huh? I worked Vaudeville
                    once... that is a tough audience. If
                    you don't kill them fast, they kill
                    you.
          
                              ANN
                    Mr. Denham - I want you to know that
                    I'm not in the habit of accepting
                    charity from strangers, or for that
                    matter ... taking things that don't
                    belong to me.

                              DENHAM

                    misunderstanding.

                    That's awful. Anyway, Ann - may I call
                    you Ann?
          
          DENHAM leans forward ... lowering his voice.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    ... You wouldn't happen to be a size
                    four by any chance?
          
          ANN pauses mid way through a mouthful of food, her appetite
          suddenly draining away. She abruptly stands.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    No! Oh God, no! You've got me all
                    wrong. Miss Darrow, please! I'm not
                    that type of person at all!
          
                              ANN
                    What type of person are you?
          
                              DENHAM
                    I'm someone you can trust, Ann. I'm a
                    movie producer.
                             (sincere)
                    Believe me, I am on the level, no
                    funny business. Please, sit down -
                    Please ... Please.
          
          ANN hesitates a moment before sitting down once again.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                             (pitching the film)
                    Ann, I want you to imagine a handsome
                    explorer bound for the Far East.
          
                              ANN
                    You're filming in the Far East?
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM looking her in the eye and lying.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Singapore. On board ship he meets a
                    mysterious girl. She's beautiful ...
                    she's fragile ... haunted ...
          
          ANN looks up ... caught by the tale DENHAM is weaving.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    She can't escape the feeling that
                    forces beyond her control are
                    compelling her down a road from which
                    she cannot draw back. It's as if her
                    whole life has been a prelude to this
                    moment - this fateful meeting that
                    changes everything. And sure enough,
                    against her better judgement -
          
                                                                  17.

                                 DENHAM
                    Yes!
          
                              ANN
                    But she doesn't trust it. She's not
                    even sure if she believes in love.
          
                                 DENHAM
                    Oh really?
          
                              ANN
                    If she loves someone - it's doomed.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Why is that?
          
                              ANN
                    Good things never last, Mr. Denham.
          
          An awkward pause ... ANN looks away, having revealed too much.
          DENHAM considers her a beat, realising something ...
          
                              DENHAM
                    So you're interested?
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM hurriedly gathering up his hat and coat.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    That's settled then. I don't want to
                    rush you - but we are under some time
                    pressure here.

          DENHAM, sensing her interest, starts to get excited.

                    What a writer, huh? And let me tell
                    you Ann, Jack Driscoll doesn't want
                    just anyone starring in this picture.

          TOWNS. A CAB drives onto the DOCKS. DENHAM hops out and holds the
          door open for ANN, who emerges carrying a BATTERED SUITCASE.

                              DENHAM
                    Is this all of the equipment? This is
                    all of it? We're taking the Bell and
                    Howell? Good. You got all the lenses -
                    you got the two and the six?

                    Get it on board, fellas. Come on.
          A
           NGLE ON: PRESTON hurrying down the GANGWAY. He rushes up to
          DENHAM ... his eyes flick to ANN, but he pulls DENHAM to one side.
          
                              PRESTON
                             (urgent whisper)
                    They're on their way. I've just had
                    word.
          
                                 DENHAM
                    Who?
          
                              PRESTON
                             (whisper)
                    Men in uniform. The studio called the
                    cops!
          
          A FLASH of FEAR crosses DENHAM'S FACE ... DENHAM calls across to
          a TALL FIGURE who is supervising the loading of the ship.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Englehorn! Cast off! Hoist up the
                    mainsail - raise the anchor, whatever
                    the hell it is you do - we gotta
                    leave.
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    I cannot do that ... we're waiting on
                    the manifest.
          
                              DENHAM
                    What? Who? English - please!

                             (dryly)
                    Paperwork, Mr. Denham.
          
          DENHAM leans in conspiratorially ...
          
                              DENHAM
                             (low voice)
                    I'll give you another thousand to
                    leave right now.
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    You haven't given me the first
                    thousand yet.
          
          DENHAM glances at ANN, flustered and embarrassed.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Can we talk about this later. Can't
                    you see we're in the company of a VIP
                    guest?
          
          ENGLEHORN's gaze falls upon ANN ...
          
                               ENGLEHORN
                    Ma'am...

                    So you are ready for this voyage, Miss
                    Darrow?

                    Nervous?
          
                              ANN
                    Nervous - no. Why? Should I be?
          
          ANN looks taken aback ...
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    It isn't every woman who would take
                    such a risk.
          
          DENHAM throws PRESTON a look!
          
                              PRESTON
                             (hurriedly)
                    Why don't I show Miss Darrow to her
                    cabin?
          
                              DENHAM
                    Wonderful idea, thank you, Preston.

                                 PRESTON
                       Miss Darrow, if you'd just - Hi, my
                       name is Preston, Carl's assistant.
          
          DENHAM pulls his CHEQUE BOOK from his JACKET POCKET.
          
                                 DENHAM
                       Two thousand - it's a deal ... Will
                       you take a cheque?
          
                                 ENGLEHORN
                       Do I have a choice?

            EXT. VENTURE/NY DOCKS - NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: PRESTON goes to lead ANN up the GANG WAY past some rough-
          looking sailors, onto the SHIP - "THE VENTURE".
          
                                 PRESTON
                       Please, follow me. If there's anything
                       that you need ... `excuse me fellas,
                       if there's anything that you need
                       please don't hesitate to ... ask ...
          
          PRESTON turns back to see ANN hesitating at the bottom of the GANG
          WAY ... an unnerved expression on her face ...
          
          ANN steps forward ... Deep breath, she follows PRESTON.

          BEEFY SAILORS shovel COAL into the SHIP'S FURNACE ... another

          INT. DENHAM'S CABIN - NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM enters his CABIN looking FLUSTERED. He is
          STARTLED to find JACK DRISCOLL waiting for him. DRISCOLL is a
          WRITER, well dressed in a SHABBY sort of way.
          
                                 DENHAM
                       Jesus, Jack - you scared me!
          
          DENHAM crosses to a cabinet and breaks into a CRATE OF JOHNNY
          WALKER.
          
                                 DENHAM (cont'd)
                       Listen, if anyone comes to the door,
                       don't open it. You haven't seen me ...
                       say I got depressed and committed
                       suicide. Say I stuck my head down a

                    ... three hours late.
          
          JACK throws a FEW SCRIPT PAGES across the TABLE.
          
                              DENHAM
                    What's this?
          
                              JACK
                    It's the script.
          
                              DENHAM
                    This is a script? Jack ... this is
                    fifteen pages.
          
                               ACK
                    I know - but they're good! You've got
                    fifteen good pages there, Carl!
          
                              DENHAM
                    I'm supposed to be making a feature
                    length picture.
          
                              JACK
                    You told me I had more time. I'm
                    sorry. Look I gotta go.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Jack - No - you can't do this to me! I
                    have a beginning but I need a middle
                    and an end! I gotta have something to
                    shoot.
          
          The SHIP'S ENGINES roar into life ... JACK stands to leave.
          
                              JACK
                    You got my notes - I gotta go. See
                    you.
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM looking DISMAYED. He stares blankly at the RUSH

                              DENHAM
                    Alright, fine. We might as well settle
                    up.
          
          JACK looks ASTONISHED as DENHAM pulls out his CHEQUE BOOK.
          
                              JACK
                    You're going to pay me?

                              DENHAM
                    How does two grand sound?
          
                              JACK
                    Sounds great!
          
                              DENHAM
                    Thought it might.
          
          DENHAM'S eyes flick to the WINDOW ... sees SAILORS are hauling up
          the GANGPLANK.
          
           NGLE ON: A SAILOR CRANKS a series of VALVES as the SHIP'S PISTONS
          crank in to life.

                    Voila!
          
          JACK snatches the CHEQUE and turns to leave.
          
                                 JACK
                    Thanks...
          
          JACK glances at it.
          
                              JACK (cont'd)
                    Carl ... you've written "Two Grand".
          
          DENHAM takes the CHEQUE back ...
          
                              DENHAM
                    So I did ... Sorry about that
                             (screwing it up)
                    Let's start from the beginning.

          ANGLE ON: The ship's PISTONS PUMP faster.
          
          DENHAM looks up at JACK, a confused look on his face.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    It is the 29th, isn't it?
          
                              JACK
                             (anxious)
                    Come on - it's the 25th, Carl, the
                    25th!

          ANGLE ON: JACK suddenly realises the SHIP is about to leave.
          
                              DENHAM
                    I'm sorry. Let me just ... It'll just
                    take a second.
          
          DENHAM screws up the CHEQUE again! The VIBRATION of the ENGINES
          picks up. JACK heads for the DOOR!
          
                              JACK
                    Never mind, pay me when you get back!

                    are to have you back with us, Sir.
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK is hurrying down the corridor towards the DOOR. He
          feels the SHIP MOVING! He suddenly collides with BRUCE, who
          thrusts a SUITCASE at him.
          
                              BRUCE
                    Be a sport and lend us a hand.
          
                              JACK
                    Oh, Christ!
          
          JACK looks desperately out of the PORTHOLE, doubles back and BOLTS
          AWAY.
          
                              BRUCE
                             (dryly)
                    Appreciate the help, fella.
          
                              PRESTON
                    Let me get the door for you - welcome
                    to your state room sir.
          
                              

          
                                                                  25.
          
          
          INT. BRUCE'S CABIN - NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: BRUCE is clearly unimpressed with the TINY CABIN. He
          reacts to the SMELL.
          
                               RESTON
                      know, that's not a nice smell is it?
                    I'm sure it'll disperse in a day or
                    two. Did I ever mention how much I
                    love your work, Mr. Baxter? I've seen
                    every one of your pictures ... even
                    the silent ones.
          
                               RUCE
                    I haven't made any silent ones.
          
          BRUCE gently closes the DOOR in PRESTON'S FACE - leaving him
          silently CURSING to himself in the CORRIDOR.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE WHEELHOUSE - NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: The PROPELLER CHURNS through the WATER ...
          
          ENGLEHORN watches the VENTURE pull away from the dock ...
          Satisfied, he enters the WHEELHOUSE ...
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    Dead slow ahead both, Mr Hayes.
          
                              HAYES
                    Dead slow ahead both, Captain.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE/NY DOCKS - NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK emerges from the labyrinthine SHIP INTERIOR and
          rushes to the RAIL of the SHIP ... he freezes in HORROR!
          
                                 JACK
                    Oh Christ!
          
          ANGLE ON: The SHIP is PULLING AWAY from the DOCK ... 6 feet ...
          7 feet ... JACK contemplates JUMPING for a MOMENT:
          
                                 JACK (cont'd)
                    Goddammit!
          
          
          EXT. NY DOCKS
          
          POLICE CARS race along the docks towards the VENTURE, SIRENS
          wailing.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE DECK - NIGHT

          JACK SLUMPS on the DECK in DESPAIR. He's missed his chance to
          get off the ship.
          
                  

          
                                                                  26.
          
          DENHAM steps up behind JACK, just as a POLICE CAR, followed by
          ZELMAN and the INVESTORS, pull up on the DOCKS in the DISTANCE.
          
                              DENHAM
                    I keep telling you, Jack, there's no
                    money in theatre.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. NY DOCKS - NIGHT
          
          The INVESTORS leap out of the car.
          
                              SLEAZY INVESTOR
                    No, no, no!
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE DECK - NIGHT
          
          The VENTURE steams past the LIGHTS of MANHATTAN.
          
                              DENHAM
                    You're much better off sticking with
                    film.
          
                              JACK
                    I don't do it for the money, Carl. I
                    happen to love the theatre.
          
                              DENHAM
                     o, you don't.
          
          JACK looks at him exasperated as DENHAM casually taps his PIPE
          on the RAIL of the BOAT.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    If you really loved it, you would have
                    jumped.
          
          
          EXT. NY DOCKS - NIGHT
          
          WIDE ON: ZELMAN throws his hat to the ground in anger as THE
          VENTURE pulls away from the docks.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK HARBOUR - NIGHT
          
          WIDE ON: The VENTURE steams away from the DOCKS, passing under the
          MANHATTAN BRIDGE.
          
          
          INT. ANN'S CABIN - NIGHT
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN tests her mattress with her hands. ANN straightens &
          turns, perching on the edge of the BUNK.

                             (apologetic)
                    I hope you find it to your liking...
                    it's quite comfortable. Your towels
                    and linens are underneath the bed.
                    That is the wash basin. I know, that's
                    not a pleasant smell - is it? I'm sure
                    it'll disperse in a day or two.
          
           RESTON dances over to the WARDROBE.
          
                              PRESTON (cont'd)
                    The closet ... your costumes - I hope
                    you'll find everything is in order. If
                    there is anything that you need,
                    please do not hesitate to ask...fresh
                    water, perhaps? I can bring it to you
                    personally.
          
          PRESTON is interrupted by a knock on the CABIN DOOR...
          
          ANGLE ON: The DOOR opens and DENHAM enters. He thrusts a bottle of
          JOHNNY WALKER SCOTCH into ANN'S HANDS ...
          
                              DENHAM
                    Knock knock! We can't have our leading
                    lady deprived of the necessities of
                    life.
                              to PRESTON)
                    Do me a favour - run a bottle down to
                    Jack. It'll fend off his migraine.
          
                              PRESTON
                    They're still trying to find a place
                    for him to sleep.
          
                              DENHAM
                             (to PRESTON)
                    You told him my typewriter is
                    available for hire?
          
                               RESTON
                    Yes - he didn't take it well.
          
          PRESTON departs down the corridor.
          
                              ANN
                             (confused)
                    Mr. Driscoll ...?
          
          DENHAM turns and looks at ANN.
          
                              ANN (cont'd)
                    He's on board?
          
                              DENHAM
                    Jack has his heart set on coming. Call
                    me a softie - I couldn't say no.
          
                                                                  28.
          
          
          INT. SHIPS HOLD - NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: CHOY is showing JACK to his sleeping QUARTERS, carrying
          BLANKETS.
          
          JACK stares in DISBELIEF at the DINGY HOLD strewn with STRAW
          BALES and EMPTY ANIMAL CAGES. He reacts to the SMELL.
          
                              CHOY
                    This room very comfortable, plenty dim
                    light ... fresh straw.
          
                              JACK
                    What'd you keep down here?
          
                              CHOY
                    Lion, tiger, hippo - you name it.
          
                              Jack
                    What, do you sell them to Zoos?
          
                              CHOY
                    Zoos ... circus ...
                             (lowers voice)

                    Careful! Camel have bad accident on
                    floor. Stain unremovable ...
          
          JACK looks down. He's standing in a dark, viscous PUDDLE OF GUNGE.
          
                              CHOY (cont'd)
                             (lowers voice)

                    Choy!
          
          ANGLE ON: CHOY clams up as ENGLEHORN strolls into the hold.
          
                              ENGLEHORN (cont'd)
                    My apologies for not being able to
                    offer you a cabin. Have you found an
                    enclosure to your taste?
          
                              JACK
                             (dryly)
                    Spoilt for choice.
          
          ENGLEHORN surveys a COUPLE OF LARGE CAGES.
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    What are you, Mr. Driscoll, a lion or
                    a chimpanzee?
          
          JACK opens a CAGE large enough to sleep in.
          
         

          
                                                                  29.
          
                              JACK
                    Maybe, I'll take this one.
          
          He steps back with SURPRISE as a WOODEN CRATE TOPPLES, spilling
          out a LARGE MEDICAL BOTTLE. CHOY looks up in SHOCK as the BOTTLE
          ROLLS towards ENGLEHORN who coolly TRAPS it with his FOOT.
                               E
                              ENGLEHORN
                    I told you to lock it up.
          
                              CHOY
                             (scared)
                    Sorry, Skipper! Lumpy said -
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                             (interrupts)
                    Lumpy doesn't give the orders. What
                    are you trying to do? Put the whole
                    ship to sleep? Get them out of here!
          
          ENGLEHORN hands the BOTTLE to a nervous CHOY. JACK stares at the
          CRATES stacked in the CAGE.
          
          CLOSE ON: Piles of BOTTLES, all marked "Chloroform".

           NGLE ON: BRUCE pins movie posters from some of his previous films
          on his cabin wall ... He steps back, admiring them.
          
          
          INT. SHIPS HOLD - DAY
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK, sitting in the hold, TAPPING on an OLD TYPEWRITER
          propped up on BOXES. He is clearly very QUEASY, as he tries to
          stay focussed on the TYPEWRITER KEYS.
          
          He sees JIMMY carrying a TRAY come into view, he COUGHS and CLAMS
          UP.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Compliments of the chef -
          
          ANGLE ON: JIMMY unloading the BOWLS of GREY looking STEW from the
          TRAY.
          
           LOSE ON: JIMMY puts the BOWL next to JACK ... who takes one look
          at it, and SQUEEZES his eyes closed.
          
                              JACK (O.S.)
                    Oh Christ - oh God!

          The CAGES and ROPES SWAY with each roll of the WAVES ... JIMMY
          walks away.

                              HAYES (O.S.)
                    Jimmy!
          
          JIMMY spins round, a guilty look on his face.
          
                              HAYES (cont'd)
                    You run those ropes up on deck like I
                    told you?
          
                              JIMMY
                    Doing it now, Mr. Hayes.
          
          ANGLE ON: JIMMY tries to slip past, but HAYES grabs his WRIST.
          
                               HAYES
                    How about you return Mr. Driscoll's
                    pen first?
          
          CLOSE ON: An expensive FOUNTAIN PEN drops from JIMMY'S HAND and
          clatters to the floor. QUICK as an eel, JIMMY scampers AWAY.
          
          HAYES shakes his head, and picks up the PEN ... hands it back.
          
                               HAYES (cont'd)
                    He doesn't mean any harm. I'll keep
                    him out of Jyour way.
          
                               ACK
                    No, it's okay.
          
                              HAYES
                    It's just he likes it down here, it's
                    where I found him ... four years ago
                    ... stowed away in one of them cages.
                    His arm was broken in two places, he
                    was wilder than half the animals in
                    here. Still won't tell me where he
                    came from - all I know, it wasn't any
                    place good.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE DECK - DAY
          
          ANGLE ON: JIMMY is sorting NETS up on DECK. Nearby HAYES rests
          against the railing.
          
                              HAYES
                    You gotta straighten up. You don't
                    want to be on this ship for the rest
                    of your life.
          
                              JIMMY
                    I do.
          
                                                                  31.
          
                              HAYES
                    No, you don't, Jimmy. You wanna get
                    yourself educated. Give yourself some
                    options. Take this serious.
          
                              JIMMY
                    I do, Mr. Hayes, I do! Look, I've been
                    readin'.
          
          JIMMY pulls a battered book out of his coat pocket. HAYES takes
          the book. It has a painting of a TRAMP STEAMER on the cover and
          the title: HEART OF DARKNESS by Joseph Conrad.
          
                              HAYES
                    Where did you get this?
          
                              JIMMY
                             (prevaricating)
                    I borrowed it ...
          
          HAYES flicks the book open and sees "Property of New York
          Public Library" stamped on the interior of the dust jacket.
          
                              JIMMY (cont'd)
                    ... on long term loan. Look at this.
          
          JIMMY points to the printed byline on the back of the book.
          
                              JIMMY (cont'd)
                    "Adventures on a Tramp Steamer". See -
                    just like us.

          INT. ANN'S CABIN - DAY
          
          ANN is holding a copy of JACK'S PLAY "ISOLATION" ... she is
          standing in front of a mirror rehearsing her introduction.
          
                               ANN
                    It's nice to meet you Mr. Driscoll -
                    I'm actually quite familiar with your
                    work.
                              (trying again)
                    Oh yes! ... Hello, Mr Driscoll - it's
                    so nice to meet you! Actually, I'm
                    quite familiar with your work. I'm a
                    huge fan!
                              (one more time)
                    I've read everything you've ever
                    written.
          
          ANN'S face falls in DESPAIR - she can't get rid of her nerves
          about meeting the famous JACK DRISCOLL.
          
                                                                  32.
          
          
          INT. MESS ROOM - DAY
          
          A few sailors are finishing BREAKFAST.
          
          PRESTON, HERB and MIKE are seated at a TABLE.
          
          ANGLE ON: MIKE packing away his HEADPHONES and SOUND RECORDING
          EQUIPMENT.           M
                               IKE
                    I'm gonna have the ships' engines all
                    over the dialogue - sea gulls, camera
                    noise, wind and Christ knows what
                    else!
          
                              DENHAM
                    I don't care, Mike! You're the sound
                    recordist - make it work.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN in the CHIFFON DRESS, hesitating in the doorway of
          the MESS.
          
          DENHAM looks up and signals her over.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    Ann! Come on in! Let me introduce you
                    to the crew! This is Herb - our
                    cameraman ...
          
          ANN reaches out to shake HERB'S hand.
          
                              HERB
                    Delighted to meet you, ma'am. And may
                    I say what a lovely dress.
          
                              ANN
                    Oh! This old thing! I just - threw it
                    on!
          
                              PRESTON
                             (confused to DENHAM)
                    Isn't that one of Maureen's costumes?
          
                              ANN
                             (hurriedly)
                    What does a girl have to do round here
                    to get some breakfast!
          
                              DENHAM
                    Lumpy! You heard the lady!
          
          ANGLE ON: LUMPY looking up. He is simultaneously shaving a
          SAILOR and stirring PORRIDGE.
          
                              LUMPY
                    Fancy some of me ... ah ... Porridge
                    aux walnuts?

          DENHAM turns back to ANN, who is staring at MIKE, who has his
          head down, scribbling in a NOTEBOOK.
          
                              DENHAM
                    ANN, I don't believe you've met -
          
                              ANN
                    That's alright Mr. Denham, I know who
                    this is ...
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN, who is staring at MIKE in quiet awe. He glances up
          at her, nervously.
          
                              ANN (cont'd)
                    Thrilled to meet you. It's an honour -
                    to be part of this.
          
                              MIKE
                             (bewildered)
                    Gee, thanks!
          
                               ANN
                    Actually - I am quite familiar with
                    your work.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM raises a quizzical EYEBROW.
          
                                 MIKE
                    Really?
          
                              ANN
                    Yes, and what I most admire - is the
                    way you have captured the voice of the
                    common people.
          
                              MIKE
                    Well - that's my job.
          
                              ANN
                    I'm sure you've heard this before, Mr
                    Driscoll, if you don't mind me saying -
                    you don't look at all like your
                    photograph ...
          A
           NGLE ON: JACK at the bar, holding a cup of COFFEE. He turns
          and glances at ANN.
          
                                 MIKE
                    Excuse me?
          
                              DENHAM
                    Wait a minute! Ann -
          
                              ANN
                             (to DENHAM)
                    Well, he's so much younger - in
                    person.
                             (turning back to MIKE)
                    And much better looking.
          
                  

          
                                                                    34.
          
          JACK starts to walk over to the table.
          
                              DENHAM
                    ANN! Stop! Stop - right there -
          
          ANGLE ON: MIKE staring past ANN'S shoulder.
          
                              ANN
                    I was afraid you might be one of those
                    self obsessed literary types. You know
                    - the tweedy twerp with his nose in a
                    book and his head up his -
          
          JACK snaps his BOOK closed. ANN turns around ... her face drops.
          JACK looks at ANN, who stares at him MORTIFIED.
          
                              JACK
                    It's nice to meet you too, Miss
                    Darrow..
          
          
          INT. SHIP'S CORRIDOR/BRUCE'S CABIN - DAY
          
           RUCE bumps into JIMMY who hurries away looking shifty.
          
          BRUCE enters his CABIN ... A moustache has been drawn on all his
          POSTERS. BRUCE looks annoyed ... then takes another look.
          
          CLOSE ON: BRUCE glancing in the mirror - imaging himself with a
          moustache. Not bad.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE - DAY
          
          WIDE ON: The VENTURE ploughs through a HEAVY SWELL.
          
                              DENHAM (V.O.)
                    She's standing at the railing ... she
                    doesn't know it yet, but they're
                    sailing towards disaster. You got
                    that?
          
                              JACK (V.O.)
                    She turns ... The First Mate is
                    staggering towards her - there's a
                    knife sticking out of his back!
          
          
          INT. SHIPS HOLD
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK, sitting in the hold, TAPPING on an OLD TYPEWRITER
          propped up on BOXES. He is clearly very QUEASY, as he tries to
          stay focussed on the TYPEWRITER KEYS.
          
          DENHAM is pacing the HOLD, sucking on a PIPE.
          
                              DENHAM
                     ait a second, we're killing off the
                    First Mate?
          
                               

                                                                  35.
          
                              JACK
                    That's assuming she knows who the
                    First Mate is.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Come on, Jack! It was an honest
                    mistake. Ann is near-sighted - it
                    could happen to anyone.
          
                              JACK
                    I was joking, Carl.
          
                              DENHAM
                    The point is: she's horrified. She has
                    to look away. And that's when she sees
                    it.
          
                              JACK
                    See's what? What?
          
          ANGLE ON: Unseen by either DENHAM or JACK, JIMMY has snuck down in
          to the HOLD ...
          
                              DENHAM
                             (dramatic)
                    The island.
          
                              JACK
                             (taken aback)
                    We're filming on an island now? When
                    did this happen?
          
                              DENHAM
                    Jack, keep your voice down! I don't
                    want the crew getting spooked.
          
                              JACK
                    Why would they get spooked? What's it
                    called?
          
          DENHAM looks SHIFTY.
          
                              DENHAM
                    All right ... It has a local name, but
                    I'm warning you, Jack, it doesn't
                    sound good.
          
          ANGLE ON: JIMMY, his attention caught as he eavesdrops on the
          conversation.
          
          JACK looks at DENHAM in GROWING FRUSTRATION.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                             (quietly)
                    They call it ...

          JIMMY POV: DENHAM leaning in and murmuring to JACK.
          
                             

                                                                  36.
          
                              JACK
                    What's wrong with this place?
          
                              DENHAM
                    There's nothing officially wrong with
                    it. Because technically it hasn't been
                    discovered yet.
          
          JACK gives up, feeling too seasick to argue ...
          
                               JACK
                             (resuming typing)
                    Okay ... alright ... so we arrive at

          CLOSE ON: DENHAM looks up in time to see JIMMY listening ... Their
          eyes meet ... DENHAM tries to hush JACK - too late.

                               DENHAM
                    All right everyone, from the top.   And
                    ... action!
          
          ANGLE ON: BRUCE saunters up to ANN, who is leaning on the rail,
          staring out to sea, in full hair and make-up.
          
                              ANN
                    I think this is awfully exciting! I've
                    never been on a ship before.
          
                              BRUCE
                    I've never been on one with a woman
                    before.
          
                              ANN
                    I guess you don't think much of women
                    on ships, do you?
          
                              BRUCE
                    No, they're a nuisance.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM looking intently at JIMMY and HAYES who are
          further down the DECK ... talking quietly.

                              ANN (O.S.)
                    Well, I'll try not to be.
          
                              BRUCE (O.S.)
                    Just being around is trouble.
          
                              ANN (O.S.)
                    Well! Is that a nice thing to say!
          
                              BRUCE (O.S.)
                    It's a dangerous thing, having girls
                    on ships. They're messy and they're
                    unreliable!
          
                              DENHAM
                             (distracted)
                    Cut! Great!
          
           NGLE ON: DENHAM'S gaze returns to JIMMY and HAYES who are huddled
          in a group with three more SAILORS ... word is travelling fast.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    Bruce, wonderful performance. You can
                    relax for ten minutes.
          
          ANGLE ON: BRUCE looking pretty pleased with himself.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    That was very natural... I felt moved.
          
          JACK looks on in disbelief.

                     hat do you think, Driscoll? The
                    dialogue's got some flow now - huh?
          
                              JACK
                    It was pure effluence.
          
                                BRUCE
                        beefed up the banter ...
          
                              JACK
                    Try to resist that impulse.
          
                              BRUCE
                    It's just a little humor, Bud - what
                    are you, a Bolshevik or something?
          
          JACK watches as BRUCE saunters off ... he turns back to DENHAM.
          
                              JACK
                    Actors. They travel the world but all
                    they ever see is a mirror!

          JACK looks up to see ANN looking dismayed, a MIRROR COMPACT, in
          her hand ...
          
          She quickly snaps the COMPACT shut and turns away.

          INT. SHIP'S CORRIDOR - DAY
          
          ANN is making her way to the BATHROOM. She looks up as JACK
          rounds a corner coming the other way. They walk toward each
          other.
          
          SUDDENLY the ship sways, JACK is thrown forward, but ANN
          manages to hold her BALANCE.
          
                                 JACK
                    Good legs.
          
          ANN looks at him SHARPLY.

                    Sea legs - I meant - you know ... sea
                    legs. Not that you don't have good
                    legs, I was just ...
          
          JACK trails off as ANN edges past him, averting her eyes.

                    I know, it wasn't what you wrote. But
                    Mr Baxter felt very strongly that when
                    a man likes a woman - then he must
                    ignore her. And if things turn really
                    hostile ... no?

          SETTING SUN.
          
          ANN stares at JACK, momentarily forgetting where she is. He stares
          back at her.
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM catching the EXCHANGE of LOOKS. He takes the

                    There's no land south-west for
                    thousands of miles. It takes us way
                    outside the shipping lanes.
          
          ENGLEHORN turns and confronts DENHAM.

                    I would say they was full of it, Mr.

                    ...
          
          PRESTON glances warily at DENHAM. DENHAM takes in the situation
          and decides to front up.

                             (quietly)

                    I wouldn't be so sure of that.
          
                              PRESTON
                    What do you mean?
          
                              LUMPY
                    Seven years ago, me and Mr Hayes - we
                    were working our passage on a
                    Norwegian barque.
          
                              HAYES
                    We picked up a castaway - found him in
                    the water - he'd been drifting for
                    days.
          
                              LUMPY
                    His ship had run aground on an island,
                    way West of Sumatra. An island hidden
                    in fog. He spoke of a huge wall, built
                    so long ago - no one knew who had made
                    it ... A wall a hundred foot high ...
                    as strong today as it was, ages ago.
          
                              PRESTON
                    Why did they build the wall?
          
          SILENCE ...
          
         

          
                                                                  42.
          
                              LUMPY
                    The castaway - he spoke of a creature,
                    neither beast nor man, but something
                    monstrous, living behind that wall...
          
                              DENHAM
                    A lion or a tiger. A man-eater. That's
                    how all these stories start.
          
                              PRESTON
                             (to LUMPY)
                    What else did he say?
          
                              LUMPY
                    Nothing. We found him the next morning
                    ... he'd stuck a knife through his
                    heart.

                    than that. Monsters belong in B

          ANGLE ON: The MAP FLOATING on the INKY WATER as the VENTURE
          steams away ...
          .
           .. into a HUGE BANK of FOG that seems to melt out of the
          DARKNESS!
          
          Another BLAST from the FOG HORN echoes across the silent ocean.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE DECK - NIGHT
          
           RESTON moves along the DECK ... Staring uneasily at the FOG.
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES: Even the seasoned crew look unnerved.
          
          ANGLE ON: JIMMY up in the CROW'S NEST ... he is reading HEART     OF

                              ENGLEHORN
                    Station the for'head lookout, and get

                    Aye, Captain.

          HAYES is tense. ENGLEHORN remains focussed, his eyes fixed ahead.
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    Reduce speed, steerage way only.
          
          HAYES swings the TELEGRAPH LEVERS.
          
                              HAYES
                    Dead slow ahead, both.
                             (beat)
                    You should stop the ship.

                              HAYES
                    We're shallowing!
          
          ENGLEHORN looks with despair at the THICKENING FOG ahead. He
          starts spinning the WHEEL.
          
                              ENGLEHORN

          ENGLEHORN ... a look of DISBELIEF on his FACE.

           IDE ON: The VENTURE sails directly towards a HUGE WALL which
          rises up 200 feet into the sky! The SHIP is DWARFED by the
          monstrous structure.
          
          
          INT. WHEELHOUSE - FOGGY NIGHT
          
          ENGLEHORN stares at the LOOMING WALL, unable to believe his
          eyes ... he starts SPINNING the WHEEL hard to STARBOARD!
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    Stop engines!

          the FOG off the starboard bow.
          
                              JACK
                    Rocks!

          ANGLE ON: JIMMY spinning around as he sees ROCKS surrounding
          the SHIP.

                             (yelling)
                    Rocks to starboard ... to port ...
                    rocks everywhere!

          WHEELHOUSE DOOR.
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    Take the wheel, Hayes!
          
          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN rushes on to the DECK and looks with HORROR as
          he realises his SHIP is trapped amid a LABYRINTH of ROCKS.
          
          
          EXT. OCEAN - FOGGY NIGHT
          
           he VENTURE lolls WITHOUT POWER in the heavy swell.
          
          The HEAVY THROB of the ENGINES regain strength ... the reverse
          propellers pull the ship away, but still without adequate control.
          
 

          
                                                                  52.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE DECK - FOGGY NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN hurries up the STAIRS ... she clutches the
          RAILING for support and reels off balance, literally FALLING
          into JACK'S ARMS as the side of the VENTURE CRUNCHES against rock.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE - FOGGY NIGHT
          
          The IMPACT sends the VENTURE into a SLOW SPIN. As the SHIP sinks
          in the trough of a WAVE, MORE ROCKS emerge from the WATER around
          it.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE DECK - FOGGY NIGHT

                      Full ahead!
          
          ENGLEHORN takes the WHEEL from HAYES.

          HAYES runs OUTSIDE
          
                                HAYES
                      Rocks to port, Captain!
          
          
          EXT. OCEAN - FOGGY NIGHT

          ANGLE ON: The VENTURE rides the SWELL towards CAMERA.
          
          SUDDENLY!
          
          A SICKENING GROAN OF METAL ... as the VENTURE RUNS AGROUND on
          HIDDEN ROCKS! HAYES looks in HORROR as he comes within inches of
          the rock outcrop.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE DECK - FOGGY NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM watches as a HUGE STONE FACE - part of the ROCK
          OUTCROP they have grounded on - slides to a halt just off the
          VENTURE'S BOW. Weathered ... eroded away ... carved by the hand of
          some ANCIENT PEOPLE.
          
           NGLE ON: A breathless JIMMY scuttles backwards as the CROWSNEST
          settles against the ROCK.
          
      

          
                                                                     53.
          
          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN shuts the engines down as his ship GRINDS
          sickeningly against the rock ...
          
          ... STUCK FAST.
          
          PANDEMONIUM ON DECK!
          
           NGLE ON: HAYES, unable to believe his eyes as he STARES up at the
          LOOMING ROCK.
          
          DENHAM stares at the EERIE SILHOUETTE of an ISLAND, visible
          through the thinning FOG. JAGGED PEAKS rise from a ROCKY
          SHORELINE. CRUMBLING RUINS cling to BARREN CLIFFS.
          
          ANN steps closer, a LOOK of total DISBELIEF on her FACE.
          
          
          INT. VENTURE ENGINE ROOM - FOGGY DAWN
          
          CLOSE ON: JETS of WATER are squirting into the ENGINE ROOM,
          through cracks between RIVETED PLATES.
          
          HAYES supervises STOKERS frantically opening valves on the
          PUMPS. OLD MATTRESSES are being shoved up against the LEAKS.
          
          ENGLEHORN arrives, looking GRIM.
          
                                 ENGLEHORN
                    Hayes!
          
                              HAYES
                     he's taken a pounding ...
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    What about the prop?
          
                              HAYES
                    Shaft's not bent, far as we can tell,
                    but she's stuck hard against the rock -
          
          A LOUD GROAN as the SHIP shifts against the ROCKS.
          
          At that moment JIMMY comes bursting into the ENGINE ROOM.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Captain! You'd better come up quick!
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE DECK / OFFSHORE SKULL ISLAND - FOGGY DAWN
          
          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN, HAYES and JIMMY emerge onto the DECK as the
          MILKY LIGHT of DAWN washes over the SHIP.
          
          CLOSE ON: HERB holds the CAMERA as DENHAM cranks the HANDLE.
          
          POV: A WHALER - a small lifeboat - is being ROWED away from the
          VENTURE towards the SHORE of the ISLAND. DENHAM, JACK and ANN,
          HERB, MIKE, BRUCE and FOUR SAILORS are packed into the tiny
          boat.
          
  

          
                                                                  54.
          
                              HAYES
                    You want me to bring them back?
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    I don't give a damn about Carl Denham
                    ... I want this ship fixed and ready
                    to float on the next high tide. We're
                    leaving Mr. Hayes.
          
          
          EXT. SKULL ISLAND COAST - DAY
          
           IDE ON: The WHALER rows towards the ISLAND passing great STONE
          RUINS jutting out of the WATER. The HUGE WALL rises out of the
          WAVES and disappears INLAND.
          
           NGLE ON: DENHAM is balanced at the front of the BOAT, filming as
          the SAILORS row ashore ...
          
                              DENHAM
                             (quietly)
                    Can you believe this, Jack? ... Skull
                    Island! We got our picture!
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK as he STARES up at the RUINS ...
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN, as if COMPELLED, turns and looks over the side of
          the BOAT, into the SEA ... her breathe catches!
          
          ANN'S POV: Beneath the WATER the HIDEOUSLY, DISTORTED FACE of     a
          FALLEN STATUE gapes up at her ...
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN sitting huddled to one side of the BOAT ... drawing
          her RAIN-SLICKER closer around her ... ANN'S FINGERS edge across
          the seat and curl over JACK'S HAND ...
          
          WIND WHISTLES through the GAPING HOLES in the EDIFICE ... a CREEPY
          MOANING SOUND that mixes with the DEEP BOOM of the CRASHING WAVES
          
          
          EXT. SKULL ISLAND SHORE - DAY
          
           NGLE ON: The WHALER runs onto a tiny, stony BEACH. SHEER CLIFFS
          rise straight up from the SHORE.
          
          DENHAM, JACK, ANN, BRUCE, HERB, MIKE, PRESTON and TWO SAILORS
          clamber out.
          
          
          INT. ANCIENT STAIRCASE - DAY
          
           IDE ON: DENHAM leads HERB, PRESTON, JACK, ANN, BRUCE, MIKE   and
          the TWO SAILORS up a DARK, VAULTED TUNNEL. They look in silence at
          the primitive signs of civilisation.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN looks up the STAIRCASE nervously ... taking in the
          sight of the HUMAN SKULLS lining the walls.
          
 

          
                                                                  55.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE - DAY
          
          JIMMY looks up, hollow-eyed ... in his hand is the copy of
          "HEART OF DARKNESS". HAYES stands nearby.
          
          ANGLE ON: JIMMY closing the BOOK, an ashen expression on his
          FACE.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Why does Marlow keep going up the
                    river, why doesn't he turn back?
          
                              HAYES
                              shrugs)
                    There's a part of him that wants to,
                    Jimmy. A part, deep inside himself
                    that sounds a warning, but there's
                    another part, that needs to know ...
                    that needs to defeat the thing which
                    makes him afraid.
          
          CLOSE ON: HAYES pauses, filled with a sudden sense of DREAD.    He
          reluctantly turns, his eyes drawn to the creepy CARVED HEAD
          towering above the SHIP.
          
                              HAYES v/o
                    "We could not understand, because we
                    were too far ... and could not
                    remember, because we were travelling
                    in the night of First Ages ...
          
           LOSE ON: DENHAM obsessed ... cranking the handle of his CAMERA.
          
                              HAYES V/O (cont'd)
                    ... of those Ages that are gone,
                    leaving hardly a sign and no memories
                    ...
          
          
          INT. BURIAL CHAMBER - DAY
          
          DENHAM leads the GROUP across a RICKETY BAMBOO BRIDGE, spanning a
          section of BROKEN PATH. They pass BROKEN TOMBS, burial niches
          containing glimpses of MUMMIES.
          
          AHEAD ... DAYLIGHT streams in as they near the end of the
          STAIRCASE. They make their way over large stone blocks, caved
          in from above ... QUIET, TENSE.
          
          
          EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE/WALL - DAY
          
          THUNDER RUMBLES overhead as DENHAM, JACK, ANN, HERB, BRUCE,
          PRESTON, MIKE and 2 SAILORS clamber out of the RUINED TUNNEL
          MOUTH.
          
          DENHAM stays low, and hurries to a VANTAGE POINT. The OTHERS
          FOLLOW ...
          
        

          
                                                                     56.
          
                              HAYES V/O
                    We are accustomed to look upon the
                    shackled form of a conquered monster,
                    but there, there you could look at a
                    thing monstrous and free."
          
          CRANE UP: to reveal a PLATEAU below them, covered with the RUINS
          of an ANCIENT BURIAL GROUND ... stone MAUSOLEUMS and TOMBS,
          smashed open and destroyed.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE - DAY
          
          ANGLE ON: JIMMY closes the BOOK.
          
                               JIMMY
                             (quiet)
                    It's not an adventure story - is it,
                    Mr. Hayes.
          
                              HAYES
                             (quiet)
                    No, Jimmy, it's not.
          
          HAYES' EYES drift back to the STATUE. JIMMY follows his GAZE.
          
          
          EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE/WALL - DAY
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM as he leads the group into the village.
          
          SPREAD among the RUINS is a VILLAGE - a crude shanty town, created
          by a more recent and far less sophisticated culture ... ramshackle
          GRASS and BAMBOO HUTS.
          
          ANGLE ON: PRESTON looking around, UNNERVED ...
          
                              PRESTON
                    It's deserted ...
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM cranking the CAMERA as he rolls film on the
          VILLAGE.
                              DENHAM
                    Of course it's deserted. Use your
                    eyes, Preston. The place is a ruin!
                    Nobody's lived here for hundreds of
                    years.
          
          At the moment they hear the sound of the SOBBING of a HUMAN CHILD
          ...
          
          ANGLES ON: ANN, PRESTON, JACK, DENHAM, HERB ... not knowing if
          they heard what they just heard ...
          
          ROW UPON ROW of sharpened BAMBOO SPIKES line the top of the WALL.
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM ... His eyes suddenly widen in disbelief.
          

          
                                                                     57.
          
          ANGLE ON: A SMALL CHILD standing on the DUSTY PATH ahead of them.
          She stares up at them, with weird FERAL EYES.
          
          THE CHILD slowly raises an arm towards the watching GROUP ... in a
          pointing gesture. A suspended moment ... DENHAM steps forward.
          
                              ANN
                             (whispering)
                    Mr Denham ... I think we should go
                    back.
          
                                DENHAM
                        will handle this.
          
          DENHAM pulls a NESTLE BAR from his pocket and walks up to the
          CHILD. DENHAM waves the chocolate around.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    Look chocolate ... you like chocolate?
          
          The CHILD'S EYES drill into DENHAM. RAIN STARTS FALLING.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    Good to eat! Take it ... take it!
          
          The CHILD steps back. DENHAM grabs the CHILD by the wrist and
          attempts to press the chocolate bar into her HAND. The CHILD
          struggles and CRIES OUT!
          
                              BRUCE.
                    For Godsake, Denham, leave the native
                    alone.
          
                              JACK
                    She doesn't want the chocolate!
          
          ANGLE ON: VILLAGERS begin to melt out of the shadows, OLD PEOPLE,
          YOUNG PEOPLE, WOMEN stare HOLLOW-EYED at DENHAM as he wrestles
          with the CHILD.
          
           he CHILD sinks her TEETH into DENHAM'S WRIST. He yells, releasing
          his grip. The CHILD runs off ... in to the arms of an OLD WOMAN
          ...
          
               

                                                                  58.
          
          The GROUP starts to nervously walk forward, DENHAM gestures
          impatiently.
          
                              DENHAM
                     t's alright - it's just a bunch of
                    women and old folks ... they're
                    harmless.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN looks STARTLED as MIKE suddenly LURCHES past her.
          
                              ANN
                    Mike?
          
          MIKE turns, gasping, staring at her helplessly! And then FALLS
          face forward, a JAGGED SPEAR stuck in his BACK!
          
          ANN steps back in HORROR and SCREAMS!
          
          A RUMBLING, BESTIAL ROAR fills the VILLAGE as if in answer to
          ANN'S CRY ... LOUD and CLOSE ... for a brief moment everyone
          freezes ...
          F
           AST ACTION: NATIVE MEN emerge as if from NOWHERE ... before
          anyone can react, they are roughly SHOVED and PULLED into the
          MIDST of the FURIOUS NATIVE MOB.
          
          In the SHADOWS the agitated WOMEN of the VILLAGE start rocking and
          wailing in unison.
          
          IMAGES: STRANGE FACES, smeared with MUD ... SCREECHING MOUTHS.
          BRUCE is HELD BACK by SEVERAL NATIVES as he struggles. JACK
          pulls ANN close to him, trying to protect her. ANN is wrenched
          from him ...
          
          She struggles against her captors ...
          
          ANGLE ON: A OLD-WOMAN moves through the midst of the VILLAGERS ...
          her gaze fixed on ANN, muttering curses, eyes burning with a dark
          fury ...
          
          DENHAM is YELLING at the NATIVES ... he is SHOVED to the GROUND.
          
          The NATIVES SHRIEK. One of the SAILORS is DRAGGED forward, his
          HEAD pushed against a FLAT STONE SLAB, and CLUBBED TO DEATH.
          
          ANGLE ON: In the midst of the CONFUSION, JACK sees the          OLD
          SHA-WOMAN screaming at ANN. She starts chanting with rising
          HYSTERICS ...
          
                              SHA-WOMAN
                             (chanting)
                    Larri yu sano korê ... Kweh yonê
                    kah`weh ad-larr ... torê Kông.
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK struggles, fists flying - he is clubbed and DROPS
          like a stone.
          
          ANN SCREAMS ... the BEAST ROARS in the DISTANCE!
          
                             

          
                                                                  59.
          
          DENHAM punches a NATIVE ... they haul him forward and thrust
          his HEAD onto the BLOOD SPLATTERED STONE ... NATIVE CLUBS rise
          into the air ...
          
           .. a GUNSHOT!
          
          The NATIVES hesitate, as if STUNNED ... then SCATTER.
          
          ENGLEHORN, HAYES and an ARMED GROUP of SAILORS race into the
          VILLAGE!
          
          ENGLEHORN roughly hauls DENHAM to his feet.
          
                               ENGLEHORN
                     Seen enough?

          EXT. VENTURE - NIGHT
          
           IDE ON: As EACH WAVE hits the VENTURE, it GROANS and SCRAPES
          against the ROCKS - SHIFTING SLIGHTLY.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE DECK - NIGHT
          
           NGLE ON: ENGLEHORN, desperate ... yelling at his CREW, above the
          HOWLING WIND.
          
                               ENGLEHORN
                              (yelling)
                     Lighten the ship! Anything that's not
                     bolted down goes overboard!
          
          ANGLES ON: As WAVES crash against the STRANDED SHIP, LUMPY,
          JIMMY, CHOY and the other SAILORS throw TABLES, CHESTS ...
          KITCHEN EQUIPMENT into the SEA.
          
          
          INT.   DENHAM'S CABIN - NIGHT
          
          DENHAM is swigging from a HIP FLASK. HERB and PRESTON are gathered
          gloomily around a TABLE, while DENHAM strides around the ROOM,
          swigging and talking in a animated fashion. The STORM BATTERS and
          CRASHES outside.
          
                               DENHAM
                     We got away. We gotta be grateful for
                     that gentlemen.
          
                               PRESTON
                     What about Mike? He didn't get away -
                     he's still there!
          
                               DENHAM
                              (sharply)
                     Mike died doing what he believed in!
                     He didn't die for nothing. And I'll
                     tell you something else - I'm going to
                     finish this film - for Mike.
          
         

                                                                     60.
                    I'm going to NHAM(cont'd) donate the
                              DE finish it and

          FLAMING OIL to pour down rough CHANNELS hewn into the STONE of the

          start to TREMBLE, their canopies swaying as if PUSHED by an UNSEEN
          FORCE.
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN ... looking on with HORROR at the MOVEMENT in the

          ROCKY GROTTO, leading into the DENSE TANGLED JUNGLE of SKULL
          ISLAND.
          
          SUDDENLY ANN feels herself DRAGGED FORWARD ... the POSTS she is
          tied to are MOVING, pulling her TOWARDS the EDGE of the WALL! ANN
          digs her heels and tries to PULL AGAINST it, but is unable to stop
          herself being HAULED OFF THE WALL ...

          FRAMEWORK swings her out over the CHASM, LOWERING her towards a
          ROCK PROMONTORY on the EDGE of the FOREST.
          
           NGLE ON: ANN is LOWERED onto the ROCK PROMONTORY, which resembles
          an ALTAR ... ANN struggles to free herself, but she is tied fast
          to the posts, a TINY FIGURE illuminated by enormous GLOWING
          CARVINGS ... the WALL towering up behind her.
          
          ANGLES ON: ANN squirms ... as the FOREST BELOW HER BROILS and
          SEETHES! TREES are violently SWAYING ... above the crescendo of
          the NATIVE FRENZY, ANGRY BESTIAL ROARS can be heard.
          
          SKULL ISLANDERS line the TOP of the WALL, their WAILING and
          CHANTING interrupted by a LOUD SPLINTERING SOUND.

          ANN catches a BRIEF GLIMPSE of a HUGE DARK SHAPE propelling itself
          THROUGH the JUNGLE ... the OILY SMOKE from the FIRES hangs in the
          air, OBSCURING HER VISION ... she can now only hear the CREATURE'S
          MOVEMENTS and BREATH as it draws ever closer.
          
          ANN cowers back, pulling at her bonds.
          
          A MASSIVE SHAPE moves through the air ... The ground SHAKES with a
          sudden force of IMPACT!
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN stands trembling, as the swirling smokey cloud
          slowly DISSIPATES ... a GIANT LEATHERY FOOT is visible.
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN balanced on a knife-edge of TERROR.

          A SUDDEN PUFF OF WIND INSTANTLY CLEARS THE VEILING SMOKE.
          
          ANN slowly LOOKS UP, her face filled with DREAD.
          
          The SKULL ISLANDERS reply in UNISON ... a piercing WAIL, from the
          TOP of the WALL.
          
          ANN'S strength suddenly DRAINS from her legs, and SLUMPS between
          the POSTS.
          
          Before her is ... KONG!
          
          A 25 FOOT TALL MALE GORILLA! KONG stares at ANN for a beat,
          leaning forward on his KNUCKLES ... then prods her with his
          finger.
          
          SUDDENLY ... GUNSHOTS!

          bonds.
          
              DEAFENING ROAR!
          
          ANN SCREAMS!
          
          CLUTCHING her tightly, KONG carries ANN away from the ALTAR.
          
          
          EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE/WALL - NIGHT
          
          FRENZIED MOVEMENT: SAILORS, lead by ENGLEHORN, race into the
          VILLAGE firing WARNING SHOTS in the air ... SKULL ISLANDERS
          SCATTER in TERROR ...
          
          ANGLES ON: The SKULL ISLANDERS melt away into the darkness ...
          vanishing as fast as they appeared.
          
          ... from behind the WALL, the DISTANT CRY of ANN screaming for
          help, following by an EARTH SHUDDERING ROAR.
          
                                ENGLEHORN
                               (staring upwards)
                      What in God's name was that?
          
                                JACK
                               (sudden realisation)
                      Behind the wall!
          
         

          
                                                                     67.
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK rushes to the BASE of the WALL and begins to climb
          ...
          
          DENHAM hurries to the massive, heavily fortified gate.
          C
           LOSE ON: DENHAM staring through the LATTICE WORK of sharpened
          bamboo ...
          
          DENHAM'S POV: A fleeting glimpse of KONG disappearing into the
          depths of the jungle. In his HUGE FIST KONG clutches ANN!
          
          
          EXT. TOP OF WALL - NIGHT
          
           NGLE ON: JACK has reached the top of the WALL ... he races to the
          EDGE peering over it. Nothing ... only the primitive ALTAR, and
          beyond, DARK JUNGLE dissolving into BLACKNESS.
          
          JACK'S POV: The EMPTY ROPES binding ANN'S WRISTS swing from the
          ALTAR POSTS.
          
                                JACK
                               (disbelief)

           ACK is hurrying down from the WALL.
          
                                JACK
                      She's gone!
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM in SHOCK ... his mind racing, fuelled by FEAR.
          Gradually his breathing slows and another part of his brain kicks
          into gear.
          
          JACK makes brief eye contact with DENHAM, who quickly looks away.
          
                                JACK (cont'd)
                      Carl? What is it?
                               (realizing)
                      You saw something ...
          
          LATER ...
          
          ANGLE ON: BOXES of AMMUNITION and GUNS have been brought up      from
          the beach. Lids are prised open ... AMMO distributed.
          
          DENHAM is surrounded by JACK, ENGLEHORN and the SAILORS.
          
                                ENGLEHORN
                      You can take Hayes and fifteen others.
                      I'll put a guard on the gate until you
                      return ... The rest of you, stay with
                      the ship.
          
          JACK grabs his PACK and WALKS away TOWARDS THE GATE, with LUMPY &
          JIMMY following.
          
           

                                                                  68.
          
                              HAYES
                    Not you, Jimmy.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Com'on Mr. Hayes, look at `em. None of
                    them knows a which way to point a gun.
          
          HAYES takes the RIFLE out of JIMMY'S HANDS.
          
                                 HAYES
                    Stay here.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Miss Darrow needs me!
          
                                 HAYES
                    No!
          
          CLOSE ON: JIMMY, crestfallen.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM by the CAMERA BOXES with HERB and PRESTON.
          
                              DENHAM
                             (quietly)
                    Bring the tripod - and all of the film
                    stock.
          
                              HERB
                    You wanna go with the six inch lens?
          
                              DENHAM
                    The wide angle will do just fine.
          
          CLOSE ON: PRESTON slings the FILM STOCK BAG over his SHOULDER.

          ANGLE ON: JACK, PRESTON, HAYES, LUMPY, CHOY, BRUCE and 8 SAILORS
          as ENGLEHORN surveys the GROUP. DENHAM and HERB are HAULING CAMERA
          EQUIPMENT.
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    You got guns, you got food, you got
                    ammo. You got twenty-four hours.
          
                              BRUCE
                    Twenty-four hours?
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    This time tomorrow we haul anchor.
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK ... as he slings his GUN on his shoulder, turns
          and HEADS through the GATE.
          
          
          EXT. SKULL ISLAND JUNGLE -     NIGHT
          
          WIDE ON: The VOLCANIC ROCKS form a JAGGED, TORTURED LANDSCAPE of
          DEEP CREVASSES and TOWERING CLIFFS. The vegetation is THICK, the
          JUNGLE DARK. ANCIENT GNARLED TREES twist out of the ground, thick
          LICHEN and long MOSSES hang from branches and TANGLED VINES. STEAM
          RISES from festering SWAMPS ...
          
  

          
          
                                                                  69.
          
          HAYES is LEADING DENHAM, JACK, PRESTON, LUMPY, CHOY, BRUCE and
          EIGHT SAILORS. HERB is limping along with the heavy CAMERA on his
          shoulder.
          
          The atmosphere is TENSE ... unseen creatures scurry in the
          darkness, fleeing from the approaching humans.
          
          HAYES puts his hands up ... the GROUP stops ... a STRANGE, LOW
          MOAN echoes from the SURROUNDING JUNGLE ... The MEN stare into the
          darkness ... watchful, on edge ...
          
          
          EXT. KILLING GROUND - NIGHT
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN in KONG'S HAND, being tossed around like a rag doll
          as KONG RUNS through the FOREST.
          
           NGLE ON: KONG propels himself through the JUNGLE with EASE,
          barely disturbing the forest, moving with GRACE along a well used
          route.
          
           LOSE ON: ANN held fast in his GRIP. She is FLUNG wildly around as
          KONG BOUNDS across CHASMS, LEAPING over rivers.
          
          ANN'S FEVERED POV: The JUNGLE SPINNING and BLURRING by. She tries
          to brace herself against KONG'S FINGERS, but the rigors of the
          journey knock her sideways like a RAG DOLL.
          
          WIDE ON: SHAFTS of MOONLIGHT play on the faces of grotesque
          STATUES set into a MOSSY CLIFF.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN clutched tightly in KONG'S HAND. She is rigid with
          FEAR. KONG squats down ... he LOOKS CLOSELY at ANN.
          
          CLOSE ON: KONG ... we see him clearly for the first time. A very
          old, brutish BULL GORILLA. Years of survival have left SCARS on
          his face. One EYE LID is mangled and his JAW is CROOKED ...
          leaving a huge yellowed INCISOR TOOTH jutting up.
          
          KONG stares at ANN ... she dare not move; only her RAPID BREATHING
          belies her INNER TERROR.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN is suddenly swung UPSIDE DOWN and SHAKEN ... the
          ceremonial NECKLACE falls from ANN'S NECK.

          CLOSE ON: ANN'S HORRIFIED FACE ... she sees HUMAN REMAINS amongst
          the NECKLACES! Bones ... skulls! A WHIMPERING SOUND escapes from
          the back of her throat.
          
          SWIRLING UPSIDE DOWN POV: The NECKLACE lands on the ground - amid
          DOZENS of OTHER NECKLACES littering the clearing.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN is lifted UPWARDS ... KONG'S LIPS curl in a low,
          slow SNARL.
          
          ANN looks at KONG, aghast, and in this moment her heightened sense
          of FEAR gives way to something more fundamental: SELF
          PRESERVATION!
          

          
                                                                   70.
          
          KONG'S FINGERS start to OPEN - ANN seizes her chance! She suddenly
          PROPELS herself off his HAND! ANN DROPS 12 feet and lands heavily
          at KONG'S FEET. She rolls amongst grinning HUMAN SKULLS and LEG
          BONES ... staggers to her feet and RUNS!
          
          KONG rises up with a ROAR, but ANN is already disappearing into
          the JUNGLE!
          
          
          EXT. DENSE JUNGLE - NIGHT
          
            NGLES ON: ANN desperately powering through the DENSE UNDERGROWTH.
          She throws herself over huge FALLEN LOGS, through TANGLED VINES.
          .
          She GLANCES BACK ...
          
           .. TREES are FALLING, KONG is smashing through the undergrowth
          after her!
          
          ANGLE ON: With surprising AGILITY and GRACE, KONG sweeps down from
          above and SCOOPS ANN off the ROCK. She barely has time to CRY OUT
          before being CARRIED AWAY, as KONG disappears into the DEPTHS of
          the ISLAND.
          
          
          EXT. TANGLED VINES - NIGHT
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK ... hearing ANN'S DISTANT SCREAMS!
          
                              JACK
                    Ann!
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK starts RUNNING towards the SOUND. DENHAM and the
          OTHERS follow ... JACK is barging through THICK TANGLED
          VEGETATION, which is growing between huge moss covered FALLEN
          COLUMNS.
          
          KONG'S ENRAGED ROAR echos through the JUNGLE.

           ONG LEAPS ACROSS CHASMS as he CARRIES ANN through the JUNGLE.
          
          
          EXT. KILLING GROUND - DAWN
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK picks up ANN'S NECKLACE ... a LOCK of BLONDE    HAIR
          still tangled within it's STRANDS ...
          

          
                                                                  71.
          
          WIDE ON: DAWN LIGHT brightens the SKY as the GROUP survey the
          KILLING GROUND.
          
                              LUMPY
                    Christ! It's a bleeding bone yard!
                             (horrified realization)
                    They've been ripped limb from limb.
          
                                 JACK

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM casts an eye over the DEBRIS STREWN GROUND ...
          his gaze rising to a HUGE GASH in the FOREST ...
          
          DENHAM POV: TREES have been RIPPED from the earth where KONG    has
          SMASHED a path through the JUNGLE ...
          
          ANGLE ON: HAYES notices a SAILOR with a WOOLLEN HAT pulled   down
          over his head ... the SAILOR has turned away from the GRISLY
          REMAINS. HAYES bats the hat off the SAILOR'S HEAD ... it's JIMMY.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Just keep walking, Mr. Hayes. Pretend
                    you didn't see me.
          
                              HAYES
                     esus, Jimmy!
          
          HAYES snatches the GUN off him ...

                              defiant)
                    Hey! I need that!
          
                              HAYES
                             (angry)
                    I'm not giving you a gun!
          
                              JIMMY
                    You were younger than me when they
                    gave you one!
          
                              HAYES
                    I was in the army. I was trained - I
                    had a drill sergeant!
          
          CLOSE ON: JIMMY looks at HAYES.

                    I just wanna help bring her back.
          
          HAYES's expression softens. He hands the gun back to JIMMY.
          
                              HAYES
                    Don't make me regret it.

          EXT. ROUGH TERRAIN - DAY
          
          ANGLE ON: The GROUP'S NERVES are FRAYED ... as they continue
          slogging through the difficult TERRAIN. HUGE INSECTS fly around
          them, AND THE GROUP try in vain to SWAT them away.

          ANGLE ON: SLIDING FEET ... down a VINE strewn slope.
          
           ULL BACK to reveal ... the GROUP have emerged from the JUNGLE
          into a NARROW VALLEY, deep in the heart of SKULL ISLAND ... The
          VALLEY is less than 75 feet wide, flanked by sheer CLIFFS.
          
          JACK looks up and down the VALLEY ... he wipes his brow ..    the
          SUN is high, it is hot out of the SHADE.
          
          ANGLE ON: LUMPY stumbling forward with a hacking SMOKER'S COUGH.
          
                              LUMPY
                    I'm knackered! I've gotta have a

          LUMPY flops down on the ground, and grabs a cigarette from behind
          his ear and lights up.
          
          JACK watches as OTHER SAILORS follow suit.
          
                              JACK
                    Hey fellas - we don't have time for
                    this. We've lost too much ground
                    already! Come on, - get up!

                              HAYES
                             (quiet)
                    They're not about to quit on you. Cut
                    them some slack.
          
          JACK stares at HAYES and then sighs, resigned.
          
          HAYES calls to the MEN ...
          
                              HAYES (cont'd)
                    Alright, you got five minutes!
                    Everybody stay in sight!
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM grabs the CAMERA from HERB. Nearby PRESTON sets
          up the TRIPOD.
          

                                                                     73.
          
                              DENHAM
                             (hushed)
                    Over here. I wanna get a wide shot of
                    the valley.
          
           NGLE ON: DENHAM as he arrives at the top of the SLOPE, he       turns
          at the sound of a STRANGE NOISE ...
          
          PUSH IN: ON DENHAM ... a look of AMAZEMENT dawning on his FACE.
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK kneels down and stares at an unmistakable     indent
          in the sand: a GIANT FOOTPRINT!
          
                              LUMPY
                    Bloody Nora!
          
          JACK looks up to see SAILORS gathering around.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Is that what took Miss Darrow?
          
                              LUMPY
                             (sagely)
                    There's only one creature capable of
                    leaving a footprint that size ...
          
          ALL look up at LUMPY ...
          
                              LUMPY (cont'd)
                    The abominable snowman!
          
          A ripple of FEAR spreads throughout the CROWD.
          
          The RATTLED SAILORS mutter agreement. There is random chatter of
          turning back.
          
          HAYES kneels down beside JACK ...
          
                               HAYES
                             (quiet)
                    It's gotta be - what? Twenty - twenty-
                    five feet?
          
                              JACK
                             (grimly)
                    Carl saw it. Let's ask him.
          
          HAYES looks over his SHOULDER ...
          
                                  HAYES
                    Denham!
                              no answer)
                    Where'd he go?
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK walking up the VALLEY.
          
                                  JACK
                    Carl!!!
          
              

          
                                                                     74.
          
          WIDE ON: DENHAM, BRUCE and HERB arrive at the TOP of the VALLEY
          A
          ... they stare transfixed at a HERD of grazing BRONTOSAURS.
          
           NGLE ON: DENHAM is cranking the CAMERA ...
          
                              DENHAM
                              low)
                    Walk forward, Bruce.
          
                                 BRUCE
                    What?!
          
          ANGLE ON: a HERD of TWELVE BRONTOSAURS are slowly moving through a
          WIDE CLEARING ahead.
          
                              DENHAM
                    You're the star of this picture! Get
                    into character and head towards the
                    animals.
          
          ANGLE ON: BRUCE nervously SHUFFLES forward ...
          
                               BRUCE
                    What the hell kind of place is this?
                              (beat)
                    Are you sure about this, Denham???
                    Don't we have a stand-in for this type
                    of thing?
          
                              DENHAM
                      need you in the shot, or people will
                    say they're fake.
          
                              BRUCE
                    Nobody's gonna think these are fake!
          
          SUDDEN flash of MOVEMENT! CARNOTAURS are circling the HERD.
          
          ANGLE ON: the BRONTOSAUR HERD looking EDGY and RESTLESS!
          
                              DENHAM
                     ou're making them nervous! No sudden
                    movement.
          
                              BRUCE
                    I'm not moving.
          
          A LOW RUMBLING SOUND can now be heard ... the GROUND starts to
          SHAKE ...
          
          PUSH IN: on BRUCE as he realizes what is about to HAPPEN!
          
                              BRUCE (cont'd)
                             (under his breath)
                    Mother of God ...
          
          ANGLE ON: BRUCE suddenly turns and runs!
          
          ANGLE ON: HERB is starting to get NERVOUS as DENHAM determinedly
          continues filming ...
          
                                                                  75.
          
          WIDE ON: A sudden FALL of ROCKS ... Jack looks up!
          
          ANGLE ON: The MEN look NERVOUS as the GROUND starts to TREMBLE
          beneath their feet!
          
          JACK turns and sees: BRUCE running down the hill ...
          
                              JACK
                    What is it?! Where's Carl?
          
          BRUCE slows down, attempting to appear CALM.
          
                              BRUCE
                    He's - he's ... um ... well, he's up
                    there ... filming.
          
          A LOUD ROAR!
          
          BRUCE bolts like a STARTLED RABBIT!
          
          SEVERAL nervous SAILORS jump up and start running.
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK cautiously moves uphill towards the source of the
          LOUD RUMBLING SOUND.
          A
           NGLE ON: DENHAM and HERB appear on the brow of the HILL. They are
          running flat out towards JACK!
          
          Seconds later a HERD of BRONTOSAURUS stampede down the hill after
          DENHAM and HERB!
          
                                DENHAM
                    Run Jack!
          
                              JACK
                    Holy Christ!
          
                              HAYES
                             (yelling)
                    Go Jimmy - Run!
          
          EVERYONE TURNS and FLEES!
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK running ... he looks back and sees DENHAM trip and
          fall!
          
          The STAMPEDING DINOSAURS storm towards DENHAM down the NARROW
          VALLEY!
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM is frozen to the spot, staring at the CAMERA,
          which is lying directly in the rampaging DINOSAUR'S PATH.
          
          JACK turns back ... he attempts to drag DENHAM to his FEET, as
          DENHAM struggles to grab hold of the CAMERA and TRIPOD.
          
                              JACK
                    Leave it!!!
          
                                DENHAM
                    No!!!
          

          
                                                                  76.
          
          DENHAM and JACK scramble to their feet and start to RUN!   DENHAM
          cradles the CAMERA and TRIPOD in his ARMS, as the   BRONTO PACK
          bears down on them from behind!
          
          Spectacular TRACKING SHOT: ... The PACK of 15 CARNOTAURS are
          CLOSING IN on the BRONTOSAURUS HERD! A CARNOTAUR leaps onto the
          back of a FLEEING BRONTOSAUR, causing it to falter and slide
          against the cliff. TWO MORE CARNOTAURS leap onto the ailing
          BRONTOSAUR as the rest of the pack stream past.
          
          DENHAM, JACK and the OTHERS are running as fast as they can ...
          JACK glances over his shoulder - the WALL of THUNDERING BRONTOSAUR
          LEGS are about to ENGULF THEM!
          A
           NGLE ON: JACK and DENHAM suddenly find themselves in a SEA of
          HUGE LEGS - like wildly pounding Redwood tree trunks! The
          CARNOTAURS are snapping and snarling at the LEGS ... they see the
          MEN! Their only hope of survival is to stay WITHIN THE STAMPEDE,
          out of reach of the MEATEATERS!
          
          QUICK IMAGES: THE GROUP in the SEA of LEGS ... a SAILOR trips and
          is CRUSHED UNDERFOOT. A COUPLE OF SAILORS jump clear of the
          BRONTOSAURS - only to be set on by the CARNOTAURS. JACK ... DENHAM
          ... SAILORS ... everyone is running madly, dodging BRONTOSAURS,
          CARNOTAURS and trying not to fall!
          
          A CARNOTAUR focuses on JACK ... it skillfully weaves IN BETWEEN
          and UNDER the BRONTOSAURS and emerges right behind JACK, it's
          SNAPPING JAWS inches away from his head!
          
           ACK suddenly SIDE-STEPS, and SHOULDER-BARGES the CARNOTAUR
          SIDEWAYS - under a BRONTOSAUR'S LEGS. The CARNOTAUR is instantly
          trampled!
          
          BRUCE is managing to stay ahead of the stampede - possibly RUNNING
          FASTER than any human before him! A CARNOTAUR races out in front
          of the stampede and bears down on BRUCE with incredible speed!
          BRUCE desperately waves a TOMMY GUN at the CARNOTAUR ... TOWARDS
          THE STAMPEDE!
          
          JACK sees it coming ...
          
                              JACK
                             (yelling)
                    No!!!!
          
          BRUCE FIRES, missing the CARNOTAUR ...
          
          ... but he hits the LEAD BRONTOSAUR, following behind, in the
          chest. The BRONTOSAUR COLLAPSES AT TOP SPEED! It CARTWHEELS OVER,
          it's huge NECK and TAIL thrashing out. The OTHER BRONTOSAURS
          PLOUGH INTO IT, tripping and rolling!
          
          JACK and the SAILORS suddenly find themselves in the middle of an
          amazing FLESHY FREIGHT TRAIN PILE-UP! SAILORS are crushed as
          BRONTOSAURS come down on top of them! A CARNOTAUR is squashed when
          TWO BRONTOSAURS slam together.
          
          JACK rolls against a rock as MOUNTAINS of BRONTOSAUR TUMBLE all
          around him.
          
                           

          
                                                                   77.
          
          DENHAM throws himself onto the ground, shielding the CAMERA.
          
            n the space of seconds, the MIGHTY HERD OF BEHEMOTHS is reduced
          to a VAST PILE of DEAD or WOUNDED ANIMALS ... The CARNOTAURS
          immediately go to work, leaping onto BRONTOSAURS, ripping into
          fleshy stomachs.
          J
           ACK crawls past huge HEAVING BELLIES and TWITCHING LEGS ... he
          staggers out of the DINOSAUR PILE-UP ... he turns back at the
          SOUND OF LOUD HISSING - a CARNOTAURUS is climbing over a DEAD
          BRONTOSAUR, it's gleaming eyes intent on JACK. The CARNOTAURUS
          leaps ...
          
          BAM! BAM! BAM! The CARNOTAURUS is riddled with BULLETS and falls
          DEAD at JACK'S FEET!
          
          HAYES hurries towards JACK, clutching his TOMMY GUN!
          
                               HAYES
                              (yelling)
                    Go! Go!
          
          HAYES sends the rest of the MEN up a steep ROCKY SLOPE ... they
          SLIP and SLIDE on the SLIMY MOSS-COVERED ROCKS.
          
          JACK doesn't move. He looks around in mounting panic.
          
                              JACK
                             (frantic)
                    Carl!? Carl?! Get up!
          
          DENHAM limps out of the PILE-UP, bloodied and covered in DUST -
          the CAMERA in his arms.
          
          HAYES blasts at another CARNOTAURUS - it TOPPLES BACKWARDS.
          
                               HAYES
                    Run!
          
          
          EXT. SLIMY SLOPE - DAY
          
          The GROUP are desperately scrambling up the STEEP ROCKY SLOPE -
          slipping and sliding on the WET MOSS ... FOUR SURVIVING CARNOTAURS
          follow in pursuit ... the MEN start sliding backwards in their
          panic. The CARNOTAURS are sliding too, but their powerful legs are
          working furiously, propelling them closer and closer to the
          flailing SAILORS!
          
          A SAILOR loses his footing completely ... he rolls past TWO
          CARNOTAURS before being grabbed by the JAWS of the THIRD.
          
          The MEN grab hold of WEEDS, ROCKS ... ANYTHING, to get away from
          the DINOSAURS. They are crawling towards a network of NARROW
          FISSURES between HUGE ROCKS ... which the CARNOTAURS cannot
          squeeze through.
          
          ANGLE ON: HERB is scrabbling up as best as he can with his bad leg
          ... DENHAM moves towards him, reaching desperately ...
          

                                                                  78.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Herb! Come on!
          
                              HERB
                             (gasping)
                    Mr Denham ... ! Take the tripod.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Come on Herb - I'm pulling you up.
                    Come on, hold on to your end.
          
                              HERB
                             (gasping)
                    You gotta go!!
          
                              DENHAM
                    I'm not going anywhere without you!
          
                              HERB
                    You gotta leave me!
          
          HERB is straining to hold the TRIPOD when his GAMMY LEG gives way
          ... he SLIPS and ROLLS into the path of an oncoming CARNOTAUR!
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM reacting in SHOCK as HERB is KILLED by the
          frenzying CARNOTAURS.
          
          
          EXT. JUNGLE RUINS - DAY
          
          ANGLE ON: KONG drops ANN onto the ground. She LANDS in a LIFELESS
          heap.
          
          KONG has dropped ANN in a small RUINED COURTYARD, it's WALLS are
          cracked and split by encroaching JUNGLE CREEPERS.
          
           IDE ON: KONG circles around ANN who lies MOTIONLESS on the
          GROUND. He PRODS her ROUGHLY with a FINGER ... no response.   KONG
          GROWLS ... PRODS AGAIN ... ANN lies STILL.
          
           LOSE ON: ANN ... she slowly OPENS HER EYES! ANN looks warily
          towards KONG.
          
          
          EXT. EDGE OF SWAMP - DAY
          
           ACK, DENHAM, HAYES, BRUCE, JIMMY, LUMPY, CHOY and PRESTON clamber
          down a JAGGED ROCK face into lush sub-tropical VEGETATION. They
          are followed by a few surviving SAILORS - a bedraggled GROUP ...
          CUT, BRUISED, COVERED in DUST, SOAKED in SWEAT. Most of the GUNS
          are lost.
          
           AILORS slump to the ground, EXHAUSTED.
          
          They are on a NARROW CLEARING at the edge of a MISTY SWAMP. SHEER
          CLIFFS rise out of the SWAMP on both sides of the SHORE.
          
                              HAYES
                    Jimmy, do a head count. I wanna know
                    how many injured and how bad -
          
                                                                  79.
          
                              LUMPY
                             (interrupting)
                    Injured? Four of us are dead!
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM reaches with a trembling hand for his HIP FLASK.
          He takes a big SWIG ... and stands staring out over the SWAMP.
          PRESTON sits on A TREE STUMP nearby.

                               PRESTON
                    It's not your fault. What happened to
                    Herb - it's no ones fault.
          
                              DENHAM
                             (soft realization)
                    You're absolutely right, Preston ...
                    And I'll tell you something else.
                    Herbert didn't die for nothing. He
                    died for what he believed in and I'm
                    gonna honour that.
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM reaching for that moment of self justification.
          
                               DENHAM (cont'd)
                    He died believing there is still some
                    mystery left in this world - and we
                    can all have a piece of it - for the
                    price of an admission ticket!
                              (excited)
                    Goddammit Preston we're gonna finish
                    this film for Herb. We'll finish it,
                    and donate the proceeds to his wife
                    and kids.
          
          CLOSE ON: PRESTON, he has heard this all before.
          
          WIDE ON: BRUCE stands amongst the SEATED SAILORS.
          
                              BRUCE
                             (desperate)
                    We gotta get back to the ship.
                    Englehorn sails in nine hours.
          
                              JIMMY
                    So? We gotta find Miss Darrow.
          
                              BRUCE
                    Hey, did you hear me? We're gonna be
                    stranded here!
          
          BRUCE becomes aware of JACK staring at him COLDLY. BRUCE self
          consciously clears his THROAT.
          
                              BRUCE (cont'd)
                    Miss Darrow was a great gal - no
                    question. She was a wonderful person.
                    It's a terrible loss. We're all gonna
                    miss her.
          

          
                                                                   80.
          
                              JACK
                    I always knew you were nothing like
                    the tough guy you play on screen - I
                    just never figured you for a coward.
          
                               BRUCE
                    Hey, pal, wake up. Heroes don't look
                    like me - not in the real world. In
                    the real world they've got bad teeth,
                    a bald spot and a beer gut ... be
                    seeing ya.
          
          BRUCE walks off. HAYES turns to the rest of the GROUP.
          
                              HAYES
                    Anyone else?
          
          A couple of SAILORS shuffle forward towards BRUCE.
          
          
          EXT. JUNGLE RUINS - DAY
          
          WIDE ON: KONG SITS on the EDGE of a RUIN, surveying the JUNGLE.
          
          He SITS with his BACK to ANN, in the crumbling remains of an
          enclosed ENTRY AREA ... which also provides the only way out.
          
           ith a splintering rip, KONG pulls off one of the DINOSAUR'S LEGS
          and starts EATING it.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN, having feigned unconsciousness, she now cautiously
          searches for a way to escape.
          C
           LOSE ON: ANN LIFTING HER HEAD, risking a quick look around. The
          WALLS are TOO STEEP to attempt an escape ...
          
          ... but there is a NARROW STAIRWAY across the COURTYARD, leading
          down into the JUNGLE.
          
          INCH by INCH ANN starts to EDGE FORWARD, CRAWLING on her STOMACH
          towards the STAIRS. KONG is CHEWING NOISILY ... he SHIFTS HIS
          WEIGHT, half turning ... ANN FREEZES.
          
           ONG GLANCES at ANN, who has resumed her LIFELESS POSE. KONG
          doesn't appear to notice she's moved several feet. He continues
          EATING ...
          
          ANN again starts to EDGE FORWARD ... she is STARTLED when some
          CREEPY INSECTS swarm out of a CRACK in the FLAGSTONES, inches from
          her FACE!
          
          With only a few feet left to go, ANN quietly rises and scurries
          towards the STAIRWAY. She clambers into the NARROW PASSAGE -
          finally out of KONG'S SIGHT! Glancing back over her shoulder, ANN
          hurries down the STAIRWAY towards FREEDOM!
          

                                                                  81.
          
          
          EXT. BOTTOM OF STAIRWAY/JUNGLE - DAY
          
          ANN pauses at the BOTTOM of the STAIRS, listening for sounds of
          KONG. All is QUIET ... she glances back up the stairs ... no sign
          of him there ...
          
          ... gathering all her strength ANN emerges from the PASSAGE and
          makes a bold run across the CLEARING towards the cover of the
          JUNGLE!
          
          THUD! KONG'S FIST SLAMS DOWN in FRONT of ANN!
          
          She GASPS and tries to change direction ... THUD! Another FIST
          blocks her way. KONG GROWLS ANGRILY!
          
          ANN swings around and FACES KONG ... he SNARLS at HER, FURIOUS and
          DEADLY.
          
           NGLE ON: ANN suddenly ducks under KONG'S ARM and makes a last
          ditch attempt to escape! She is half way across the clearing when
          she TRIPS and FALLS!
          
           NGLE ON: KONG bounds over to ANN, SLAPPING his HANDS on the
          GROUND in a frenzy of excitement - he utters a GUTTERAL SQUEAL.
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN, flat on the ground, eyes shut, lying still.
          
          ANGLE ON: KONG .. circling around ANN, SUSPICIOUS. He PRODS her a
          couple of times ...no response. KONG moves on ... ANN'S EYES flick
          OPEN! At that moment KONG doubles back - CATCHING her out!
          
          ... ANN SPRINGS UP, looks at KONG for a desperate moment, wonders
          if she should run, decides she'll never make it ... and takes
          another PRATFALL!!

          KONG cocks his HEAD! He GRIMACES, baring his teeth and CIRCLES
          her.
          
          ANN repeats the COMIC FALL! KONG SLAPS his HANDS on the GROUND,
          SHAKES his HEAD and GROWLS.
          
          ANN starts to draw upon her VAUDEVILLE ROUTINE, swaying drunkenly
          and falling, then bouncing back up ... working her timing around
          KONG'S reactions - he grows increasingly ENGAGED.
          
           NGLE ON: ANN BOUNCES UP ... PANTING ... BEADS of SWEAT trickle
          down her face. Her EYES dart between the JUNGLE and KONG, she's
          looking for her chance ...
          
          ... but KONG is a DEMANDING audience. He wants more ... he wants
          ANN to fall down again.
          
          KONG PRODS ANN ROUGHLY, knocking her OFF HER FEET. She FALLS to
          the GROUND ... WINDED.
          
          KONG slaps his hands on the GROUND, and lets out another EXCITED
          GROWL. He thumps the GROUND with his FISTS, and SHAKES his HEAD,
          delighted with the GAME.
          

          
                                                                   82.
          
          ANN tries to get up - KONG pushes her over again! This time she
          stays on the GROUND, breathing HEAVILY.
          
           HUMP! THUMP! THUMP! KONG wants more! He tries to PROD ANN into
          getting up and is STARTLED when she HITS his FINGER AWAY!
          
                              ANN
                             (gasping)
                    No! I said no!
          
          KONG cocks his HEAD ... he THUMPS his FISTS on the GROUND.
          
           HUMP! THUMP! THUMP!
          
                               ANN (cont'd)
                              (gasping)
                    That's all there is ... there isn't
                    any more.
          
          KONG RISES TO HIS FEET, and BEATS his CHEST, towering over ANN.
          
          His HUGE FIST rises into the air and comes SLAMMING DOWN straight
          TOWARDS ANN!
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN shuts her eyes ... KONG'S FIST THUDS into the ground
          inches away from her.
          
          THUD! Another FIST SLAMS into the GROUND!
          
          ANGLE ON: KONG ROARS and beats his chest in a dramatic display of
          ANGER and FRUSTRATION. He rips a TREE from the ground as his ANGER
          spirals into violent MADNESS.
          
            LOSE ON: ANN as the GROUND SHAKES with the fury of his RAGE. For
          a brief moment KONG and ANN lock in EYE CONTACT!
          C
           LOSE ON: KONG stares at the small figure in his hand who is
          waiting for DEATH to come.
          
          In this moment an UNFAMILIAR feeling wells inside him ... a half
          formed emotion he hasn't experienced much in his long life: he
          feels a connection to this tiny creature.
          
          The SPARK of RAGE goes out in KONG'S EYES ...
          
          KONG stares at ANN as a confusion of feelings wash over him.
          
           ONG pulls back from ANN ... overcome by sudden UNCERTAINTY. He
          knows only that she has somehow disarmed him ... and this has in
          turn, DIMINISHED his power.
          
          KONG starts to BACK AWAY from ANN - slowly at first, until DOUBT
          and FEAR compel him to move faster. Suddenly he turns away.
          
          ANN watches as KONG lopes off. He pulls himself up and over a
          RUINED WALL and DISAPPEARS from SIGHT.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN, rising to her feet, finally free of her captor.
          

          
                                                                  83.
          
          
          EXT. THICK JUNGLE - DAY
          
           NGLE ON: ANN hurrying through the JUNGLE ... pushing THROUGH
          thorns, TANGLED in VINES ... she is EXHAUSTED, THIRSTY.
          
          
          EXT. LOG CHASM - DAY
          
           IDE ANGLE: DENHAM, JACK, HAYES, LUMPY, JIMMY, PRESTON and the
          remaining CREW have arrived at a DARK, VINE ENTANGLED CHASM ...
          spanning the narrow, but deadly RAVINE is a SINGLE FALLEN TREE.
          
          WEAK SUNLIGHT filters through the DARK CANOPY above casting a
          SICKLY GREEN HUE over the place.
          
           IDE ON: HAYES, followed by JIMMY, leads the GROUP across the
          SLIMY, MOSS covered LOG ... the going is treacherous.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM struggling with the CAMERA ... JACK follows HAYES
          ... LUMPY helps CHOY. They put one foot in front of the other,
          trying not to let the DROP unnerve them.
          
          ANGLE ON: HAYES suddenly stops ... tensely scanning the DARK RUINS
          on the other side of the CHASM ...
          
          CREEPY POV: ... something is watching the MEN on the LOG.
                               J

                             (low voice)
                    What is it?
          
          HAYES motions for JIMMY to be quiet. He stares intently into    the
          DARKNESS of the FOREBODING RUINS.
          
                              JIMMY (cont'd)
                             (whispering)
                    Mr. Hayes ...?
          
          HAYES turns and looks at JIMMY.
          
                              HAYES
                    If anything happens, I want you to
                    run! Understand?
          
                              JIMMY
                    I'm not a coward - I ain't gonna run.
          
                              HAYES
                             (gently)
                    It's not about being brave, Jimmy.
          
          CLOSE ON: JIMMY looking at HAYES uneasily, as he continues across
          the LOG.
          
          
          EXT. FAR EDGE OF CHASM - DAY
          
           NGLE ON: HAYES is the first to step off the LOG, to the safety of
          the FAR BANK.
          

          
                                                                  84.
          
          Ahead, some RUINS have collapsed, creating a LONG DARK TUNNEL.
          
          CLOSE ON: HAYES ... peers into the DARKNESS of the TUNNEL.
          
          ANGLE ON: A PAIR of GLEAMING EYES, reflecting LIGHT ... rushing
          towards HAYES.
          
                              HAYES
                     o back! Back across the log!
          
          The GROUP on the LOG FREEZE, start to BACK AWAY, slipping and
          sliding on the WET MOSS.

                    I ain't gonna run.
          
                              HAYES
                    Get Jimmy out of here.
          
          ANGLE ON: HAYES... SHOOTS into the DARKNESS of the TUNNEL.
          
          KONG rampages out of the TUNNEL MOUTH! He SNATCHES HAYES with one
          SWEEP of his HAND.
          
          CLOSE ON: HAYES in KONG's HAND ...
          
           IMMY yells! KONG's GAZE turns toward the MEN on the LOG!
          
                              JIMMY
                    No! Let him go!
                             (to HAYES)
                    Kill him! Kill him!
          
                              HAYES
                             (to KONG)
                    Look at me! Look at me!
          
                              JIMMY
                             (desperate)
                    Bring him down! Mr Hayes!
          
          SLOWLY HAYES begins to lift his PISTOL up ... KONG's GAZE locks
          back on HAYES ...
          
                              HAYES
                              deadly calm)
                    You've gotta run, Jimmy.
          
                               IMMY
                    No! I ain't gonna run.
          
                               HAYES
                    Do as I say.
                              (to JIMMY)
                    G
                      o with Jack ... All of you.
          
          KONG stares at HAYES a BEAT ... HAYES suddenly raises his PISTOL
          at KONG to shoot!
          

                                                                  85.
          
                              HAYES (cont'd)
                    Run!
          
          ANGLE ON: KONG HURLS HAYES at the SAILORS ... he flies over their
          heads like RAG-DOLL and smashes against the FAR WALL of the RAVINE
          with a sickening CRUNCH.
          
                              JIMMY
                    No!
          
          JIMMY runs at KONG, blinded by tears of GRIEF and RAGE ... JACK
          KNOCKS him down and SHOOTS at KONG.
          
                               JACK
                             (desperate)
                    Shoot him!
          
          WILD SHOOTING from the SAILORS, as they try to maintain BALANCE on
          the LOG.
          
          KONG ROARS ... DESPERATE SAILORS try to back across the RAVINE.
          
          KONG runs towards the LOG ... KONG'S FIST smashes at the LOG,
          knocking the men off balance. A SAILOR plummets off into the CHASM
          below.
          
          
          EXT. THICK JUNGLE - DAY
          
           NGLE ON: ANN hurrying through the JUNGLE ... hearing the sound of
          gun fire.
          
                              ANN
                    Hey! Here! Over here!
          
          She runs up the bank towards the noise.
          
          
          EXT. FAR EDGE OF CHASM - DAY
          
           IDE ON: KONG has LIFTED the END of the LOG!
          
          JACK, DENHAM, LUMPY, CHOY, JIMMY, PRESTON and THREE SAILORS hold
          on for dear life ... as KONG vigorously TWISTS and SHAKES the LOG,
          bucking the MEN into the air.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM skates on the MOSS and his CAMERA slides away,
          becoming WEDGED in the fork of a STUMP.
          
           LL AROUND panicked SAILORS are SHOOTING WILDLY, but fear and lack
          of balance throws their AIM OFF.
          
           WO SAILORS FALL ... CHOY scrambles for something to grab.
          
                              CHOY
                    Lumpy! Help me!
          
          LUMPY desperately tries to reach CHOY'S hand ... but CHOY slips
          away into the ABYSS.
          

          
                                                                  86.
          
          KONG ROARS with FRUSTRATION, and TOSSES the ENTIRE LOG into the
          CHASM!
          
          QUICK IMAGE: DENHAM, PRESTON, JACK, JIMMY and LUMPY gripping the
          LOG as it FALLS!
          
          QUICK IMAGE: PRESTON thrown off the LOG halfway down ... he
          manages to GRAB onto a ROCKY SHELF.
          
          ANGLE ON: PRESTON is nearest to the FAR BANK ... he LEAPS, and
          MANAGES to catch hold of some hanging VINES, hauling himself up to
          safety.
          
          ANGLE ON: The LOG plummets into a web of VINES, which arrest its
          FALL and sends it FLIPPING end on end, throwing the MEN CLEAR into
          mid-air... DENHAM, JACK and LUMPY land in SOFT MUD which cushions
          the impact of the LANDING.
          
          
          EXT. VALLEY EDGE - DAY
          
          ANN suddenly spins around ... the DISTANT SOUND of approaching
          FOOTSTEPS through the dense JUNGLE. A flicker of hope in ANN'S
          eyes! She starts hurrying towards the FOOTSTEPS!
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN sees a distant PLUME of SMOKE - over FOUR MILES AWAY
          ... she hesitates.
          
          She SLOWLY turns towards the SOUND of the FOOTSTEPS, which are now
          VERY CLOSE. Suddenly a LARGE 8 foot tall CARNIVOROUS DINOSAUR is
          in the GLADE before her!
          
           NGLE ON: ANN as she quietly backtracks. The CARNIVORE pauses, as
          if SENSING something. It's NOSTRILS twitch. She ducks behind a
          WIDE TREE.
          
           NGLE ON: ANN PEERING around from behind the TREE ...
          
          ... there is another CARNIVORE BEHIND HER! It snares at her ...
          and pounces!
          
          ANN leaps away ... she barely has time to start running before the
          CARNIVORE GIVES CHASE!
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN races past the first CARNIVORE ... the creature
          turns it's head ... and soon BOTH DINOSAURS are pursuing ANN.
          
          
          EXT. HOLLOW TREE GLADE - DAY
          
           NGLE ON: ANN desperately heads towards the TANGLED ROOT SYSTEM of
          a HUGE TREE. She throws herself forward, as the CARNIVORE'S JAWS
          snap above her head.
          
           NGLE ON: ANN ROLLS and SCRAMBLES into a HOLLOW under the ROTTEN
          TREE.
          
          ANGLE ON: The CARNIVORE CLAW at the TREE, trying to get at ANN.
          

          
                                                                  87.
          
          ANN is lying beneath the ROOTS ... all she can see are LEGS and
          SLAVERING SNOUTS! The DINOSAUR RAM'S it's nose into the NARROW
          GAP.
          
          SUDDENLY ... ANN sees the LEGS of one of her pursuers LIFT off the
          GROUND - it's taloned feet thrashing in mid-air.
          
           he SECOND CARNIVORE turns and FLEES into the JUNGLE, as ANN is
          forced to watch the twitching legs SHUDDER and FLAIL.
          
          The SOUND of BONE CRUNCHING ... CRACK! The CARNIVORE'S LEGS SPASM
          and go limp.
          
          ANN is completely still, she dare not breathe ... whatever killed
          the CARNIVORE is now inches from her hiding PLACE.
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN'S FACE ... as she sees something CRAWLING above her.
          
          CLOSE ON: A DARK HOLE, beneath the tree ... Long FEELERS probe
          along the ROOF of the hole as a HUGE CENTIPEDE CRAWLS towards her.
          
          ANN doesn't move as it inches towards her face. Suddenly she feels
          another crawling up over her shoulder.
          
          ANN FREAKS! She desperately scrambles away from the CENTIPEDES ...
          rolls out on the OTHER SIDE of the TREE and stands to RUN...
          
          ... TOWERING above her, with the DEAD CARNIVORE hanging limply
          from it's HUGE JAWS, is a TYRANNOSAURUS REX!
          
          ANN starts RUNNING! The TYRANNOSAUR crashes after her with the
          DEAD CARNIVORE still in it's MOUTH... as SHE races through the
          JUNGLE, dodging TREES, leaping over FALLEN LOGS, smashing through
          BUSHES, the TYRANNOSAUR POUNDING ever closer in pursuit. ANN can
          feel its hot sour BREATH blowing on the back of her neck! The HUGE
          JAWS of the HUGE BEAST open INCHES from ANN'S HEAD!
          E
          
          EXT. VALLEY EDGE - DAY
          
           NGLE ON: ANN slips down a MUDDY BANK, rolls over a LOG, and
          CRASHES NOISILY through a THICKET of PALMS ...
          
          
          EXT. FALLEN TREE GLADE - DAY
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN'S LUNGS are bursting, but the TYRANNOSAUR is   GAINING
          on her ... she manages to scramble onto a FALLEN TREE that   juts
          out over a small CLIFF. ANN clings onto the MOSSY LOG, and   crawls
          towards the END ... the TYRANNOSAUR cannot possibly follow   her.
          
          She falls amongst the roots, lying as flat as possible, praying
          the TYRANNOSAUR doesn't see her. It seems to work and IT walks
          off. ANN HESITANTLY SITS up, thinking that she is at last free,
          only to turn and discover another is behind her!
          
          With an almost delicate movement, the TYRANNOSAUR nudges the LOG
          with it's head ... causing it to lurch dramatically! The
          TYRANNOSAUR pushes HARDER, sending ANN over the SIDE ...
          

          
          
                                                                  88.
          she just manages to grab hold of a BRANCH as she FALLS. ANN hangs
          on desperately ...
          
          SHE SCREAMS!
          
          ANN is HELPLESS ... The TYRANNOSAUR positions it's HEAD for the
          FINAL LUNGE - gaping JAWS OPEN impossibly WIDE ...
          
          AT THAT MOMENT: KONG CHARGES!
          
          KONG meets the TYRANNOSAUR HEAD-ON at FULL SPEED! He swings, with
          his FOOT smashing the TYRANNOSAUR against the FALLEN LOG ... ANN
          loses her GRASP and FALLS ... as the DINOSAUR SPRAWLS onto the
          ground beside her ... in a flash, KONG CATCHES HER mid-fall ...
          ROLLING AWAY as the TYRANNOSAUR LEAPS UP and tries to take another
          swipe.
          
          
          EXT. SKULL ISLAND JUNGLES - DAY
          
           AST FEVERED ACTION: A pair of CARNIVOROUS DINOSAURS leap towards
          HER! They cling onto KONG'S ARM, clawing furiously, snapping at
          ANN!
          
           LOSE ON: Saliva flies from wild, snapping jaws.
          
          WIDE ON: KONG rolls over, THUMPING his arm against a TREE,
          crushing a DINOSAUR.
          
          ANN is WINDED ... she clings to KONG'S FINGERS as he strangles the
          second BEAST with one hand, snapping it's NECK with a BONE
          CRUNCHING sound.
          
            UDDENLY! A SECOND TYRANNOSAUR ATTACKS!!! He comes charging into
          shot, grabbing KONG'S ARM in his JAWS! KONG ROARS, sending both
          TYRANNOSAURS SPRAWLING TO THE GROUND. The FIRST TYRANNOSAUR
          scrambles back to it's feet! KONG holds ANN protectively as he
          braces himself for the FIGHT OF HIS LIFE. The TWO TYRANNOSAURS
          CIRCLE him ... when SUDDENLY! A THIRD TYRANNOSAUR comes from
          behind.
          T
           hey ATTACK KONG and ANN ... a BREATHTAKING FIGHT to the DEATH.
          KONG fights like a madman on three separate fronts ... Not only
          does he have to do battle with the TYRANNOSAURS, he is also
          PROTECTING ANN - constantly transferring her from ONE HAND to THE
          OTHER as the TYRANNOSAURS SNAP AT HER HEELS.
          
          KONG punches and smashes with his fists, but he also uses
          wrestling-style headlocks and flips ... for a brief moment, ANN
          rolls free on the ground and has to dodge 25-foot DINOSAURS and
          the GORILLA, as the frenzied fight THUNDERS all around her.
          
          The FIRST TYRANNOSAUR is taken out when KONG LIFTS up a HUGE
          BOULDER and SMASHES it against the TYRANNOSAUR'S HEAD.
          
          KONG and the TWO TYRANNOSAURS slide down on to a ROCKY OUTCROP.
          
          KONG outs the SECOND TYRANNOSAUR in a HEADLOCK, FLIPPING it over
          his shoulder, and throwing it down into the CHASM. CLINGING ONTO
          THE LEDGE KONG PULLS THE FIRST TYRANNOSAUR OFF THE LEDGE ... BUT
          AS IT FALLS it SNAPS AT KONG'S FOOT.

          KONG ROARS IN PAIN AND TOGETHER THEY FALL DOWN INTO THE CHASM ...
          DOWN INTO THE VINES. KONG CONTINUES TO FIGHT THE TYRANNOSAUR, AS
          ANN IS LEFT SWINGING, CAUGHT UP IN THE VINES ... TOWARDS THE
          SECOND TYRANNOSAUR. HE SNAPS AT HER AS SHE COMES WITHIN INCHES OF
          HIS JAW.
          
          WIDE ON: KONG SEES AND CLIMBS UP TOWARDS IT, PULLING IT DOWN.
          THEY ALL TUMBLE DEEPER INTO THE CHASM, AND SUDDENLY ANN FINDS
          HERSELF DANGLING FROM THE JAWS OF THE TYRANNOSAUR ABOVE THE JAWS
          OF ANOTHER! KONG SWINGS AND KICKS THE TYRANNOSAUR IN THE HEAD ...
          ANN LOSES HER GRIP AND PLUMMETS DOWN ... VINES BREAKING AS SHE
          FALLS. AND more SMASHING AGAINST THE CHASM WALLS ... SHE FALLS AND
          LANDS ON THE HEAD OF ANOTHER. FALLS AGAIN. SHE LANDS IN THE SWAMP.
          RUNS. IT CHASES.
          
          EXT. CLEARING - DAY
          
          WIDE ON: ANN faces the TYRANNOSAUR! SUDDENLY KONG THUDS DOWN
          BEHIND HER ... GLARING AT THE DINOSAUR ... ANN FINDS HERSELF
          CAUGHT BETWEEN THE TWO BEASTS. ANN WEIGHS UP HER OPTIONS BETWEEN
          BOTH ... and for a moment ANN & KONG LOCK EYES. SHE THEN BACKS
          BENEATH THE LOOMING FIGURE OF KONG.
          T
           HE TYRANNOSAUR SNARLS at KONG and he ROARS BACK ... KONG THROWS
          ANN GENTLY to the side as HE and the TYRANNOSAUR LUNGE at each
          other.
          
          KONG GRABS HIS JAWS in BOTH HANDS forcing it OPEN and BITING the
          TYRANNOSAUR'S TONGUE. HE ROLLS the TYRANNOSAUR over and over,
          using all his strength to force the TYRANNOSAUR'S JAWS OPEN
          before RIPPING them clean APART at the HINGE! The TYRANNOSAUR
          sprawls back, DEAD.
          
          KONG is PANTING HEAVILY ... he has been BITTEN, RAKED and CUT.    He
          puts his foot on the LAST TYRANNOSAUR and BEATS HIS CHEST,
          TRIUMPHANTLY with a DEAFENING ROAR.
          
          WIDE ON: KONG KICKS THE DINOSAUR OUT THE WAY. KONG ROARS ANGRILY -
          his blood is up, he is ready to take on the world. HE STANDS NEXT
          TO ANN, BUT HE WON'T LOOK AT HER DIRECTLY. SHE TRIES TO HIS
          ATTENTION BUT HE LOOKS AWAY. HE LUMBERS AWAY. KONG has DEADLY
          INTENT in his EYES. ANN watches as he DISAPPEARS into the JUNGLE.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN, CONFUSED for a minute ... THEN RUNS AFTER HIM.
          
                                ANN
                    Wait!
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN is roughly SWUNG into the air, as KONG bounds off
          into the DEEP JUNGLE INTERIOR.
          
          ANN as she is suddenly SNATCHED UP by KONG and SWUNG ROUGHLY on to
          his SHOULDER.
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN HANGS ON for dear life as KONG GALLOPS into the
          JUNGLE.
          
          KONG moves SWIFTLY and POWERFULLY through the JUNGLE with ANN on
          his SHOULDER ...
          

          
                                                                  90.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN as she looks up at the GIANT GORILLA ... the
          tension seems to go out of her body, she relaxes into his HAND
          ... for the first time since coming to SKULL ISLAND she feels
          SAFE.
          
          
          EXT. BOTTOM OF CHASM - DAY
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK STIRRING, immediately hearing the SCUTTLE OF
          INSECTS. HE ROLLS OVER and see's HUGE SPIDERS CRAWLING INTO THE
          PIT. HE staggers to his FEET ... REACHING INTO HIS PACK and PULLS
          from it A FLARE. THROWING it at the SPIDERS they CRAWL OFF.
          
          DENHAM is lying nearby.
          
                              JACK
                    Carl!!!
          
          DENHAM STIRS, MUMBLING IN PAIN BUT ALIVE.
          
          JACK SEES JIMMY.
          
          CLOSE ON: JIMMY is looking VACANTLY into space, JACK kneels down.
          
                              JACK (cont'd)
                    Jimmy?
          
          CLOSE ON: JIMMY looks up at JACK, there are tears filling his
          eyes. He falls into JACK'S arms softly sobbing.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM sitting up... dawning realization in his eyes.
          
          LUMPY, his back to CHOY ... he HOLDS CHOY'S HAND ... but CHOY'S
          FINGERS SLIDE LIMPLY out of LUMPY'S HAND ... LUMPY TURNS TO CHOY
          .. ONLY TO SEE THAT HE has DIED.
          
           NGLE ON: HAYES' eyes closed, his FACE peaceful, lying DEAD on the
          floor of the RAVINE.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM PEERING over a ROCK. The wreckage of the CAMERA
          lies smashed and broken on the CHASM floor ... a thin, shiny,
          thread of black FILM trailing from the smashed CAMERA body like
          spilt innards.
          
          DENHAM reaches out and touches the EXPOSED FILM ... his dreams
          DESTROYED.
          
          WIDE ON: THE FLARE SLOWLY DIES.
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK cradling JIMMY in his ARMS. HE LOOKS UP as he SEES
          the INSECTS CRAWL BACK.
          
          ANGLE ON: a HUGE six-foot CARNIVOROUS MAGGOT-THING squirms out!
          It crawls blindly towards LUMPY and CHOY!
          
          ANGLE ON: LUMPY pulling CHOY'S BODY to safety, but both are
          ATTACKED by LARGE INSECTS, the size of dogs!

          JACK tries to PULL THE GIANT CRAB-SPIDER OFF LUMPY, but instead it
          TURNS on him! More GIANT CRAB-SPIDERS JUMP at JACK.
          
                                                                     91.
          
          LUMPY and CHOY are CONSUMED by the nightmarish BUGS.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM is WIELDING a short stick like a CLUB ... he
          smashes the HUGE BUGS in a psychotic explosion of RAGE,
          pulverizing their bodies into the DIRT!
          
          All around, MONSTROSITIES OF NATURE emerge from DANK BURROWS and
          crawl towards the JACK, DENHAM and JIMMY ... these are HUGE
          INSECTILE MUTANTS - combinations of SPIDERS, CRABS, MANTISES and
          CENTIPEDES!
          
          SUDDENLY JIMMY notices the TOMMY GUN sticking out of JACK'S PACK.
          GRABBING IT he aims at the INSECTS on JACK.
          
          BAM! BAM! BAM! The GIANT INSECTS are blown apart!
          
          JACK looks wildly around for DENHAM. THEY SEE that they're
          SURROUNDED BY SPIDERS. ANGLE ON: JACK desperately swings at the
          INSECTS with a STICK, whacking and stabbing them.
          
          BAM! BAM! BAM! GUNSHOTS RING OUT. SPIDERS SWARM out of HOLES in
          the CLIFF AND DIE. JACK spins around ... confused.
          
          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN and a COUPLE of SAILORS OPEN FIRE from the LIP
          of the CHASM, SHOOTING the SPIDERS into SMITHEREENS!
          
          ANGLE ON: BRUCE SWINGS down from above, clinging to a VINE ... GUN
          BLAZING!
          
          BRUCE proceeds to lay waste to the INSECTS ... those not    blasted
          apart, scurrying away, back in to the darkness.
          
          
          EXT. JUNGLE - DAY
          
          Moving purposefully along a well-known route to his LAIR, KONG
          launches himself across a LOW CHASM ... one hand reaching out
          to clutch at THICK VINES on the other side ...
          
          SUDDENLY! The THICK VINES TEAR AWAY from the side of the CHASM
          WALL ... KONG falls backwards. ANN still clutched protectively
          to his CHEST he lands with a THUD!
          
          ANN looks up alarmed!
          
          KONG scrambles to his feet, GROWLING ... he places ANN on the
          GROUND pushing her protectively behind him.
          
          KONG POV: LOOMING out of the CHASM WALL is a HUGE FACE!
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN as her expression suddenly changes from FEAR to
          DAWNING COMPREHENSION.
          
          ANN walks past KONG ... who emits another LOW, WARNING GROWL.
          
                              ANN
                    It's alright ... it's okay ...
          
          ANN reaches the WALL and begins to pull away more of the VINES
          and CREEPERS to reveal ...
          
                                                                  92.
          
          A life-size and very life-like eroded STATUE of a SITTING
          GIANT GORILLA ... the IMAGE of KONG ...
          
          ANN turns back excitedly to KONG, trying to make him understand.
          
                              ANN (cont'd)
                    Look - it's you ... "Kong". See ...
                    you. "Kong". This is you.
          
          KONG looks from ANN to the HUGE STATUE ...
          
          KONG POV: ANN is dwarfed by the STONE MONOLITH.
          
          PUSH IN on KONG ... a growing sense of REALISATION as he comes to
          understand the STATUE is in fact a reflection of himself.
          
          CLOSE ON: KONG looking down at his hands ... it's as if he is
          seeing his GNARLED, LEATHERY FINGERS for the first time.
          
          ANN moves towards KONG ... he looks at her ... there is a
          VULNERABLE EXPRESSION on his FACE ... FEAR and SADNESS well in his
          EYES.
          
          
          EXT. SKULL MOUNTAIN - DUSK
          
          In VERTIGO-INDUCING shots, KONG climbs HIGHER and HIGHER - up into
          the HIGHEST PEAK of SKULL ISLAND ... carefully cradling ANN in his
          hand.
          
          A sudden FLAP OF WINGS and FLICKERING SHADOW causes KONG to pull
          ANN close to his chest as a sinister BAT-TYPE CREATURE lunges at
          her ... these SCAVENGERS hover in the SKIES around SKULL MOUNTAIN
          ... they have eight-foot wing spans and TALONED FEET. Their faces
          are more reptile than bat.
          

          
          
                                                                  93.
          
          
          EXT. KONG'S LAIR - DUSK
          
          WIDE ON: KONG steps out of a LARGE ROUND CAVE onto a LEDGE that
          juts out high over SKULL ISLAND ...
          
          This is KONG'S LAIR ... Over the ledge is a DIZZYING DROP of at
          least 1000-feet down to the JUNGLE.
          
          The "VENTURE" can be seen - moored off the TIP of the ISLAND, some
          three miles away.
          
           NGLE ON: KONG gently places ANN on the GROUND ... ANN watches as
          he moves away and sits to one side of the LEDGE.
          
          The SKY is a FIERY ORANGE as the SUN goes down ...   SILHOUETTING
          the FIGURE of KONG ...
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN looks around the CAVE taking in her STRANGE
          SURROUNDINGS ... her eyes fall upon a HUGE GORILLA SKULL and
          SKELETON which lie within the recesses of the CAVE ...
          
          ANN turns and looks back at KONG ... realizing these are the BONES
          of his FOREBEARS ... that KONG was not always alone.
          
            SUDDEN flutter in the DARK recesses of the LAIR, a SINISTER
          SOUND, sends ANN scurrying towards KONG ...
          
           ONG won't look at her.
          
          ANN breaks into a few tap steps ... NO RESPONSE. She leans   down
          and picks up some STONES ... JUGGLING them, attempting to amuse
          him as she did before. KONG's gaze remains averted ...
          
          He looks out over the JUNGLE CANOPY. ANN follows his GAZE, taking
          in the RUGGED LANDSCAPE which is bathed in the last EVENING RAYS
          of the SUN. She stares out to sea, a RAIN CLOUD casts shadows over
          the OCEAN.
          
                              ANN
                             (softly)
                    It's beautiful.
          
          KONG sits QUIETLY staring out over the JUNGLE ... she looks up at
          him.
          
                                 ANN (cont'd)
                    Beautiful.
          
          ANN places her HAND against her heart.
          
                              ANN (cont'd)
                    Beau-ti-ful.
          
          KONG'S BIG PAW unfurls beside ANN ... she hesitates for a moment,
          then CLIMBS into it.
          
          ANGLE ON: KONG gently lifts ANN ...
          

          
                                                                  94.
          
          WIDE ON: KONG with ANN, high above the JUNGLE, as the last of the
          DUSK LIGHT FADES.
          
          
          EXT. LOG CHASM - DAY
          
           LOSE ON: HANDS reach down as ENGLEHORN and a SAILOR PULL PRESTON
          up the last stretch of the ROPE ...
          
          ENGLEHORN turns and sees JACK climbing towards the TOP of the
                               D
          CHASM ... TWO SAILORS reaching down to help him.
          
                                DENHAM
                    Thank God.
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    Don't thank God, thank Mr. Baxter ...
          
          CLOSE ON: BRUCE PULLING HIMSELF UP THE ROPE, gasping from
          exertion.
          
                              ENGLEHORN (cont'd)
                    He insisted on a rescue mission. Me? I
                    knew you'd be okay ...
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM looks up to see ENGLEHORN standing at the top of
          the CHASM. ENGLEHORN is watching him IMPASSIVELY.
          
                              ENGLEHORN (cont'd)
                    That's the thing about cockroaches; no
                    matter how many times you flush them
                    down the toilet they always crawl back
                    up the bowl!
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM as he rises to his feet.
          
                              DENHAM
                     ey buddy! I'm outta the bowl! I'm
                    drying off my wings and trekking
                    across the lid!
          
          ENGLEHORN LOOKS at DENHAM a BEAT and then LOOKS across the CHASM
          in SURPRISE. DENHAM FOLLOWS HIS GAZE.
          
          WIDE ON: JACK at the TOP of the opposite side of the CHASM ... a
          solitary figure, bloodied and torn.
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    Driscoll ... don't be a fool! Give it
                    up, it's useless ... She's dead.
          
                              DENHAM
                             (quietly)
                    She's not dead. Jack's gonna bring her
                    back.
          
          ENGLEHORN turns to DENHAM.
          
                                                                     95.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    And the ape will be hard on his heels.
                    We can still come out of this thing
                    okay -
                             (pause)
                    More than okay. Think about it, you've
                    got a boat full of chloroform we can
                    put to good use.
          
          ENGLEHORN looks at DENHAM for a BEAT and then LAUGHS.
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    You want to trap the Ape? I don't
                    think so.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Isn't that what you do? Live animal
                    capture? I heard you were the best.
          
          ENGLEHORN stares at DENHAM for a moment, it is impossible to know
          what he is thinking.
          
                                 DENHAM (cont'd)
                    Jack!
          
          JACK looks at DENHAM D
                               ... DENHAM raises a hand in salute.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                             (calling)
                    Look after yourself!
          
                              JACK
                    Keep the Gate open.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Sure thing, buddy! Good luck!
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK turns to go ... and disappears up the DARK TUNNEL.
          
                                 DENHAM (cont'd)
                    I'm sorry.
          
          
          EXT. THICK JUNGLE - DUSK
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK struggles through the JUNGLE ... he breaks into
          CLEARING and STOPS SHORT as he see's the VAST VISTA of the
          MOUNTAIN in front of him.
          
          
          INT. KONG'S LAIR - NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: MOONLIGHT steams into the CAVE ... KONG sits on his
          LEDGE, HE CRADLES ANN IN HIS ARM.
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN SLEEPS PEACEFULLY in his HAND.
          
          ANGLE ON: KONG gently lifts ANN ... he STARES at her ... his
          FINGER touches ANN'S HAIR.
          

          
          
                                                                     96.
          
          
          EXT. KONG'S LAIR - NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK is climbing up through ROCKS towards KONG'S LAIR!
          
          BAT-THINGS flutter ... AGITATED ... SENSING an INTRUDER.
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK freezes.
          
           NGLE ON: A LARGE NUMBER of BAT-THINGS are GATHERING amid the
          STALACTITES that hang from the ROOF of the CAVERN.
          
          He scans the LAIR for any sign of ANN ... but can't see her. The
          OLD BONES of a LARGE GORILLA lie across the CAVE from JACK.
          
           ACK CLIMBS higher INTO THE CAVE until at last he's on THE LEDGE
          WITH KONG.
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK moves forward, towards KONG. He stays in the
          SHADOWS of the ROCKS.
          
          JACK CRAWLS FORWARD onto the LEDGE.

          ANGLE ON: JACK creeps CLOSE to the SLEEPING KONG'S BACK ... his
          SHOULDERS gently heaving with each breath.
          
           LOSE ON: JACK crawls past KONG'S FEET ... he looks in AMAZEMENT.
          
          ... ANN is ASLEEP in KONG'S HAND!
          
           LOSE ON: KONG GROWLS ... JACK SPINS AROUND ... KONG is growling
          in his sleep!
          
          JACK is less than 8 FEET away from ANN.
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN'S eyes OPEN. For a MOMENT she stares blankly at JACK
          ... then REALISATION arrives quickly - he has come for her! She
          looks at JACK with disbelief.
          
           LOSE ON: JACK looks at ANN, drawing a finger to his lips ...
          neither DARES to move, or make a sound.
          
           ERY SLOWLY, JACK rises and steps towards ANN. He gestures for her
          to stay motionless in KONG'S PALM.
          
           NGLE ON: The salivating, carnivorous BAT-THINGS flutter out of
          the CAVE and SWARM around the LEDGE ... their FEAR of KONG is
          overwhelmed by the tempting SIGHT of JACK and ANN.
          
          KONG STIRS.
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK extends his HAND towards ANN ... she reaches out
          ... their FINGERS TOUCH ...
          
          ... and KONG'S EYES SNAP OPEN!
          

          
          
                                                                   97.
          
          TIME seems to SLOW: JACK attempts to GRAB ANN'S WRIST, but KONG'S
          FINGERS CLOSE around ANN with stunning SPEED! KONG ROLLS to his
          FEET, pulling ANN away from JACK!
          
           NGLE ON: KONG SNARLS at JACK, who now stands HELPLESSLY before
          him.
          
          The BAT-THINGS SWARM above KONG.

          ANGLE ON: KONG SWATS at JACK with his FREE HAND. ANN struggles and
          KICKS in his GRASP. A

                             (yelling)
                    No!
          
          KONG places ANN high on a SMALL LEDGE and CHARGES at JACK!
          
           NGLE ON: JACK ROLLS to the SIDE, KONG'S FISTS smashing DOWN
          around him!
          
           ONG STAMPS on JACK, who DIVES CLEAR, just as the HUGE FOOT
          pummels into the GROUND.
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK is LYING on the GROUND with KONG rearing above him
          ... there is NO ESCAPE!
          
          CLOSE ON: KONG'S EYES, blazing with DEADLY INTENT. He LIFTS his
          FOOT, ready to SQUASH JACK like a bug!
          
          AT THAT MOMENT! ANN SHRIEKS in PAIN!
          
          KONG spins around ...
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN is under ATTACK from the BAT-THINGS ... they are
          FRENZYING around ANN, sharp CLAWS lashing her! She cowers against
          the ROCK FACE, trying to protect herself.
          
          CLOSE ON: KONG ... ROARING with ANGER ... he abandons JACK and
          CHARGES at the BAT-THINGS!
          
          The FRENZIED BAT-THINGS ATTACK KONG EN MASSE as he snatches ANN
          from the LEDGE.
          
          They strike at KONG and ANN like a swarm of giant bees. KONG ROARS
          and THRASHES OUT at them in a FRENZY!
          
            NGLE ON: KONG puts ANN down against the ROCKS, so he can use BOTH
          HANDS to strike at the DEADLY BAT-THINGS. With every sweep of his
          ARM, several BAT-THINGS are KNOCKED TO THE GROUND, but OTHERS claw
          at his HEAD and BODY.
          A
           NGLE ON: JACK seizes his CHANCE! He rushes along the EDGE of the
          CLIFF towards ANN ... under the cover of an OVERHANG.
          

          
                                                                    98.
          
          JACK and ANN are inches away from each other right behind KONG'S
          FEET!
          
           ACK grabs ANN'S HAND and leads her towards the only possible
          escape route - the EDGE of the LEDGE, 1000 FEET above the JUNGLE!
          
          JACK grabs a LARGE VINE, testing it's strength. He turns to     Ann.
          
                              JACK
                             (urgent)
                    This way! Come on!
          
          JACK pulls ANN to him and clambers over the EDGE of the   DIZZYING
          DROP.
          
          
          EXT. LEDGE - NIGHT
          
          WIDE ON: JACK and ANN desperately CLIMB down the THICK VINES that
          hang over the LEDGE ... hand over hand ... the SOUND of KONG
          ROARING above, as he battles the BAT-THINGS.
          
          
          EXT. KONG'S LAIR - NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: SEVERAL BAT-THINGS are gripping and CLAWING KONG'S BACK
          in an effort to weaken the huge ape ... he suddenly POUNDS HIS
          BACK against the WALL of the CAVE, SQUASHING THEM ALL!
          
          The surviving BAT-THINGS wheel away from KONG, HISSING ANGRILY ...
          16 lie on the cave floor, STUNNED or DEAD. They FLUTTER towards
          the BACK OF THE CAVE, preparing their NEXT ATTACK.
          
          KONG LOOKS for ANN ... she has GONE!
          
          
          EXT. LEDGE - NIGHT

          SUDDENLY! They start RISING!
          
          WIDE ON: KONG is PULLING on the VINE! He lifts JACK and ANN
          towards HIM, like a fisherman reeling in a catch.
          
          ANN tightens her grip on JACK'S SHOULDERS as BAT-THINGS flutter
          around THEM.
          A
           NGLE ON: JACK and ANN are HELPLESS ... KONG almost HAS THEM! BAT-
          THINGS dive towards JACK and ANN!
          
          A BAT-THING CLAWS at JACK'S HEAD. He releases ONE HAND and GRABS
          it's TALONED ANKLE.
          
                               ACK

          ANN hangs onto JACK for dear life, as he GRABS the BAT-THINGS
          OTHER ANKLE.
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK and ANN DESCENDING RAPIDLY ... the BAT-THING
          furiously FLAPPING it's WINGS, but unable to stop the SPIRALLING
          plunge past the CLIFF FACE.
          
          SOUNDS of KONG ROARING WITH GRIEF FROM THE LEDGE.
          
          
          EXT. RIVER - NIGHT
          
          The BAT-THING wobbles crazily in the sky, rapidly LOSING ENERGY
          ... JACK looks down - a FAST FLOWING RIVER is 50 feet below. He
          RELEASES HIS GRIP!
          
          ANN SCREAMS as she and JACK fall into the RIVER ... they are
          immediately picked up by the current and SWEPT AWAY.
          
          JACK and ANN are carried into the RAPIDS, swept down a small
          WATERFALL, surfacing into a FAST-FLOWING, but less violent part of
          the river.

          SUDDENLY! JACK and ANN appear from the undergrowth, RUNNING
          towards the CHASM and WALL ... the ALTAR BRIDGE has been raised,
          and hangs just out of reach.

          The GROUP react to KONG'S ROAR - now VERY CLOSE. A SAILOR with a
          MACHETE hovers near the ROPE, ready to cut it on DENHAM'S COMMAND.
          
                                DENHAM (cont'd)

          slices through the ROPE ...

          CLOSE ON: ANN ... seeing GROUPS of SAILORS crouched behind rocks,
          with GRAPPLING HOOKS at the ready. PRESTON lies to one side, a RAG

                    his sight!
          
          JACK takes ANN'S ARM ... DENHAM yells at him, as KONG'S RAGE
          intensifies.
          
                              DENHAM

                              JAYNE
                    Anyway about half way through the

                              (falsetto)
                    It felt like the right thing to do at
                    the time.
                              (falsetto)
                    Oh! I'm sorry - I couldn't help but

          other.
          
                              JAYNE
                    He's looking into my eyes -
          
                              THELMA
                    And that's when he told you how he
                    felt?
          
                              JAYNE
                    No - he never said it.
          
                              THELMA
                    He never said it?!
          
                              EDGAR
                             (falsetto)
                    He probably thought he didn't need to
                    say it.
          
          AUDIENCE LAUGHS!
          
                              THELMA
                    Then how does she know that it's real?
          
                              JAYNE
                    He said it was not about the words.
          
                              THELMA
                    Please - if you feel it, you say it.
                    It's really very simple.
          

                                                                   108.
          
                              JAYNE
                    He said we'd talk about it later. Only
                    there was no later ...
          
          CAMERA PUSHES IN on JACK ....
          
                               AYNE (cont'd)
                    It never happened.
                             (reflective)
                    I just thought that maybe this one
                    time, things might actually work out -
                    which was really very ...

                    Men! They'll give you the world ...
                    But they let the one thing that truly
                    matters slip through their fingers.
                    All for the sake of three little
                    words!
          
                               EDGAR
                              (indignant)
                    The three hardest words in the English
                    language!
          
          AUDIENCE MEMBERS break into fresh LAUGHTER as JACK leaves the

          CLOSE ON: CARL DENHAM quietly waiting in the WINGS of the HUGE
          BROADWAY THEATRE. It is a moment of calm ... he is feeling a
          mixture of PRIDE and ANTICIPATION.
          
          The SOUND of KONG BREATHING - a RASPING WEAK GROWL - causes DENHAM
          to flick his eyes to the darkened AREA behind the CURTAIN.

          WIDE ON: The LARGE CROWD APPLAUDS as DENHAM strides onto the stage
          in the GLARE of THE SINGLE SPOTLIGHT. He waves enthusiastically to

                     hank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank
                    you! Ladies and Gentlemen, I am here
                    to tell you a very strange story ... a
                    story of our adventure in which
                    seventeen of our party suffered
                    horrible deaths! Their lives lost in
                    pursuit of a savage Beast, a monstrous
                    aberration of nature! But even the
                    meanest brute can be tamed. Yes,
                    Ladies and Gentlemen, as you will see,
                    the Beast was no match for the charms
                    of a girl - a girl from New York ...
                    who melted his heart. Bringing to mind
                    that old Arabian proverb ...

                    as one dead ..."

                    to show you the greatest thing your
                    eyes have ever beheld. He was a King
                    in the world he knew but he comes to
          D         you now ... a captive!

          WIDE ON: With a DRAMATIC FLOURISH the CURTAIN slowly rises to
          REVEAL:
          
          KONG sitting slumped and unresponsive, his WRISTS MANACLED to   a
          STEEL SCAFFOLD. Other MANACLES and CHAINS secure his ANKLES, NECK
          and WAIST.
          
          There is a BIG GASP from the AUDIENCE ... KONG'S sheer size is
          OVERWHELMING.
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM ... euphoric, as the collective GASP of 2000
          PEOPLE washes over him.
          
           NGLE ON: KONG's head lolls, as if he is barely aware of his
          surroundings ...
          
                              DENHAM
                    Don't be alarmed, ladies and
                    gentlemen. It is perfectly safe. These
                    chains are made of chrome steel!

                    Observe if you will, I am touching the
                    beast! I am actually laying my hand on
                    the twenty-five foot gorilla.

          DENHAM reaches up and touches KONG'S LEG. KONG'S foot twitches
          slightly causing DENHAM to jump back in fright ...
          
           LOSE ON: JACK enters the AUDITORIUM.

          ANGLE ON: A STAGE HAND begins to CRANK a WINCH ... the CHAINS

          FORCED to his FULL HEIGHT ...
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK walks into the BACK of the BALCONY of the
          darkened AUDITORIUM. He quietly makes his way down the SHADOWED
          AISLE.
          
           NGLE ON: DENHAM turns back to face the AUDIENCE ...

                    We have in the auditorium tonight, a
                    surprise guest. The real life hero of
                    this story ... the man who hunted down
                    the mighty "Kong"!

                    The man who risked all to win the
                    freedom of a helpless female! A big

          him on the BACK as if they were OLD FRIENDS ... BRUCE turns and
          acknowledges the ADULATION of the AUDIENCE.
          
          A LINE of DANCERS, dressed as cheesy NATIVES appear from   either
          side of the stage. They dance to the beat, playing to KONG, who
          stares impassively at them.
          
          A PULSATING DRUM BEAT begins to fill the AUDITORIUM!
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    Ladies and Gentlemen, imagine if you
                    will an uncharted island ... a
                    forgotten fragment from another time
                    ... And clinging to life in this
                    savage place, imagine a people
                    untutored in the ways of the civilised
                    world. A people who have dwelt all
                    their lives in the shadow of Fear! In
                    the shadow of ... "Kong"!

                             (quietly)
                    He was right ...
          
          JACK turns to find PRESTON standing beside him ...
          

          
                                                                   112.
          
                              PRESTON (cont'd)
                    ... about there still being some
                    mystery left in this world ...

                             (softly)
                    And we can all have a piece of it ...
                    for the price of an admission ticket.
          
          ANGLE ON: PRESTON turns to look at JACK ... JACK'S EYES   flicker
          towards the SCAR which runs down one side of PRESTON'S CHEEK ...
          
                              JACK
                             (quietly)
                    That's the thing you come to learn
                    about Carl ... his unfailing ability
                    to destroy the things he loves.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM as he strides to the FRONT of the STAGE ...

          DANCERS fall to their KNEES in WORSHIP as a PLATFORM rises      from
          beneath the STAGE ...
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    Behold her terror as she is offered up
                    to the mighty "Kong"! A big hand folks

          CLOSE ON: KONG, a flicker of HOPE in his EYES.
          
          The TINY FIGURE tethered to the ALTAR looks up! For the first
          time KONG sees her FACE.
          A
           NGLE ON: KONG utterly CONFUSED; this is NOT ANN, but a woman in a
          blonde wig, dressed to look LIKE HER!
          
           ONG roars!
          
          FAKE ANN thrashes around SCREAMING unconvincingly!

          ANGER!

                               PRESTON
                    I've no idea. I heard he offered her
                    all kinds of money and she turned him
                    down flat.

          JACK'S eyes turn to the AUDIENCE seated nearby ... he gets up and
          attempts to usher people out.
          
                              JACK (cont'd)

                    wasn't going to get paid ... But as it
                    turned out, Mr. Denham here has been

          KONG tentatively inches TOWARDS ANN!
          
          ANN stops ... KONG stops. They stare at each other for a long
          moment ... ANN offers KONG a small SMILE, and reaches her HAND out
          hesitantly towards his ARM.
          K
           ONG gently picks ANN up ... his EYES never leaving her FACE.

          ...
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN, she understands ...
          
                              ANN
                             (whisper)
                    Beautiful ...
          
          Here, high above the squalor and the noise and confusion, the city
          lies quiet, almost peaceful ...
          
                              ANN (cont'd)
                    Yes ... yes it is.
          
          WIDER ... KONG cradles ANN in his HAND as they SHARE the moment.
          
          WIDE ON: KONG and ANN sit on the LEDGE, watching the SUN RISE.
          SIX NAVAL BIPLANES suddenly ROAR INTO SHOT, sweeping low over the
          DOWNTOWN BUSINESS DISTRICT ... and closing in on KONG. These are
          TWO-SEATERS, armed with TWIN MACHINE-GUNS for the PILOT, and a
          flexible MACHINE-GUN for the OBSERVER.
          
          CLOSE ON: PILOT'S FINGER on trigger.
          
          A COLD WIND blows ANN'S hair as she watches the PLANES approach.
          KONG is UNEASY about these BUZZING PREDATORS as they CIRCLE above
          him.
          
          The NAVAL PLANES peel off into an ATTACKING DIVE at KONG.
          
          DOWN GUN-SIGHTS ... drifting left and right as KONG grows in size
          ... LOCKED ON!
          
          KONG is suddenly FEARFUL ... he INSTINCTIVELY pushes ANN towards
          the BUILDING'S WALL!
          
          The PLANES split to either side of KONG, ZOOMING straight at him!
          
          KONG ROARS at the PLANES, as if issuing a CHALLENGE.
          
          ANN is screaming ...
          
                                 ANN (cont'd)
                    No!!!
          
          THE SIX NAVAL PLANES fly at KONG from different directions!
          MACHINE-GUNS START FIRING!
          
          KONG ROARS ... and SNATCHES at the NAVAL PLANES as they ZOOM by
          ... he FLINCHES as he is HIT BY BULLETS!
          

          
                                                                 122.
          
          KONG clambers onto the SIDE of the BUILDING and begins climbing
          to the UPPER MOST LEVEL...attempting to DRAW the PLANES away from
          ANN ...

          KONG.

          CHEST in ANGER.

          ANGLE ON: KONG recoils in pain as each bullet hits... HE ROARS IN
          PAIN.
          
          ANGLE ON: KONG leaps into the AIR smashing at the last PLANE ...
          the GIANT APE falls through the AIR ...
          
          The CRIPPLED PLANE spins out of control ... plummeting towards the
          street!
          
           he PLANES continue their attack as KONG tries each time to SWAT
          at them.

                    Hey, hey, nobody past this point. You
                    can't go in there.

          SUDDENLY a PLANE FLIES straight at KONG. He LEAPS out the way and
          FALLS...
          
          KONG smashes into the SIDE of the BUILDING ... one hand still
          grasping onto the UPPER LEVEL ... the TOP of ANN'S LADDER gives
          way ...
          
          HIGH ANGLE ON: ANN dangling precariously in mid-air as she
          desperately tries to hold on to the STEEL RUNGS ... her fingers
          slip ... ANN FALLS!
          
          KONG stretches out and catches ANN in his HUGE PAW ... behind him
          the planes are circling preparing to dive once again ...
          
          KONG reaches through the BROKEN WINDOWS and puts ANN in the GLASS-
          IN UPPER-OBSERVATION DECK ... ANN tumbles to the GROUND.
          
          Before she can stand another BURST of GUNFIRE rakes the BUILDING!
          WINDOWS SHATTER! GLASS FLIES all around ANN. BULLETS SLAM into the
          BACK of KONG!
          
          KONG circles the building trying to get away from the PLANE but it
          continues to follow him.
          
           NGLE ON: KONG leaping back on to the top of the EMPIRE STATE

           NGLE ON:ANN staggers to her FEET and races outside to the
          balcony, desperately looking for KONG.
          
          KONG looks FEARFUL ... he is WEAKENING from his BULLET WOUNDS.

          KONG, clearly weakened, looks out across the city to the
          approaching PLANES.
          
          THE PLANES are CIRCLING in the DISTANCE, preparing for an ATTACK
          RUN.

          challenge, rises up ROARING at the APPROACHING PLANE...
          
          ANN races between KONG'S LEGS to the EDGE of the BUILDING ... she
          frantically waves at the PLANES, screaming as loud as she can!
          
                              ANN
                    No! No!
          
          CLOSE ON: THE PILOT ... seeing ANN, he decides not to fire.
          
          ANGLE ON: KONG, now barely clinging to the top of the building,
          gently picks up ANN and STARES AT HER ONE LAST TIME. HE places her
          GENTLY down on the ground ...
          
           IDE ON: THE PLANES as they fly at KONG.
          
          GUNFIRE SMASHES into KONG. ANN looks up ... KONG grasps the side
          of the BUILDING ... She crawls over to him, clutches his FINGERS,
          hugging them, trying to COMFORT HIM. TEARS STREAM DOWN HER FACE
          ... KONG slowly lifts her in his HAND ... he looks beyond her ...

          ALL SOUND FADES AWAY ... except for a gentle breeze ...
          
          The FEAR leaves KONG ... he looks at ANN with TENDERNESS and LOVE.
          
           LOSE ON: KONG ... as the light in his eyes slowly fades and goes
          out.
          
          KONG topples back ... disappearing from sight.
          
          WIDE ON: KONG plummeting away ... Towards the ground FAR BELOW.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN as she moves towards the edge of the EMPIRE STATE
          BUILDING ... she stares down at the STREETS BELOW ... overcome
          by a sense of utter despair ...
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN ... for a brief moment she wants to do nothing
          more than follow KONG ...
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK as he climbs on to the ROOF ... he looks at ANN.
          
          SLOWLY ANN turns and faces him ... her grief still trapped
          inside her ... JACK can see in her eyes how close he is to
          losing her.
          
          ANN stares at him a beat ... tears begin to spill from her
          eyes. Slowly she rises to her feet and walks hesitantly towards
          Jack.
          
           ACK gently embraces her. She wraps her arms around him.

          CROWDS are gathering to STARE at KONG'S BODY. A SWARM of

                    Why'd he do that? Climb up there and
                    get himself cornered? The ape musta
                    known what was comin'.

                    him.
          
          PUSH IN ... on DENHAM staring at KONG, an ASHEN expression on

          The PHOTOGRAPHERS stare at DENHAM ... expectant.

                               DENHAM (cont'd)
                    ... it was beauty killed the beast.

2   INT. WASHINGTON, DC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY                   2

    We're in a kindergarten classroom of 25 SIX YEAR OLDS. All
    sitting on the floor, legs crossed. Sitting in front of the
    kids is Little KEVIN FLEURY, flanked by his mom LYLA FLEURY
    and his dad RONALD FLEURY, in a dark suit.

    Little Kevin has a large cardboard square with pictures from
    different stages of his life taped to it. He's telling the
    class about the photos.

    We're TIGHT ON the pictures. TIGHT ON the young faces. TIGHT
    ON Fleury.

                         KEVIN FLEURY
              This is my Fredricksburg house and
              my grandma Ruth playing with my
              skateboard ramp. It's a Tony Hawk
              jump ramp.

    A little girl, MICK raises her hand.

                        KEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D)
              Mick?

    Silence from Mick

                        MICK
              I forgot what I was going to say.

    Kevin points to another picture.

                        KEVIN FLEURY
              This is me at my second birthday
              party with my mom and my dad.
              That's my cake.

    Fleury looks down sweet at his son.

                        KEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D)
              This is me with my mom at the zoo
              and this is my dad and me and my
              grandpa Willie.

    Kevin points to another photo.

                        KEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D)
              And this is me and my dad and my
              grandpa Willie at my dad's office.

                                          KINGDOM 8/18/06   2.



The kids all lean forward and squirm as they try and get
closer to the pictures. MISS ROSS, the pretty twenty five
year old teacher watches from the side.

                    MICK
          Where's your gun?

                    LITTLE BOY
          Yeah, where is your gun?

Pretty much all the kids get in on this now. Everyone wants
to see Fleury's gun. Fleury makes eyes at Miss Ross. She's
giving him a `no fucking way' hard eye.

                    FLEURY
          I'm assuming that there are no bad
          guys in this room. Isn't that
          right? I mean, are you guys good
          guys or bad guys?

                       THE WHOLE CLASS
          GOOD GUYS!

                    FLEURY
          Right. So why would I have brought
          my gun to a room full of good guys?

This silences the class. Miss Ross keeps things moving,
pointing to a photo.

                    MISS ROSS
          What's that picture?

                    KEVIN FLEURY
          This is me and my dad playing
          Battleship at my dad's apartment.

Mick's hand goes back up.

                       KEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D)
          Mick?

                    MICK
          What is a battleship?

                    KEVIN FLEURY
              (abruptly)
          My parents are divorced.

A beat. Lyla and Ron look down at Kevin, stalled...

                                             KINGDOM 8/18/06    3.



                        KEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D)
              But that's OK `cause the most
              important thing is to know that
              everybody loves each other.

    This hits a bit hard on Lyla and Ron. Miss Ross jumps in.

                        MISS ROSS
              So, who's that in that picture up
              on top?

                        KEVIN FLEURY
              That's my fish, his name is Jaws
              and he's a really mean fish.

    Kevin's pointing to a picture of Ronald holding him as a tiny
    newborn.

                        KEVIN FLEURY
              This is the day that my daddy says
              is the happiest day of his life.

                        MISS ROSS
              Really. His happiest day! Can you
              tell us about that day, Mr. Fleury?

    Fleury smiles, looks out at the class.

                                          KINGDOM 8/18/06   4.



                    RONALD FLEURY
          I sure can. That was December 4th
          and that was the day that we spent
          the whole day in the hospital
          waiting for this guy right here to
          come out of Kevin's mom's tummy.
          And we waited and waited but he
          wouldn't come and we kept waiting
          and finally the doctor said
          `OK...he's not gonna come out on
          his own so we got to go get him.'
          And well,

Fleury stops, checks in with Miss Ross.

                    RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
          Can I tell this story?

                       MISS ROSS
          Go for it.

                    RONALD Fleury
          So they take her and put her on a
          special bed and they give her some
          medicine so she doesn't feel any
          pain then they take out this tiny
          little knife and make a tiny little
          cut right here in her tummy.

The kids are mesmerized...

                    MISS ROSS
          Then what happened?

                    RONALD Fleury
          Then the doctor put her hands way
          up into Kevin's mom's tummy. WAY
          IN! And then you know what they
          did?

A little girl, LU LU: WIDE EYED

                    LU LU
          What did they do?

                    RONALD FLEURY
          They started to pull and pull and
          pull... they had something in there
          and it started coming and they were
          pulling and the doctor all of the
          sudden said "STOP!"

The class is frozen. Fleury has them.

                                            KINGDOM 8/18/06   5.



                        RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
              They stopped pulling and the doctor
              looked up at me and said `Hey, Mr.
              Fleury - you ready to have your
              world rocked?' And I just stared at
              her and she pulled this little head
              up out of that belly. And it was
              him. His head. And I looked down at
              him and screamed "Kevin!!" And he
              looked down at me and screamed
              "Daddy!!"

    The kids are howling!

                                                      CUT TO:


7   EXT. AN UNKNOWN ROOFTOP - LATE DAY                             7

    A Muslim family sits together at a table under a tented-
    canopy: 32 year-old MAN nervously chewing on a toothpick, and
    his 8 and 15 year-old SONS. The 8yo leans his weight into an
    old MAN hunched and obscured by his grandson - this is his
    Grandfather. He gently rubs the Boy's head with an ancient
    left hand. The Boy finger-paints in Arabic script, right to
    left, getting paint on the table. Read the translation: There
    is no God but Allah.

    The Grandfather's face is down, obscured by his shumagh: the
    head-wrap worn by some Muslim men. Never a clear view of his
    face. His 32 year old Son and eldest Grandson sit next to
    them, the Son talking quietly on a cell phone, chewing that
    toothpick, eyes set on something in the distance: A Security
    Gate three hundred yards away, the entrance to some sort of
    compound. The Compound looks like a walled-off subdivision,
    most of which we can see from this high up.

    The landscape is foreign. Scrub desert. Ten miles beyond, on
    the horizon: the shimmer of a modern skyline. Surreal
    monolithic shapes made more so by the heat.

    Muted yells-claps-screams waft in from that Compound now...
    Catches the youngest Grandson's attention. Eyes lift up from
    his painting: the yells-claps-screams are coming from a
    softball game mostly visible behind the Compound's reinforced
    walls that extend a mile in each direction. Played on the
    only stretch of green grass visible from this vantage.

9    EXT. COMPOUND MAIN ENTRANCE - LATE DAY                          9

     Sounds from the softball game much louder now, just over the
     walls. Security perimeters two checkpoints deep before you
     get to the main gate. A maze of concrete Jersey-barriers to
     slow all entering vehicles: give machine-gun emplacements
     flanking the entrance plenty of time to shred those vehicles
     if need be. Middle-Eastern Police platoons. 500 lbs. lift-
     gates to dissuade any vehicle that just tries to ram through.

     SERGEANT HAYTHAM: a lean, 27 year-old Middle-Eastern
     Policeman in-command of the Entrance. Sweats through his
     uniform. A late-model Range Rover with blacked-out windows
     queues up. All the windows roll down: just a single, portly
     White WOMAN behind the wheel, her INFANT CHILD in a car-seat
     in front. Two other Uniformed Officers mirror-scan the bottom
     of the Rover.

     A brief exchange, as Haytham checks his ID:

                         DRIVER
               How are you today, Sergeant?

                         HAYTHAM
               Sun is shining. Wind is blowing.
               How bad can I be doing?

                         DRIVER
               I like that, "Sun is shining..."

     A tight smile from Haytham.

     The other Officers are checking the inside of the Rover now.
     They nod to Haytham, Haytham hands the ID back to her.
     Windows rolls up. Lift-gate goes up. Range Rover pulls away,
     navigating the zig-zag jersey barriers.


10   INT. COMPOUND - NEXT MOMENT                                 10

     Stay with the Range Rover as it moves deeper into the
     complex. Think middle-class Phoenix suburb circa 1960: stucco
     homes sandwiched between dormitory style apartment blocks,
     concrete and rock where grass should be.

     The Range Rover passes a tank with a caged SOLDIER on top
     sitting behind a fifty caliber GUN. A Police Land Cruiser
     parked in the middle of the road is the last of the security.
     Official markings, emergency lights in the grill.

11   EXT. UNKNOWN ROOFTOP - SAME MOMENT                           11

     The Son studies the compound through binoculars, while the
     youngest Grandson squints to study the softball game:
     Interest cut with jealousy. More muted cheers float. Behind
     and above him, his Grandfather's voice, rough as sand, to his
     32 year-old Son, in Arabic:

                         GRANDFATHER (O.C.)
               Hang up the phone. If they're not
               ready now, no words will change it.


12   EXT. COMPOUND SOFTBALL DIAMOND - NEXT MOMENT                 12

     Another Middle-Eastern POLICEMAN takes in the motley
     competition: half-smiling, half-smirking at a plump-pink
     White Man cheering on his plump-pink 9 year-old Son sliding
     into third.

                            WHITE MAN
               GET DIRTY!

     Safe. Clapping and Hoots. The PITCHER: an older White Man in
     his middle forties visibly frustrated. A 25 year-old African-
     American Batter steps to the plate now. Pitcher turns to his
     Fielders:

                         PITCHER
               STEP IT UP NOW!
                   (back the Batter)
               Ready for my knuckle-curve?

     The Batter just stays focused as the Pitcher tosses a high-
     lob. Batter smacks the ball a mile high, deep to left. The
     teammates of the plump-pink Boy on third:

                         TEAMMATES
               TAG UP! WAIT `TIL SHE CATCHES IT-

                          PITCHER
                   (spins, points up at the
                    ball)
               -COMIN' HOME!

     A 14 year-old Indian girl sprints underneath the fly-ball:
     sets up, catches it, juggles it, drops it.

     We pick up different families on the grass nearby: A young
     WOMAN helps her five year old DAUGHTER untangle a yo-yo. A
     black COUPLE doing a crossword puzzle together, the wife's
     head on her husband's lap.

13   EXT. UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT                          13

     The muted reaction to the dropped ball. The whole Family,
     save the youngest Grandson, intently focused on two Officers
     walking up to that Police Land Cruiser parked in the middle
     of the road, well inside the compound: no blinks now.

     The youngest still enthralled by the softball game, the
     cheers, the running, the shorts and t-shirts. We see his
     Grandfather's left hand stop rubbing the Boy's head, and move
     to the Boy's temple, placed like a blinder so he can't see
     what's about to happen. In Arabic:

                         GRANDFATHER
               Don't stop watching the game.


14   EXT. INSIDE THE COMPOUND WALLS - NEXT MOMENT                 14

     Noises from the softball game close again. Track these two
     Officers on foot walking toward the Police Land Cruiser ala
     shift change: nonchalant but quick.


15   INT. POLICE LAND CRUISER - SAME MOMENT                       15

     The Driver eyeing the two approaching Officers: something off
     about them. Uniforms wrinkled, one with a full beard. Driver
     turns to his Partner, in Arabic:

                         DRIVER
               You have a copy of the duty rost-

     -POP-POP-POP before the Driver finishes. The Officers on foot
     rapid-firing 9MM pistols. The Driver and Passenger hit
     multiple times instantly, crumble lifeless in their seats
     before anyone has time to process the sounds, link them to an
     attack. The two firing `Officers' move low-fast like
     professionals: rip the fresh bodies from the Cruiser, jump
     in. The new Passenger rips an AR-15 rifle off the center
     console. The new Driver lays rubber into the Compound.


16   EXT. UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT                          16

     The youngest Grandson wide-eyed, startled, watches as every
     member of the Security Details in and around the Compound go
     prairie dog: search with necks extended, eyes wide -- what
     the fuck was that? The Boy tries to turn his head away from
     the game to look for himself: Grandfather just pushes his
     head back to the game, voice harder now, in Arabic:

                                               KINGDOM 8/18/06   9.



                         GRANDFATHER (O.C.)
               I said keep watching the game.


17   EXT. COMPOUND MAIN ENTRANCE - SAME MOMENT                     17

     Haytham instantly sprints toward another nearby Police Land
     Cruiser as most everyone else ducks. In Arabic:

                            SERGEANT HAYTHAM
               LOCK DOWN!

     Then points at the Officer in the Driver's seat:

                            SERGEANT HAYTHAM (CONT'D)
               MOVE!


18   EXT. COMPOUND SOFTBALL DIAMOND - SAME MOMENT                  18

     Game forgotten. Parents up, screaming for loved ones, moving
     fast toward the parking lot. The Middle-Eastern Officer that
     has been watching the game hustles onto the field, next to
     the Pitcher, waves people toward him. Gathering but sporadic
     gun-fire in very near distance.

                         WATCHING OFFICER
                   (accented English)
               COME TO ME! FOLLOW ME!

     People immediately flocking around the authority figure.

                                                         CUT TO:

     The 14 year-old Indian Girl running in, more puzzled than
     scared: why is that Cop wearing a jacket in this heat?

                                                        BACK TO:

     The Officer rips a yellow gun-shape from his jacket pocket.
     The Pitcher sees it, instinctively tries to rip it away from
     him. Gets a handful of collar, pulls as violently as he can,
     shreds the front of the Officer's coat: a white linen vest
     with a bulge in-front underneath the jacket...


19   EXT. UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT                           19

     The youngest grandson's wide-eyed face. Then we see the
     Grandfather's right-hand slide down the other side of his
     youngest Grandson's face, coming to rest on his other temple:
     making sure he's still watching the Softball diamond now. The
     Grandfather's right hand: missing an index and middle finger.

20   EXT. COMPOUND SOFTBALL DIAMOND - SAME MOMENT                 20

     Panic. The Officer swings the yellow gun-shape, what we now
     realize is an electric drill crudely modified into something
     else, bashes the Pitcher's face with it. Those that had
     gathered have turned, are sprint-stumbling away...

     The Officer closes his eyes, depresses the drill trigger,
     vanishes before we comprehend the massive release of blue-
     black chaos, expanding in an ever-wider sphere. Immediate
     surroundings dissolve: players, parents, stands, cars, the
     light standards surrounding the field and parking lot.


21   EXT. CINDER-BLOCK CONCESSION STAND - SAME MOMENT             21

     Located behind straight-a-way center field, at the nexus of
     four fields. We see it from profile as shock-wave and
     shrapnel blast the structure: another Officer hiding behind
     it staggers out now, sprawls ugly: balance fucked from a
     blown inner-ear. He also wears a jacket, and holds a modified
     yellow plastic power drill. Moves uneasy toward screams in
     the nearby parking lot.


22   EXT. SOFTBALL DIAMOND PARKING LOT - NEXT MOMENT              22

     The off-balance Officer stops over a 30 year-old African-
     American woman pinned under a Toyota. She hyperventilates,
     her bare leg and open-toed sandal kick at air. The Officer's
     breathing calms: the sight of exposed skin as divine
     reassurance. CLOSE-UP: the vented rear of the drill as the
     14.4 volt motor sparks blue. A second blue-black explosion
     that shreds the parking lot as cars smash into one another
     desperate to escape.


23   EXT. ADJACENT STREET - NEXT MOMENT                           23

     Panicked women walking dogs. Frozen. A Police Land Cruiser
     with bullet-scarred windows roars around the corner. Stops
     near the women. They smile: cavalry to the rescue. Then a man
     with leans out the window with an AR-15: point-blank
     staccato. Tracers exit bodies, drill asphalt. The Land
     Cruiser rolls, spraying passing homes indiscriminate...


24   INT. JACKED LAND CRUISER - NEXT MOMENT                       24

     Tearing through the streets, Passenger firing at all signs of
     life. Sits back for a lightning-quick re-load. Leans back out
     -- before he can begin firing again-

     -another Police Land Cruiser from nowhere hammers their
     Driver's side. Vicious. The Passenger is launched out his
     window, head-first into the curb. Both vehicles smoke-
     screech. Momentary pause after the a massive collision.

     Then Sergeant Haytham, 9MM in-hand, falls from the Second
     Land Cruiser. Stalks bloody to the Passenger side of the
     jacked Land Cruiser still slowly rolling backwards, leaking
     all it's vital fluids, it's snapped drive-shaft leaving a
     groove in the pavement. And Sergeant Haytham empties his clip
     into the interior while walking along side.

     The Officer Haytham told to 'move,' rips himself from the
     Passenger's side of their vehicle, bleeding profusely,
     screaming something unintelligible into his handheld radio.


26   EXT. UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT                           26

     Just the youngest Grandson's horrified eyes: he had no choice
     but to see it all, carnage painted permanently. His face
     still held tight between his Grandfather's hands. In Arabic:

                         GRANDFATHER (O.C.)
               Our Time is not a peaceful one. God
               has left it to us to make it so.

     Hold on those deep, young, brown eyes.

     Those young brown eyes finally blink.

     Everyone eats snacks that the Fleurys brought. Kevin's the

     Fleury's cell phone vibrates. TIGHT ON THE ID: 911. Fleury's

                                         KINGDOM 8/18/06   13.



                    FRAN MANNER (O.S.)
          Go. I'll be here.

Fleury hangs up, walks to Kevin, kneels down - oblivious to
everyone watching.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          Son, I gotta go to work.

                    KEVIN FLEURY
          We're gonna do ceramics...

                    RONALD FLEURY
          I gotta go to work...

                    KEVIN FLEURY
              (points to the phone)
          Who was that?

                    RONALD FLEURY
          Big Fran -- you remember him?

                    KEVIN FLEURY
              (beat, thinking)
          Uncle Fran? Put peanuts in his Coke
          so he could drink and eat all at
          the same time?

                    RONALD FLEURY
              (smile)
          Where he's from in South Carolina
          that's called fine-dining, Bud.

                    KEVIN FLEURY
          What happened?

                     RONALD FLEURY
              (beat)
          Something bad.

                    KEVIN
              (impression of his Dad)
          `Lotta bad people out there...'

                    RONALD FLEURY
              (smiles, already homesick)
          I love you.

Kisses his boy's forehead hard.

                    KEVIN FLEURY
          You gonna go see him?

                                             KINGDOM 8/18/06   14.



                         RONALD FLEURY
               I'm gonna try...

     Looks at Lyla who's been through this drill too many times,
     knows this face. Ronald can only give a little shrug, which
     Lyla gives right back.

                         RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
                   (to Lyla)
               Can you get a ride?

     She nods yes. Miss Ross nearby, surprised by this:

                         MISS ROSS
               Where's your husband going?

                         LYLA FLEURY
               Ex-husband, and God knows.

     Then a wave of fear ripples across her face. She hesitates,
     then calls after him:

                          LYLA FLEURY (CONT'D)
               BE SAFE.

     Ronald turns, gives a little Cheshire grin, puts the phone
     back up to his ear.


28   EXT. AL-RAHMAH HOUSING COMPOUND BLAST SITES - EVENING         28

     The shattered softball diamond and parking lot. Emergency
     lights swirl from everywhere. Acrid smoke.

     FRANCIS MANNER (FBI LEGAT, US Embassy) is giant. The kind of
     American that only grows in tiny southern hamlets. Military
     whitewalls, short-sleeves, khaki Dockers, a thick Casio G-
     shock, FBI credentials visible on a chain.

     Hangs up his phone. Lifts his eyes: Hell from one side of the
     frame to the other. Saudi teams setting up portable lights
     that bathe the horror in industrial incandescent. Columns of
     black smoke. Fleets of emergency vehicles. 100 uniformed men.
     Another 200 in bio-suits combing the ball field, the parking
     lot. Fran has to do something/anything.

     Move through the horror with him now. His hands shake, his
     face already dirty with soot. Jumps in with a Saudi team
     pulling a half-burned WOMAN out of a smoldering Range Rover.
     She fights them, gouging Fran's face, trying to get back in.

     She is the woman we met at the gate of the compound.    She
     wants her baby.

                                            KINGDOM 8/18/06   15.



     Fran bloodied, just kind of steps away from the woman. Leaves
     the Saudi emergency team to fight with her. Backs away until
     he feels grass under his feet. The woman's screams
     reverberate. Fran just sits in the grass. Staring at the
     woman, her shattered soul. Forces himself to look away. Eyes
     come to rest on a child's baseball cap: ragged holes ringed
     with black stains: where blood dried on the blue felt.

                         VOICE (O.C.)
                   (immediately behind)
               Fran. You gotta stand Big Man...

     Fran turns to find REX BURR: 5'7" fireplug. A long silence.
     Fran points to the hat:

                         FRANCIS MANNER
               Rex, how old were you when your hat
               was that small?

     We watch tears well in Rex's eyes...

                         REX BURR
               You gotta stand, Big Man.

     Fran does. Wipes his hands on his pants. Slack-jaw hopeless.
     The first moments in what will be weeks of reverse-
     engineering the murders of unknown dozens. He and Rex step to
     a group of WALKING-WOUNDED. A NEIGHBOR doles out mugs of
     coffee. Most everyone from the compound is out, pondering the
     proximity. SAUDI emergency teams sprint past. Fran spits,
     settles in:

                         FRANCIS MANNER
               We need to get everyone back, then
               get all their-

     SOMETHING HUGE EXPLODES over their shoulders, 50 yards away.
     The Attack's coup de grace: wait for people to lift up their
     heads, hit them again. Five times the size of the suicide
     bombs. Shreds emergency vehicles, nearby homes and apartment
     buildings. Kills Saudi rescuers by the bushel. Fran is
     crushed by a flying portable light standard. Rex is blown
     into the man handing out coffee. The walking wounded get
     decimated.


29   EXT. AL-RAHMAH HOUSING COMPLEX - NEXT MOMENT               29

     Slowly lift up and hold on Al-Rahmah as it burns. Black smoke
     and flame pour skyward from the site of the coup de grace
     explosion. Massive crater. Screams. Chaos postcard.

                                               KINGDOM 8/18/06   16.




29A   EXT. WASHINGTON, DC HOUSE - DAY                             29A

      Establishing shot.


29B   INT. FRAN MANNER'S WASHINGTON, DC HOUSE - DAY               29B

      Fleury sits with GLENDA MANNER... a toy remote-control robot
      comes into the room. Little Teddy Manner (5) peeks his head
      around the corner of a door.

                          GLENDA
                It was... I don't know what time it
                was... the dishwasher's broken...I
                was waiting for the dishwasher...
                The doorbell rang - I thought it
                was... it wasn't the dishwasher
                guy...It wasn't. It wasn't.

      Glenda breaks down, starts to completely lose it. Her little
      boy Teddy climbs up onto his mother.


29C   INT. FRAN MANNER'S HOUSE - TEDDY'S ROOM - LATER             29C

      Fleury sits on the bed with little Teddy looking at a
      beautiful black and white photo of Fran holding a new born
      Teddy up over his head. Eye to eye.

      Little Teddy shows Fleury his toy helicopter. His dad's
      soldier boots.

      Fleury can't take it.


29D   INT. FRAN MANNER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM   - LATER            29D

      Fleury stands with Glenda.

                          FLEURY
                Glenda, I want you to look at me.

      A PAUSE: Fleury freezes up on a shock of raw emotion,
      struggling to contain himself.

                          FLEURY (CONT'D)
                Please... I'm going to take care of
                this. Whoever did this... I give
                you my word. Whoever did this will
                pay. I can't change this, but I can
                promise you that I will make
                someone pay for this.

                                            KINGDOM 8/18/06    17.




30   INT. HOOVER BUILDING, FBI HEADQUARTERS - DAY, EST           30

     Startling quiet in contrast. AGENTS cluster beneath 32-inch
     Televisions suspended from the ceiling. Tuned to Al-Jazeera,
     CNN, BBC, etc. Most eyes focus on the double-bloody scoops
     from CNN. Volume low:

                         CNN REPORTER
               ...1 hour ago: blasts in Saudi
               Arabia, in or around the `Al-
               Rahmah' western housing complex
               near Riyadh. More than 100 feared
               dead, including children. The Saudi
               Foreign Minister has released a
               statement calling this a `heinous
               act possibly committed by
               foreigners...'

                         BBC REPORTER
               ...homes to thousands of Westerners
               and other non-Saudis who work in
               the Kingdom, there have been
               several attacks on these compounds
               in the last five years. As such,
               they have become very tight in
               terms of security, with both the
               Saudi National Guard and police
               taking command.

     Fleury walks under the televisions. A folder in-hand, heading
     down a long hallway, subordinating his fury to tasks-at-hand.


31   INT. COMMAND & TACTICAL OPERATIONS CENTER (CTOC) - NEXT     31
     MOMENT

     Fleury enters, steps to a podium, opens his folder. 50 Agents
     seated lecture hall-style. Steam from fifth, sixth cups of
     coffee. Plasma screens behind show still-images of the crime
     cribbed from Al-Jazeera.

     Throughout the scene, Fleury constantly refers to a roster of
     his ERTs.

                          RONALD FLEURY
               Numbers so far: 100+ dead, 200+
               injured. The target was a softball
               game. Rumor is the Killers wore
               Saudi police uniforms.
                   (beat)
               Special Agent Fran Manner was
               killed.

                                       KINGDOM 8/18/06     18.



JANET MAYES, 29 years-old, stifles a sob in the front row.
Fleury steps from behind the podium, puts a hand gently on
Janet's shoulder, leans in and whispers something no one but
Janet hears. Whatever his words, they give back her
composure. She nods.

                    RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
          So was Rex Burr from State.

Fleury lets the news absorb as he steps back to the podium.
No one says a thing. Fleury lifts his eyes again, real
trouble maintaining control...

                    RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
          Fran was the best among us...we'll
          feel this loss the rest of our
          days...
              (beat, moment to regroup)
          Grant, take stabs at bomb sizes.

GRANT SYKES. 50 years-old. Virginia State Trooper before
joining the FBI. Law-and-order formidable: sharp-smart
Charlottesville accent. Studies the images for a beat...

                    GRANT SYKES
          From the craters, looks like they
          used a High Explosive... possibly
          military grade: can't fit that much
          TNT into a vest. 20, 30 pounds of
          PETN: they got it. Semtex or C-4:
          they could get it. The third there,
          God knows...that crater looks like
          a plane dropped a 500-pounder...

                    RONALD FLEURY
          Obviously a secondary blast after
          the initial devices used to lure
          first responders to the scene.
          Don't know anything about where or
          what it was yet.

                    GRANT SYKES
          This is how they do it.

ADAM LEAVITT. 34 years-old, sought-after Investigator.
There's a constant, intense grind to this guy, a mind and
mouth incapable of quiet. He paces around the room, then
eagle-eyes the bomb images... starts surge-scrawling crude
diagrams of the blast site on a piece of loose leaf. Feels
more like nervous doodling than work. Not looking up from his
drawing:

                                        KINGDOM 8/18/06   19.



                    ADAM   LEAVITT
          I already know   the answer, but any
          chance in Hell   we get to go over
          there, use our   hands?

                    RONALD FLEURY
          If you already know the answer
          Adam, why ask the question?

Fleury circles Leavitt's name on the roster. Leavitt never
stops drawing.

                    SYKES
          We're not seeing this kind of
          planning and execution anywhere
          else...these ain't hot-wired
          artillery shells waiting for
          Humvees to roll by.
              (pointing at the screens)
          These hits are coordinated:
          planning, timing, and big, broad-
          daylight balls-

                    JANET MAYES
              (almost trance-studying
               the images)
          Yeah, So... did they all happen
          during daylight?

Another great question. Fleury looks over to AGENT #1 on his
immediate right, an egg-head type with a big binder in front
of him. Everyone's eyes follow. Agent #1 flips quickly
through the binder, back-and-forth, searching. Fleury crosses
his name off of his roster. Then:

                    AGENT #1
          Yes. At least the first parts of
          the attacks.

Everyone smells it: that's big -- more proof these attacks
are being carried out by one, very skilled Terror Cell.

                    JANET MAYES
          We had two others...North of Riyadh
          and the oil thing. What was that?

                    ADAM LEAVITT
          The Refinery... Ras Tenura
          Refinery.

                    JANET MAYES
          Yeah, south of Jeddah. Same thing:
          daylight, suicide bombers. Right?
                    (MORE)

                                       KINGDOM 8/18/06   20.

                    JANET MAYES (CONT'D)
          Same thing. Followed by machine gun
          crews. Collect and kill.

                    ADAM LEAVITT
          Yup.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          This is not new in concept. It is
          new in scope. It's bigger. Very
          sophisticated. Command and control
          was flawless. They found the
          largest kill zone they could and
          they did it... they did it by being
          patient.

                    ADAM LEAVITT
          Any rumors or confirmations of
          uniforms being used in the other
          two attacks?

Fleury circles Mayes' name on the ERT roster.

                    AGENT #1
              (from memory)
          No. I know this is the first for
          that.

                    GRANT SYKES
          That's `worst case scenario' if
          you're still asking for my stab,
          Sir. A crew who can build bombs
          this big, with this level of eyes-
          on control and detonation
          coordination... has access to Saudi
          uniforms now...I mean...Baby Jesus.

                    LEAVITT
          Anyone take credit?

Fleury checks from his notes.

                    FLEURY
          Abu Hamza. Saudi Al-Qaeda. Bin-
          Laden-wanna-be. We know he was in
          Afghanistan, then moved to Iraq.
          Now he seems to have come home.
          He's clearly becoming increasingly
          active...

                    ADAM LEAVITT
          If it is Hamza, he's definitely
          turning up the volume over there.
                    (MORE)

                                             KINGDOM 8/18/06   21.

                          ADAM LEAVITT (CONT'D)
                Not to beat a dead horse, Sir, but
                if there was ever a time to get
                boots on Saudi sand...

      Sykes studies Leavitt with what is best described as
      substantial skepticism. Fleury circles Sykes' name on his
      roster.

                          JANET MAYES
                They can't afford to appear as if
                they are losing any kind of
                control. They lose control over
                their country, their people...then
                they risk losing control over the
                oil. They won't let us in. No way.

      Fleury's P.O.V.: His open folder on the podium. A memo
      printed on Department of State letterhead. Pulls the memo,
      reads it aloud, calm laced with rage.

                           RONALD FLEURY
                From the State Department, one hour
                ago: `We are in agreement with the
                Saudi security assessment that any
                additional American presence on
                Kingdom soil represents reckless
                risk. Therefore it is the Secretary
                of State's position that only after
                the situation has been evaluated
                and contained, should the Federal
                Bureau of Investigation activate
                Rapid Deployment.'
                    (folding the memo)
                The National Security Advisor and
                the Attorney General agreed.
                    (beat)
                I'm going to get us access. Keep
                your go bags hot. It's gonna come
                fast.

      Leavitt stares at Fleury as he moves fast out of the room.

                           ADAM LEAVITT
                    (beat)
                Well... I guess he's gonna go get
                us some access.
                    (beat)
                How's he gonna do that?

      Sykes just hard-eyes Leavitt.

32   INT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD PRISON - UNKNOWN TIME              32

     COLONEL AL-GHAZI, Saudi Police, 45 years-old, mustache as         
     thick as Sykes'. A firecracker-loud crack makes him flinch.
     He stands in the back of the room, not participating in the
     interrogation. Just observing. Clearly not happy about what
     he's observing.

     His POV: The Officer from the second Land Cruiser that rammed
     the fake and killed those inside, Sergeant Haytham. slab-
     cuffed and being worked over hard buy a couple of thick-
     fisted SAUDIS.. Silent tears roll off his cheek, left ear
     split ghastly. A MAN standing far right of him beats him: the
     firecracker sound again.

     Al-Ghazi looks away, biting his tongue. Obviously wants this
     over.

     In-charge of the interrogation: GENERAL ABDUL MALIK. He
     doesn't appear sadistic, but very determined to get the truth
     from Sergeant Haytham by any means necessary. Those
     distinctions blur easily. Malik gives a `hold-up' signal. The
     following exchange in Arabic:

                         GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
               No falsehoods, Sergeant Haytham.
               What was your involvement?

                         SERGEANT HAYTHAM
               Killing those I saw responsible.

                         GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
               So none could be questioned?

                         SERGEANT HAYTHAM
                   (puzzled, angry)
               I don't understand.

     A nod from General Malik: another vicious crack.

                         GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
               You were born and raised in Suweidi-

                         SERGEANT HAYTHAM
               -that is not a crime-

                         GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
               -it should be.

                           SERGEANT HAYTHAM
               It's not.

                                          KINGDOM 8/18/06   23.



                    GENERAL ABDUL MALIK
          Do you know Abu Hamza?

                       SERGEANT HAYTHAM
          I do not.

                    GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
          Your brother was killed fighting
          the Americans. True or false?

                    SERGEANT HAYTHAM
          I am not my brother.

                    GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
          Your brother--

                    SERGEANT HAYTHAM
          I am NOT my brother!

                       GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
          TRUE or-

Al-Ghazi interrupts.

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                              
          He has answered the question.

Malik shoots Al-Ghazi a unequivocal SHUT THE FUCK UP hard
eye. Then back on Haytham.

                     GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
          We found six more uniforms than you
          were assigned in your possession --
          that is a crime: especially when
          you consider the Attackers wore our
          Uniform...

Another nod, another crack. Al-Ghazi, flinching, becomes more
alert.

                       SERGEANT HAYTHAM
          Uniforms?

General Malik in Haytham's face:

                       GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
          Truth!

                    SERGEANT HAYTHAM
          I sweat. I'll say it again because
          it is true. I need more uniforms
          because I must change during
          shifts...look at my shirts.

                                            KINGDOM 8/18/06     24.



                         GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
               I am not interested in your sweat.

                         SERGEANT HAYTHAM
               -then look at my jackets. Please.
               Permanent stains...no matter how
               many times they're cleaned...

     Colonel Al-Ghazi grimacing now, leaves the room.                  


33   INT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD - STORAGE - NEXT MOMENT            33

     We follow. Al-Ghazi hustling into an evidence storage room.
     Searching. Finds a Locker labelled `Haytham.' Opens it. Pulls
     out several shirts still in the plastic dry-cleaning sheaths:
     yellowed, permanent stains on the armpits of each.


34   INT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD PRISON - INTERROGATION ROOM        34

     Al-Ghazi walks back into the room with the shirts, lays them
     down on the table in front of the General -- all business.

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI                              
               He's telling the truth.

     The only sound for a long, unsettled moment: Sergeant
     Haytham's labored breathing. Malik looks at the shirts, then
     Al-Ghazi, hesitates, steps away.

                         GENERAL ADBUL-MALIK
               You were injured when you used your
               vehicle to protect your country. Do
               you understand?

     Al-Ghazi moves in, begins uncuffing Haytham's bloody-raw
     wrists, hard-eyeing Malik the whole time. These men clearly
     don't like each other.


35   EXT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD PRISON - LATER                     35

     Al-Ghazi and Haytham sit alone. Al-Ghazi smokes. Haytham
     looks down at his feet.

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI                              
               Look at me, Haytham.

     Haytham slowly looks up at Al-Ghazi.

                                            KINGDOM 8/18/06   25.



                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                     
               You saved lives today. I believe
               that. You served your country. I
               believe that.

                         HAYTHAM
               I love my country.

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI                              
               I believe that, Haytham...

     Haytham Holds Al-Ghazi's eyes a good long beat...

                         HAYTHAM
               I love my country...

     Al-Ghazi slow nods.

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI                              
                   (beat, breaks eye-contact)
               You will have your revenge for what
               needed to be done to assure them
               you weren't involved.

     Haytham never blinks. Eyes hard. Stoic. Clear.


36   EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREETS - NOON                          36

     GRACE looks like a barrel-chested lineman. A four-man
     security detail behind. He and Ronald Fleury walk side-by-
     side. Janet Mayes just behind them.

                          DIRECTOR GRACE
               Everyone's terrified, so nothing
               moves. Paralysis. You and your team
               aren't going anywhere.
                   (beat)
               And this meeting is just a circle-
               jerk, Ronnie: Attorney General
               Young's going to go through the
               motions because protocol says we
               get an appeal. We'll be on record,
               but expect nothing more.

     Nothing from Fleury.

                         DIRECTOR GRACE (CONT'D)
               Can you handle this? Keep your
               mouth shut when people way above
               you say things you'll hate?

               Yeah, sure. No problem.

                         DIRECTOR GRACE
                   (re: Janet)
               What about Agent Mayes?

                          RONALD FLEURY
               Ask her.

                         DIRECTOR GRACE
                   (to Janet)
               What about you?

               I'll be fine.


37   INT. ATTORNEY GENERAL GIDEON YOUNG'S OFFICE - NOON           37

     Fleury, Grace and Mayes enter. Handsomely decorated,
     expansive: a lifetime of notable handshakes framed in black
     and white. The biggest is a picture of Young and Billy Graham
     that could be titled, `lucky for you, we have all the
     answers.'

     Gideon Young sits behind his Federalist-era oak desk: a
     marathoner's build, a smile too bright-perfect for his age.

     Two others in-attendance. A pear-shaped 54 year-old man with
     a Midwest-honest, ruddy-oval face: Ellis Leach, Assistant
     Secretary, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, Department of
     State

     And a 51 year-old Hispanic woman in conservative Chanel:
     enough femininity without diminishing toughness: Maricella
     Canavesio, Deputy National Security Advisor, White House

                         DIRECTOR GRACE
               I apologize if we're late-

                         GIDEON YOUNG
               They were early.

                         DIRECTOR GRACE
               You know Special Agent Fleury?

                          GIDEON YOUNG
               I do.

                                       KINGDOM 8/18/06    27.



                    DIRECTOR GRACE
          This is agent Janet Mayes, she's
          one of our Arabic experts.

Janet stares at Young, looking mildly in over her head.

                    GIDEON YOUNG
          OK. The latest.

Grace sits, nods to Fleury: you're up...

                    RONALD FLEURY
          Two suicide bombers. Rumors they
          were dressed as Saudi Police. We
          believe this is the work of Saudi
          terrorist named Abu Hamza.

Young just stares at Fleury kind of odd like a kid staring at
a mushroom flavored Popsicle.

                    GIDEON YOUNG
          Go on.

Fleury continues:

                     RONALD FLEURY
          A Shooter crew served as
          distraction. After the initial
          attack there was a lull to allow
          Saudi Emergency Teams...and our own
          attaches...to collect. Then a
          secondary blast was triggered,
          aimed at those first responders. So
          they targeted families and rescuers
          with one attack.
              (mildly sarcastic:)
          I think that's a clear signal that
          their definition of `Enemy' is
          expanding.

                    MARICELLA CANAVESIO
          My God.

                    GIDEON YOUNG
          Let us never forget how cheap life
          is over there. Now...I have seven
          minutes before my next meeting, so
          who's talking first?
              (to Fleury and Grace, slow
               like a Kindergarten
               teacher:)
          You two digested the memo?

                                       KINGDOM 8/18/06   28.



Stoic nods from each. Ellis Leach raises his hand, a tone
that's worlds away from Young's.

                     ELLIS LEACH
          I'll go first if that's okay
          Maricella?
              (off her `yeah, sure' nod)
          First, I'm sorry about Fran Manner.

Gideon Young remembers, nods along solemnly.

                    DIRECTOR GRACE
          As we are about Rex Burr.

                    ELLIS LEACH
          I met with Prince Thamer at the
          Saudi embassy fifteen minutes after
          I heard this morning's news. After
          speaking with Thamer, I advised we
          withhold additional US personnel
          because a big part of the religious
          justification for these bombs is
          the presence of current US
          personnel. More boots on Saudi soil
          make an already combustible
          situation more so. I know that's
          not the answer you want, but...

Motions to Maricella: the floor is yours.

                    MARICELLA CANAVESIO
          My two cents: The Saudis haven't
          asked for FBI help. Sounds like
          they've done just the opposite. If
          we force the issue, that could
          further anger an utterly important
          ally that shares a 1000-mile long
          border with Iraq.

                    GIDEON YOUNG
              (to Grace and Fleury)
          It's all rock-solid logic.

                     DIRECTOR GRACE
              (beat)
          We would just like to be on record
          as saying we think we should go
          ASAP-

                    GIDEON YOUNG
          That's not going to happen

                                       KINGDOM 8/18/06   29.



Young stands: we're done. Fleury's look: that's it? Young's
already collecting his briefcase, jacket-

                    GIDEON YOUNG (CONT'D)
              (mock sincerity to the
               room:)
          -so as we present this to the
          public, let's - as best we can -
          try to view this through an FBI
          Agent's eyes.
              (beat...To Grace:)
          And please let me know if there's
          anything else we can do for you.

Meeting seems over. Not quite. Fleury can't keep his mouth
shut.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          Sir, how would you imagine it looks
          viewed through an FBI agents eyes?

                       GIDEON YOUNG
          Pardon me?

                    RONALD FLEURY
          I'm interested in how you think
          this situation is viewed through
          our eyes.

Young, eyes on a Republican-gold Rolex, instantly perturbed
the meeting isn't ending.

                    GIDEON YOUNG
          It's some variation on vengeance...
          When one of your own is killed,
          Agents lose their analytical powers
          - kind of a greatest strength,
          greatest weakness thing...

                     RONALD FLEURY
          If I wanted vengeance, I'd have
          whispered `Rex Burr' into Ellis's
          ear right when we walked in.
              (beat)

Eyes migrate to Fleury --

                    RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
          This isn't Terrorism, ma'am. It's
          just Serial Murder.

                    MARICELLA CANAVESIO
          What's the distinction?

                                       KINGDOM 8/18/06   30.



                    RONALD FLEURY
          To call this massacre an act of
          terrorism... that implies a
          specific political agenda. To me,
          these killings are so futile and
          unbalanced that they feel utterly
          sociopathic- more like Charles
          Manson than Osama Bin Laden...

Fleury looks to Mayes. She clears her throat. Delivers the
following with utter precision.

                    JANET MAYES
              (beat, fuck it: Go)
          Al Qaeda lost the first phase of
          this war, so a new, zero-sum phase
          has begun: if you won't join us,
          we'll let loose the truly talented
          Murderers... Abu Hamza. He will
          kill so many of you that the
          resulting humiliation of the Saudi
          Royal Family will cause an exodus,
          a rebellion, both. Because the
          Royal Family simply cannot protect
          you or yours any longer.

Fleury studies Janet with solid respect. He gives Janet a
subtle nod: "Nice work."

                    RONALD FLEURY
          When she says talented, she's not
          talking about the walking-bombs who
          can sneak past any and all
          security, nor the hi-jackers tough
          enough to take an airliner. We're
          talking about the Man who teaches
          them how...

                    JANET MAYES
          --the operational commander who
          organizes, trains, plans,
          encourages. That is who we're
          fighting.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          If we don't get inside Saudi Arabia
          within 36 hours, there is no chance
          we catch the killer responsible for
          Al-Rahmah. None.

                                            KINGDOM 8/18/06   31.



                         ELLIS LEACH
               Okay. I believe it all. So doesn't
               your team in that country represent
               the kind of target one of these
               `Masters' would die for? Trade ten
               of their own for one of you?

                         RONALD FLEURY
               To not engage these criminals out
               of fear for our personal safety is
               just another way of saying `uncle.'

     Fleury takes another deep breath.

                         RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
               I'll say it another way: Evidence
               starts to go cold after twenty four
               hours. If we can't get in now, we
               will not find the man or men
               responsible for this crime. We
               couldn't do it at Khobar; we
               couldn't do it in Yemen; we have
               barely scratched the surface in
               Iraq. And we are on verge of not
               doing it here. They are getting
               stronger, we are getting weaker. I
               just lost a very good friend and I
               would very much like to go and do
               my job.

     Beat.

                         GIDEON YOUNG
                   (chuckle)
               That was spirited... let's all
               thank God Special Agent Fleury
               doesn't make policy decisions. He'd
               turn the FBI into Patton's Third
               Army.

     Young stands. Fleury contemplates career-ending violence.

               I see the look in your eyes. That

          It's not vengeance.

                    DIRECTOR GRACE
          It ain't justice. It's stronger.
          We've all been there. I have.
          Vengeance is always dirty, Ronnie.

          Know what my high school football

                    DIRECTOR GRACE
          What?

                    RONALD FLEURY
          "HIT SOMETHING." All night long,
          Coach Bailey would scream "HIT
          SOMETHING." Every play.

          How you gonna do it?

                    RONALD FLEURY
          The Saudis covet good PR as much as
          their Oil: 15 of 19 hijackers on 9-
          11 means most Americans will never
          stop asking if that Saudi Oil is
          worth it. It's all about press.

                    DIRECTOR GRACE
          Few more moves and it's Total War,
          Ronnie. The only time Treason is
          palatable is when it's done
          righteously and completely...

Fleury digesting Grace's words: moments pass. Then he looks
to Janet.

     Elaine Flowers, Senior Correspondent, Washington Post: Coffee
     amp'd, deep black raccoon eyes - heavy wrinkled khakis.
     Fleury sits across from her. We've entered mid-scene:

                         ELAINE FLOWERS
               Looks like every overthrow in

               broke the Vice President's guy

                         RONALD FLEURY
               I know you're tracking Al Haramain.

                          ELAINE FLOWERS
               Is that what you want to talk
               about? Saudi officials making
               donations that end up... What?
               Blowing up trains in Paris? Buses

40   EXT. WILLARD HOTEL - WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT                 40

     Frenetic Doorman-Valet ballet. 2 black Suburbans with red-
     blue diplomatic plates swing onto the round-about. A bald,
     waif-like 38 year-old Saudi MAN gets out of the lead vehicle.

     Fleury waiting outside, eyes on his watch. To Thamer:

     A big bodyguard sits up front. Fleury sits in back, aims the
     AC vents his way. Prince Thamer sits next to him. Bright
     lights from the trail suburban illuminate the interior.

     Prince Thamer looks more than a bit baffled.

                         RONALD FLEURY
               Too many people we both know were
               at the bar. It's a pleasure to meet
               you, Your Highness.

                         PRINCE THAMER
               I had an interesting conversation
               with a reporter from the Post.

                         RONALD FLEURY
               She can be a bit of an
               exaggerator... I'm sure things were
               somewhat over-stated. I see myself
               as friend of Saudi Arabia. I just
               need a little cooperation, that's
               all.

                         PRINCE THAMER
               What kind of cooperation??

                         RONALD FLEURY
               Full cooperation: my Team cleared
               to land at Prince Sultan Air Base.

     Fleury takes a beat.

                         RONALD FLEURY
               This goes one of two ways. First:
               The FBI with the White House go on
               the kind of aggressive PR "Saudi
               Royal Family Decaying Monarchy"
               bender that just can't help but
               hurt. Really hurt. And I don't care
               how many Chinese are lined up to
               buy the oil. You know it's gonna
               hurt.

                         PRINCE THAMER
               My family is not decaying-

                    RONALD FLEURY
          And then we bring the hammer down
          hard as hell: Bust Al Haramain - we
          got direct links from Riyadh - two
          wives donating ten million to three
          Arab-American cultural centers in
          Boston. Then what gets kind of not-
          funny is how some of that cash
          found its way to Jakarta and some
          Mosques that have these training
          camps built right next to them.
          It's kinda funny... you got little
          kids playing over here, and some
          not so little kids playing with
          guns over here. That's kinda odd.

                    PRINCE THAMER
          You have no proof of this.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          We're getting there, Sir. And I
          haven't even brought up the two
          girls still missing out of Houston.
          This is big. It is real. And I know
          you only care so much about public
          American opinion, Sir. But the
          story will be covered... Big...

Thamer is clearly rattled. Fleury is starting to crack this
man.

                    RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
          And this ain't the Metro section.
          It's above the fold, just below the
          date. Words like these get
          syndicated to papers like the Omaha
          World-Herald, The Terrell Tribune --
          You ever been to Terrell, Texas?

                    PRINCE THAMER
          What is your point?

Fleury looks back to him.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          Last I heard, 112 people lost their
          lives in your country. One of them
          was a good friend of mine. I want
          in and I want in immediately.

     Fleury looks back at the Ambassador. A stare down.

               If your phone doesn't work
               international, you can borrow mine.

     Prince Thamer slowly reaches for his phone as Fleury opens
     his door.

               I'll just be right out here.

      dish...


43    INT. SAUDI SHACK - NIGHT, SAUDI TIME                       43

      A tiny framed Saudi National flag in the middle of a wall:
      green with a white sword underlining script that reads: There
      is no God but Allah.

      No other decoration. The none-too-muffled sounds of traffic:
      a lone window overlooking a four-lane boulevard. Then the
      Athan (call to prayer) for the Isha (last of the five daily
      prayers) trumps the traffic noise.

     Sergeant Haytham enters, bandaged, blank, then a small smile
     crosses his face. An old man's weathered voice, in Arabic:

                         OLD VOICE (O.C.)
               Just in time.

     Haytham's P.O.V.: His FATHER, glass-frail, lying in a bed, a
     small TV nearby, on but soundless. Haytham goes into a
     routine: rolls out two prayer mats, steps to his Father,
     reaches down to pick him up. His Father readies himself --
     stops everything when he sees the bandages up close, the
     black bruises with outer rings of purple covering 1/2 of his
     Son's cheek. Looks into his boy's eyes.

                         HAYTHAM'S FATHER
               What happened?

     Haytham not returning the gaze, hoists his Father into his
     arms -- pain shoots up his arms from his damaged wrists.

                         SERGEANT HAYTHAM
               You haven't heard about the attack?

                         HAYTHAM'S FATHER
               I choose not to listen anymore.
               What happened to your face?

                          SERGEANT HAYTHAM
                   (beat)
               An attack today.

                         HAYTHAM'S FATHER
               Look at me.

     Haytham looks into his father's eyes now. No words. Haytham's
     eyes well with tears. After a long silence:

                         HAYTHAM'S FATHER (CONT'D)
               Is this how they now treat the men
               who protect them? Can you look at
               me? You cannot, can you? Can you
               look at yourself?

     Haytham stares at his father.

                         HAYTHAM'S FATHER (CONT'D)
               You are protecting the true enemies
               of God.

     INTERCUT WITH THE HAYTHAM SCENE:

     Al-Ghazi sits on pillows on the living room with his WIFE and
     three DAUGHTERS. A television is on, playing "MAN SAYARBAH AL
     MILIOUN" the Arabic "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire." Al-
     Ghazi's children are playing a game with peas, trying to
     guess which one of his hands Al-Ghazi is hiding the pea. When
     a girl guesses correctly, he eats a pea.

     From outside, we hear the call to prayer. Al-Ghazi and his
     family all move to prayer mats in his living room.


45   INT. ONE ROOM APARTMENT - SAME                               45

     Haytham continues carrying his Father to the prayer mats.
     Gently sets him down, Kneels down himself, carefully rolls
     his Dad to his stomach. Then stands to help tuck his Father --
     in obvious, great arthritic pain -- into a kneeling prayer
     position.

     Kisses his father on the top of his head. And both pray.


46   INT. AL-GHAZI'S HOUSE - SAME                                 46

     A Load-Master buckling down two paletts of shrink-wrapped

               coming outta the Head. But he
               definitely felt Fran's uppercut
               shatter his jaw.

Points to Fleury's dirty Jeep arriving.

                    GRANT SYKES
          SAC Fleury took care of him.

                    ADAM LEAVITT
          How?

                    GRANT SYKES
          If I knew how I'd be SAC Sykes. I
          do know the post in Riyadh was part
          of the deal Fleury cut to save
          Fran's career.

Leavitt looks up at Mayes as she gets within ear-shot, plops
down next to them.

              (beat)

sense of purpose.

     Three-Suburban convoy turns up a driveway, waved past a guard
     post bristling with automatic weapons and into the circular
     drive of a massive, walled palace. Impersonal wealth. Two
     dozen SANG troops on security detail. Two Humvees equipped
     with anti-aircraft missiles parked 100 yards apart.

     Colonel Al-Ghazi out of the middle Suburban. Frisked by SANG,      
     rough: no love lost.

     10' X 20' gold/glass desk over a 50' X 50' rug in a 100' X
     100' marble room. Al-Ghazi greets the Prince formally: kiss
     the right shoulder near the clavicle. The Prince's tongue
     chalk-white for some reason. In Arabic:

               land at Prince Sultan Air Base this

                They gonna let us land?

                          PILOT #1
                We've been talking to them about an
                hour or so... they know we're
                coming.

                             RONALD FLEURY
                Good.

                think quail in Tennessee, deer in

                you all gonna do in Saudi?

58    EXT. MASSIVE, CLOSED DOWN MILITARY COMPLEX - NIGHT           58

      PRINCE SULTAN AIR BASE, SAUDI ARABIA. Our C-130 touches down
      smooth on Saudi soil.


59    INT. C-130 CARGO HOLD - NIGHT, SAUDI TIME                    59

      Engines winding down to nothing. The team standing, slinging
      bags over their shoulders. Groggy but pumped. Fleury looks at
      his team, last bit of advice before game-time.

                                              KINGDOM 8/18/06   48.

               Heads on a swivel.


60   EXT. PRINCE SULTAN AIRBASE - NIGHT, SAUDI TIME               60

     The cargo door locks into place on Saudi tarmac. Fleury and
     the Team outside the plane now, bags dropped at their feet.
     90 degrees even this late. Look-up: light washing over a
     small, formal Saudi military team in front of two caskets
     draped in American flags, and a small convoy of bullet-proof
     black Suburbans. Adam Leavitt will never forget this first
     glimpse of Saudi Arabia: surreal. Tears in Janet's eyes as
     she glimpses the caskets.

     Colonel Al-Ghazi steps up, offers his hand to Fleury. Fleury      
     and Al-Ghazi shake:

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI                              
               Colonel Al-Ghazi.

               Special Agent Ronald Fleury.

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI                              
                   (beat: the caskets)
               Your two fallen comrades, Mr.
               Manner and Mr. Burr.

     Three men multi-task hustle to forklifts, start them up. Into
     the cargo hold, pulling out paletts. Things moving orderly-
     fast now. The Americans just kind of step back, dazed.

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                     
               Passports and credentials. Please.

     Sergeant Haytham, driving one of the suburbans, steps forward
     with kevlar vests for our crew.

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                     
               Thank you to keep these on whenever
               you are outside of Al-Rahmah.

                         JANET MAYES
               We brought our own.

     The crew hits their bags, pulls out their vests.

     Another OFFICER checks each team member's FBI badge and
     passport. Stops at Leavitt's: an Israeli stamp on his
     passport. Leavitt's quick:

                                            KINGDOM 8/18/06    49.



                         ADAM LEAVITT
               Israeli stamp in my passport?

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
                   (in Arabic to the Officer)
               That is not our concern.

     Al-Ghazi takes the passports and badges, hands them back.

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                    
               I'm also to collect your sidearms.

     This is like handing over your first-born. Fleury goes first.
     Haytham puts each weapon in a padded case.

                         GRANT SYKES
               And I usually just toss it on the
               kitchen table...

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
                   (small smile)
               If each of you would please get
               into the middle vehicle.


61   INT. MIDDLE SUBURBAN, RIYADH SUBURBS - NIGHT                61

     The speedometer at 110 m.p.h. Haytham navigates with his left
     hand. Prayer beads hang from the rearview mirror. Al-Ghazi in
     the passenger seat, right hand rubbing another set of prayer
     beads down to nubs. The team in the back rows: all staring at
     the prayer beads on the mirror.

                         JANET MAYES
                   (whispering to Leavitt)
               Wouldn't need the power a' prayer
               if there were 2 hands on the wheel.

                         ADAM LEAVIIT
               110 miles per hour... How do you
               keep so calm? I mean, really? Is
               it breathing--

                         JANET MAYES
               --Shhhh....

                         RONALD FLEURY
               If somebody was tailing us it'd be
               obvious. This is just standard
               operating speed.

     Al-Ghazi on the edge of his seat, no belt, scanning for
     threats: sidewalks, traffic, rooftops.

                                       KINGDOM 8/18/06    50.


His left hand hand wrapped around the stock of an Mp-5
machine gun. Fleury takes in a deep breath: let's see who
this guy is.

                    RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
          Colonel, have you ever been to the                    
          US?

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
          I have been there only once. I
          spent four days at Quantico... I
          saw your Michael Jordan play for
          the Washington Wizards.

Small laughs.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          You don't know what you missed...
          you should have seen him play for
          our Chicago Bulls.

Fleury nods to Sykes, giving him the go to start in with the
Bad Cop. Throughout the following exchange, we stay TIGHT ON
FLEURY: in control, using Sykes to ask the questions he
"diplomatically" does not want to ask.

                    GRANT SYKES
          You have portable lights on-scene?

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
              (loses his smile)
          Yes. But your team cannot work
          nights.

Janet looks to Leavitt, then Fleury: `what did he say?'
Fleury looks to Sykes, `Keep going...'

                    GRANT SYKES
          We only have seven days: we work
          around the clock.

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
          Five days. And you are not safe at
          night.

                    GRANT SYKES
          We're safe during the day?

Fleury is about to step in when-

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
              (in Arabic, shocking)
          WATCH IT-SLOW!

                                           KINGDOM 8/18/06   51.



A truck 200 yards ahead in the middle of an abrupt U-turn.
Over the median. Dust cloud. Heading back our way. Something
big in the truck's bed. Our vehicle shimmies as Al-Ghazi
flinches, drops his prayer beads. Mp-5 up to the Colonel's         
sight-line, muzzle tracking the truck. Leavitt leans away
from his window as the vehicles pass: streetlights show two
farmers, a camel sitting in the bed. Missed their left turn.

A long, nearly comical moment.

                       ADAM LEAVITT
                 (smartass)
             I don't like camels.                                  

Fleury cycling through different angles. Continues:

                       RONALD FLEURY                               
             Colonel, do you believe Abu Hamza                     
             was responsible for this attack?                      

                       COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
             We don't know.                                        

                       RONALD FLEURY                               
             Were Saudi Police involved in the                     
             attack?                                               

                       COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
             We don't know that either.                            

                        RONALD FLEURY                              
             Any word on what that third big
             blast was?

Al-Ghazi getting tired of the questions: exhausted himself.

                        COLONEL AL-GHAZI                           
             Not yet.

                       GRANT SYKES
             You interviewed witnesses?

                       COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
                 (short-fuse burning)
             We're trying. No one who was close
             enough to see the things we would
             like to know, lived.

                       GRANT SYKES
             Were any of the uniformed bombers
             brother-officers?

No answer.

                         GRANT SYKES (CONT'D)
               Do you know yet?

     No answer. Team feeling the tension. Fleury steps in and
     takes charge.

                         RONALD FLEURY
               You don't know the source of the
               blast, don't know if your own
               Officers were involved, but you
               won't let us work nights?

     Al-Ghazi stanches an explosion. Haytham looks over at his
     Colonel: rarely ever seen him like this. Looks in the rear-       
     view mirror to see Sykes, the man giving the Colonel fits.        
     Sykes catches him looking back, gives him a quick wink into
     the mirror. TIGHT ON Haytham's face: the guilty little smile
     you give when someone takes your boss to task.

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
               47 of my `brother-officers' were
               blown into hundreds of pieces that
               will take months to collect. 80,000
               Officers total, across the country,
               at four uniforms apiece. Thousands
               of people who can sew forgeries.
               Apologies that I don't have
               definitive answers.
                   (beat)
               You're still not working nights.

     Fleury stays quiet, studying, calculating, thinking: we got a
     Handler that's going to be tough to handle.

63   INT. GIDEON YOUNG'S OFFICE - EVENING RUSH HOUR, EST          63

     Director Grace already sits in front of Young's desk.

                         DIRECTOR GRACE
               Good afternoon, Sir.

     Young says nothing, just pulls a memo from his bag, clears
     his throat -- still no eye-contact -- reads aloud like a poor
     man's Orson Welles:

                         GIDEON YOUNG
               `Sunlight is indeed the most
               powerful disinfectant.

                                        KINGDOM 8/18/06   53.

                     GIDEON YOUNG (CONT'D)
          In that spirit I come before this
          Judiciary Committee with a painful
          admission.
              (beat)
          Simply: I've lost all confidence in
          the FBI, especially it's uppermost
          echelon. Entrenched and outmoded,
          the Leadership has shown itself
          fearful of the pioneering thought
          this Committee and I have tried to
          imbue. It is thus an Agency at
          contretemps, hindering our every
          effort.' And by `Committee' I mean
          the fucking SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
          ON TERROR...

Young finally makes eye contact: expecting something like
fear, remorse, back-pedalling...

                    DIRECTOR GRACE
          Senators? Then I'd change
          `outmoded' to `outdated,'
          `echelons' to `ranks' and what in
          God's name is `contretemps?' These
          guys aren't the best and brightest-

Young's face flashes red, seething:

                    GIDEON YOUNG
          -never take the Lord's name in vain
          in this office-

                    DIRECTOR GRACE
          -but you can say `Fucking?'

Young apoplectic now: ready to end the Director right there,
when Grace leans in, lets the vague threat of physical
contact manifest.

                     DIRECTOR GRACE (CONT'D)
          You're going to the Senate Select
          Committee, but not to the President
          who appointed you. Why's that?
              (beat)
          I bet the President wasn't the
          audience you thought he'd be: I'll
          bet he realized you can't have
          Voters asking why the second-
          longest serving FBI Director gets
          fired for doing his job, for
          sending Agents into Saudi Arabia,
          seven months from mid-term
          elections-

                                            KINGDOM 8/18/06    54.



                         GIDEON YOUNG
               -you really want to bet?

     Grace snaps his ID badge off his lapel, puts it on the table.

                         DIRECTOR GRACE
               I do.

     Young's pallor tells us his bluff has been called. Goes
     silent. Grace smells it, finishes him now:

                          DIRECTOR GRACE (CONT'D)
               Westmoreland made all us Officers
               write our own obituaries during
               Tet, when it looked like the Cong
               were going to end it all right
               there. Once we clued-in that life
               was finite, the loss of it no
               longer scared us: the end comes no
               matter what, it's just a question
               of how you want to go out: on your
               feet or on your knees. After that,
               we went out and pulled triggers
               until barrels melted. And Vietnam
               lasted another seven years.
                   (beat)
               The lesson extends to this career:
               I ACT, knowing the end of this job
               will come, no matter what. You
               should do the same.

     Grace waits: nothing else from Young. Stands, snaps his ID
     badge back on his lapel, walks out.

                         DIRECTOR GRACE (CONT'D)
               I'll forward Fleury's reports.

               That's one of the great horrors of

               adds pounds to actresses. Isn't
               that what they say?

                         ADAM LEAVITT
               Who's "they?"

                         JANET MAYES
               That is what they say. Doesn't add
               to crime scenes. Television cameras
               shrink them. Misrepresent. No
               smells. Poor sound. Limited view.
               TV always makes them look smaller.
               You can't feel the hatred on
               television.

     TIGHT ON FLEURY: Quiet and focused, taking everything in.

                         FLEURY
               ...heads on a swivel, people.


66   EXT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER - NEXT MOMENT               66

     Two more security perimeters of SANG surround the Community
     Center: blinding portable lights, heavy machine guns mounted
     in the backs of Humvees track the convoy as it comes to a
     stop: every troop on-guard. The Team tentatively exits: 100
     pairs of glares from heavily-armed SANG.

     Soldiers descend on the Teams' bags, paletts of equipment.
     Long leers at Janet: not so much `sexual' as `wary.' Janet
     goes for her own bag. Haytham goes for it at the same time.
     Their hands accidently touch. Haytham pulls back fast,
     embarrassed.

                         JANET MAYES
               EASY.

     Janet notices the nasty marks around Haytham's right ear.


67   INT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER - NEXT MOMENT               67   

     Florescent lights make it ugly. Haytham dumps duffel-bags by
     their bunks, SANG stack steel travel-boxes from the paletts
     inside. No windows, AC cranked to `coldest.' Americans sealed-
     in - in the name of comfort.

                                        KINGDOM 8/18/06   56.



Janet's area made obvious with a floral partition. She
immediately folds it, puts it into a corner. Haytham watches
her undo his work.

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
          The bathrooms are through that
          door. I will be here tomorrow
          morning so we can begin.

                    FLEURY
          What time tomorrow morning?

                     COLONEL AL-GHAZI                           
          Sunrise.

              (beat)
          When I knock.

Al-Ghazi and Haytham leave. The doors close behind them, then
the sound of a key turning in a lock. The Americans look on,
half-disbelief, half-comedy: locking us in.

                    GRANT SYKES
          That's against fire code.

                    JANET MAYES
          They don't have fire codes. They
          don't have codes other than codes
          of war. They'll lock us in and dial
          up some kind of earth movers if
          they want to. You know that, Sykes.
          Dig a big hole and push us in. Fill
          it up and no one comes calling.
          You're in the jungle now, baby.

Silence as the crew digests this odd little verbal outage.

                    ADAM LEAVITT
              (smiling)
          You alright, girl?

Fleury pulls out his laptop, wakes it up from sleep mode.
Eyes a photo of Kevin on his desktop, picks up the phone.

     Fleury begins unpacking.


68   EXT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER - 4:30 AM                    68

     Pre-dawn: Eight black suburbans parked on the side street:
     waiting. The doors of the first four open in-unison. 20 Arab,
     suited SECURITY GUARDS exit.

     Al-Ghazi unlocks the door to the compound: the team stands
     dressed, waiting. CLOSE-UP: The Team steps out to see
     massive, organized security.

     From one of the vehicles exits a middle aged AMERICAN -
     sweating a bit, hanging back, watching. This is US Deputy
     Chief of Mission, the Embassy's second-in-command: DAMON
     SCHMIDT.

     Another 100 Security CONTRACTORS remain vigilant: SNIPERS on
     roof-tops, in machine-gun nests.

     Schmidt approaches Fleury.

                                        KINGDOM 8/18/06    59.



                    SCHMIDT
              (big smile)
          You are in so much trouble.

                    FLEURY
          Is that right?

                    SCHMIDT
          For sure. I mean, I don't know how
          you did it. Nice work, but if you
          live through this, which I put at
          about fifty percent - if you do,
          your balls are gonna get stretched
          and beaten on. Dig that?

Fleury stares at this freak show. Schmidt sticks out a paw.

                    SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
          Damon Schmidt. State Department.
          I'm in charge of getting you out of
          here.

PRINCE BIN KHALED and his INNER-CIRCLE exit a Suburban and
approach: All in traditional dress. The Prince locks eyes
with Fleury.

IN THE BG, forklifts rumble-hiss to life, placing Jersey
barriers around the community center.

                    SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
          Don't let go of his hand first.
          Major disrespect.

One of the inner-circle, without a word, takes off the FBI-
emblazoned windbreaker worn by Leavitt and places it on a
short-sleeved Janet. Careful not to touch skin.

Only then does Prince Bin Khaled approach. A lone
PHOTOGRAPHER follows: snapping pictures. Different
definitions of personal space: four inches separation as Bin
Khaled greets each Team member in accented English. Janet
last: the pictures suddenly stop. The Prince gives a little
curtsy, no words, steps back to Fleury: the pictures re-
start. Bin Khaled holds Fleury's hand sixth-grade boyfriend-
style.

                    PRINCE BIN KHALED
              (in Arabic)
          This is our level of commitment to
          bringing Terrorists to justice:

Motions to the Americans. No more unflattering a portrait:
pre-coffee, post-twelve hour flight, hours unpacking...

                                        KINGDOM 8/18/06   60.



As the cameras start flashing. Angle on Al-Ghazi and Haytham
placed to stand next to the Americans. Haytham clearly not
comfortable with this kind of attention.

                     PRINCE BIN KHALED (CONT'D)
          We've invited American legal
          officials into our Kingdom despite
          current difficulties between the US
          and Islam. They will observe our
          advanced investigative techniques,
          offering helpful hints.
               (to Fleury in English)
          You will please honor me with your
          presence tonight at my home.
               (beat, a stunted nod)
          Yes.

The Prince turns back to the convoy. Entire entourage
follows. One of the Security Contractors catches the jacket
Janet hurls back at him, tosses it to Leavitt. Convoy gone.
The team turns: 100 glares again. Fleury blinks out the
camera flashes, takes in all the eyeballs.

Fleury looks up at a retreating Damon Schmidt.

                    SCHMIDT
          Nice pictures. You guys ready to go
          home now?

Dead eyes from Fleury. He's clearly not amused.

                    SCHMIDT   (CONT'D)
          OK. If you change   your minds, I got
          a plane fueled up   and ready to go -
          got your name all   over it...

He points a finger gun at Fleury.

                    SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
          Strap your kevlar on tight, people.

SCHMIDT takes off. Sykes by Fleury.

          screams and points and you think
          your constantly about to bag a
          Marlin but you never do and they
          keep pointing and jumping and-

                    FLEURY
          Enough.

Haytham walks off by himself, shaking off the shady Royal
photo vibe, looking back at the Americans. From behind him:

                    POLICE OFFICER
          You're willing to die to protect
          your enemy?

Haytham turns. An older POLICE OFFICER stands with a GROUP of
SANG twenty feet behind him, eyeing Haytham.

Back to Fleury: he looks to Al-Ghazi.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          What did the Prince say?

                     COLONEL AL-GHAZI                           
              (beat)
          That there are more rules than just
          not working at night.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          What rules?

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
          You are here as observers. Not
          investigators.

Fleury tries to remain cool.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          That's not accurate--

Al-Ghazi ignores Fleury.

                     COLONEL AL-GHAZI                           
          --I need to make sure the sites are
          secure. Then you can begin
          observing.

Leavitt looks around at the Security as Al-Ghazi hustles off:

                    ADAM LEAVITT
              (to Fleury)
          How could they get more secure?

The Team slowly realizes they're not going anywhere yet, dump
their bags in a pile, already disgusted.

In the distance, the group of SANG stare back at our team.

68A   INT. LOCATION UNKNOWN - TIME UNKNOWN                         68A

      Hold on an empty 2' X 1' X 6" balsa wood box set on a dirty
      linoleum floor.

      Ancient hands line the balsa wood box with bricks of putty-
      gray plastic explosive. We immediately notice the right hand
      is missing the index and middle fingers. The hands insert
      bright-red blasting caps into the explosives, lengths of
      detonating-wire emanating from each cap.

      Another set of stronger, younger, in-tact hands gently pours
      a mixture into the box now. Ball bearings, children's jacks,
      marbles, razor blades, roofing nails. Everything malevolent
      densities and angles. Some pieces bounce out, run along the
      floor. The younger hands then start pressing/molding the
      pieces of soon-to-be shrapnel into the putty-gray plastic
      explosives.


68B   EXT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER - LATER                      68B

                Saudi Slow Roll.

      Sykes and Fleury lean against the locked door, staring at the
      pathetic sight before them: Janet's truly awful jumper...
      that somehow swishes every time. Before she lands, cocky and
      smooth:

                          JANET MAYES
                Good.

                                             KINGDOM 8/18/06   63.



     Then the metallic swish of the all-weather net. Leavitt boxes
     out air for the non-existent rebound, grabs the ball, chest-
     passes it Great Santini-hard back to Janet who softly sucks
     in the pass. Playing in their cargo pants and hiking boots.

                         LEAVITT
               How do you do that?

     Janet gently bounce-passes it back:

                         JANET MAYES
               Check.

                         LEAVITT
               Don't say `good' again.

     Janet takes the check from Leavitt: before he can react, she
     drains a 30-footer. Same cockiness, different word:

                         JANET
               Bueno.

     Fleury with Sykes still standing in the same spot. Looks up:
     Al-Ghazi coming into the building. Fleury ready to vent until
     something surprises him: breathless, Al-Ghazi has broken a
     wide-sweat hustling back to the Americans. Fleury's face
     relaxes. He pulls a bottle of water out of a cooler, hands
     it to Al-Ghazi.

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI

     Hands in pockets. Soak in the aftermath: shallow but wide
     crater, shredded backstop, nearby buildings torn, blood baked
     into dirt. Fifteen cars.

               The remaining rules: you cannot

                    FLEURY
          I would have thought your primary
          concern was investigating a crime.

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
          And you would be mistaken.

Sykes looks over to Fleury. Crooked smile.

                    SYKES
              (to Fleury)
          I think it's one of those
          "something happens to us... his
          head comes off" kind of deals.
              (to Al-Ghazi)
          Is it one of those kind of deals,
          Colonel?                                              

Al-Ghazi ignores Sykes.

                    FLEURY
          So, if you're not running the
          investigation...who is?

Al-Ghazi motions to 50 MEN in uniforms different than his:
SANG troops digging, bagging evidence, marking the scene with
red-flags.

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
          The National Guard's Military
          Police Brigade is conducting the

The Team: so we're on Tour. Fleury still silent.

                    ADAM LEAVITT
          I thought the SANG were soldiers--

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
          --the bombers didn't wear a
          soldier's uniform. They wore mine.

Fleury finally speaks, asking the most important question:

                    RONALD FLEURY
          Who is in charge of the
          investigation then?

Al-Ghazi points to a Man we've seen before, General Abdul-
Malik. Haytham's Interrogator. He pours over a table 20 feet
away: maps, blueprints, utility schematics spread before him.

                                         KINGDOM 8/18/06   65.



                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
          General Abdul-Malik. He's given us
          permission to walk through each
          crime-scene.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          To walk through? Are you kidding
          me?

                      COLONEL AL-GHAZI                           
          I am not.

Starting to get heated.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          Get him over here now and let's
          clarify this situation.

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
          There is no lack of clarification.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          There sure as hell is! I don't know
          what kind of game you're playing
          but you got the wrong guy, Colonel                     
          Al-Ghazi! That was not the deal-

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
              (getting hot)
          This is not a game show, Mr.
          Fleury! There are no deals made
          here. There is me telling you what
          you may or may not do and there is
          you doing it.

Beat. As Al-Ghazi stabilizes...

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                    
          You will be permitted to walk
          through the crime scenes. When we
          have determined that it is safe.

A stand off. Fleury eyes Al-Ghazi. Trying to figure this guy
out.

Sees something that looks like a flash of embarrassment in Al-
Ghazi's eyes: unable to perform his profession, relegated to
Tour Guide. Leavitt begins taking notes. Haytham sees his
notebook, snaps his fingers at Al-Ghazi who looks, nods: let
him.

                      RONALD FLEURY
          OK.

                                              KINGDOM 8/18/06   66.



     Fleury tight-grins. Looks off. In one of the apartments, he
     sees a PERSON looking down at them from behind a curtain.

     He tries a new tactic.

                         RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
               How have you guys been doing with
               the witnesses?

                         AL-GHAZI
               What witnesses?

     Al-Ghazi just stares at Fleury.

                         FLEURY
               I'm guessing there are a bunch of
               Americans, Brits... Australians?
               Someone must have seen something.
               I'm sure they're just dying to talk
               to you guys, seeing as how the
               killers were wearing your uniforms.
               That must be a real confidence
               booster for them.

     Al-Ghazi silent, staring.

                         FLEURY (CONT'D)
               Let me talk to them.

     Al-Ghazi looks unsure. He was not expecting this.


71   EXT. RIPON FAMILY HOME                                       71

     Fleury and Al-Ghazi walk up the front walk. Fleury noticing
     kids bikes, hockey gear, a comfortable easy chair covered in
     fur outside on the front porch, toy guns.


72   INT. RIPON FAMILY HOME - MOMENTS LATER                       72

     Fleury sits with the RIPONS: EARL (40s) JANINE, his wife
     (30s), and MADDY, Earl's mother (late 60s). Earl sits on an
     ugly couch, a plywood sheet right above their heads. Everyone
     uneasy save the CAT in Maddy's lap. Fleury waves off a bottle
     of water from Janine. Al-Ghazi hovers awkwardly by the front
     door.

     AWKWARD INTERVIEW:

                         EARL
               There's still a couple of hundred
               of us living on the compound.

                                       KINGDOM 8/18/06     67.



                    RONALD FLEURY
          Why Saudi Arabia?

A moment as Earl and Janine get a bit defensive:

                    EARL
          Neither of us did anymore schooling
          than Electra High, Electra Texas.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          OK.

Al-Ghazi sees Janine smile, squeeze Earl's hand tighter.

                    EARL
          And the jobs here pay twice what
          you'd make in Midland or the Gulf
          a' Mexico. Plus the house is free.

Earl's mother Maddy looks at Fleury, pets the cat.

                    JANINE RIPON
          I call it combat pay. This place
          has gone Guns - Guns - Guns.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          So has Everyone else now.

                    JANINE
          My girlfriends in Texas spend their
          combat pay on diamonds... I spent
          mine on a safe room.

                    RONALD FLEURY
              (chuckles)
          Two nights back. Can you start one
          second before you knew anything was
          wrong?

                    JANINE
          We didn't really see anything. Just
          hit the ground and hustled to the
          safe room. Closed our eyes and
          prayed. It was so fast. So loud.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          So you really didn't see anything.

                    MADDY
          I hit the deck. Horrible.

                    JANINE
          Not `til after. Just the screams--

                                            KINGDOM 8/18/06   68.



                         EARL
               -- the kids... they were screaming.
               That got me out of the house. Those
               kids.

                         FLEURY
               Which kids were those?

                         JANINE
               The Jackson kids. Tracy Jackson
               next door was murdered looking out
               her window...front of her children.
               No safe room over there...
                   (right at Al-Ghazi)
               Not even the Men that did this
               should die in front a' their
               babies.

     Fleury lets moments pass. Earl rubs his wife's leg, trying to
     comfort her. Al-Ghazi hides emotion.

                         RONALD FLEURY
               She live with her husband?

                         EARL
               Aaron.

                          RONALD FLEURY
                   (beat)
               If I'm facing your house, is the
               Jackson home to the right or left?

                         JANINE
               Left.

     Fleury looks out the window towards the Jackson house.


73   EXT. JACKSON HOME - SAME MOMENT                            73

     Next door to the Ripons. Fleury knocks. Door opens: a sad MAN
     with black bags under dying eyes. Disgusted-resigned breath
     through a half-open mouth. Silver watch and Polo insignia...
     sees Al-Ghazi, eyes come alive, teeth grit.

                         RONALD FLEURY
               Mr. Aaron Jackson?

                         AARON JACKSON
                   (re: Al-Ghazi)
               Get him away from me-

                                        KINGDOM 8/18/06   69.



                    RONALD FLEURY
          -easy, Sir. He's a friend to us-

                    AARON JACKSON
          -I don't know either one a' you.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          I'm Special Agent Ronald Fleury of
          the FBI. This is Colonel Al-Ghazi                     
          with the Saudi State Police-

                    AARON JACKSON
          -the Police: they attacked.

Al-Ghazi quietly backs away, walks away. Fleury looks after
him, turns back to Mr. Jackson who stares after Al-Ghazi:
hate. Fleury unsure what to do next.

                    AARON JACKSON (CONT'D)
          I just put my boys down for the
          first time in two days. I can't
          wake `em and sure as hell can't be
          gone if they stir on their own.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          Can I come back?

                       AARON JACKSON
                 (too loud)
          WHY?

                    RONALD FLEURY
          Your boys...

Jackson remembers the warning he just spoke...

                    RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
          To ask about two nights ago.

Fresh tears re-animate his face:

                    AARON JACKSON
          When my wife's jaw was shot off in
          front of our sons? My sons who sat
          with her while she bled to death?
          Couldn't speak because she didn't
          have the bottom of her face and I
          wasn't home and my baby boys are
          destroyed for life and my five year-
          old had a box of band-aids in his
          hand when I finally got home?

                                              KINGDOM 8/18/06   70.



     Silence outside of Mr. Jackson's sobbing. Fleury sick to his
     stomach. Desperate to let this man alone. No eye contact.

                         RONALD FLEURY
               ...I won't pretend to know...

     Aaron Jackson settles, wipes away tears, appreciates the
     honesty. Then bites back into his rage:

                          AARON JACKSON
               Kill everyone that had something to
               do with this. Everyone related to
               them. Everyone who knew them.
                   (beat)
               And all you'd be doing is their
               recruiting for them... It's an
               entire generation: not small and
               isolated like they say. But a
               generation that thinks what they
               did to my wife, to my children, is
               a "calling"...

                         RONALD FLEURY
               Up the street, there was a wreck,
               did you see any-

                         AARON JACKSON
               -notice how it wouldn't take a lot
               to disguise your friend
                   (points to Al-Ghazi)
               as a Mexican? Think he couldn't
               handle crossing our deserts? Look
               around!

                         RONALD FLEURY
               Aaron-

                         AARON JACKSON
                   (explodes)
               -LET ME FINISH GOD DAMN YOU-

     A child's scream from inside. Piercing. Scary. Jackson goes
     red, clenched fists, steps to Fleury who takes an instinctive
     step backward, guard-up. Jackson stops, spins back inside. A
     door slam that rattles the plywood sheet covering the
     shattered window. The screams become night terror shrieks.


74   EXT. JACKSON HOME                                            74

     A LONG, SAD BEAT, as Fleury and Al-Ghazi stand alone in front
     of the Jackson house.

                                             KINGDOM 8/18/06   71.



                         RONALD FLEURY
                   (to Al-Ghazi)
               Can we tour the compound? Can we
               please do that?

     Slow nod from Al-Ghazi.


75   EXT. BOMB SITE - LATER                                      75

     The team tours the site.

     As they fan out. They walk casually, but focused through the
     first bomb site. An inquisitive Mayes, already peering into a
     mostly in-tact car, halfway out of its parking spot. Al-Ghazi
     and Haytham watch the Americans like mother-hens.

                         JANET MAYES
               He or she almost made it.

     Fleury steps, looks inside: blood and safety glass coat the
     seat. Janet points to keys in the ignition: still at the `on'
     position. Then the stick-shift, pulled to the back right:
     reverse. The shift-knob bloody...

                         JANET MAYES (CONT'D)
                   (beat, quieter)
               Makes me think of the Trade Centers
               -- the people on the floors above
               the impacts -- no matter how fast
               or strong or smart you are, if
               you're in the wrong spot, `it' will
               not let you get away.

                         FLEURY
               That's what makes this a War.

     Sykes notices something on the ground... he picks up a
     military detonator, discretely hands it over to Fleury.
     Fleury quietly pockets it.


76   EXT. THIRD BLAST SITE - MOMENTS LATER                       76

     Structures 100 feet away look like they've been hit with a
     God-sized sawed-off. The crater: 25-feet wide, 7-feet deep.
     Blackened frames and bits of vehicles circle the crater. The
     bottom of the crater filled with water. A syphon-pump works
     overtime. No SANG Investigators around.

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.)                      
               About one hour into the rescue.

                         ADAM LEAVITT
               Hit a water main?

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
               No -- from the tanks of this fire
               engine: that's the water that
               didn't evaporate in the blast.

     Al-Ghazi points to a mass of black metal: looks like a fire
     truck the way a Jackson Pollock looks like the Mona Lisa.
     Leavitt and Grant stand back. Quiet:

                         GRANT SYKES
                   (eyes on Fleury)
               Hole is the case. See, there's
               "evidence" down in that hole. You
               understand evidence? Little things
               that are "clues." Clues can be very
               helpful to a fella when he's trying
               to solve a crime.

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
               I understand that.

                         GRANT SYKES
               Glad to hear it. So can we get in
               there?

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
               No.

     Sykes holds Al-Ghazi's gaze. Smiles.

                         GRANT SYKES
               OK.

     Fleury is taking in the entire crime scene. He notices a four
     story building half a mile off the perimeter.

     He watches Al-Ghazi rip at a chunk of floorboard wedged into
     the mud, bag it himself, search for someone to give it too.
     Nobody. Sets it down. Stands, wipes his hands hard on his
     pants. Fleury could swear the dirt stains are intentional:
     trying to feel like he's doing something.


77   EXT. DESERTED STREET, AL-RAHMAH - MOMENTS LATER            77

     The Land Cruiser Haytham rammed - driver's side crushed,
     bullet holes, out-of-control skid-marks, asphalt scars from
     the snapped drive shaft...

                                         KINGDOM 8/18/06   73.



Fleury is moving around the scene, restaging the shoot out.
Instantly lining up the angles.

Leavitt's taking digital snaps of the shattered Land Cruiser.
Through the viewfinder: the caved-in door. Two snaps.

A SANG passes Adam, his gun aimed a touch high.

                    ADAM LEAVITT
              (to Fleury)
          A little high...

                    FLEURY
              (to SANG, "Lower," in
               Arabic)
          Watt-tee...

                    ADAM LEAVITT
          Watt-tee fuck (alt: "Watt-tee
          hell...") is his gun doing up so
          high?

                     COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
              (to Fleury)
          This vehicle was stolen. Two
          drivers murdered. A team outside
          the blast-radius...shooting at
          anything. Everyone.
              (beat)
          Sergeant Haytham ended this part.

                    ADAM LEAVITT
              (to Al-Ghazi)
          Are the Shooters in-custody-

                    SERGEANT HAYTHAM
          -dead.

So Sergeant Haytham speaks English...

                    FLEURY
          Were any of these shooters your
          men?

                    SERGEANT HAYTHAM
          No.

Fleury's thinking, looking into the car. Searching the
horizon, he spots a distant apartment building providing a
view of the crime scene.

                                              KINGDOM 8/18/06    74.



                           FLEURY
                 They got into the compound.
                 Somehow...took control of this
                 vehicle. I'm guessing they didn't
                 politely ask whoever was in this
                 car if they could take it for a
                 little ride?

       Fleury gets in the car, checking out ballistic shreds in the
       back of the passenger seat headrest.

                           AL-GHAZI
                 No, they didn't. There were two
                 officers in the car. Both were
                 executed.

                            FLEURY
                 I understand that. Those men were
                 your men--

                           SERGEANT HAYTHAM
                 -- they were. They were Police.

                              FLEURY
                 I'm sorry.

       Al-Ghazi offers the slightest of nods to Fleury.

                           FLEURY (CONT'D)
                 Where was this car when they hit
                 it?


a77A   EXT. AL-RAHMAH - MAIN GATE                                a77A

       Al-Ghazi leads our team to the main gate.    Sykes and Fleury
       follow close.

                           COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
                 Security is a combination of the
                 police and military.

       Leavitt and Mayes lag behind a bit. Leavitt makes eye
       contact with a YOUNG SAUDI behind the .50 caliber.

                           JANET MAYES
                 Good news is that if he shoots you,
                 he's gonna shoot you sitting on an
                 American tank... with an American-
                 made bullet. So, it's kind of "all
                 in the family."

                          ADAM LEAVITT
                How about we get into those
                American Suburbans... with their
                American A/C...

      Al-Ghazi continues the tour as Fleury once again notes the
      familiar apartment off in the distance.


77A   EXT. AL-RAHMAH - SECURITY STATION CAR PARK - LATER        77A

      A car port. Fleury and team moving around the area. Fleury
      picks up some broken glass from the ground.

                          FLEURY
                The car was parked here?

                             AL-GHAZI
                Yes.

                             FLEURY
                Backed in?

                             AL-GHAZI
                Yes.

      Fleury studies the scene.

                          FLEURY
                They were attacked from the front.
                Must have assumed the killers were
                fellow officers... Have any of
                these men been identified?

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
                Not yet. We will check certain
                neighborhoods. It is likely that
                the four men prayed at the same
                Mosque.

                          JANET MAYES
                The same Mosque is enough to
                identify them, link them to a cell?

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
                Yes. If the Mosque is in Suweidi.

                             ADAM LEAVITT
                Suweidi?

                    JANET MAYES
          Suweidi is a known militant
          stonghold. Al-Qaeda could recruit
          from storefronts.

On Fleury: he looks back at the homes, then up and around: He
locks on the OBSERVATION BUILDING in the distance.

                    FLEURY
          Can we go to check out some of
          these surrounding buildings?

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
          Why?

                    FLEURY
          Seems reasonable that the Planner
          had to observe and based on Hamza's
          past history, it's consistent that
          he would want to video the attack.
          Is that true? Is that accurate?

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
          That is true.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          Well, in order to video, in order
          to observe, you need a view.

Fleury points to one particular building.

                    FLEURY
          That building sees all three crime
          scenes.

Al-Ghazi looks up to the building. Back to Fleury.

                     COLONEL AL-GHAZI                           
              (beat)
          It's outside the walls-

                    ADAM LEAVITT
          -c'mon now. This is insane: we got
          enough security to invade Suweidi,
          let alone that building-

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
          -no you don't.

                    FLEURY
              (to Al-Ghazi, respectful)
          Could you ask?
                    (MORE)

                                              KINGDOM 8/18/06   77.

                         FLEURY (CONT'D)
               We're already seeing the crime-
               scenes individually -- why not all
               at once?

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI                              
               Any answer will take-

                         FLEURY
               -time. I understand.

     Fleury speaks slowly and clearly now: like he's cementing his
     words in his own head as he speaks them.

                         FLEURY (CONT'D)
               You have to ask the General, then
               the General would ask the Prince.
               Does it go higher or is that... is
               the Prince the end of the chain?

     Al-Ghazi hesitates, can't help but be charmed. Fleury clearly
     knows when to step-on or lay-off the gas. He's smooth... and
     HIGHLY EFFECTIVE: Al-Ghazi nods `yes' to the strange half-
     question.

                          FLEURY (CONT'D)
               We'll be at the Community Center.

               Janet, wanna play hoops?


78   INT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER HOOPS COURT - NOON           78   

     We're in the big gym as our team sits and waits. Leavitt taps     
     on a laptop.                                                      

     Janet shoots free throws by herself.

                         JANET MAYES
               This is the kind of radical
               circumstance that could have
               seriously upped Shaq's free throw
               percentages. Take a man. Ship him
               off to Riyadh. No phones, constant
               threat of death, no girls, no hip
               hop. Nothing... just free throws.
               Shaq, he'd be shooting at least
               seventy percent. Lakers would still
               be together. Kobe and Shaq lovers
               forever.

     Leavitt calls to Fleury.                                          

                         LEAVITT                                       
               Hey, Boss... check this out.

      Fleury moves over to Leavitt. Checks out the screen.              

                          LEAVITT (CONT'D)

      Fleury studies the footage. Backs it up plays it again and        
      again.                                                            


78A   INT. LOCATION UNKNOWN - TIME UNKNOWN                        78A

      A set of stronger, younger, in-tact hands gently pours a
      mixture into a box now. Ball bearings, children's jacks,
      marbles, razor blades, roofing nails: everything malevolent
      densities and angles. Some pieces bounce out, run along the
      floor. The younger hands then start pressing/molding the
      pieces of soon-to-be shrapnel into the putty.


79    EXT. RIYADH SUBURB NEAR COMPOUND - AFTERNOON                 79

      Five car convoy moving quickly through the city.


80    EXT. SPOTTER APARTMENT- LATER                                80

      Our convoy pulls up in front of the apartment. They exit the
      vehicles. Our team stands surrounded by a 50-man security
      detail, rifle-stocks to shoulders. Double-time it - outside
      the walls now, hostile territory. Two-man sniper teams out
      front. Al-Ghazi ten steps ahead.

      A SANG five car security CREW pulls up, tracking Fleury and
      company. A stand off between the two police forces.


81    EXT. SPOTTER APARTMENT - NEXT MOMENT                         81

      The SANG Officer in-charge steps to Al-Ghazi. In Arabic:

                          SANG OFFICER
                This is unacceptable.

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
          It's cleared with General Abdul-
          Malik. We have five minutes here.

                    SPECIAL FORCES OFFICER
          We were told they must remain in
          the vehicles...

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
          That is not true...

                    SPECIAL FORCES OFFICER
          They must stay in the Toyotas-

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
          -report me then when you get in-
          touch with the General-

-Officer reaches down from nowhere and hammers Al-Ghazi open-
handed as Al-Ghazi tries to step past. Collective shock.

In that breath, Haytham punishes the Officer with a left-
cross: knees buckle before he comprehends what hit him.
Haytham's kick follows, catches the Officer in the sternum as
he hits ground.

Al-Ghazi shakes it out, trades blows with the SANG second in-
command.

Leavitt moves, catches a rifle butt to the shoulder after two
steps. Fleury aims, drills the Soldier that butted Leavitt:
instant night-night. Another SANG steps up. Fleury throats
him, knee caps him, and grabs his weapon before the dude hits
the ground.

Fleury can obviously fight... all the above happens in four
seconds.

Then, a `knock-it-off' gunshot aimed at the sky pops one-foot
from Janet's head. We hear what she hears: one half-second of
the shot, then the big ring. On her knees immediately, hand
over her ear. In response: heavy-caliber gunfire flies: group
flinch-n-crouch. The warning shots from a .50-caliber mounted
on a Humvee racing this way from Al-Rahmah: dust plumes from
the speed. Members of the security detail and the Special
Forces go Mexican stand-off.

                    JANET MAYES
          Tell me it didn't burst-tell me it
          didn't burst-

     Al-Ghazi the first to her, touching her hand to pull it away
     from the ear. A SANG nearby sees this: spits two inches from
     Al-Ghazi. Al-Ghazi leans to Janet's non-ringing side:

                            COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
               No blood.

     The Humvee now slides to stop ten feet from the fracas.
     General Abdul-Malik out of the passenger seat, in Arabic:

                            GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
               WHO FIRED?

     That Soldier's hand goes up sheepish. Two men out of the
     Humvee's backseat break him down, face first in the dirt:
     cuff him, lock him in the vehicle.

                            GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK (CONT'D)
               AND WHY?

                         SPECIAL FORCES OFFICER
                   (standing, doubled over)
               A disagreement.

     The General grabs the Officer by the back of his head: an
     abusive Dad. Walks him to the side.

                         GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
                   (back to Al-Ghazi)
               FIVE MINUTES.

     Al-Ghazi looks back down at Janet, at Leavitt's bruise, at
     the man Fleury knocked out. Angry. Impressed: fought
     alongside him. Haytham hasn't moved an inch, not even when
     the General came, chin raised to an entire platoon: say when.

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI                               
                   (to Fleury)
               Five minutes.

     The SANG move back. The team staggered, slowly remembering
     why they're here in the first place, finally make their way
     to the Roof Top.


82   EXT. ROOF TOP - CONTINUOUS                                    82   

     Fleury finds a table with a view. Tabletop: holes and finger-
     paint stains. Al-Ghazi three feet away. Both look in the same
     direction: two Tigers being held back.

                                       KINGDOM 8/18/06   81.



Fleury's studying the housing compound through a video          
camera, comparing the images on his camera with what he saw     
posted on the internet.

          Look for yourself.                                    

Al-Ghazi takes the camera from Fleury. He lines up the same     
shots we saw posted on Leavitt's computer: clearly a match.     
This is where they shot the video                               

                    AL-GHAZI                                    
          He was here...                                        

Another long moment. Al-Ghazi looks at the table, discarded
trash: the Capri Sun containers, the candy wrappers.

                     RONALD FLEURY                              
          Formed the plan up here: saw
          everything he could hit.
              (beat)
          Way too pretty a' plan to have been
          fully hatched on just one visit. He
          came here a couple times.

Al-Ghazi quiet for a long while. Then he reciprocates:          

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
          The man who did this is a Saudi -                     
          this place, this neighborhood... if                   
          foreigners were up here, someone
          would say something.

Fleury looks over to the two dozen LOCALS peering out with
suspicion at them on the rooftop.

                    FLEURY
          I see.

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
          Nobody's talking. Here, many people                   
          love Hamza - they think of him like                   
          Bin Laden. Like your Robin Hood.                      

Fleury smiles small at whatever just passed between them. Al-
Ghazi stays stoic, then looks straight at Fleury:

                                         KINGDOM 8/18/06   82.



                       COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                  
            A man who thinks of something like
            this ...while maybe his family
            played around him... scares me more
            than I have words to express.
            Shaytan...

                      RONALD FLEURY
                (refocusing)
            Two big answers in two small
            minutes. Imagine if we had a couple
            days together.

Al-Ghazi pauses.

                      RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
            I'm sure the General is good
            guy...and I'm just as sure he's no
            Investigator.

Al-Ghazi stands still, silent. Fleury reaches into his
pocket. Reveals the detonator to Al-Ghazi. Al-Ghazi reaches
to take it. Fleury holds it for a BEAT...

                      RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
            Let me help you.

He hands the detonator to Al-Ghazi.    Al-Ghazi now pockets it.

A BEAT...

                      COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
            We break now: too hot to work
            outdoors. Then we will leave for
            the Palace.

                      RONALD FLEURY
            And I imagine that will run until
            sundown?

                       COLONEL AL-GHAZI                           
                (beat)
            I had televisions delivered to your
            quarters to pass the downtime.

Fleury just nods back.

                      COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                   
            Miss Mayes will not attend this
            evening. Men only.

Fleury looks over to Janet. Hurt, yet extremely defiant, she
looks ready to attack anything that comes near her.

                                               KINGDOM 8/18/06   83.



                         FLEURY
               You want to tell her that?


83   EXT. CHEVY SUBURBAN, RIYADH SUBURBS - EARLY EVENING           83

     Cobra gunships covering the convoy as it blurs past police
     checkpoint after police checkpoint. Intersections shut down.
     Bracketed front and back by Saudi Humvees.


84   INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN, RIYADH SUBURBS - NEXT MOMENT             84

     Al-Ghazi in the passenger seat, hand on the stock of his Mp-
     5: again searching for threats. Our team in back, freshly
     scrubbed, collared-Polos as formal as anyone thought to pack.
     Team frustration has evolved into angry acceptance.

     The convoy zipping alongside a wall now: desert-orange in
     color, twelve-feet high, blue ottoman tiles running the
     length of the wall's horizontal center-line.

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI                               
               We're here.

     The helicopters peel off at steep angles, the sound of the
     rotors reverberating in your chest. Leavitt watching them go:

                            ADAM LEAVITT
               Big wall.

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI                               
               It's a big palace.


85   INT. PRINCE BIN KHALED'S PALACE - DAY                         85

     Majlis - a Saudi political ceremony in which Saudi citizens
     and local politicians (most aristocratic and exclusive) are
     permitted a brief audience with the Prince. A bizarre
     receiving line of sorts.

     Our team moves through a massive marble hallway towards the
     ceremony.

                         ADAM LEAVITT
               How many Princes are there?

                            COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
               Over 5000.

                         RONALD FLEURY
               They all get palaces this big?

                                                KINGDOM 8/18/06   84.



                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI                               
                Some get bigger.

                          ADAM LEAVITT
                Who pays for all this?

                          GRANT SYKES
                General Motors, Ford, Chevrolet...

                          ADAM LEAVITT
                Hey, man - I drive a Hybrid.

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI                               
                    (a beat...)
                The Prince will ask you about your
                flight, the accommodations...lite
                subjects. If he offers you the
                chance to hold his Raptors, don't
                flinch: it's a compliment.

                          ADAM LEAVITT
                    (to Grant: genuine worry)
                What's a Raptor?

      Damon Schmidt appears.


85A   INT. PRINCE BIN KHALED'S PALACE - LATER                      85A

      The Prince sits on a sea of pillows. There are several small
      flat screens playing business reports, CNN and Al-Jazeera.

      Seen from behind the Prince: everyone but Leavitt standing
      next to faces we've never seen. The table holds six gold
      serving platters. Enough food to kill a famine, tended by a
      frenzy of servants.

      Sykes puts a hand over his cup to stop the constant tea re-
      fill.

      Leavitt stands to the Prince's left, thick leather glove on
      his hand, a falcon perched on it. Leavitt holds it away from
      the rest of his body like he's already made peace with losing
      the arm. Servants hold three others close-by.

                          PRINCE BIN KHALED
                His talons slice bone.

                          ADAM LEAVITT
                Super.

                                       KINGDOM 8/18/06   85.



                    PRINCE BIN KHALED
          That's my most prolific Hunter. I'm
          trying to teach his friends there
          by example, but I fear it's
          something you're born with or not.
          Do you agree, Mr. Ronald? Innate or
          not at all?

                    RONALD FLEURY
          I do.

                    PRINCE BIN KHALED
              (nodding: I could tell)
          What have you seen so far of our
          Kingdom? -- and know I can arrange
          tours anywhere within our borders.

When I bull-rush our hosts you'll know it: In his quiet, calm-
amidst-the-bullets tone:

                    RONALD FLEURY
          I've seen that the man who planned
          the worst crime in your Kingdom's
          history is without a doubt Saudi...

Pin-drop silence in response to Fleury murdering the Prince's
"lite subjects," his attempt to extend the gilded circle-jerk
by offering tours. Bin Khaled's face sinks to gray again
after the excited pink of talking about his Falcons. His hand
slowly moves back over his stomach: Napoleon's ulcers. As
Fleury speaks, people unconsciously put their tea-cups down,
look up at him with wide-eyes.

                     RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
          ..and that if you walk 300
          kilometers from the compound, you
          will find a rooftop where the
          attacks were planned. I've seen
          that the person in this room "born
          with it" is right there...
              (points at a gawking Al-
               Ghazi)
          Everything I just said came from
          Colonel Al-Ghazi: his observations                     
          of the scene while he was
          protecting us. And I think you're
          absolutely right Sir: that kind of
          instinct can't be taught: not to
          Falcons. Definitely not to SANG
          Generals. Innate or not at all.
              (beat)
          You want the murder to stop as much
          as I do. Let us help.

                                        KINGDOM 8/18/06   86.



The Prince stares at Fleury, cataloguing everything Fleury
just said. Stands. In Arabic:

                    PRINCE BIN KHALED
          Colonel Al-Ghazi, a word.                             

As the Prince walks out with Al-Ghazi, he signals another
corps of servants to serve another round of cups: coffee.
Dinner over. A servant takes the Falcon from Leavitt just as
he was starting to smile at it.

Fleury sips his coffee. Schmidt and Sykes approach.

                    GRANT SYKES
          That was impressive.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          Think it will work?

                    GRANT SYKES
          Yeah. Maybe. I mean, you can only
          play the "I'm going to the press
          card" like three more times. So,
          maybe.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          They're paranoid and overly self-
          protective.

                    DAMON SCHMIDT
          They aren't protecting anyone.
          There's no conspiracy. They're just
          terrified. Finally. The Saudis have
          finally seen the Monsters they
          helped create, because those
          Monsters have come home. And if
          Saudis don't catch Saudi Monsters,
          that's the end.

Fleury opens his mouth to interrupt.

                    DAMON SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
              (right through Fleury's
               attempt to speak)
          And that end could come double-
          quick if they let the US "Shaytan"
          catch those Monsters for them.
              (Fleury silent, gets it)
          Because that's what the Saudi on
          the street suspects: the only thing
          keeping the Royal Family upright is
          American evil.

                            KINGDOM 8/18/06   87.



          GRANT SYKES
That's dead on accurate. Very
impressive. That's why they're
making it hard on us, and that's
why he wants to help `em turn the
screws.

          RONALD FLEURY
They can have every shred of credit-

          DAMON SCHMIDT
-you see the slums on the way in?

          RONALD FLEURY
Yeah.

          DAMON SCHMIDT
See that even though their homes
are falling down, they had
satellite dishes bolted on?

          RONALD FLEURY
Yeah...

          DAMON SCHMIDT
Everyone already knows you're here.
Credit? If the Saudis cracked this
Cell while these servants were
pouring coffee, Al-Jazeera still
leads the story with your Team.

          RONALD FLEURY
Have you been to the crime-scene?

          DAMON SCHMIDT
No-

          RONALD FLEURY
-if you had, you'd see the evil
work of real Talent. The kind that
doesn't stop until it's forced.

          DAMON SCHMIDT
And the path to Hell is paved with
good intentions.

          RONALD FLEURY
You having fun?

          DAMON SCHMIDT
    (genuine smile)
Beats hell outta visa-stamping.
    (smile vanishing)
          (MORE)

                                             KINGDOM 8/18/06   88.

                         DAMON SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
               You're on an island. I hope you
               know how to get off.

                         RONALD FLEURY
               By catching Abu Hamza.

     Raising his coffee, toasting Fleury's cup:

                         DAMON SCHMIDT
               Then here's to you. Let's bet: when
               this Colonel Al-Ghazi comes out,                       
               he's in-charge of the investigation
               -if so, you set me up on a date
               with Janet Mayes.


86   INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN, RIYADH SUBURBS - NIGHT                 86

     100 m.p.h. Semi-grins from the Team: how the fuck did he do
     that? Al-Ghazi on a cell, rattling orders in excited Arabic:

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
               ... every investigator on-scene by
               midnight, 50 more portable lights,
               three more pumps-

                           RONALD FLEURY
                   (to   Leavitt)
               Do me a   favor and tell Janet that
               she and   Damon Schmidt got a date
               when he   gets back to the States.

     Al-Ghazi points into darkness...

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
               The rules still stand.
                   (beat)
               But tomorrow will be a new day.


87   INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - SAME MOMENT                         87

     TIGHT ON blasting caps, military detonators, nails, wing-
     nuts, bolts, jacks, marbles... young hands feed lengths of
     detonating wire through pre-drilled holes on a wooden cover.
     The cover is attached to the box with nails and a rubber
     mallet: no sparks. The wires are braided into one, clipped to
     a lead on a servo-motor attached to the box-top.

     A vehicle is being fitted with tire guards and heavy-duty
     crash bumpers - all as a man quietly talks.

                                            KINGDOM 8/18/06   89.



     WIDEN to reveal the MAN, being VIDEOTAPED: foretelling of new
     threats, face obscured by his head wrap. Several other MEN
     watch and listen.

     TIGHT ON the man's eyes. REVEAL PHOTOS on a nearby table: the
     Al-Rahmah compound, Fleury with Al-Ghazi, Leavitt and Mayes,
     Sykes and Haytham.

                                                       CUT TO:


88   EXT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER - MORNING, SECOND DAY       88

     Half-assed gardening party. Al-Ghazi worked through the
     night, hasn't slept since we last saw him. Looks like it.

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
               From now on, any evidence you find
               you hand over.

     Al-Ghazi smiles...

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                    
               I'm "all ears," Special Agent
               Fleury.

                         RONALD FLEURY
               We should start with the dead
               shooters.

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
               They had no identification on them.
               Fingerprints and dental have come
               up empty.

                         RONALD FLEURY
               Can we photograph all three of
               them? Couple hundred copies each...

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
               No problem.

                          RONALD FLEURY
               Good. If it's OK with you, I'd like
               to suggest we split up as
               follows...

     Sykes and Leavitt can't help small smiles. Finally getting to

     Grant at the Crater. Three brand-new industrial-sized pumps       
     draining it. 30 Police INVESTIGATORS watch Sykes.

                   (to the Saudis)

               You get that?

     Dead, confused stares from the Saudis into the mud hole...

     He smiles, watches another Officer write Saudi translations
     on the stainless-steel paint cans into which you load
     evidence: shrapnel, soil, DNA, shells, etc.


90   EXT. DEATH SQUAD SCENE, AL-RAHMAH - SAME MOMENT              90

     A JUNIOR OFFICER double-times it to Al-Ghazi with a stack of
     photos: Rough head-shots of the three dead SHOOTERS. Fleury
     takes some, hands the rest back to Al-Ghazi.

                         RONALD FLEURY
               Have him pass these out to the
               compound security. See if anybody
               knows them.

     Fleury, Leavitt, and Al-Ghazi walk past the Land Cruiser
     Haytham took out. 15 Police INVESTIGATORS on-scene: Leavitt
     stops, drops his bag. Al-Ghazi introduces him to the Officer
     in-charge.

     Leavitt opens his evidence kit. A couple of Police can't help
     but sneak a peek, checking out what the American's got
     inside.


91   INT. RIPON HOME - LATER                                      91

     Fleury stands with Al-Ghazi back in the Ripon home.

                         RONALD FLEURY
               Would you mind doing one more thing
               for me?

                       EARL
          No, Sir.

Fleury pulls out the photographs.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          Could you tell me if you recognize
          any of these men?

Fleury puts the three photographs down on the dining room
table: not pretty pictures. Earl and Janine study the photos.

                    JANINE
          ...Horrible.

A few moments, then:

                    EARL
          I don't know any of them.

Fleury thinks a minute. Looks outside.

                    FLEURY
          I'm just wondering. That chair out
          side. Looks like it gets a lot of
          wear. Looks comfortable.

                    EARL
          That my mom's chair.

                    FLEURY
          See, that's exactly what I was
          thinking. I'm guessing she spends a
          lot of time sitting outside?

                       EARL
          All day.

                    FLEURY
          She must pretty much see it all.
          Right?

                       EARL
          She does.

                    FLEURY
          Where is she?

                    EARL
          She's sleeping.

Pause: Fleury slow nods, then...

                      FLEURY
            Let's wake her up.


TIME CUT:

Maddy up at the dinning room table, looking down at the
photos.

                      MADDY
            I've seen him.

                      RONALD FLEURY
            Where?

Maddy thinking...

                      MADDY
            Like, a week ago. Twice I've seen
            him. Watering...With the garden
            crews. I remember he was wearing a
            Liza Minnelli T-shirt. I thought
            that was funny.

                      RONALD FLEURY
            What about the others?

                      MADDY
                (closer examination)
            No. Just him. I remember the T-
            shirt. I remember thinking it was
            odd...?

                      RONALD FLEURY
            What, the Liza Minelli shirt?

                      MADDY
            No. I do think Liza Minelli's gone
            odd, but that wasn't it.

                      RONALD FLEURY
            What was odd?

                      MADDY
            He was a Saudi. The gardener.

                      RONALD FLEURY
            Yeah.

                      MADDY
            Saudis, like Americans, don't do
            manual labor. Blowing leaves is
            beneath them.

      Fleury looks to Al-Ghazi for confirmation. Al-Ghazi nods.

                           RONALD FLEURY
                    (to Maddy)
                Thank you.

      Fleury and Al-Ghazi start to leave.

                             EARL
                Who is he?

      Fleury looks back to Earl.

                          RONALD FLEURY
                That's one of the many things we're
                trying to find out...


92    EXT. RIPON FAMILY HOME - NEXT MOMENT                           92

      Al-Ghazi gives the photo of the IDENTIFIED SHOOTER to an AIDE
      waiting outside.

                           AL-GHAZI
                Find out if he worked with the
                gardeners.

      The aide takes the photo, starts walking away.

                             AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
                RUN!

      Freaked, the aide about jumps out of his skin...starts
      running.


92A   EXT. BLAST SIGHT - DAY                                        92A

      Sykes has a SAUDI WORK CREW digging in the hole, pulling out
      pieces of charred metal. He is slowly laying out the pieces
      and studying them like a puzzle, trying to figure out what
      the hell blew up.


93    EXT. MOBILE FIELD MORGUE - SAME MOMENT                         93

      Janet and Haytham approach a 2000 square-foot M.A.S.H. Tent
      attached to refrigeration units.

                                              KINGDOM 8/18/06   94.




     FROM VARIOUS ANGLES:

     SANG OFFICERS look down at the Americans, dead eyed, watching
     them work.


94   INT. MOBILE FIELD MORGUE - NEXT MOMENT                       94

     The Muslim dead wrapped in white linen according to the
     Sunna. Western bodies lie separated from Arabs. A Saudi
     TECHNICIAN blankly hands Janet and Haytham lab coats to cut
     the cold. Three Police OFFICERS in the tent with them:
     Watching Janet.

     Haytham is looking uncomfortable as if he is embarrassed to
     be seen with the American woman.


95   EXT. JACKSON HOME - LATER                                    95

     Fleury knocks at Aaron Jackson's door. A pause, the peep hole
     darkens. A longer pause, then the door opens. Aaron Jackson
     doesn't look any better. Same shirt.

     Packed boxes. Suit cases. Jackson is clearly getting out of
     Dodge.

                          RONALD FLEURY
                   (beat)
               How are your Sons?

     Jackson's eyes shrink-wrapped in tears. After a long silence
     with no answer, Fleury hands him a sheet of paper:

                         RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
               That's the name of a clinical
               psychologist. Works with Embassy
               kids...apparently very good at
               explaining violence-

                         AARON JACKSON
               -what do you know about what my
               kids need? What they saw? What the
               rest of their lives might be like?

                   (beat)
               I thought maybe your Boys...without
               their Mom anymore...might ask you
               why sometime...

                                         KINGDOM 8/18/06   95.



Aaron Jackson begins shaking his head yes. Tears flow free:
sorrow and gratitude. He hangs on to Fleury's hand for a very
long time. Silent apologies.

                    RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
          I will find the man responsible for
          the death of your wife. We're
          close.

                     AARON JACKSON
              (beat)
          Tomorrow it'll be somebody else's
          wife.

Fleury quiet.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          Then tomorrow I'll come back.

Fleury turns his head: Al-Ghazi approaches on the next lawn
down with three JUNIOR OFFICERS. Fleury nods goodbye to
Jackson.

Fleury approaches Al-Ghazi, holds up the Shooter's photo.

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
          The gardener. We know who he is.
          He's on several watch lists.

Fleury - a slight nod of satisfaction.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          We know where he lives?

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
          We will very soon.

96   EXT. BLAST SITE - DAY                                        96

     Ten Police Investigators in the crater with Grant. Outside
     the crater: pieces of vehicles laid out outside: 1/2 of a
     door, 1/4 of a front axle, bits of engine. Five feet away
     from that: stacks of bagged evidence, two dozen evidence
     containers.

     Sykes clambers out of the hole, streaks of re-animated mud
     where sweat streams out of his hairline, mad-dashing for his
     chin. A chunk of metal in one hand, something small in the
     other: a marble. He drops it in the appropriate cannister
     then steps to a chunk of metal: one half of an alternator.

     Sykes stares down at the pieces of completely mangled metal.
     He studies a piece of twisted, half-melted iron. Thinking...

     He walks over to a second larger piece of twisted metal.
     Starts trying to fit the two pieces...like a puzzle.


97   INT. MOBILE FIELD MORGUE, PRESENT DAY - NOON                 97

     The dead, oblong faces of the dog-walkers. Janet uses forceps
     to pull a wing-nut from one of the dog-walkers. Places it on
     a sanitary table littered with shrapnel: tiny bits of colored
     glass, ball-bearings, parts of razor blades, spent slugs, and
     scraps of unidentified metal.


98   EXT. BLAST SITE - CRATER                                     98

     Sykes still works the two large pieces of trashed iron. Until
     something clicks. The fit. Sykes looks down at the connected
     metal.

                         SYKES
               It's a gurney.

     Sykes looks down at the mud colored DIGGERS.

               Who's missing an ambulance?

     Just stares from the Saudis.

               Could somebody please go get
               Sergeant Haytham?

                Sergeant Haytham!

      Inside the crater: water-level down to the ankles. Three
      Saudis dig around what looks to be one of the dualie-style
      back tires. Re-positioning to get a better grip, Sykes
      notices the top of what looks to be a sizeable, ragged hole,
      still mostly submerged. Pointing:

                             GRANT SYKES
                Here.

      Sykes slogs over. He drops to his knees, reaches his hand in,
      all the way to his shoulder, the side of his face to the
      water: void. Out of the crater, Sykes points to a Bobcat
      earth-mover, in Arabic:

99    INT. / EXT. MOBILE FIELD MORGUE - SAME                       99

      Janet stands with the Saudi Pathologist. She prepares to take
      a fingerprint from a body. As the moves in to touch the Arab
      hand, one of the GUARDS unloads in her direction - a full
      guttural Arabic assault. No idea what he's saying, but it's
      obvious he's furious. Haytham starts firing back. This is an
      un-translated argument. We sense that the guard is doing more
      than expressing his displeasure regarding Janet. This seems
      to be personal. Janet's getting very nervous. A frightening
      display. Then, Haytham turns:

                          HAYTHAM
                You cannot touch any Muslims.

      Janet takes a breath as the Police hard-eye her.

                           JANET
                No problem. Can I still touch
                Americans?

                             HAYTHAM
                Of course.

      Janet moves back to the American dead, as the Saudi Tech
      continues with the Muslims. She pulls another shard of
      COLORED GLASS from a wound.

SERIES OF SHOTS:

A two car convoy drives deep into the city.                    

The Convoy is forced to stop across the street from a gas
station as a construction crane backs into a drive way.
Al-Ghazi and Fleury stare across the street as a large gas
truck fills up the heavy tanks of a Saudi gas station.

          trillion more barrels of
          recoverable oil.

          A trillion reasons to keep
          fighting. For both sides of this
          War.
               (beat)
          I think our oil has begun
          destroying more than it creates.

          Agreed.

                     (beat, tired)
                 I have three daughters. And I find
                 myself in a place where I no longer
                 care about `why' we are attacked. I
                 only care that 100 people woke up a
                 few mornings ago had no idea it was
                 their last. When we catch the Man
                 who murdered these people, I don't
                 care to ask even one question...I
                 just want to kill him...stop him.
                     (beat, a bit embarrassed)
                 Do you understand?

                              RONALD FLEURY
                 Yes, I do.

       A long moment. Just road noise. We see two men, as different
       from each other as they could be, yet made from the same
       things.

100A   INT. MOBILE FIELD MORGUE - CONTINUOUS                     100A

       A glazed Haytham works with a Pathologist on the Muslim
       bodies. Their own collection of foreign objects. Janet pulls
       free 1/2 of a marble from a burrowed hole: explains the
       shards of colored glass. Cleans it in saline, holds it up to
       the light. We stare at it with her.

       Janet begins piecing together glass shards - reconstructing a
       MARBLE.


101    EXT. DEATH SQUAD SCENE - DAY                                101

       Police Investigators eat lunch under a tent 50 yards away
       with Leavitt.

       Then a red laser-sight moves across him: Three MEMBERS of his
       Police security-detail: smirking, pretending to fidget with
       an AR-15's aperture.

       Leavitt stares. Subtle defiance. Nobody blinks. Silent
       moments pass.

                                               KINGDOM 8/18/06   100.


      The smallest of the detail reaches over, pulls the cocking
      device of the rifle: round in the chamber, so stop looking at
      us.


102   INT. BOMB SITE - CRATER                                      102

      Sykes, covered in mud, digging, searching for any signs of
      identification amongst the charred, mangled metal.


103   EXT. INTERNET CAFE - LATER                                   103

      The small convoy pulls up next to a run down, late seventies
      chunk of architecture which looks like a combination bombed
      dentist office/ accounting firm. Weird. Two TEENAGERS in Tu-
      pac T-shirts smoke in front.

      Fleury, Al-Ghazi and a couple of Police head for the blacked
      out front door.


104   INT. INTERNET CAFE - CONTINUOUS                              104

      Moving up two flights of stairs. Dark, rundown shredded
      carpet. Old hip hop - cheap bass, thin speakers. Smoke.
      Everything grows in intensity as they move up the stairs. Two
      more TEENAGERS skulk past.

                          FLEURY
                    (half joking to Al-Ghazi)
                Feel like I'm back home in Detroit.

      Al-Ghazi keeps moving up and into what is definitely on
      Fleury's top ten list of the most bizarre places he's ever
      been.


      FLEURY'S POV:

      Two rooms: First is some kind of snack/smoke/TV lounge.
      FILIPINOS serve drinks. Packs of young Saudi MEN drink Cokes,
      tea, coffee, and smoke.

      Odd Saudi talk shows mix with hip hop.

      Behind, another room: bigger, overflowing with stacks of mis-
      matched computers. Dozens of them. Dozens of Saudi TEENAGERS
      plugged in. Head-phoned and mic'd. All chain smoking, all
      fully plugged in to CALL OF DUTY (an American war game) on
      line. These kids play with rabid intensity, smoking and
      screaming and killing.

                                              KINGDOM 8/18/06   101.



      Al-Ghazi moves through the crowd. A small middle aged SAUDI
      spots Al-Ghazi. They exchange words. Al-Ghazi waves Fleury to
      follow.

      Fleury does and follows Al-Ghazi through the computer room,
      into a back office.


105   INT. INTERNET CAFE - BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS               105

      A middle aged Saudi: TALAL. He sits behind a cluttered desk.
      Art books and computers everywhere. He gets up and embraces
      Al-Ghazi.

      Al-Ghazi then turns to face Fleury.

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI                              
                At one time, Talal was Arafat's
                senior bomb-maker and planner in
                the occupied territories. He joined
                Bin-Laden when Al Qaeda brought the
                fight to the Royal Family.

                           RONALD FLEURY
                    (beat)
                OK. Shouldn't we arrest him or
                shoot him or something?

      Small smile from Al-Ghazi.

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI                              
                He turned himself in last year
                during an amnesty. He's now part of
                a new government effort to balance
                the experience of Saudi Youth.

                          RONALD FLEURY
                This place is community service?

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI                              
                If America figures out a way of
                keeping their kids off the
                computers please let us know.

                          RONALD FLEURY
                Why did he turn himself in?

      Before Al-Ghazi can answer, Talal begins talking to him in
      Arabic. Al-Ghazi translates:

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI                              
                `You only come after I see there
                were bombs.
                          (MORE)

                                      KINGDOM 8/18/06   102.

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
          Did you know Bin Laden put 5
          million-dollars on my head? Why
          shouldn't it be 10?'

Subdued laughter. Then Talal becomes quiet, grave. Al-Ghazi
continues the translation:

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                   
          The Man who made War on Al-Rahmah
          is someone my age -- this kind of
          skill is learned over decades.

Talal looks at Fleury now, speaking directly to him through
Al-Ghazi:

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.) (CONT'D)            
          A Man who can plan the mass-murder
          of women and children, then go home
          at night to his own and sleep
          soundly...? That kind of Man is
          supremely difficult to catch.

                    RONALD FLEURY
              (through Al-Ghazi)
          How does he know he slept soundly?

Colonel Al-Ghazi hesitates, then relays Fleury's question.      
Talal stares: eyes touched by war-blood-atrocities committed.
Someone who believes he's going to Hell.

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.)                     
              (translating)
          Because he hasn't stopped. You stop
          when their faces don't let you
          close your eyes...

                    RONALD FLEURY
              (through Al-Ghazi)
          Is that why you quit?

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.)                     
              (translating)
          17 days without sleep will make you
          quit anything.

Two TEENAGERS stick their heads into the office. They're mad
about the sharing of a computer. Talal puts a fast stop to
it. It's obvious he's good with these young boys. He smiles
as he speaks to Al-Ghazi.

Al-Ghazi translates to Fleury.

                                        KINGDOM 8/18/06   103.



                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                    
          He says he makes my job easier.
          Here, at least they only fight and
          kill on computers.

Al-Ghazi shows Talal the detonator. The old man studies it.      
Al-Ghazi and Talal speak in Arabic about the detonator.          

Al-Ghazi looks to Fleury, translates.                            

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                    
          He says that there are several ways                    
          to get American military equipment                     
          like this detonator but not many                       
          men in Saudi Arabia that know how                      
          to get them.                                           

                    FLEURY                                       
          How do they get them?                                  

                     COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
          Usually smuggled from Iraq by                          
          corrupt soldiers working with the                      
          Americans.                                             

                    FLEURY                                       
          Could Hamza get this equipment?                        

Al-Ghazi asks Talal.                                             

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
          Without question. Yes, he could.                       

                    RONALD FLEURY                                
              (through Al-Ghazi)
          How do we find him?

He thinks for a moment, then speaks. The boys chuckle as Al-
Ghazi continues translating:

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
          Prayer. Luck. Handshakes.

Fleury looks at Al-Ghazi, doesn't quite get it...

                    RONALD FLEURY
              (to Al-Ghazi)
          Well, I think I get the `prayer'
          and `luck' parts...

Talal slowly stands, Al-Ghazi helping him up, moves to
Fleury. Reaches his hand out to him, quietly:

                                              KINGDOM 8/18/06   104.

                    (translating)
                His hands will feel like this.

      Fleury shakes Talal's hand, turns it over: index finger gone.

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.) (CONT'D)

106   EXT. BLAST SITE - DAY                                       106

      The Bobcat digs   into the crater, over the unknown hole.
      Already a large   pile of dirt. Another sizeable scoop down
      about two feet:   nothing. Haytham now stands over the crater
      watching Sykes.   Leavitt has joined him.

                           GRANT SYKES
                Whatever this is, it blasted-off
                like NASA.

      Haytham yells to the Machine Operator in Arabic:

                          SERGEANT HAYTHAM
                Driven in at an angle... go
                deeper...

      Another gouge of earth: 4 feet. Nothing. Grant sits back.

                `High-order explosion' doesn't do

                looks like it was put through a
                wood-chipper.

      Leavitt rubs his eyes: adrenaline long gone. Looks at his
      watch: time passing fast. Sykes drops to his stomach, reaches
      in with the TRENCHING TOOL to see how much farther the hole
      goes: a metallic `clink.

      An oxygen tank. The kind used in ambulances. Nozzle assembly
      gone, burst in the explosion with a force that drove it
      several feet into solid ground. Haytham takes a razor blade,
      scratches off samples of the soil and carbon for explosive
      residue into a fresh cannister. Then takes a wet rag, begins
      cleaning the tank to reveal Arabic script...

                          SERGEANT HAYTHAM

107   INT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER                            107

      Now a mini command post. Al-Ghazi works phones with Fleury
      and Mayes by his side. Sykes and Leavitt muddy, sitting on
      their cots. Leavitt tags evidence from the shootout.

      Al-Ghazi hangs up, looks to Fleury.

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
                The ambulance was reported stolen
                from King Fahd Hospital last
                Wednesday, three days before the
                bombing.

                There's more: I told you it
                wouldn't be hard to find the
                soldiers.

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
                The stolen ambulance had a twenty
                man crew that rotated shifts on it.
                We checked all twenty men. One of
                them, Muaath Hazmi is now of
                interest to us.

                          RONALD FLEURY
                Why?

      Al-Ghazi reaches for the photo of the dead shooter/attacker.

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
                Because this gentleman is Fathi
                Hazmi, Muaath's brother.

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
                I'm going to show you.


108   EXT. SUBURBAN RIYADH STREET - AFTERNOON                    108

      A five block radius has been sealed off by Police Vehicles.
      Fleury and his team are at the outer perimeter, crouched
      behind barricades at the entrance of a cul-de-sac. They're
      not allowed anywhere near the line of fire.

      They sport bullet-proof vests and helmets: look like
      reporters in a war-zone. Police turn away cars, neighbors.
      Snipers stand posted on near-by rooftops. Helicopters audible
      overhead. Street deserted.

                          GRANT SYKES
                We never get to do anything fun.

                          JANET MAYES
                Sykes, I'm guessing you don't even
                remember how to load your gun.

                          GRANT SYKES
                That's not funny.

                          ADAM LEAVITT
                She's not trying to be funny.

                          GRANT SYKES
                I'm a very good shot.

                            JANET MAYES
                I'm sure.

      Haytham hands Al-Ghazi a walkie-talkie, in Arabic:

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
                Neighbors clear?

                            VOICE (O.S.)
                Yes.

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
                Activity or communication?

                          VOICE (O.S.)
                Snipers have seen nothing. No
                telephone line into the house.

                                              KINGDOM 8/18/06   107.



                           COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
                    (beat)
                Allahuakbar. Go.

      Two black Suburbans roll around the corner: out-fitted with
      running boards and hand rails upon which a 12-man SWAT team
      rides: 3 on each rail, 2 vehicles. SWAT team: military
      fatigues, black hoods, Mp-5 close-quarter sub-machine guns.
      Flying down the cul-de-sac: Half-way down the street, one of
      the Snipers open fire: BOOM-BOOM-BOOM. That moment an RPG
      fires wide of the lead Suburban. Over Al-Ghazi's walkie-
      talkie, in Arabic:

                          VOICE (O.S.)
                ONE DOWN! RPG!

      The two SWAT-Teamers at the front of the running boards open
      up with their MP-5s one-handed: the front of the house puffs,
      bursts, disintegrates. Suburbans rip to a stop. SWAT off,
      move fast. Three toss flash grenades into and around the
      house. Massive flash-bangs. Six through the front door. Six
      sprinting around back. Loud AK-47 bursts from inside
      now...screams. Then an RPG fired inside: the rushing sound
      and yellow-white flash past two windows. A section of the far
      left wall of the house detonates from the inside out.

      More mechanical, silenced thwacks from the SWAT Mp-5s.
      Silence. Then voices from Al-Ghazi's walkie-talkie.
      Ambulances round the corner, fly toward the house:

                          VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                CLEAR.


109   INT. TARGETED HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER                         109

      The team enters, wide-eyed. Four men in civilian garb, all
      dead: multiple bullet wounds. An Officer with four 8 X 10 mug-
      shots, matching them to the dead faces, dropping mug-shots on
      respective chests. Once he's finished, a police photographer
      takes new pictures of each. At the far side of the House:
      engineers use 2x4s to support the wall hit with the RPG. All
      of it has the feel of standard Saudi operation procedure.

      Al-Ghazi appears from the back of the house. Bends over each
      of the four dead men: lifting each of their hands, examining
      the backs of the hands quickly.

                          GRANT SYKES
                Prints are on the other side...

                                             KINGDOM 8/18/06   108.



                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
                I'm not looking for prints. I'm
                looking for fingers.

      Stands after the last: a look of controlled frustration that
      Fleury files. Then Al-Ghazi motions to Sykes and Fleury.


110   INT. REAR OF THE HOUSE - NEXT MOMENT                       110

      Back to the rear of the house: stacks of plastic explosives,
      buckets of shrapnel, two Paramedics working feverishly on a
      SWAT Officer hit multiple times. Fleury goes about his
      business like a man isn't dying six feet away.

      Sykes is a kid in a candy store: rummaging through
      explosives, blasting caps, shrapnel.

                             RONALD FLEURY
                JANET...

      Janet makes her way back. Immediately moves to the wounded
      SWAT Officer.

                          RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
                He's gone... This shrapnel look
                like the stuff you pulled at the
                morgue?

                          JANET MAYES
                    (distracted)
                Yeah... I pulled so much it's hard
                to remember it all.

                             RONALD FLEURY
                Bolts?

                             JANET MAYES

                          RONALD FLEURY

                             JANET MAYES

                                      KINGDOM 8/18/06   109.



Al-Ghazi begins tossing the room, motions to Fleury: help.
Fleury moves to him.

                    RONALD FLEURY
              (calling back)
          ADAM...

                    GRANT SYKES
          C-4...

Al-Ghazi dumps desk drawers: pictures of government-looking
buildings, walled-compounds. Lays them out in rows, studying
each. Leavitt appears, focuses on the C-4 immediately.

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.)                    
          -the front gates of every other
          western housing compound in Riyadh.

Everybody looks at the Colonel, pointing at the pictures:      

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                  
          And Embassies: Italy, Japan, Korea,
          Norway, England...

                     ADAM LEAVITT
              (beat)
          The Coalition...

Leavitt steps, scans the pictures, picks up two in
particular: buildings with scaffolding and heavy equipment.

                    ADAM LEAVITT (CONT'D)
          These are all countries with Troops
          in Iraq -- Japanese and Italian
          embassies are under construction?

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                           
          The entire Diplomatic Quarter is
          being retro-fitted to sustain
          bigger bomb blasts.

Janet pops her head in:

                    JANET MAYES
          -the Prince's Convoy just showed.

Al-Ghazi's face: fear.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          This is bullshit. You know it.
          Meaningless. There's no leader
          here. These are kids. That's it.

                                                KINGDOM 8/18/06   110.



      Al-Ghazi says nothing.

                          JANET MAYES
                We're out of here.

                          RONALD FLEURY
                Yes, that's it. Smile for the
                cameras, body-bag some children.
                Wrap it up, but us -- out. I get
                it.

                             COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
                I'm sorry.


111   EXT. FRONT OF TARGETED HOME - MOMENTS LATER                   111

      Prince Bin Khaled touring the scene: reporters,
      photographers, his personal top-line security detail: the
      business suits and boots, the special ops M-4s. All on edge
      to be in a Saudi neighborhood. Rahman, looking like he needs
      sleep and vitamins. Lecturing in Arabic:

                          PRINCE BIN KHALED
                Only in death will our enemies
                realize Allah never permits
                defiance of his almighty will.

      Damon Schmidt trailing behind the Prince's detail. The Prince
      locks Al-Ghazi with a mad-dog stare in-between lesson points.
      One of the Prince's inner-circle heads straight for Al-Ghazi,
      in Arabic:

                          INNER-CIRCLE
                Take the Americans inside now and
                keep them out of sight. You will be
                spoken to about their presence
                here.


112   INT. TARGETED HOUSE - NEXT MOMENT                             112

      The Team sitting on the floor, below the window sills, away
      from the holes and doors. Al-Ghazi standing, looking out the
      window at the spectacle. Damon Schmidt steps in: sees dead
      bodies and goes ghost, almost collapses. Leavitt pops up,
      helps him sit.

                          RONALD FLEURY
                You need water?

      A quick `no' nod: like the second before you lose lunch.

              (pointing at the dead)
          That fella got shot right through
          his God damn nipple...

                    JANET MAYES
          Don't stare too long. It'll start
          living in your dreams.

Janet's voice causes Schmidt to immediately force composure.

                    DAMON SCHMIDT
          No -- I know.

                     RONALD FLEURY
          You do?
              (beat)
          How did you know we were here?

                    DAMON SCHMIDT
          The Prince has Men at Al-Rahmah.

                      COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
          What Men?

                     DAMON SCHMIDT
          Ask him.
              (beat)
          3 vehicles will stay behind when
          the Prince and Press leave. You'll
          convoy straight to BA flights into
          Dulles -- last minute fares come
          out of your budget, by-the-by.
          Tried to swing upgrades, but check

Pissed, reproachful head-shakes.

              (beat; color returning)
          Turn those frowns upside down,

          stunning Saudi-only counter-punch
          that killed those responsible for
          Al-Rahmah. Al-Jazeera will play up
          an FBI presence, we'll play up
          their ties to Terror as checkmate.
          And everyone that was so
          righteously pissed back home is
          gonna eat crow.

          You won the hand on the River card.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          We didn't win shit, Schmidt. These
          are teenagers... children with

          -kidding me? You mean those are

      Flying down a highway. Haytham driving. Sykes up front. The
      rest of the team crammed in back: Fleury next to Al-Ghazi;
      Mayes and Leavitt on the back bench. Everyone spent. Grant
      stares up at a distant jet climbing-out. The police radio
      belching calm codes and calls every few seconds.

                Amateurs. It's a small win.

          drinking are like a chicken and egg

In the back, Al-Ghazi can't help a small smile either.
Fleury's not into it. All business, pissed, clearly does not
want Pabst.

                    RONALD FLEURY
              (to Al-Ghazi)
          Remember how we caught that cell?

          Yes. Car bomb. He went back to pick
          up his deposit on the rental car.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          Four hundred dollars. For four
          hundred dollars, he was caught.
          Stupidity. Catching the cell was
          easy. Just like this. The cell came
          back.

Fleury looks at Al-Ghazi. He knows the win is small. Also
knows that's all she wrote, for now.

                    RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
          I'll be back.

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
          Yes, you will.

The POLICE BAND suddenly squelches loud with excited Arabic.
Everyone perks, leans up to listen to the urgency.

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                   
              (translating radio
               chatter)
          Religious demonstration in
          progress. Back near the City
          Center.

A small collective smirk, sigh of relief. Fleury turns in his
seat.

                          GRANT SYKES
                I'm serious. Beer will open up your
                subconscious. Canned beer
                especially. Give you instincts they
                can't teach-

      Fleury notices the Suburban bringing up the rear has dropped
      back.

                          RONALD FLEURY
                    (looking back)
                Is he responding to the call?
                Dropped back...

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.)                      
                    (turning)
                What?

      Al-Ghazi and Fleury both looking back to the following
      Suburban now. Dropped back, sunglasses and blank faces
      staring back at them.

      Fleury looks to the overpass above - he sees a YOUNG MAN on a
      cell phone. As they pass, the kid runs to watch them from the
      other side.

      Al-Ghazi gets to the CB radio, in Arabic:

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                    
                Tighten up-

      -the trailing Suburban doesn't `tighten up.' It falls further
      back. Fleury instinctively turns, wide-eyed -- out the
      window: a small brown truck swerves out of the opposing
      lanes, flying across the desert median, aimed at the Convoy.
      Without hesitation Fleury reaches over Haytham, rips the
      steering-wheel right, nosing away from the approach...

117   EXT. SAUDI HIGHWAY - SAME MOMENT                           117

      Our Suburban on two wheels: The lead Suburban turns the same
      direction a twitch too late. The small brown truck detonates.
      The lead Suburban takes a massive fraction of the explosion
      broadside, essentially shielding our vehicle. Flame spits
      through the lead vehicle as it spins, flips onto its roof.

                                             KINGDOM 8/18/06   116.




118   INT. OUR SUBURBAN - NEXT MOMENT                             118

      Off-road now, violent impacts on bare rims shedding rubber.


119   EXT. HIGHWAY ATTACK AFTERMATH - NEXT MOMENT                 119

      The lead Suburban: tortoise on its back, engulfed, still
      sliding. Fleury's Suburban fish-tailing.

      The Lead Suburban blows in-half now as the gas tank ruptures.
      A football-sized shard of metal explodes through our
      windshield-


120   INT. OUR SUBURBAN - SAME MOMENT                             120

      - and smashes straight out the back, taking the rear cargo
      door with it.

      The shock of it causes Haytham to lose control in earnest
      now. The Suburban flips, barrel rolls. Violent pounding
      inside the vehicle. Motion stops: upside down, just the roar
      of the big Detroit V-8 red-lining, wheels spinning in air.
      Everyone dazed, border-line unconscious. Fleury's bell rung
      the worst, trying to function, get his bearings.

      Fleury touches Leavitt's face, can barely see through the
      gathering smoke that smells like oil.

                             RONALD FLEURY
                You whole?

                             ADAM LEAVITT
                Think so-

      Leavitt unbuckles his seat belt and smashes head first into
      the ceiling -- running FOOTFALLS approach, quick yell-yips in
      Arabic: commands?

      The Driver and three other Police Officers from the trailing
      Suburban. Smoke fills the interior now: thank God these
      Police Officers have ripped open a door: saviors. They grip
      Leavitt by his hair because it's the only thing they can
      grab.

      Alarmed, Al-Ghazi begins to scramble for Leavitt.

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI                              
                This is not right!

                                              KINGDOM 8/18/06   117.



      Haytham gets a good look at the driver, recognizes him as the
      officer who shamed him at the compound on day one. Haytham
      moves to unbuckle.

      Fleury's trying to claw towards Leavitt. Throwing upside down
      punches at the air. Unbuckles himself now.

                            RONALD FLEURY
                WHAT THE-

                          JANET MAYES
                    (panicked)
                ADAM! WHAT -- WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

      Alarm rising, everyone else unbuckles and smashes into the
      ceiling as horizons go flip-flop confusion.


121   EXT. HIGHWAY ATTACK AFTERMATH - NEXT MOMENT                 121

      Leavitt's throwing punches as he's dragged with velocity to
      the trail Suburban, idling. Pistol-whipped viciously,
      repeatedly until they're able to kick him inside. Another
      Officer from the trailing vehicle steps up with an AK-47,
      pulls back the cocking mechanism, ready to spray the dazed
      occupants of our Suburban-

      -the Officer's ankles and shins detonate. POP-POP-POP-POP
      from the driver's seat: Haytham. Screams from the would-be
      shooter at double volume. Haytham keeps firing as the
      Officer, hit multiple times, falls hard.

      The trailing Suburban hesitates,   slams into our Suburban just
      as Fleury is getting out of the    wreckage. Everybody else
      still inside, knocked silly. The   trailing Suburban backs up
      quick. Fleury instinctively goes   for his holster: empty for
      days now.

                            RONALD FLEURY
                GUN!

      Trailing Suburban accelerates away now, as Janet struggles
      out. Haytham's 9 MM in-hand racked open: empty. Fleury steps
      away from the now black smoke pouring from the vehicle -- in
      the passenger seat of the trail Suburban, he sees the Officer
      that checked passports at Prince Sultan Air Base.

                          GRANT SYKES
                -DOOR HELP-

      Fleury rips Grant's door open. Trapped smoke billows, clears:
      Grant's arm closest to the outside of the vehicle dangles at
      an unnatural angle, bleeding badly.

                                      KINGDOM 8/18/06   118.



                    GRANT SYKES (CONT'D)
          Can't release-

Fleury begins sawing Grant's seat-belt with a jagged piece of
metal.

                    RONALD FLEURY
          Hands up -- you're gonna fall-

Sykes still does, ugly. Fleury and Janet rip him free of the
Suburban.

Haytham's pulling shotguns, handguns, ammo from the flipped
vehicle. Haytham pointing ahead, to the fading roster-tail.
In Arabic:

                    SERGEANT HAYTHAM
          They're going to disappear...

Desperate, Fleury looks in the direction of the fleeing
Suburban: the rooster-tail it leaves getting smaller. Al-
Ghazi nods, swings his head to thesnarled/wrecked highway
traffic. PEOPLE hesitantly step toward uniforms they trust on
instinct. Haytham dumps the pile of weapons at the Team's
feet, re-loads his 9MM. Janet ties a half-assed tourniquet
around Sykes' reminder of an arm.

Al-Ghazi steps toward the approaching crowd: they see his
state, his gun, and turn back: panic starts to infect the
larger mass, then the topper-

-AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE from somewhere. Glass-dirt-metal bursts
around us: this attack is still going.

Fleury looks up: just the roof of an old Mercedes on the
median, dirt kicked up behind them, running behind lines of
stopped-wrecked traffic now. The barrel of a rifle held high
out the window like a taunt. Accelerating for another opening
to finish the job.

Scared motorists devolve into terrified motorists. Many have
abandoned their vehicles to sprint into the desert, the rest
go smash-'em-up derby-folly: 50 panicked drivers aiming for
the same spots. Fleury snatches an M4A1 from the stack
dropped by Haytham, up to his shoulder, hustling toward the
next break in traffic. The Mercedes is approaching at 80 MPH.

                    RONALD FLEURY
              (back to his crew)
          GET DOWN!

                                       KINGDOM 8/18/06   119.



Al-Ghazi starts screaming in Arabic, motioning frantically to
the CITIZENS who have turned back, running toward them, in
Arabic:

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
          DOWN!

Fleury's view blocked by fleeing Saudis: just intermittent
flashes of the Mercedes braking hard, massive dust cloud
behind them, sliding toward the opening Fleury pre-sighted.
Intermittent wild shots fired from the SUV, vaguely in our
direction.

Fleury flips a switch on the left side of the rifle, just
forward of the handle: full-auto. Takes a deep, measured
Sniper's breath, eases the stock snug aimpoint up to his
right eye, and without hesitation lets loose the entire clip
perfectly: one heartbeat before the Mercedes hits the gap.
The right side of the Mercedes shreds just as it appears.
Fleury's clip gone in a flash, yet more rounds still hit the
Mercedes: Al-Ghazi four feet away, firing his own salvo from
a knee. Something bright red pops against the driver's side
window now, the Mercedes rip-slides to a stop. Commotion
inside. Wild, half-aimed shots back at us.

Then it starts up again. Al-Ghazi bolts toward the line of
stopped traffic. Searching for something big, empty, still
running. Fleury right on his heels.

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                   
          WE MOVE NOW OR WE LOSE HIM.

Early 90's Land Rover. Desert tough. Driver long-gone,
exhaust plumes pumping out. Al-Ghazi dives into the Driver's
seat, Fleury shotgun. Guns it to the rest of the Survivors,
an eye on the rooster-tail of the Mercedes he and Fleury just
shredded, heading the same direction as Leavitt's kidnappers.

Al-Ghazi jumps out, ushers Haytham into the Driver's seat. In
Arabic:

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                   
          You know Suweidi -- you know how to
          go fast.

Fleury helps Sykes into the rear. Janet loads the weapons.
Jump in.

The Land Rover spits it's own tell-tale plume as it sprints
away down the median, dodging traffic, in desperate pursuit.

Startling silence comes sudden now as the fight moves
elsewhere. Receding engines. Petering screams/shouts.

                                            KINGDOM 8/18/06   120.

122   INT. TRAIL SUBURBAN - SAME MOMENT                         122

      Driving as fast-hard as possible. No regard for anyone/thing.
      Passport Officer up front pulls a cell-phone. A THIRD AND
      FOURTH in the back still beating and zip-cuffing Leavitt.


123   INT. LAND ROVER - NEXT MOMENT                             123

      Janet's sitting with Sykes in the rear, readying weapons and
      ammo. She hands him twin Berettas - Sykes' double-fisting
      despite his wound, looking forward to a fight.

                          SYKES
                Nobody's gonna hurt Leavitt but me.

      Driver's Seat P.O.V.: on the median, 95 MPH, dodging
      abandoned and escaping cars. High-beams flashed on-off-on-
      off, constant horn, gaining on the Mercedes' rooster-tail
      ahead of them.


124   INT. TRAIL SUBURBAN - SAME MOMENT                         124

      Powering deep into the Suweidi neighborhood. Skid-stopping
      and backing into an alley between broken down three story
      buildings.


125   INT. LAND ROVER - SAME MOMENT                             125

      Haytham scanning as he drives: straining to see the plume
      from the second attacking vehicle way ahead, blending with
      other fleeing, scared motorists. We watch as the distant
      plume cuts hard left, at a high rate of speed... then
      DISAPPEARS.


126   INT. UNKNOWN ROOM - SAME MOMENT                           126

      Quiet. The 32 year-old son we met on the rooftop is on his
      cell phone again, speed-assembling an ancient VHS camera atop
      a tri-pod.

                          THE SON
                    (in Arabic, frantic)
                DO NOT COME HERE!

      Intercut with the Mercedes Driver yelling frantic into his
      cell phone:

                                             KINGDOM 8/18/06   121.



                          MERCEDES DRIVER
                    (Arabic)
                He's been shot! BE READY.

      Back in the room, A HUGE MAN dressed in paramilitary black,
      face wrapped in his shumagh, so only the eyes are visible,
      stands in front of a sheet hung from the ceiling, quietly
      practicing/reading a speech for an imaginary audience. Lots
      of gesticulating and head movement.

      The handle of large knife sticks from his waste band.

      Door BURSTS open, bottom hinge rips from the jamb. Leavitt is
      slammed to the ground. Passport Officer shoves the practicing
      Speaker out of the way- Turns to the wide-eyed 32 year-old.

                          PASSPORT OFFICER
                NOW. HURRY.

      Leavitt's face already swollen-black-bleeding, scanning the
      room with terrified fury in his eyes. He sees the handle of
      the knife sticking from the Huge Man's waistband. His tears
      leak all at once.

      The Officer takes the knife, turns to Leavitt: dirty 11-inch
      blade...


127   INT. LAND ROVER - NEXT MOMENT                              127

      Haytham searching for the turn-off: where the rooster-tail
      they were following cut left, died. At the last minute, he
      sees tire marks headed down an embankment into a decrepit,
      decaying apartment block neighborhood. Haytham cuts hard,
      fish-tails. Sykes' head SMASHES into the rear-side window,
      starring it.

      They're being lead into Riyadh's most hostile neighborhood.

                          AL-GHAZI
                We should not be here...

      JANET'S POV: scanning for the trail Suburban and the Mercedes
      - she can't help but notice the neighborhood. Halfway past an
      intersection, Fleury yells:

                          RONALD FLEURY
                BRAKES-REVERSE-TO THE RIGHT...

      Haytham brakes, reverses: the Suburban.

                                            KINGDOM 8/18/06   122.




128   INT. LAND CRUISER / EXT. SUWEIDI - NEXT MOMENT            128

      Without hesitation Haytham pulls across the cramped street,
      surrounded by the same decaying buildings. Ahead: CIVILIANS
      huddled behind cars, poking heads out from behind shacks.

      A second passes: these people know where the attackers went.
      Al-Ghazi locks eyes with a little boy... he quickly-quietly
      just shakes his head no. In the back, Sykes has fallen on his
      back. He looks up through the window: sees a shape jet past
      on the top of the closest building -- three stories up: the
      little boy was nodding a warning-

      What follows is fast, chaotic, eyes-closed combat:

                          GRANT SYKES
                -GET OUT OF-

      -big BOOM of close-in shells. As Haytham throws it in reverse
      and punches, the front of the Rover shreds. The windshield
      bursts. Engine dies: tachometer and speedometer needles
      bottom out instantly. Haytham and Al-Ghazi tuck into the
      dash. Fleury tries to get as close to the backseat floor
      panels as possible. Janet covers Sykes.

      A Thump-Thump-Thump can be heard on the roof: A GRENADE
      thrown with too much arm by the guy Sykes spotted bounces off
      the roof and into the Land Cruiser.

      Frantic, Fleury swats it out.

      The blast releases a massive airburst and bits of shrapnel
      into the vehicle, starring windows, rocking it: creak of
      shocks and struts. Fleury lifts up now, grabs the M-4:
      returns fire indiscriminately through the windows at any and
      all surrounding rooftops. That provides cover and reminds
      everyone in the car they're armed. Janet exits with a rifle:
      firing out the back door, more covering fire. Civilians who
      were ready to see a massacre scurry now that it's a fight.


129   EXT. ROOF TOP - NEXT MOMENT                               129

      A SHOOTER: black-hood, black T-shirt, old-school red-white-
      black Air Jordans, snub-stock AK, an open, filthy North Face
      backpack at his feet holding spare clips, God knows what
      else.

      Shots from below keep him two feet away from the ledge,
      firing down in random sweeps, head turned like he's lighting
      a fire-cracker.

                                            KINGDOM 8/18/06   123.


      We see things from above, three stories down, a sweep of
      blindly-fired shells pop the asphalt inches from Fleury's
      head, soiling his face in black-top debris. But Fleury never
      stops firing back, his own head slightly turned, flinching on
      reflex. Air Jordan grabs another grenade just before he
      disintegrates: Fleury's three-feet away with the riot gun.
      Another rack and blast to make sure A.J. stays down for
      eternity.

      Fleury spots and bull-charges a second SHOOTER: Ballistic
      Chicken, Fleury wins. A sound... Fleury spins, racking the
      riot gun, aims and FREEZES: 2 six year old BOYS stare from
      the doorway.


130   EXT. SUWEIDI STREET - NEXT MOMENT                           130

      Haytham crouches in front of the Land Cruiser. Rocks thrown
      now from somewhere: KIDS peeking from behind shacks
      Palestinian-style. He's pelted in the side of the head.

      Janet and Sykes move to a stopped vehicle and take cover.

      From the rooftop, Fleury yells down to the men on the ground.

                          FLEURY (O.C.)
                I CAN SEE THE MERCEDES... BLOOD-
                TRAILS RIGHT UP TO AN APARTMENT IN

131   EXT. ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT                                 131

      Fleury's P.O.V.: an Apartment complex that looks like a
      roadside motel: exposed stairwells, walkways, entrances. A
      puddle in front of one of the front doors on the third floor.
      Then we look right, one street over: civilian FIGURES, some
      in traditional dress, starting to mass.

                          FLEURY
                MOB FORMING NEXT BLOCK!

      He drops the riot gun, picks up the AK from the man he just
      killed, pops a new clip from the backpack, slings the
      backpack over her shoulders. Starts to hustle down.


132   INT. UNKNOWN ROOM - SAME MOMENT                             132

      Gunshots reverberating from outside. Echoes. The 32 year-old,
      hands shaking with nerves, screwing the camera into the tri-
      pod: set-up almost complete. The Passport Officer is posted
      at the door: head poking out, weapon up and ready.

                                            KINGDOM 8/18/06   124.


      We can hear Arabic yells down what sounds like a hallway.
      Passport Officer barks something back.

      The Driver of the Trail Suburban squats, pinning Leavitt's
      head down with his knee, knife near a long, white expanse of
      neck. The Huge Man sits on Leavitt's stomach, keeping him in
      place. Leavitt trying to gasp for breath: eyes-wide panic.

                          DRIVER
                READY?

      Just as the 32 year-old nods yes, Leavitt explodes with his
      last bit of effort: kicks just enough to nudge the Camera,
      trying to knock it over. The 32 year-old gets his hands on it
      as it falls, almost catches it, slips out, smacks the ground,
      battery pops off. The Driver and Huge Man both begin
      hammering Adam.

                          PASSPORT OFFICER (O.C.)
                    (in Arabic)
                GOD DAMN HIM!

      32 year-old picks the camera up again, trying to re-attach
      the battery as Adam fights for his life. Spit and claws and
      snot and blood rage.


133   EXT. CINDER-BLOCK APARTMENTS - NEXT MOMENT                  133

      Running down side stairs, Fleury spots a grenade launcher
      poking from a door, next-door to the apartment with blood-
      pool in front.

                          RONALD FLEURY
                RPG!

      Empties his clip into that vicinity: windows shatter, wood
      splinters. The grenade launcher recedes. Janet and Al-Ghazi
      start to run. The launcher fires from its new position...The
      trail suburban DETONATES. Al-Ghazi and Janet knocked flat on
      their asses for second and third times: dazed.

      Fleury searching: I know that Fuck with the RPG is reloading,
      how do I kill him. Drops the bag off his shoulders, pulls a
      grenade out, fires it as hard as he can: 40 yards on the fly.
      Bounces just on the third floor landing-


134   INT. ENEMY APARTMENT - SAME MOMENT                          134

      -RPG Soldier just locking the new rocket tube in, brings the
      reticle up to his eye. Grenade blast splits through what's
      left of the front window.

                                              KINGDOM 8/18/06   125.


      Big flinch-tense on his part: rocket fires inside, roars down
      the hall, hits two feet in-front of the door Passport Officer
      has been peaking out of.

      Massive, contained detonation.   Passport Officer vanishes. The
      32 year-old and his camera are   blown through the Driver
      waiting to saw Leavitt's neck.   Because Leavitt was held so
      tight to the floor, he escapes   the worst of the blast. Still
      fucked up.

      Leavitt's P.O.V.: ears roar with the ring, no sounds. 32 year-
      old and Driver lay in a heap on the floor. Huge Man's on his
      back, trying to get up. Leavitt breathes, rolls to the Driver
      and the boy: grabs driver's blade. Hand to hand war as
      Leavitt gets his payback. He does not stop.


135   EXT. CINDER-BLOCK APARTMENTS - SAME MOMENT                  135

      Sykes takes cover between two cars, holding down the rear,
      firing warning shots and screaming football plays to freak
      out the LOCALS.

                          SYKES
                THIRTY EIGHT RAZOR MAD DOG!!!

      He fires above the crowd, as Janet heads into the building.
      Two LITTLE KIDS slowly approach carrying water, obviously
      terrified at the sight of the wounded American.

      Sirens and helicopters sound in the distance.


136   EXT./INT. CINDER-BLOCK APARTMENTS - NEXT MOMENT.            136

      Base of the stairs: Mayes joins Fleury and a dazed Al-Ghazi &
      Haytham.

                We go in the front door. Haytham -                      
                cover the stairs. Janet - hallway.

      They move 3 levels up the stairs into the building, following
      the blood-trail from the SUV to the Apartment. PEOPLE step
      out of their doors. Al-Ghazi aiming at them:

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI

                INSIDE!


137   INT. / EXT. APARTMENT 303 - NEXT MOMENT                     137   

      The puddle of blood, a trail leading under the door. The
      front wall/window/entrance of the next apartment down, still
      smoldering from Fleury's grenade. No sounds, words. Our team:
      fingers on triggers, weapons to shoulders, sights-aligned.
      Ten feet back. Shoulders already flexed with tension,
      expecting a suicidal blast at any moment. Janet grabs another
      grenade, moves to secure the hallway.                             

                                            KINGDOM 8/18/06   126.



                                                                      

      Intercut Sykes outside. Haytham on the stairs.                  

                          RONALD FLEURY                               
                    (beat, to Al-Ghazi)
                Is Allah on the other side of that
                door?

      Al-Ghazi raises his prayer beads to Fleury.

                           AL-GHAZI
                    (beat)
                I think were about to find out, my                    
                friend.                                               

      Fleury moves forward: I'm primary through the door. Al-         
      Ghazi's right with him. Fleury gets three-point-stance low,
      hits the door like Jim Brown. Scattered gunfire. Fleury opens
      up in response.

      Fleury never stops forward motion. Stumbling headlong into a
      kitchenette, hard into a refrigerator and cabinets, firing
      the whole time. Al-Ghazi blasting anything that looks like a
      body. Straight mop-up operation.


138   INT. CINDER BLOCK APTS - HALLWAY - SAME MOMENT            138

      Securing the hallway, Mayes steps into a charred apartment
      through doors blown off hinges. She heads in deeper, towards
      the bedroom. Finds the closet - it tunnels into the
      apartment below. She peers into the hole--

                          JANET MAYES
                ADAM?!

                                            KINGDOM 8/18/06   127.



      -- sees a bloody knife below thrown by an unseen hand. Janet:
      wide-eyed horror, about to pull back, when she is YANKED into
      the hole by her hair.


139   INT. UNKNOWN ROOM - NEXT MOMENT                           139

      Huge Man ATTACKS Janet. Vicious hand to hand blows. Still
      tied, Leavitt does what he can, kicking at the attacker.
      Adrenaline morphs Janet from scared and out-sized to
      desperate and equally vicious. This is SAVING PRIVATE RYAN
      shit with Leavitt as the observer. He's no coward - he's
      doing everything he can.

      Huge Man overtakes Janet, slow-choking her... she's gasping,
      dying... Janet has a knife out and is shredding the big man's   
      back right thigh and ass. BOTH SCREAMING. From nowhere,         
      Fleury ends the fight with a butt-end baseball-swing of the
      shot gun to Huge Man's head.

      Janet: fucked up, but alive.

                          JANET MAYES
                    (to Leavitt)
                Sykes is going to kick your ass.                      

      Al-Ghazi follows Fleury into the room. Leaning to Janet,
      Fleury sees Leavitt, puts his hand on his head. Leavitt's
      somewhere else, tears in his eyes, just taking deep, measured
      breaths.

                          RONALD FLEURY
                Everybody OK?                                         

      Slow nods from Leavitt and Janet as Fleury cuts Adam's ties.

                          FLEURY
                There's at least three more of
                them.

      As Janet's eyes catch on something: a sheet/half-assed
      backdrop hung from the ceiling has been nearly pulled down -
      exposing a crude square cut out of the wall - a path into
      another Apartment.

      Janet points to the hole in the wall. This isn't over: a
      seven-year old GIRL peers out at her, shaking, tears in her
      eyes. Janet tries her best Motherly smile.

                          JANET MAYES
                It's okay Little One.

                                              KINGDOM 8/18/06   128.



      The little girl backs away. Janet gets up, steers Leavitt
      outside. Sits him down. Hands him a Glock.

      Fleury and Al-Ghazi step through the hole. Janet follows. A
      blood trail snakes through Little One's room, out her door,
      and deeper into another apartment. Little girl long gone into
      the main part of the Apartment. Then, Arabic SCREAMS, the
      metal-crashing sound of automatic GUNFIRE.

      Sirens overheard outside now.


140   INT. ATTACHED APARTMENT - NEXT MOMENT                       140

      Hustle cautious into the apartment. Haytham stands in the
      room already: the muzzle of his AK still smoking, held on a
      man down. The other occupants of the room are a cowering
      FAMILY: KIDS and a couple of real OLD FOLKS, all terrified. A
      little boy cries by himself, huddled in a corner. The
      collateral damage of random violence. Janet quick scans the
      room. LOCKS EYES on the traumatized little boy, his innocence
      draining as she watches. Can't take her eyes away.


      TIGHT ON HAYTHAM:

      Taking this all in: The violence. The terror of this family,
      the defiance on the faces of these young souls.

      Al-Ghazi, post-game shakes, a tear running down his cheeks,
      spattered in blood, stares at Fleury. The man Haytham shot is
      not dead: ragged gasps. Fleury and Al-Ghazi lock eyes, then
      take in the tragedy of the room -- kids their children's age,
      never to be the same. Al-Ghazi to the room, In arabic:

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI                              
                Is everyone alright?

      Silent stares from the Saudis. The little girl Janet saw
      earlier, eyes still on Janet, moves to her brother - he holds
      her tight, his eyes down. Janet kneels, heart-breaking, holds
      her hand out: I can help you little one.

      The Little Girl holds a fist out to Janet, tears in her eyes:
      okay. Janet slowly crouches over to her, the older women's
      eyes on her, piercing.

                           COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                    
                    (to the little girl, in
                     Arabic)
                It's okay.

                                      KINGDOM 8/18/06   129.



Little One trembles. One of the women in the corner calls to
her in Arabic, sharp. Janet just strokes the back of her
little bloody fist. Her little hand opens, shaking: this is a
gift for you.

Janet's face ghost white: Little One is trying to give her a
marble...

Al-Ghazi steps closer, sees the marble. Processes things.
Immediately looks over at the huddled mass: THE GRANDFATHER
staring right back at him. We now see the old man clearly. Al-
Ghazi shaking, slowly steps to him, hands out...

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                    
              (in Arabic)
          Let me help you up, Old Man...

The old man nods a `no.'

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                    
              (in Arabic)
          GIVE ME YOUR HANDS!

Al-Ghazi rips Grandfather up now. The family screams. Al-
Ghazi pulls the old man's hands from under his thobe: missing
fingers. Bends at the knees to look the Old Man right in his
eyes, lifts his chin with his hand.

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                    
              (dazed, starting to                                
               realize)                                          
          ...Hamza.                                              

The old man looks up at Al-Ghazi: rage and defiance.             

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                    
          I got you. Abu Hamza, you are under
          arrest.

ABU HAMZA stares, hatred burning into Al-Ghazi.

                    NASSAR
          You are a traitor to your
          country... a traitor to your God.

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             
          I am no traitor to my God. You are.

Al-Ghazi's chest explodes before we hear the booms: the 15
year-old Grandson, firing a cheap, nickel-plated 9MM.
Everybody drops. The family huddles that much closer to the
floor. Al-Ghazi falls back to the floor, pulling Grandfather
with him.

                                             KINGDOM 8/18/06   130.


      Fleury's standing stock still, out-of-body now: He can only
      see a teenager built like a river-reed, like his own Son...
      not a Murderer who just shot his friend. Quiet-sick:

                          RONALD FLEURY
                ...Don't...

      The 15 year-old steps to the doorway, pulls the trigger
      again: the cheap 9MM jams. Janet lifts up with her AK, aims
      it at the boy's chest.

                          RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
                ...drop it, Son...please...

      ...The teenager wiping his tears: so he can see clear enough
      to clear his jammed weapon. Half young boy, the other half
      something much more dangerous...Expert movements from his
      hands, racking back the slide, thumbing the still smoking
      shell from the ejector, letting the slide go, racking another
      round into the chamber.

      Then... Fleury finally pulls his trigger.

      Utter Distortion as the old man reaches for the teenager's
      fallen hand gun. Janet, screaming, raises her gun towards the
      old man as Al-Ghazi shoots the old man in the chest. Sobbing,
      the little boy runs to his fallen grandfather. Janet, still
      screaming, covers the family. The Grandfather whispers
      something we cannot hear in the Little Boy's ear.                

      TIGHT ON HAYTHAM taking it all in: the bleeding, dying           
      teenager; his hysterical sister; Hamza choking, clutching for    
      his grandson. CHAOS, CONFUSION, CONFLICT swirling in             
      Haytham's eyes.                                                  

      A platoon of SAUDI POLICE slowly enter the room.

      Janet goes to the shot 15 year old, starts trying to stop the
      bleeding...

      Fleury reaching for the dying Al-Ghazi, cradling him. Tears
      spill as his eyes move from the dying boy to the old man,
      back down to Al-Ghazi.

      Fleury grasps Al-Ghazi's hand, as a Saudi man would.

                          RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
                You got him. You got him... You got
                him.

143    EXT. PRINCE SULTAN AIRBASE - LATER                        143    

       Our crew watch from a deserted terminal as a C-130 touches
       down.

       Haytham enters: came to say good-bye. The team's first smiles    
       -- collective. Fleury stares at Haytham...thinks about what
       he's seen the past few days...how he has come to admire this
       Kid. Haytham smiling, bandaged himself. Halting and awkward,     
       he shakes Janet's hand.

146   INT. WASHINGTON FIELD OFFICE - CUBICLE - DAY                146   

      Fleury, Sykes, Leavitt and Janet sit around Janet's cubicle.      
      Bandages, awkward silences, and 1000-yard stares. Subpoenas       
      stacked on the corner of Janet's desk. Leavitt quiet,             
      obviously fucked up.

      Grace approaches.                                                 

                           DIRECTOR GRACE                               
                We're going to testify next                             
                Tuesday. Fleury's going first. I'm                      
                gonna go through it with each of                        
                you one on one in advance - make                        
                sure we're all on the same page. If                     
                they ask if we've talked about                          
                this, the answer is unequivocally                       
                "No." OK?

                your heads high.                                        

      SILENCE from the team.                                            

                          DIRECTOR GRACE (CONT'D)                       
                Ronnie, you ready?                                      

                           RONALD FLEURY

      Grace turns to leave. Fleury gets up to follow. They head         
      down the hallway.

      Confusion from Janet.

      The eight year-old Grandson. Tears in his eyes, standing in
      front of fresh graves. His AUNT kneels down next to him,        
      tears flowing, in Arabic:

                          AUNT
                Will you tell me what Grandfather
                whispered to you before they took
                him?

      He turns to his Aunt...

                 "Don't worry: we'll kill them all."                    

       And in his saucer-wide brown eyes, shrink-wrapped in angry
       tears, we see the parts of the future that will burn.

      Sunlight shines TIGHT ON Fleury's face: stitches the length
      of his cheek remain. PULL OUT: Fleury and his son throwing a
      baseball. Lyla watches, standing by a tree.

                                       KINGDOM 8/18/06   136.



Father and son throwing the ball back and forth.

                    KEVIN FLEURY
          You stop the people that hurt Uncle
          Fran?

Fleury stops, just staring at his little son. Tosses back the
ball.

                    KEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D)
          Did you get the bad guys, Daddy?

Fleury catches the ball, stares at his son.

TIGHT ON FLEURY: He reaches and pulls his son close, holding
him for what might just be forever... (alt: He hands Kevin Al- 
Ghazi's prayer beads.)

          A MYSTERIOUS WARRIOR treks across the rugged landscape.
          
                                NARRATOR (V.O.)
                     Legend tells of a legendary warrior
                     whose Kung Fu skills were the stuff
                     of legend.
          
          The warrior, his identity hidden beneath his flowing robe and
          wide-brimmed hat, gnaws on a staff of bamboo.
          
                               NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     He traveled the land in search of
                     worthy foes.

          The warrior sits at a table drinking tea and gnawing on his
          bamboo. The door BLASTS open. The MANCHU GANG rushes in and
          surrounds him.
          
                                GANG BOSS
                         (to warrior)

          The Boss punches the table.
          
                               NARRATOR (V.O.)
                     The warrior said nothing for his
                     mouth was full. Then, he swallowed.
          
          He swallows.

                         (dubbed hero voice)
                     Enough talk. Let's FIGHT!
                     SHASHABOOEY!
          
          WHAM! The warrior delivers a punch and the whole gang goes
          flying.
          
                               NARRATOR (V.O.)
                     He was so deadly in fact that his
                     enemies would go blind from
                     overexposure to pure awesomeness.

                              WARRIOR
                    There is no charge for awesomeness,
                    or attractiveness.
          
          ONE HUNDRED ASSASSINS appear and surround the warrior.

          The roof EXPLODES and a cloud of ninjas erupts into the sky.
          Like a tornado, the warrior spins and knocks them all down.
          
                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    It mattered not how many foes he
                    faced. They were no match for his
                    bodacity.
          
          The warrior beats up a thousand ninjas, delivering his final
          blow while doing a split between two trees.
          
          The warrior stands amongst a field of vanquished foes as god-
          rays shine down upon him.

                    Never before had a panda been so
                    feared... and so loved.

                      Even the most heroic heroes in all
                      of China, the Furious Five, bowed
                      in respect to this great master.

                      We should hang out.
          
                                 WARRIOR
                      Agreed.
          
          As the Five salute the warrior, he turns to see more bandits
          approaching. The Five strike an attack pose. The warrior
          brandishes a shiny green sword and leaps off the mountain
          into the sea of bandits.

                      But hanging out would have to wait.
                      `Cause when you're facing the ten
                      thousand demons of Demon Mountain,
                      there's only one thing that
                      matters. And that's--
          
          In mid air, the Five talk to the warrior in a strange voice.

                      Po! Get up!
          
                                TIGRESS

                      Whu?
          
          
          INT. PO'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Po lands hard on the floor. He tries to clear his head and
          wake up.
          
                                PO'S DAD (O.S.)
                      Po! Get up!
          
          We see his room is filled with various kung fu posters
          (including a poster featuring all of the Five) and souvenirs,
          and a wooden version of the Sword of Heroes (the green
          sword).
          
          Po SIGHS.
          
          He attempts to kick himself to his feet but alas, his belly
          is too worthy a foe.
          
                                PO'S DAD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                      Po! What are you doing up there?
          
                                                                      4.
          
          
                              PO
                    Uh, nothing!
          
          Po hops to his feet, imitating his Kung Fu action figures.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper!
                    Tigress! Rowrrrr...
          
          OUTSIDE on the balcony of the neighboring house, a pig
          watering flowers stares at Po. Po tries to play it cool and
          then quickly ducks out of sight.
          
                              PO'S DAD (O.S.)
                    Po! Let's go! You're late for work!
          
                               PO
                    Coming!
          
          He takes a ninja star from his floor and chucks it at the
          wall. It bounces off.
          
          He throws the star again, but it bounces off again. He picks
          it up and heads downstairs. He trips and falls the rest of
          the way.
          
          
          INT. KITCHEN - DAY
          
          Po falls flat on his face on the kitchen floor. A panda-
          shaped shadow looms over Po.
          
                              PO
                    Sorry, Dad.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Sorry doesn't make the noodles.
          
          Reveal that the shadow is actually caused by a basket being
          carried by a small DUCK. This is PO'S DAD. Po gets to work,
          which is not easy since the kitchen's not really made for a
          panda his size.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    What were you doing up there? All
                    that noise.
          
                              PO
                    Oh, nothing. Just had a crazy
                    dream.
          
          He gets back to work.
          
                                                                      5.

                              PO'S DAD
                    The dream. What were you dreaming
                    about?
          
                              PO
                    What was I... eh, I was dreaming
                    about uh... heh...
          
          Push in on Po -- is he going to admit his dream? He hides his
          throwing star behind his back.
          
                               PO (CONT'D)
                    Noodles.
          
          THOK. Dad stops chopping vegetables.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Noodles. You were really dreaming
                    about noodles?
          
                              PO
                    Uh, yeah. What else would I be
                    dreaming about?
          
          Po hands a noodle bowl to a customer, then realizes his
          throwing star is sitting in it.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                        (to customer)
                    Careful, that soup is... sharp!
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Oh, happy day! My son, finally
                    having the noodle dream!
          
          He throws his arms around Po.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    You don't know how long I have been
                    waiting for this moment.
          
          When Dad pulls out of the hug, Po is now wearing a noodle
          apron.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    This is a sign, Po!

          Po looks at the apron nervously -- what has he gotten himself
          into?
          
                              PO
                    Uh...a sign of what?

                    ingredient of my "Secret Ingredient
                    Soup." And then you will fulfill
                    your destiny and take over the
                    restaurant, just as I took it over
                    from my father, who took it over
                    from his father, who won it from a
                    friend in a game of mahjong.

                    No, it was the dream. We are noodle
                    folk. Broth runs through our veins.

                    But Dad, didn't you ever, I dunno,

                    Actually...
          
          Po looks surprised.

                    I thought about running away and
                    learning how to make tofu.

                    Oh, because it was a stupid dream.
                    Can you imagine, me making tofu?
                        (laughs at the thought)
                    No. We all have our place in this

                    seven, and twelve.
          
          He loads Po's arms with bowls of soup.

          A GONG sounds in the distance. Po looks out the window at the
          distant JADE PALACE.
          
          
          EXT. JADE PALACE - DAY
          
          SLAM ZOOM in towards Palace.
          
          End next to palace on an old red panda (SHIFU) playing a
          FLUTE. He is surrounded by the bushes and trees that nestle
          between the Palace buildings.
          
          Wider: We dolly around from behind the bushes. Stealthy dark
          shapes move in the foreground.
          
          Back on Shifu, still playing. He seems oblivious.
          
          Five figures explode from the undergrowth simultaneously,
          diving on Shifu.
          
          Shifu moves like lightning - the flute now wielded like a
          staff - he deflects, blocks, dodges, parries - the attackers
          go flying -
          
          They roll and pick themselves up, turning to face Shifu, who
          is now standing - poised - ready for their next move.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Well done, students... if you were
                    trying to disappoint me.
          
          He uses his flute to correct the Five's technique.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Tigress, you need more ferocity.
                    Monkey, greater speed.
          
          Each of the Five bows respectfully as their name is
          mentioned.
          
                                                                      8.

                    Crane - height. Viper - subtlety.
                    Mantis--
          
          Shifu suddenly points the flute at a scared PALACE GOOSE.
          
                              ZENG
                    Master Shifu!
          
                              SHIFU
                        (impatiently)
                    What?!
          
                              ZENG
                        (startled)
                    Aah! It's Master Oogway. He wants
                    to see you.
          
          Shifu looks up, concerned.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY
          
          Shifu strides purposefully down the hallway, which is lined
          with palace geese.
          
          
          INT. SCROLL ROOM - DAY
          
          Candles, incense, and smoke fill the room. The door bursts
          open, the candles flicker. Shifu enters.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Master Oogway? You summoned me.
          
          He bows. Then looks up without unbowing.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Is something wrong?
          
          Reveal Master Oogway... a wise, old tortoise.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Why must something be wrong for me
                    to want to see my old friend?
          
                              SHIFU
                    So... nothing's wrong?
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Well, I didn't say that.
          
          Shifu looks up, concerned. Oogway opens his mouth... and
          blows out a candle. And another candle. And another.
          
                                                                     9.
          
          
          Finally, Shifu uses his Kung Fu to blow them all out. Oogway
          smiles knowingly.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You were saying?
          
                              OOGWAY
                    I have had a vision... Tai Lung
                    will return.
          
          Shifu looks stricken.
          
          
          FLASHBACK - INT. SCROLL ROOM
          
          Quick, impressionistic images of Shifu battling a large,
          shadowy figure (Tai Lung).
          
          
          PRESENT - INT. SCROLL ROOM
          
          Shifu is rattled. He looks at the claw marks that still scar
          the wall and quickly looks away. But he regains his
          composure.
          
                              SHIFU
                    That is impossible. He is in
                    prison.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Nothing is impossible.
          
          Shifu makes a split decision.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Zeng!
          
          He comes flying in. Shifu gets in his face.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Fly to Chogun Prison and tell them
                    to double the guards, double their
                    weapons. Double everything! Tai
                    Lung does not leave that prison!
          
                              ZENG
                    Yes, Master Shifu.
          
          The goose flies off, but... SMACK! He hits a column. Then he
          is off. Back on Oogway, as he walks toward camera, away from
          Shifu.
          
                                                                   10.

                    One often meets his destiny on the
                    road he takes to avoid it.
          
                              SHIFU
                    We have to do something. We can't
                    just let him march on the valley,
                    and take his revenge! He'll, he'll--
          
          Oogway looks into the water of the moon pool.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Your mind is like this water, my
                    friend. When it is agitated, it
                    becomes difficult to see. But if
                    you allow it to settle, the answer
                    becomes clear.
          
          Shifu and Oogway stare into the pool. Oogway settles the
          water, revealing the reflection of an intricately carved
          dragon clutching a SCROLL in its mouth.
          
                              SHIFU
                    The Dragon Scroll...
          
                              OOGWAY
                    It is time.
          
                              SHIFU
                    But who? Who is worthy to be
                    trusted with the secret to
                    limitless power? To become...the
                    Dragon Warrior?!
          
          Dramatic music as we push in on Oogway's face. Then...
          
                              OOGWAY
                    I don't know.

          He sucks his belly in, but this causes his butt to interfere
          with a bunny family's meal.
          
                              DISGUSTED PATRON

          A couple palace geese put up a poster on the wall and a
          palace pig hits a tiny gong. This gets Po's attention. He
          rushes up to the poster.

          PAN DOWN a long, long, long, long flight of stairs. Po stands
          at the bottom with his noodle cart, looking up at the
          daunting task before him.
          
          Po struggles to pull his noodle cart up the stairs.

          Po watches as they run up the stairs. His eyes narrow. This
          is his heroic moment.

          Oogway reaches the bottom of the palace stairs and a Palace
          Pig bangs a gong.

                    Yes, and one I feared I would not
                    live to see. Are your students

                              OOGWAY
                    Now know this, old friend. Whomever
                    I choose will not only bring peace
                    to the Valley, but also to you.
          
          As Shifu contemplates what this could mean, Oogway starts
          walking off. Shifu quickly joins Oogway as they head towards
          the roaring crowd below. The pig bangs the gong.

          Po struggles to peek through the window.

                     Hey, get out of the way!
          
          Po backs up to get a better look at Crane in the sky and
          accidentally falls down the stairs.
          
          Po climbs back up and drops his head -- he missed it.
          
          MONTAGE:
          
          Po tries karate chopping the door open...to no avail. He
          slumps to the ground.

          Po attempts a pole vault, but falls on his back. The pole
          whips around and hits him into the arena wall.
          
          Po rigs a catapult, only to get clobbered by it. The crowd
          CHEERS.
          
          Po sits atop the stairs. Alone.

          Tigress sets up to deliver her move.
          
          Po launches himself up above the fence, gets a peek at
          Tigress, then falls out of view just as she does her move.
          
          Po lands outside the arena in a fireworks tent.

          Po struggles with something, his back turned to us. Reveal he
          has tied a load of fireworks to a chair. He hops on and
          lights the fuse.

          Po's Dad rushes over and tries to blow out the fuse.

                    But I don't understand. You finally
                    had the noodle dream.
          
          Po looks uneasy.

          He looks at the fuse... almost all gone... Po holds onto the
          chair for dear life, closes his eyes, and braces himself for
          liftoff.

          Po finally opens his eyes...
          
          He's still on the ground. The fuse was a dud. Po falls face
          first into the dirt. He looks away, embarrassed. Po's Dad
          holds out his apron.

          Po sighs, starts to reach for the apron, then-- BOOM! The
          rockets ignite, propelling Po into the stadium wall.

          The crowd goes wild! They cheer! They scream! Confetti falls!
          A palanquin is carried past Shifu.

          is abruptly lifted up out of shot.
          
          Cut to the Palace Geese straining.
          
          Po is being lifted with great effort on the palanquin. He is
          carried off. Shifu elbows his way urgently through the
          thronging crowd to get to Oogway.

                    panda can't possibly be the answer
                    to... our problem. You were about
                    to point at Tigress. That thing
                    fell in front of her. That was just
                    an accident!
          
                              OOGWAY
                    There are no accidents.
          
          Oogway smiles benignly as we hear an off-screen CRASH!
          
          The camera adjusts to reveal the palanquin has collapsed
          under Po.
          
          Shifu looks at Oogway. Oogway just smiles.
          
          A squad of burly pigs rushes in and hoists Po, the palanquin,
          and the Geese onto their shoulders, and they head off for the
          Jade Palace. Stunned, Shifu watches them go.
          
          Behind him, the Five approach and bow.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    Forgive us, Master. We have failed
                    you.
          
          Shifu spins around.
          
                              SHIFU
                    No. If the panda has not quit by
                    morning, then I will have failed
                    you.
          
          Confetti flutters through the air as the celebration
          continues around them.

          EXT. PRISON -- NIGHT
          
          A huge prison is carved into the side of a frozen mountain.
          Fifteen stories of iron and rock. No windows. One door --
          locked, bolted and sealed tight. Rhinoceros guards in armor
          patrol the perimeter.
          
          Zeng, the palace goose, flies into frame and a Rhino Sentry
          spots him in the distance. He lands, sliding on the ice and
          crashing into the gate. The rhinos point their spears at him.
          
                              ZENG
                    Wait wait wait! I bring a message
                    from Master Shifu.
          
          CLANG! The doors creak open. The terrified goose peers in.

          The Goose is quaking in fear. Stern Rhinos surround him,
          staring daggers at him. The Commander snaps the scroll shut.

          The goose looks over the bridge's edge. The prison goes down
          a long ways. The commander hits the goose on the back.

          A feather from the goose drifts down the prison.

                       Yes, very impressive. It's VERY
                       impressive.
          
                                 COMMANDER
                       One way in, one way out, one
                       thousand guards, and one prisoner.
          
                                 ZENG
                       Yes, except that prisoner is Tai
                       Lung...
          
          
          AT THE ELEVATOR
          
                                 COMMANDER
                       Take us down.
          
          Several guard rhinos winch the goose and the commander down.
          The commander grabs the chain and shakes the elevator, trying
          to scare the goose.
          
                                 ZENG
                       What are you doing?!
          
          The commander just laughs. The elevator finally lands,
          sending an echo throughout the prison.
          
          AT DOORS -
          
          A number of doors unlock, one after the other. Finally, a
          drawbridge is lowered out onto an island.
          
                                  ZENG (CONT'D)
                       Oh my...
          
                                 COMMANDER
                       Behold, Tai Lung.
          
                                 ZENG
                       I'll um...I'm just gonna wait right
                       here.
          
                                                                  23.
          
          
                              COMMANDER
                    It's nothing to worry about. It's
                    perfectly safe.
          
          He shoves the goose out ahead of him.
          
                              ZENG
                    Oof!

                              ZENG
                    Crossbows?!
          
          They approach TAI LUNG, a giant, muscular snow leopard bound
          in a giant piece of tortoise shell armor and chains. He
          barely registers signs of life. The commander walks right up
          to him.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    Hey, tough guy, did you hear?
                    Oogway's finally gonna give someone
                    the Dragon Scroll and it's not
                    gonna be you!
          
          The goose can't believe it.
          
                              ZENG
                    What are you doing?! Don't get him
                    mad.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    What's he gonna do about it? I've
                    got him completely immobilized.
          
          The Commander stomps on Tai Lung's tail. We hear a crunch.
          The goose flinches. But Tai Lung does not react.
          
                              COMMANDER (CONT'D)
                    Awww. Did I step on the witty
                    kitty's tail? Awww.
          
          Tai Lung doesn't move. His eyes stare coldly straight ahead.
          
                              ZENG
                    I'm good. I've seen enough. I'm
                    gonna tell Shifu he's got nothing
                    to worry about.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    No, he doesn't.
          
                                                                     24.
          
          
                              ZENG
                    Okay, I'll tell him that. Can we
                    please go now?
          
          The Commander starts to walk back to the elevator. The goose
          hurries after him.
          
          The goose's feather flutters into frame. We follow the
          feather as it lands right in front of Tai Lung.
          
          HIS EYES OPEN. Tai Lung grabs the feather with his tail.
          
          
          INT. JADE PALACE - HALLWAY
          
          The palace doors open to reveal Po on the palanquin, hundreds

                    when I flex my pinky.
          
          Po nervously eyes his finger locked in Shifu's grip and nods
          quickly.

                    Now listen closely, panda. Oogway
                    may have picked you, but when I'm
                    through with you, I promise you,
                    you're going to wish he hadn't. Are
                    we clear?

                    Yeah, we're clear. We're clear. We

                              SHIFU

          INT. TRAINING HALL
          
          The doors open, revealing Po nursing his wounded finger.
          Shifu steps out of the way and Po's face goes into shock. The
          Five are performing death-defying kung fu moves in the
          training hall. Tigress smashes a swinging, spiked ball of
          wood. ANGLE ON AN AWESTRUCK PO, as shards of wood blast into
          his face. Po is intimidated and overwhelmed.
          
                                                                 29.
          
          
          Shifu scowls at Po.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Let's begin.
          
          He gestures to the gauntlet. Po's eyes go wide.

                    Yes...now. Unless you think the
                    great Oogway was wrong, and you are
                    not the Dragon Warrior.

                    can do all of those moves.
          
          Shifu walks away and Po half-heartedly follows.
          
                              SHIFU

                    but uh, let's just start at zero,
                    level zero.
          
                              SHIFU
                    There is no such thing as level
                    zero.

                    Hey! Maybe I can start with that.
          
          Po points at a rather friendly-looking dummy.
          
                              SHIFU
                    That? We use that for training
                    children. And for propping the door
                    open when it's hot. But if you
                    insist...
          
          Relieved, Po turns to the dummy. The Five gather around him.
          
                                                                    30.

          Mantis gives him a look.

          Shifu and the Five stare at Po, perplexed.

          Po lightly hits the dummy and it rocks back into place.
          
                                                                  31.

                       harder...
          
          Po punches it again, knocking it all the way backwards. He
          turns to Shifu, smug.

          WHAP! The dummy rights itself and smacks Po. Totally dazed,
          Po trips and stumbles his way through the obstacle course.
          The Five instinctively step forward to help Po, but Shifu
          holds up his hand to stop them.

          A spiky tethered ball sends Po flying into the jade turtle
          exercise, where it rattles him around.

          wooden dummies.

          still.

          He struggles to get on his feet, takes one step and reaches
          out to a dummy arm...and immediately gets pummeled all over
          again. Po comes out the other side battered and bruised and
          finds he is standing on the floor that shoots out bursts of
          flame. We see reflections of fire on the Five and Shifu as Po
          gets singed. He comes crawling into frame.
          
                                                                  32.

          EXT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT
          
          The Five are walking to the bunkhouse, which sits high on a
          hill.
          
                              MANTIS

                    I don't understand what Master
                    Oogway was thinking. The poor guy's
                    just gonna get himself killed.

                    When he walks, the very ground

                              TIGRESS
                    One would think that Master Oogway
                    would choose someone who actually
                    knew Kung Fu.
          
                              CRANE
                    Yeah, or could at least touch his

                    Or even see his toes.
          
          As the others walk off, we reveal Po, who unbeknownst to them
          has been walking behind them this whole time, hearing
          everything.
          
          He attempts to look at his toes but just sees gut. He lifts
          up his stomach, leans forward... leans... leans... and falls
          over.
          
                                                                  33.
          
          
          He gets up and watches them go inside. He sighs.

          Po takes a gentle step. CRE-E-E-A-AA--CHUNK! Po's foot goes
          through the floor. Po tries to recover. SQUEAK-SQUEAK-SQUEAK!
          THUNK! Po rolls his ankle and stumbles through a bedroom
          door.

                    Look, you don't belong here.
          
          Po looks stung to be hearing this from one of his heroes.

          Crane stops Po before he embarrasses himself even more.

                    belong here. I mean, in this room.

                    want to get to sleep.

                    Okay. Bye bye.
          
          Po shuts the door. Crane sighs. The door flies open. Po
          enters with an eager smile.

          EXT. JADE PALACE - NIGHT
          
          A dejected Po stands under a peach tree in the moonlight.
          Oogway approaches.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    I see you have found the Sacred
                    Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.
          
          Po spins around, his face dripping with peach juice.
          
                                                              36.

                    sorry. I thought it was just a
                    regular peach tree.
          
                              OOGWAY

          Po sighs, there's no use trying to lie to Oogway.

                         front legs)
                    ...thingies. Maybe I should just
                    quit and go back to making noodles.

                    noodles.
          
          Po looks confused.
          
                                                                  37.

                    You are too concerned with what was
                    and what will be. There is a
                    saying: Yesterday is history,
                    tomorrow is a mystery, but today is
                    a gift. That is why it is called
                    the present.
          
          Oogway hits the tree with his staff as he walks away and a
          peach falls into Po's open hand.
          
          
          INT. PRISON -- NIGHT
          
          Using the goose's feather to pick the lock, Tai Lung BURSTS
          free from his armor.
          
          An ALARM RINGS OUT!
          
          The Commander runs to the ledge, the Goose right behind him.
          
                              ZENG
                    What's happening?!
          
          The Goose looks over the edge and sees Tai Lung at the bottom
          of the pit.
          
          Tai Lung struggles with his shackles.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    Fire Crossbows!
          
          Tai Lung uses the incoming spears to break his shackles and
          then manages to kick the spears back up into the walls,
          creating a makeshift staircase.
          
                              ZENG
                    Tai Lung is free! I must warn
                    Shifu!
          
          The Commander shuts the Goose up.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    You're not going anywhere. And
                    neither is he.
          
                              ZENG
                    Let go of me!
          
                              COMMANDER
                        (to guards)
                    Bring it up!
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
          The winch turns and the elevator starts to rise. A rhino
          guard tries to reach it, but just misses.
          
                              RHINO GUARD #1
                    Wait! Bring it back!
          
                              ZENG
                    He's coming this way!
          
                              COMMANDER
                    He won't get far.
                        (to guards)
                    Archers!
          
          Leaping across the spears, Tai Lung catches the elevator as
          the volley of arrows flies down past him.
          
          The guards cut the rope and the elevator crashes back down to
          the bottom of the pit.
          
          Tai Lung swings up from the bottom of the elevator house and
          catches the guards by surprise. He grabs the chain and jumps
          over the edge and swings around, launching himself up to the
          next tier, disappearing into the shadows.
          
          Tai Lung lands on a bridge, fights his way through, finally
          reaching the top tier where the Commander and the rest of the
          Rhino army await.
          
                              ZENG
                    We're dead. So very, very dead.
          
          The Commander hushes the Goose.
          
                              COMMANDER
                        (to Goose)
                    Heh heh...not yet we're not! Now!
          
          Archers set off charges on the ceiling. Massive stalactites
          crash down and the bridge begins to crumble. Tai Lung leaps
          across the crumbling debris and attempts one last huge jump
          towards the Commander. But he falls short, claws scraping and
          sparking against the rock wall. The Commander laughs
          maniacally.
          
          On his way down, Tai Lung looks up and sees a fuse burning
          down to the last group of explosives. He leaps across the
          raining debris up to the ceiling of the cavern.
          
          Grabbing a hold of the dynamite, Tai Lung falls and slings it
          ahead of him at the guards.
          
                              ZENG
                    Can we run now?
          
                                                                   39.
          
          
                              COMMANDER
                    Yes.
          
          
          EXT. PRISON
          
          KA-THOOM! The door blasts open and Rhinos go flying
          everywhere.
          
          WHUMP. The Goose hits the ground. The commander's horn
          prosthetic falls in front of him.
          
                              ZENG
                    Nuuu... Urggg...
          
          Tai Lung picks up the Goose by the throat.
          
                              ZENG (CONT'D)
                    URRK!
          
                               TAI LUNG
                    I'm glad Shifu sent you. I was
                    beginning to think I had been
                    forgotten.
          
          With a creepy tenderness, Tai Lung smooths the Goose's
          ruffled feathers.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    Fly back there and tell them...the
                    real Dragon Warrior is coming home.
          
          Tai Lung throws the Goose into the air and he flutters off.
          Lightning strikes.
          
                                                            CUT TO:

          CLOSE-UP of a gong being struck.
          
          
          INT. BUNKHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Shifu enters the hallway of the bunkhouse. The Five burst out
          of their rooms and land, ready for inspection.
          
                              FURIOUS FIVE
                    Good morning master!
          
          One door remains closed.

          He slides open Po's door. The room is empty.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                        (satisfied)

          Shifu walks with a bit more energy.

                    What do we do now, Master? With the
                    panda gone, who will be the Dragon
                    Warrior?
          
                              SHIFU
                    All we can do is resume our
                    training and trust that in time,
                    the true Dragon Warrior will be
                    revealed.
          
          
          INT. JADE PALACE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Shifu enters the training hall, only to find himself face-to-
          face with Po's butt. Shifu and the Five are taken aback.
          
                              SHIFU
                    What are you doing here?!
          
          Reveal Po is in the middle of the floor, his legs spread wide
          apart. Po looks back over his shoulder to see Shifu and the
          Five enter the hall.

                    thought I'd warm up a little.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You're stuck.

                    Stuck?! Whaa? Pfft... stuck...
                    Yeah, I'm stuck.
          
                              SHIFU
                        (to Crane)
                    Help him.
          
          Crane approaches Po.
          
                                                                 41.

                    Oh dear.
          
          Crane gingerly grabs Po's waistband and attempts to pull him
          up by flapping his wings.
          
                              PO
                    Maybe on three. One. Two-
          
          Crane pulls him up and Po flops onto his back.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    Threeeee. Thank you.

                              SHIFU
                    You actually thought you could
                    learn to do a full split in one
                    night? It takes years to develop
                    one's flexibility and years longer
                    to apply it in combat.
          
          Shifu flings two boards into the air. Instantly, Tigress
          leaps up and executes a perfect split kick. Po is awestruck.
          As Tigress lands, the broken chunks of board land all around
          Po, knocking him on the head.
          
          Po collects a piece of splintered board as a souvenir. Shifu
          notices and steps forward.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Put that down! The only souvenirs
                    we collect here are bloody knuckles
                    and broken bones.
          
                              PO
                    Yeah, excellent!
          
          He laughs excitedly and salutes Shifu.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Let's get started.

          MONTAGE
          
          Shifu snaps his fingers. Viper and Po face off.

                    I was born ready--
          
          Viper lashes her tail around Po's wrist, wrenches his arm
          back, flings him into the air and brings him crashing back
          down on his head.
          
                                PO (CONT'D)

                    I'm sorry, brother! I thought you
                    said you were ready!

                    That was awesome! Let's go again.
                        (salutes)
          
          Shifu snaps.
          
          Monkey twirls a bamboo staff. He lunges at Po who takes a
          comical beating.
          
          Shifu snaps.
          
          Po and Crane prepare to spar atop the turtle bowl. CRASH. Po
          falls in and is tossed around like a sack of soup.
          
          Shifu snaps.
          
          We see a series of shots of Po falling on his face at the
          hands of some invisible opponent, who turns out to be...
          Mantis.
          
          Shifu smiles. Flat on his back, Po manages a salute. Shifu
          has had it.
          
                              SHIFU
                    I've been taking it easy on you,
                    panda, but no more! Your next
                    opponent... will be me.
          
          Po looks excited.
          
                              PO
                    Alright! Let's go!

          The Five exchange worried looks.
          
                              SHIFU
                        (to Po)
                    Step forth.
          
          Po doesn't even finish the step as Shifu whirls him around
          and throws him to the floor pinning his arm behind him.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    The true path to victory is to find
                    your opponent's weakness and make
                    him suffer for it.
          
                              PO
                        (delighted)
                    Oh, yeah!
          
          Shifu whips Po around again.
          
                              SHIFU
                    To take his strength and use it
                    against him.
          
          Again, this time Shifu holds Po by the nose.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    --until he finally falls, or quits.
          
          Po is totally inspired.

                    But a real warrior never quits.
                    Don't worry, Master, I will never
                    quit!
          
          At his breaking point, Shifu flings Po into the air and then
          leaps at him with a flying kick.
          
                                                            CUT TO:

          Po crashes out of the door and tumbles down the steps.
          
          The Five watch him fall.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    If he's smart, he won't come back
                    up those steps.
          
                              MONKEY
                    But he will.

          Cut WIDE as Po continues to tumble.

          Mantis pops up from behind Po holding a handful of needles
          and sticks Po again.

          Po looks for Mantis...

                    I'm over here.
          
          ...But Mantis is now on his other shoulder. He jabs another
          needle into Po.

          Viper is holding a diagram of acupuncture meridians (onto
          which someone has overlaid a drawing of a panda.)

                    Shifu's trying to inspire me and
                    all, but if I didn't know any
                    better, I'd say he was trying to
                    get rid of me.
          
          Po chuckles. The others look at each other and chuckle
          awkwardly.

                                                                  47.
          
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    ...and when the boy showed talent
                    in Kung Fu...
          
          Baby Tai Lung punches the training dummy across the floor.
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    ...Shifu trained him.
          
          Shifu teaches Baby Tai Lung how to punch.
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    He believed in him. He told him he
                    was destined for greatness.
          
          Hard cut to a full-grown Tai Lung demolishing a training
          dummy.
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    It was never enough for Tai Lung.
                    He wanted the Dragon Scroll. But
                    Oogway saw darkness in his heart
                    and refused. Outraged, Tai Lung
                    laid waste to the valley. He tried
                    to take the scroll by force. And
                    Shifu had to destroy what he had
                    created.
          
          Tai Lung ransacks a village on his way up to the Jade Palace.
          He crashes through the doors, running towards a waiting Shifu
          and Oogway.
          
          Shifu leaps at Tai Lung to deliver a kick.
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    But how could he?
          
          Seeing only baby Tai Lung running towards him, Shifu pulls
          his kick short. Tai Lung counters with a devastating strike
          and Shifu crashes to the ground holding his broken leg.
          
          Tai Lung leaps for the scroll, but Oogway stops him with
          strikes at his pressure points. He falls to the ground in a
          heap.
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Shifu loved Tai Lung like he'd
                    never loved anyone before...
          
          Young Tigress in the training hall strikes the dummy in the
          same manner as Tai Lung. Shifu corrects her form. Nothing
          more. Young Tigress looks crestfallen.
          
                                                                     48.
          
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    ...or since.
          
          The sad, young Tigress cross-dissolves to adult Tigress.
          
          
          INT. BUNKHOUSE - EVENING
          
          Everyone is quiet in the moment.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    And now he has a chance to make
                    things right, to train the true
                    Dragon Warrior. And he's stuck with
                    you: a big, fat panda who treats it
                    like a joke.
          
          Po makes a googly-eyed face.

                    Oh! That is it!
          
          Mantis pops up and halts Tigress.
          
                              MANTIS
                    Wait! My fault! I accidentally
                    tweaked his facial nerve.
          
          Po falls face first to the floor, revealing his back is
          covered with needles.
          
                              MANTIS (CONT'D)
                    And may have also stopped his

          INT. TRAINING HALL - NIGHT
          
          Shifu is sitting in meditation, fidgeting incessantly.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner
                    peace.
          
          He finally opens one eye.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Would whoever is making that
                    flapping sound, quiet down!
          
                                                                   49.
          
          
          Satisfied with the silence, Shifu nods and resumes his
          meditation.
          
                               SHIFU (CONT'D)

                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Oh, Zeng. Excellent. I could use
                    some good news right now.
          
                               ZENG
                    Uh...

          EXT. JADE PALACE GROUNDS - EVENING
          
          Oogway stands under the peach tree, deep in thought. Shifu
          rushes in, emerging from the mist, extremely agitated.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Master! Master!
          
                               OOGWAY
                    Hmmm?
          
                              SHIFU
                        (out of breath)
                    I have-- it's-- it's very bad news.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Ah, Shifu. There is just news.
                    There is no good or bad.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Master, your vision...your vision
                    was right. Tai Lung has broken out
                    of prison. He's on his way!
          
                              OOGWAY
                    That is bad news...
          
          He turns to face Shifu and stares at him, eyebrow raised.
          
                              OOGWAY (CONT'D)
                    ...If you do not believe that the
                    Dragon Warrior can stop him.
          
                              SHIFU
                    The panda? Master, that panda is
                    not the Dragon Warrior.

                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    He wasn't even meant to be here --
                    it was an accident!
          
                              OOGWAY
                    There are no accidents.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Yes, I know. You've said that
                    already. Twice.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Well, that was no accident either.
          
                                SHIFU
                    Thrice.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    My old friend, the panda will never
                    fulfill his destiny, nor you yours,
                    until you let go of the illusion of
                    control.
          
                                SHIFU
                    Illusion?
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Yeah. Look at this tree, Shifu. I
                    cannot make it blossom when it
                    suits me, nor make it bear fruit
                    before its time.
          
                              SHIFU
                    But there are things we can
                    control.
          
          Shifu kicks the tree and a peach falls to his feet.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    I can control when the fruit will
                    fall.
          
          A peach falls on his head and Oogway chuckles. Shifu tosses
          the peach in the air, leaps up, and splits it with a chop.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    And I can control--
          
          Shifu punches the ground, creating a hole and places the seed
          in it.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    --where to plant the seed. That is
                    no illusion, Master.
          
                                                                 51.
          
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Ah, yes. But no matter what you do,
                    that seed will grow to be a peach
                    tree. You may wish for an apple, or
                    an orange... but you will get a
                    peach.
          
                              SHIFU
                    But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Maybe it can. If you are willing to
                    guide it, to nurture it. To believe
                    in it.
          
          Oogway covers the seed with dirt.
          
                              SHIFU
                    But how? How? I need your help,
                    Master.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    No, you just need to believe.
                    Promise me, Shifu. Promise me you
                    will believe.
          
                              SHIFU
                    I... I will try.
          
          Oogway smiles, then glances up at the sky, then back down to
          Shifu.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Good. My time has come. You must
                    continue your journey without me.
          
          He hands his staff to a confused Shifu.
          
                              SHIFU
                    What... what are you..?
          
          Oogway backs away into the swirling fog.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Master, you can't leave me!
          
          The petals surround Oogway as he approaches the cliff's edge.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    You must believe.

          Shifu runs after him. Oogway is engulfed by peach blossoms.
          As the winds settle, Shifu is revealed standing at the edge
          of a cliff.
          
          Oogway is gone.

                    It is said that the Dragon Warrior
                    can survive for months at a time on
                    nothing but the dew of a single
                    gingko leaf and the energy of the
                    universe.
          
          On the others for a beat. Then Po shrugs.

                    I guess my body doesn't know it's
                    the Dragon Warrior yet. I'm gonna
                    need a lot more than dew. And, uh,
                    universe juice.
          
          Po laughs. He picks up his bowl and takes a giant gulp. When
          he lowers the bowl, we see a noodle hanging from his face --
          it looks like a moustache. Mantis snickers.

          The rest start laughing. Po realizes he's wearing a noodle
          moustache. He plays it up.

                    Laughter? I never heard of it!
          
          The Five keep LAUGHING. Po reaches over and grabs two empty
          bowls and holds them up like ears.

          As the rest of the Five laugh, Tigress sneaks a moment to
          smell Po's soup. Leaning towards the bowl, she suddenly looks
          up and stops. The Five also look up and stop laughing.
          
          Reveal Shifu has entered behind Po. He is holding Oogway's

          Po looks at the stone-faced Five. Tigress jumps to her feet.

          He finally notices Shifu standing there, doing a slow burn.
          Embarrassed, he places the soup bowls on his chest like a

          broken lock, smashed doors, unhinged cabinets. Po belches.

                    What? I eat when I'm upset, okay?
          
          Shifu gets a glimmer in his eye. He has an idea.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Oh, no need to explain. I just
                    thought you might be Monkey -- he
                    hides his almond cookies on the top
                    shelf.
          
          Shifu calmly exits and hides just outside the doorway,
          waiting to see if his hunch is correct.
          
          KLUMP! KLONK! THUNK! Shifu peeks back inside and finds Po
          perched atop the high shelves jamming more cookies into his
          mouth. Po notices Shifu walking back in.

          He glances back down at Shifu, whose disbelief turns to a
          wise smile.

                    I don't know. I guess I-- I don't
                    know. I was getting a cookie...
          
          He looks at the cookie and then can't help but eat it.
          
                                                                  60.

          He and Po stare at each other for a beat. Then... WHOOMP! Po
          slips and crashes to the kitchen floor. A cookie rolls over
          to Shifu. He picks it up.

          slowly works his way up the hill.
          
          Po sets his gear down and looks around. Shifu breathes in the
          morning mist as Po approaches.

          Po and Shifu ready their chopsticks. Po slams the table and
          sends the bowl of dumplings airborne. Back and forth, Po and
          Shifu spar, vying for the dumplings. Until there is only one
          left.
          
          Shifu tries every trick to keep the dumpling away from Po. He
          hides it underneath one of the bowls. He uses his chopsticks
          as weapons to smack Po's chopsticks away. He attacks Po with
          his bamboo staff.
          
          But Po skillfully manages to best Shifu for the final
          dumpling.
          
          Shifu smiles. Po has passed the final test.
          
          But then Po tosses the dumpling into Shifu's open hand.

          The Five race toward a rope bridge stretched between mountain
          peaks.
          
                                                                  64.
          
          
          Tai Lung appears at the other end of the bridge. He ROARS and
          races toward them.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    Cut it!
          
          The others slash at the ropes securing the bridge to the
          mountain. Tai Lung is almost upon them when Tigress cuts the
          final rope. But Tai Lung is too close -- Tigress must launch
          herself into him. The two cats end up in the middle of the
          bridge just as it starts to tumble into the canyon below. The
          Five grab support ropes and hold on for dear life.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    Where's the Dragon Warrior?

                    at her?
          
          Tai Lung laughs. It echoes off the mountain walls.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    You think I'm a fool? I know you're
                    not the Dragon Warrior. None of
                    you!
          
          The Five exchange quick, worried looks.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                        (nodding confidently)
                    I heard how he fell out of the sky
                    on a ball of fire, that he's a
                    warrior unlike anything the world
                    has ever seen.
          
          The Five exchange quick, confused looks.
          
                              MONKEY
                    Po?
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    So that is his name -- Po. Finally,
                    a worthy opponent. Our battle will
                    be legendary!
          
          Tigress charges at him. The battle begins. Tigress punches
          Tai Lung as he hangs from the bridge. But Tai Lung counters
          with a maneuver that sends Tigress slamming backwards through
          the bridge's wooden slats. Then Tigress gets choked by the
          bridge's ropes. Monkey turns to Crane and Viper.
          
                              MONKEY
                    We've got this. Help her!
          
                                                                     65.
          
          
          Viper grabs Tai Lung, which causes him to let go of the
          ropes. Tigress plummets down into the gorge... but Crane
          manages to catch her. Viper punches Tai Lung repeatedly with
          his own fist. Tai Lung manages to get a paw around Viper's
          "throat".
          
                              VIPER
                    Monkey!
          
          ANGLE ON MANTIS AND MONKEY. Mantis is straining to hold the
          rope by himself.
          
                              MANTIS
                    Go!
                        (then)
                    Ack! What was I thinking?!
          
          Monkey leaps into action, kicking Tai Lung in the chest and
          sending him crashing through the slats of the bridge. He gets
          back to his feet and starts running back to them on a single
          strand of rope.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    Mantis!
          
          Mantis whips his end of the rope, sending a sine wave
          shooting toward Tai Lung. The rope whips Tai Lung in the face
          and he gets tangled up. The Five see their chance.
          
                              TIGRESS (CONT'D)
                    Now!
          
          Working as a team, the Five kick Tai Lung's butt every which
          way. Tigress finally slashes the last rope holding up Tai
          Lung. He plummets down... down... disappearing into the mist.
          Mantis whips his end of the rope, returning his buddies
          safely to the mountain.
          
          The Five look relieved. But the relief is short-lived...
          
          Tigress notices that the other end of the bridge is circling
          the far mountain peak. Her eyes go wide with dread. The rope
          whips up. But Tai Lung isn't there.
          
          With a crash, he suddenly appears behind the Five.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    Shifu taught you well...
          
          Tai Lung jabs a finger at Monkey, who instantly freezes.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    But he didn't teach you everything.
          
                                                                     66.
          
          
          Tai lung lunges toward the rest.
          
          
          EXT. TRAINING HALL - EVENING
          
          Shifu and Po walk through the palace courtyard. Po has an
          easy spring in his step.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You have done well, Panda.
          
                              PO
                    Done well? Done well?! I've done
                    awesome!
          
          He swings his belly around and knocks Shifu off balance.
          
          Shifu staggers back, regaining his dignity.
          
                              SHIFU
                    The mark of a true hero is
                    humility!
          
          After a moment's thought, though, he leans toward Po -
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    But yes...you have done awesome.
          
          And he punches him playfully on the arm. Po smiles at him. As
          they LAUGH, an indistinct figure appears in the clouds behind
          them. IT'S CRANE!
          
          Crane carries the five to the palace grounds, crashing in a
          heap.
          
                              PO
                    Huh? Guys? Guys!
          
          Po throws his backpack aside and runs over to them.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    They're dead? No, they're
                    breathing! They're asleep?! No,
                    their eyes are open.
          
          Crane struggles to lift his head.
          
                              CRANE
                    We were no match for his nerve
                    attack.
          
          His head collapses to the ground.
          
                                                                  67.
          
          
                              SHIFU
                    He has gotten stronger.
          
                              PO
                    Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?
          
          Shifu starts freeing the Five. First Viper, then Mantis, then
          Monkey releases suddenly from his paralysis -
          
                              MONKEY
                    He's too fast!
          
          He delivers a Kung Fu punch to Po's head and then slowly
          realizes where he is.
          
                                 MONKEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry, Po.
          
          Shifu kneels before Tigress and works to free her.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    I thought we could stop him.
          
                              SHIFU
                    He could have killed you.
          
                              MANTIS
                    Why didn't he?
          
                              SHIFU
                    So you could come back here and
                    strike fear into our hearts. But it
                    won't work!
          
                              PO
                    Uh, it might, I mean, a little. I'm
                    pretty scared.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You can defeat him, panda.
          
                              PO
                    Are you kidding? If they can't--
                    They're five masters. I'm just one
                    me.
          
                              SHIFU
                    But you will have the one thing
                    that no one else does.
          
                                                                  68.
          
          
          INT. SCROLL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          CLOSE-UP of the Dragon Scroll. Po stares at Shifu - then
          looks up at the Scroll. Then back at Shifu -
          
                              PO
                    You really believe I'm ready?
          
                              SHIFU
                    You are, Po.
          
          They look at each other. This is a big moment.
          
          Oogway's staff hangs in a rack surrounded by candles. As Po
          and The Five stand by, Shifu carries the staff over to the
          reflecting pool. Shifu bows his head, then, eyes still
          closed, he raises the staff up above his head. Po and the
          others watch, expectantly. The peach blossom petals rise in a
          flickering, spinning cloud up from the pool. The gentle
          tornado rises up around the ceiling carving that holds the
          Dragon Scroll. The petals loosen the scroll from the dragon's
          mouth and it falls. At the last second, Shifu reaches out
          with the staff to catch the scroll on the end of it. He turns
          to Po, holding it out.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Behold. The Dragon Scroll... It is
                    yours.
          
                              PO
                    Wait, what happens when I read it?
          
                               SHIFU
                    No one knows, but legend says you
                    will be able to hear a butterfly's
                    wing-beat.
          
                              PO
                    Whoa! Really? That's cool.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Yes. And see light in the deepest
                    cave. You will feel the universe in
                    motion around you.

                              SHIFU
                    Focus. Focus.
          
                                                                  69.

                    Huh? Oh, yeah... yeah.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Read it, Po, and fulfill your
                    destiny. Read it and become... the
                    Dragon Warrior!
          
                                PO
                    Whooaa!!!
          
          Po takes a deep breath. Then he grasps the tube and tries to
          pull the top off it. It doesn't budge. He strains at it.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    It's impossible to open.
          
          He strains again. He tries to bite it off...
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    Come on baby. Come on now...
          
          Shifu SIGHS and holds out his hand. Po passes him the tube.
          Shifu pops the end off effortlessly and passes it back to Po.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    Thank you. I probably loosened it
                    up for you though... Okay, here
                    goes.
          
          He glances at the Five. They look on in awe. Monkey gives him
          the `thumbs up.' Po starts to unroll the scroll, the golden
          light bathing his face. Across the scroll we see Shifu,
          excited that he is witness to history...
          
          On Po's face as he finishes opening the scroll.
          
          Then -
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
          
          Shifu looks concerned. The Five look concerned. Po looks
          utterly terrified.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    It's blank!
          
                                SHIFU
                    What?
          
                              PO
                    Here! Look!

          Po tries to show Shifu the scroll. Shifu covers his eyes and
          turns his head away.
          
                              SHIFU
                    No! I am forbidden to look upon--
          
          But he can't help himself. He takes a peek. Then he GRABS if
          off Po. He turns it around, then upside down. He closes it
          and opens it again, astonished.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Blank? I don't...I don't
                    understand.
          
          Shifu turns away, contemplative. What can this mean?
          
                              PO
                    Okay. So like, Oogway was just a
                    crazy old turtle after all?
          
                              SHIFU
                    No. Oogway was wiser than us all.
          
          Po sits heavily on the floor, dejected.
          
                              PO
                    Oh, come on! Face it. He picked me
                    by accident. Of course I'm not the
                    Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding?
          
          The Five don't argue.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    But who will stop Tai Lung?
          
                              CRANE
                    He'll destroy everything...and
                    everyone.
          
          Shifu puts the scroll back in its container and seals it. He
          looks oddly calm as he turns around.
          
                              SHIFU
                    No, evacuate the Valley. You must
                    protect the villagers from Tai
                    Lung's rage.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    What about you master?
          
                              SHIFU
                    I will fight him.
          
                                                                  71.
          
          
                              PO
                    What?
          
                              SHIFU
                    I can hold him off long enough for
                    everyone to escape.
          
                              PO
                    But Shifu, he'll kill you.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Then I will finally have paid for
                    my mistake.
          
          The Five and Po look devastated.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Listen to me, all of you. It is
                    time for you to continue your
                    journey without me. I am very proud
                    to have been your master.
          
          Shifu salutes them and turns away. Po is heartbroken. Crane
          steps forward and kindly puts a wing around Po, pulling away.
          
          Po resists for a moment, then lets the Five lead him off.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. VALLEY
          
          The Five arrive at the base of the stairs.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    We've got to get them out safely.
          
          Monkey picks up a small child.
          
                              MONKEY
                    Come, little one. Let's find your
                    mama.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    Viper, gather the southern farmers.
                    Mantis, the north. Crane, light the
                    way.
          
          They split up and begin helping the villagers evacuate. Po is
          left by himself.
          
          He makes his way through the bustling town.
          
                                                                     72.

                        (skeptically)
                    Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.
          
          Po approaches the Noodle Shop.
          
                                PO
                    Hey, Dad.
          
                                PO'S DAD
                    Po!
          
          Seeing Po, Po's Dad hurries over and wraps his arms around
          his son. Po bends down to reciprocate the hug, as Po's dad
          pulls away, having fastened an apron around Po's waist.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    Good to have you back, son!
          
                              PO
                        (listlessly)
                    Good to be back.
          
          Po's Dad goes back to packing things up.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Let's go Po. So, for our next shop,
                    it's time to face it -- the future
                    of noodles is dice-cut vegetables,
                    no longer slices.
          
          Dad starts to walk off, unaware that Po isn't following.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    Also, I was thinking, maybe this
                    time we'll have a kitchen you can
                    actually stand up in. Hmm? You like
                    that?
          
          He turns and notices that Po hasn't moved. He walks to Po
          sympathetically.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    Po, I'm sorry things didn't work
                    out. It just... wasn't meant to be.
          
          Po slumps against the cart.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    Po, forget everything else. Your
                    destiny still awaits. We are noodle
                    folk -- broth runs deep through our
                    veins.
          
                                                                  73.
          
          
                              PO
                    I don't know, Dad. Honestly,
                    sometimes I can't believe I'm
                    actually your son.
          
          Dad is taken aback.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Po, I think it's time I told you
                    something I should have told you a
                    long time ago...
          
                                PO
                    Okay.
          
          Dad pauses dramatically.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    The secret ingredient of my secret
                    ingredient soup!
          
          Po feigns excitement.
          
                                PO
                    Oh.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    C'mere! The secret ingredient is...
                    nothing!
          
                                PO
                    Huh?
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    You heard me. Nothing. There is no
                    secret ingredient!
          
                              PO
                    Wait wait...it's just plain old
                    noodle soup? You don't add some
                    kind of special sauce or something?
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Don't have to. To make something
                    special, you just have to believe
                    it's special.
          
          Po looks at his father with dawning realization. He picks up
          the Scroll.
          
          For a moment, Po stares at his reflection on the scroll, then
          he smiles serenely. He gets it now.
          
                                                                  74.
          
          
                              PO
                    There is no secret ingredient...
          
          Po turns back to look at the palace.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. JADE PALACE - DAWN
          
          At the top of the stairs, Shifu looks upon the Valley,
          awaiting his fate. With a gust of wind, Tai Lung appears
          before him.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    I have come home, Master.
          
                              SHIFU
                    This is no longer your home. And I
                    am no longer your master.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    Yes. You have a new favorite. So
                    where is this...Po? Did I scare him
                    off?
          
                              SHIFU
                    This battle is between you and me.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    So. That is how it's going to be?
          
                              SHIFU
                    That is how it must be.
          
          They fight. At last. Tai Lung punches Shifu clean through the
          doors of the Jade Palace.
          
          Tai Lung enters.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    I rotted in jail for twenty years
                    because of your weakness!
          
                              SHIFU
                    Obeying your master is not
                    weakness!
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    You knew I was the Dragon Warrior!
                    You always knew...
          
          Dissolve to FLASHBACK.
          
                                                                    75.
          
          
          A young Tai Lung looks expectant. Oogway shakes his head.
          
                              TAI LUNG (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    But when Oogway said otherwise,
                    what did you do? What did you do?!
          
          Tai Lung looks to Shifu who averts his eyes and the past
          dissolves into the present.
          
                                 TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    NOTHING!
          
          Shifu takes a Kung Fu stance.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You were not meant to be the Dragon
                    Warrior! That was not my fault!
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    NOT YOUR FAULT?!
          
          Enraged, Tai Lung knocks over the Kung Fu artifacts and
          throws them at Shifu.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    WHO FILLED MY HEAD WITH DREAMS?!
                    WHO DROVE ME TO TRAIN UNTIL MY
                    BONES CRACKED?! WHO DENIED ME MY
                    DESTINY?!
          
          Shifu dodges each attack.
          
                              SHIFU
                    It was never my decision to make!
          
          Tai Lung pulls Oogway's staff from the shrine.
          
                                 TAI LUNG
                    It is now.
          
          They fight. Tai Lung pins Shifu down with the staff.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    Give me the scroll!
          
                              SHIFU
                    I would rather die.
          
          They struggle for a beat until finally, the staff splinters
          into a hundred pieces. Shifu looks back at the pieces and a
          flutter of peach tree petals fly by. Caught off guard, Shifu
          gets kicked by Tai Lung into a column.
          
                                                                   76.
          
          
          Shifu climbs the column to the rafters. Tai Lung follows and
          sends them both crashing through the roof.
          
          Lightning flash.
          
          Grappling in mid-air, Tai Lung gets his hands around Shifu's
          throat as they crash back through the roof.
          
          They kick apart. Shifu crashes to the floor and lands hard.
          Tai Lung bounces off the wall and throws a lantern to the
          floor. Flames go everywhere. Tai Lung's arms are aflame as he
          charges at Shifu.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    All I ever did, I did to make you
                    proud! Tell me how proud you are,
                    Shifu! Tell me! TELL ME!
          
          THOOM! A fiery punch sends Shifu skidding across the floor
          and crashing against the reflecting pool. The flames
          extinguish and Tai Lung extends his claws.
          
                              SHIFU
                        (weakly)
                    I have always been proud of you.
                    From the first moment, I've been
                    proud of you. And it was my pride
                    that blinded me. I loved you too
                    much to see what you were becoming.
                    What I was turning you into. I'm...
                    sorry.
          
          Tai Lung stops in his tracks. Shifu waits. Tai Lung's
          expression goes cold. He grabs Shifu by the throat.
          
                               TAI LUNG
                    I don't want your apology. I want
                    my scroll!
          
          He holds Shifu up to the ceiling. Looking up, Tai Lung
          bristles when he sees the scroll is missing.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    WHAT? WHERE IS IT?!
          
          Tai Lung slams Shifu to the floor.
          
                              SHIFU
                        (weakly)
                    Dragon Warrior has taken scroll
                    halfway across China by now. You
                    will never see that scroll, Tai
                    Lung. Never. Never...
          
                                                                  77.
          
          
          Tai Lung is furious. He roars, ready to strike Shifu.
          Suddenly...
          
                               PO (O.S.)
                    Hey!
          
          Tai Lung turns around to find Po standing in the doorway.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                        (out of breath)
                    Stairs...
          
          Tai Lung casts Shifu aside.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    Who are you?
          
                              PO
                    Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.
                        (exhales hard)
                    Huhhh...
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    You?! Him?!
                        (to Shifu)
                    He's a panda.
                        (back to Po)
                    You're a panda. What are you gonna
                    do, big guy? Sit on me?
          
                              PO
                    Don't tempt me. Haha. No. I'm gonna
                    use this. You want it? Come and get
                    it.
          
          Po shows him the Dragon Scroll.
          
          From out of nowhere, Tai Lung appears and punches Po across
          the room, grabbing the scroll knocked from Po's hands.
          
                               TAI LUNG
                    Finally!
          
          Po bounces off a nearby pillar and slams back into Tai Lung,
          sending him flying into a column. Po puts on a brave face and
          strikes a pose as Tai Lung recovers and charges. Po turns to
          run.
          
          Tai Lung quickly catches up and they both sail off the Palace
          steps.
          
          Po clings to the scroll as Tai Lung delivers a kick and sends
          him crashing onto the theater rooftops below.
          
                                                                    78.
          
          
          Po rolls down off a tree and uses the recoil to whip back and
          smash Tai Lung. He briefly skids across the rooftop and comes
          right back at Po.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    That scroll is mine!
          
          Down the Theater steps, Po and Tai Lung grapple for the
          scroll. Po is oblivious to the effects of crashing down
          stairs and in slow motion, his voluminous butt presses down
          on Tai Lung's head. As they crash through the Gateway the
          scroll is knocked loose. Tai Lung goes for the scroll but Po
          snatches it away using a noodle lasso. The scroll flies
          towards him and bounces off his head. Tai Lung leaps for it,
          but Po grabs his tail and pulls him back down onto a cart
          which see-saws Po into the air. In mid-air, Po slurps the
          noodle.
          
          Up and over the rooftops, Po lands in a grove of bamboo trees
          and into a nearby wok shop. The scroll rolls to a stop in the
          street.
          
          As Tai Lung makes his move on the scroll, Po turns the array
          of overturned woks into a shell game, sliding the woks around
          to hide the scroll.
          
                                 PO
                    Lightning!
          
          Tai Lung knocks the woks away and exposes the scroll as Po
          uses his bamboo stilts to block Tai Lung. The leopard swipes
          out the stilts and brings Po down on top of him as the scroll
          rolls down the steps towards the river.
          
          Po gets thrown into a fireworks booth. As Tai Lung chases
          down the scroll, he turns back to see Po flying through the
          fireworks-filled sky.
          
          Po slams through Tai Lung and crashes into a rock wall. The
          scroll flies out of his hand and lands in the mouth of an
          ornamental rooftop dragon. He looks back at Tai Lung, who
          sees where the scroll has landed. Via the magic of cookie-
          vision, Po effortlessly scales the building. Tai Lung is
          shocked.
          
                               TAI LUNG
                    The scroll has given him power.
                        (then)
                    NOOO0!!
          
          He takes a giant leap and kicks the wall. The resulting
          shockwave collapses the building.
          
                                                                    79.
          
          
          Amazingly, Po skips across the falling roof tiles to reach
          the scroll in mid-air as Tai Lung leaps up behind him and
          unleashes a punishing blow that sends Po smashing into the
          ground. As Tai Lung lands, he delivers a final devastating
          punch.
          
          As the dust settles, Tai Lung is looming over Po in the
          impact crater.
          
                                TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                          (out of breath)
                      Finally... oh yes... the power of
                      the Dragon Scroll... is mine!
          
          Tai Lung grabs for the scroll and opens it. His face falls.
          
                                TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                      It's NOTHING!!
          
          Po stirs.
          
                                PO
                      It's okay. I didn't get it the
                      first time either.
          
                                TAI LUNG
                          (disbelief)
                      What?
          
          Po gets to his feet.
          
                                PO
                      There is no secret ingredient. It's
                      just you.
          
          Tai Lung snarls and lunges at Po.
          
                                   TAI LUNG
                      RRRAAAH!
          
                                   PO
                      AAAAGGGHH!
          
          Tai Lung attacks Po's nerve points. But Po begins giggling.
          
                                PO (CONT'D)
                      Stop! Stop it! I'm gonna pee!
                      Don't! Don't!
          
          Tai Lung's nerve attack has no effect on Po. Frustrated, he
          delivers a double-fisted punch to Po's belly.
          
                                                                  80.
          
          
          The shockwave ripples through Po's entire body and Po's arms
          come back and strike Tai Lung, sending the leopard crashing
          back into a building. Po looks at his hands, amazed at what
          he just did.
          
          Tai Lung rises from the rubble and runs at Po again. But Po
          strikes back, using an unorthodox panda-style technique, even
          getting Tai Lung to chomp down on his own tail. Po gives Tai
          Lung a butt bump that sends him crashing into a building. Tai
          Lung emerges and attempts one more lunge at Po. But Po
          prepares... and Tai Lung is swiftly met by Po's IRON BELLY!
          He is launched into the air. Po waits... and waits... until
          finally, Tai Lung appears in the sky and crashes to the
          ground.
          
          Tai Lung is battered, but still defiant.
          
                                TAI LUNG
                          (heavy breathing)
                      You... can't defeat me. You're just
                      a big, fat panda!
          
          SCHWING! Po grabs Tai Lung's finger. Tai Lung's eyes go wide.
          
                                PO
                      I'm not a big, fat panda. I'm the
                      big, fat panda.
          
          Po's pinky pops up. Tai Lung gasps.
          
                                TAI LUNG
                      The Wuxi Finger Hold!
          
                                PO
                      Oh, you know this hold?
          
                                TAI LUNG
                      You're bluffing. You're bluffing!
                      Shifu didn't teach you that.
          
                                PO
                      Nope. I figured it out.
          
          He flexes his pinky...
          
                                  PO (CONT'D)
                      Skadoosh!
          
          KA-THOOM!
          
                                                                  81.
          
          
          EXT. VALLEY OF PEACE
          
          A mushroom cloud appears over the Valley, sweeping past the
          Furious Five and the fleeing villagers.
          
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT. VALLEY SQUARE - A LITTLE LATER
          
          Villagers emerge from hiding. Po walks out from the mist
          looking very much like the warrior from the opening dream.
          
                              KG SHAW
                    Look! The Dragon Warrior.
          
          As he nears, we see that his hat is an upside down wok and
          his scarf is a torn apron.
          
          Villagers CHEER the Dragon Warrior. Po's Dad emerges from the
          crowd.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    That's my boy. That big, lovely
                    kung fu warrior is my son!
          
                              PO
                    Thanks, Dad.
          
          Po hugs his dad. The wok falls off Po's head and rolls on the
          ground until Mantis appears in frame and stops it. The rest
          of the Five are with him. Po takes notice.
          
                                 PO (CONT'D)
                    Hey, guys.
          
                                 TIGRESS
                    Master.
          
          Tigress bows deeply. The others follow.
          
                                 FURIOUS FIVE
                    Master.
          
                              PO
                        (modest)
                    Master?
                        (then, remembering)
                    Master Shifu!
          
          Po races toward the Jade Palace. He climbs the steps. Then
          more steps.
          
                                                                  82.
          
          
          INT. PALACE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Po arrives breathless at the Jade Palace. Shifu is still
          lying in the scroll room, his eyes closed. Po rushes to his
          side.
          
                              PO
                    Master! Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay?
          
          Shifu weakly opens his eyes.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Po! You're alive!
                        (then, darkly)
                    Or we're both dead.
          
                              PO
                    No, Master, I didn't die. I
                    defeated Tai Lung!
          
                                SHIFU
                    You did?!
          
          Shifu smiles and shakes his head in disbelief.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Wow. It is as Oogway foretold --
                    You are the Dragon Warrior. You
                    have brought peace to this Valley.
                    And to me. Thank you. Thank you,
                    Po. Thank you...
          
          Shifu closes his eyes. He is still. Po starts freaking out.
          
                              PO
                    No! Master! No No No! Don't die,
                    Shifu. Please...
          
                              SHIFU
                        (eyes snapping open)
                    I'm not dying, you idiot-- ah,
                    Dragon Warrior. I'm simply at
                    peace. Finally.
          
                              PO
                    Oh. So, um, I should...stop
                    talking?
          
                              SHIFU
                    If you can.
          
          Po nods reverently as Shifu closes his eyes again. Master and
          pupil lie next to each other. The camera pulls up and back
          away from them. Po tries to remain still, but it's hard.
          
                                                                  83.
          
          
          He's about to say something, but he stops himself. He fidgets
          for a beat, then can't control himself any longer.
          
                              PO
                    Want to get something to eat?
          
                              SHIFU
                        (sighs)
                    Yeah.
          
                                                          IRIS OUT.

         It's hard for us here to believe
         what we're reporting to you, but it                    
         does seem to be a fact.

         Murder victims have shown signs of

CLICK! The second newscaster looks more and more dishevelled.




                   SECOND NEWSCASTER (O.S.)

    IN COLOR: A FULL MOON shines over a picture-perfect American
    town. PEOPLE, seen in SILHOUETTE, stroll past quaint shops
    whose signs promise RELIABLE APPLIANCES, WELL-MADE CLOTHES,      
    SOLID VALUES. A DINER has a neon sign that offers the "BEST
    EATS IN TOWN". But something is wrong. The neon isn't lit.
    Nothing in town is lit. Street lamps, windows, are all dark.     
    TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICK. That DISTURBING SOUND continues.



    Some of the PEDESTRIANS drift into "UNIONTOWN PARK", milling
    around a GAZEBO, where THREE "MUSICIANS" are struggling with     
    a trombone, a saxophone, and a tambourine. They can't seem to
    make the instruments work, except for the tambourine player,
    who is rattling out a few very unrhythmic beats. That's where    
    that sound is coming from. TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICKY-TCHICK.     
    A CLOSER INSPECTION REVEALS: The "MUSICIANS" are DEAD. So are    
    the "PEDESTRIANS". Flesh is rotting off their bones. The town
    itself, which at first looked so perfect, is ROTTING TOO.

      DEAD TEENAGE COUPLE walks hand-in-hand near the gas pumps
    of a defunct TEXACO STATION. The boy steps on the little hose
    that BINGS when a car pulls in. Out of the building comes...

    is a wrinkled map of death. He has lost its left arm. Dried      
    blood darkens the shoulder of its jump-suit, where the arm
    was torn away. A "TEXACO" PATCH tells us the Thing used to
    work here. Embroidery tells us his nickname was once "BIG        
    DADDY". He goes to the pump and removes the nozzle. Turns, as

    THE SOUND OF GROANING WOOD as THREE heavily-armed GUERILLAS      
    push a large CRATE over a PRECIPICE into a deep GARBAGE PIT

    Insects BUZZ. RATS crawl. HUMAN SKELETONS, most HEADLESS, lie
    everywhere, no flesh left on their bones. Those with heads       
    show various wounds to their skulls. Except for one, which...    
    ...suddenly, startlingly MOVES! Its bony arm reaches up from

    The doors of a beat-up WHITE MOVING VAN open. Cholo reaches
    in, throwing back an oilcloth that covers ANOTHER CRATE.

     three they've been watching. This one wears the remains of a     
     CLOWN SUIT. Half its bulbous red nose has been eaten away.       
     Painted eyelashes make its stare alarming. Its ORANGE HAIR is    
     crawling with SPIDERS. It wrestles Mike to the ground. Opens     
     its lipsticked mouth. Is about to bite Mike's neck when...

     ...SOMETHING TERRIBLE LOOMS out of the shadows! It moves
     toward Riley and Mike, who can't see it from behind the          
     locker. The LEFT SIDE OF THE THING'S FACE has been BURNED        
     AWAY. Only scar-tissue remains, and a single usable eye
     bulging from a socket.



     Riley turns. Sees the thing. And, surprisingly, he relaxes,      
     recognizing CHARLIE HOUK, a heavily-armed guerilla whose
     intellect is as burned as his face.

Riley and Mike look across the room in the direction of the     

                                                                

voice. Twenty feet away, a WOMAN sits at the controls of what
looks like a scavenged airplane cockpit that's outfitted with   
a mixture of high- and low-tech equipment. She wears a black    

                                                                

leather jacket with "PRETTY BOY" emblazoned across the back.

         (Surprised) Pretty Boy's a dame?




                   RILEY


                                                                

         This one is. Last one was a guy.




                   MIKE                                         

         What happened to him?                                  
Pretty Boy turns, poking her finger through a BULLET HOLE       
encrusted with year-old BLOOD in the chest of her jacket.       

                   PRETTY BOY                                   

         I kept his jacket. For good luck.                      

                   MIKE                                         

         Luck?

         Put some flowers in the graveyard.                     
Pretty Boy reaches out and flips a toggle switch on the         
control panel. THOOMB! THOOMB! DEEP CONCUSSIVE SOUNDS can be    
felt as much as heard as...

     EXT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT

     ...RILEY, CHARLIE, and MIKE step out of A VEHICLE the size      
     of a city bus. The words DEAD RECKONING are painted on its      
     side. This is no bus. It's a war wagon, built of SCAVENGED      
     PARTS with a RIVETED STEEL SKIN. GATTLING GUNS protrude from    
     a MEAN-LOOKING SNOUT. A ROOF TURRET supports two FOURTEEN       
     INCH-CANNONS. Rotating lights SHINE in all directions,          
     piercing the night.                                             
     THOOMB! THOOMB! THOOMB! That sound again. MORTAR TUBES on the   
     vehicle's roof are launching FIREWORKS that BURST in the sky.   

                        CHARLIE

              (Looking up) `Flowers in the                           
              graveyard'. Why do you call `em
              that, Riley? I don't get it. These
              here flowers ain't the kind you lay
              down on the ground. These here are
              sky flowers. Way up in Heaven.

              I love ya, Charlie. Know why?
              Cuzz you still believe in heaven.



     THE WHITE MOVING VAN rolls in and parks beside Dead Reckoning. 

                                                                    

     CHOLO jumps out with the THREE GUERILLAS from the dump.




                         HOLO

              You guys scope out the town?




                        RILEY

              Looks like nobody's hit it before.



     FOUR GUERILLAS get into an old T-BIRD CONVERTIBLE mounted with 
     machine guns. TWO OTHER ARMED MEN climb onto MOTORCYCLES. The 
     very night seems to GROWL as everyone starts their engines.    

                         HOLO

              Ready?




                        CHARLIE

              Always ready. Just look at me
               ou can tell I'm always ready.




                        CHOLO

              I look at you, all I see's an idiot.                   

                        CHARLIE

              I don't think that's all you see.
                bet you see this iron, too.

     Charlie is wearing four holstered sidearms, two shouldered
     automatic rifles, a REMINGTON...and a sly smile that makes us
     wonder whether he's an idiot or not.




                        CHOLO

              Let's go have some fun.




                        RILEY

              Ain't about fun, Cholo.



     VROOOM! The T-Bird and the motorcycles pull out toward town.     

                          ILEY

              We go in, do our job, and get out,
              all of us alive, okay? I don't want                     
              any fuck-ups on my last day out here.

              (Grinning) My last day, too.




                                                                      

      iley looks surprised. Cholo mounts a MOTORCYCLE, REVS the
     engine, and heads out.                                           

                        CHOLO (CONT'D)


              YEEEE-HAAAAAAAA!





                         CHARLIE

              What'd he do, hit the lottery or
              somethin'?




                        RILEY

              Somethin'. (Wondering) Somethin'.



     Riley and Charlie start to get back into Dead Reckoning. Mike    
     follows, pausing to look up at the "sky flowers".                

                        MIKE

              Do those things really work?                            

                        RILEY

              Yup. (Almost sadly) Stenches can't                      
              take their eyes off `em.

     DEAD THINGS stand completely frozen in the middle of main        
     street, like statues, mesmerized by the FIREWORKS.               
     Only one figure is moving. BIG DADDY. He weaves between his
     brothers and sisters, urgently waving his one good hand,         
     like Frankenstein's monster, as if to say "Bad! Bad!" He has     
     learned that fireworks bring danger.

     A DEAD TEENAGE CHEERLEADER, holding filthy pom-poms, looks at   
     Big Daddy, unable to grasp what he's trying to communicate.     
     A SPEAR is DRIVEN through the Cheerleader's face! The spear     
     is held like a lance by HARRY, a guerilla who roars past on     
     his motorcycle hooting like a cowhand on round-up. Other        
     BIKERS rumble down the street, firing guns.                     
     Big Daddy watches the Cheerleader fall. It throws its head      
     back and lets out a great HOWL.

     up in the nick of time.

     Fighting off the Dead Things, Harry gets on and speeds away.

     CHOLO SCREECHES to a stop at a LIQUOR STORE with MIKE and       
     FOXY. All dismount and start toward the entrance. They stop     
     as DEAD RECKONING pulls up and RILEY and CHARLIE climb out.     

                        CHARLIE

              Nothin' in there but booze. Booze

              Not askin' you to.



     Cholo and Foxy start into the liquor store. The doors are
     wide open. All that can be seen from outside is darkness.        

                            ILEY

              Mike! Wait!                                             
     But Mike has followed the others inside.

     CHOLO unstraps his crossbow and leads the way cautiously         
     into the dark space. Every subtle SOUND in the SILENCE puts      
     MIKE more on edge. His hand tenses on his gun as SHADOWS loom    
     in front of him. Shadows that could be zombies, but are not.     
     Behind the dusty glass doors of a once-refrigerated wall-        
     unit, Cholo sees a CASE OF DOM PERIGNON. He goes to the          

                                                                      

     refrigerator. Re-strapping his crossbow, he opens the door.
     Reaches in for the case of champagne. His two hands grab it.     




                                                                      


     A THIRD HAND GRABS IT!




     Cholo looks up. The refrigerator has no back wall. A DEAD

                                                                      

     THING with a Manson-like SWASTIKA tattooed in the center of
     its forehead has stepped in from the shadows of a loading        
     area beyond. It GRABS Cholo with a terrifying GROWL.             
     Cholo falls under the weight of the champagne, and the
     weight of the Dead Thing, which drops on top of him. They        

                                                                      

     roll, struggling. The Thing holds Cholo in a death grip.



     At the front of the store, Mike fumbles with his rifle.          
     Foxy shoots at the Dead Thing and misses.



     Cholo PUNCHES the Thing with his free hand. The Dead Thing's
     head recoils, but lowers again toward Cholo, the Swastika        
     looming, drooling teeth baring for a bite. Cholo's eyes          
     flash. It's the first time we've seen him scared.                
     BLAM! CHARLIE FIRES one round, right into the center of the      
     swastika on the Zombie's forehead. The Thing crumples.           

                        MIKE

              Nice shootin'.

A FOOT KICKS the Zombie off Cholo, who looks up to see...       
...RILEY extending a hand to help him to his feet.              

                      RILEY

         Close one.

         I'm still here, ain't I?                               
Everyone relaxes. Cholo picks up the case of Dom. The others    
head toward the front of the store.                             
TILT DOWN TO THE FLOOR as their feet move past. In the gloom
behind stacks of cartons...                                     
...A DEAD HAND appears. Reaching.




                   CHOLO                                        

         Shit! Look out, kid!                                   
The hand grabs Mike around the ankle! Mike turns, raising his   
gun. Too late.

DOWN TO BONE, RIPS A HOLE IN HIS LEG with its teeth!           
 ike SCREAMS, staggers into a wall, and drops to a seated       
position on the floor. Riley and Charlie spin around at the

and fires an arrow through the Zombie's head.

         Fuckin' rookies.



Cholo tucks away the crossbow, grabs a box of Cohibas off a     
counter, and runs outside with Foxy. Riley goes to Mike.        

                    ILEY

         (Kneeling) It's alright, son.
         You're gonna be alright.




                   MIKE

         No. I'm dead. You get bit by one

Riley wraps a strong arm around Mike and lifts him. Mike
quickly plants the barrel of his .45 under his chin and...

     THE WHITE MOVING VAN, THE T-BIRD, AND THE JEEP roll out of
     town in a convoy. Trailing them, THREE SADISTIC GUERILLAS on    
     MOTORCYCLES ROAR past, firing...                                
     ...a HAIL OF BULLETS at A DEAD FAMILY on the sidewalk. The      
     MOTHER FALLS. Not shot. It has been GRABBED and SHOVED down
     to the ground by...                                             
     ...BIG DADDY! Who GRABS the little GIRL next, thrusting her
     roughly behind the protection of a wrecked car. The FATHER is
     last. Big Daddy grabs it from behind, by its hair, just as...   
     ...ROUNDS from an UZI DRILL A DOTTED-LINE across the Father's   
     neck. Big Daddy is unhurt, but spattered with BLOOD. Not red,
     greenish-black. The blood of the dead.

     T

      here's a RIPPING SOUND as the Father's NECK is PULLED APART
     by the weight of its limp body. The body DROPS to the street.

                                                                     

     The HEAD remains suspended in Big Daddy's hand. His face
     contorts. His mouth opens and closes, trying to utter sounds.   
      ig Daddy drops the head, looking down at its befuddled eyes
     with sympathy. After a moment, the sympathy is joined by
     rage. Big Daddy lifts his right foot and brings it STOMPING     
     DOWN on the disembodied head, CRUSHING ITS SKULL.



     The convoy ROARS off, leaving a cloud of exhaust. Big Daddy     

                                                                     

     sees Harry's downed motorcycle lying in the street. The butt
     of an AUTOMATIC RIFLE protrudes from a saddlebag.               




                                                                     

     Big Daddy goes over. Pulls out the rifle. Tests the weight of
     it in his hand. Curls his finger in through the guard and       
     pulls the trigger.                                              
     BLAM! A bullet ricochets off a brick wall. Big Daddy is
     startled at first. Then, he relaxes, realizing the rifle's      
     power. With surprising dexterity, he slings the weapon's        
     strap over his head and across his chest, patting the strap     
     as if comforted by it. Turning, he looks toward...              
     ...THE DISTANT GLOW OF A SKYSCRAPER that can be seen ON THE     
     HORIZON. That's the direction the convoy is headed. That's      
     where the bad men came from. That's where he wants to go.       

     REVERSE ANGLE:                                                  

     With the city in the distance, Big Daddy starts walking.
     NUMBER NINE falls into step beside him. Soon there are MORE.    
     None of them knows where they are going. Or why. All that       
     seems to matter is that they have a leader.

     DEAD RECKONING, emitting tendrils of HOT STEAM from twenty       
     steel nostrils, stands parked in a corner of a fenced-in         
     outdoor yard. (We don't see how big the yard is. Yet.) A         
     SEARCHLIGHT sweeps the darkness as GUERILLAS unload the
     supplies they took from Uniontown and carry them toward...       
     ...a set of RUSTY STEEL DOORS, above which is a FADED SIGN       
     that reads "SUBWAY (TO CITY)".                                   
     In the bustle of activity, HARRY, the biker who was attacked
     in town, perspires as he helps unload. He looks ill.             
     RILEY walks past, handing out bottles of beer to the men.

     Harry doesn't answer.

     Harry SPINS! GROWLS! LUNGES at Riley like a beast!               
     Riley has no time to reach for his gun. The Harry-Thing is
     strangling him. SMASHING the neck of a beer bottle on the        
     snout of Dead Reckoning, Riley JAMS THE JAGGED GLASS into

     The cargo carrier that was first to pull out drives into the    
     tunnel. CEILING LIGHTS spaced far apart STUTTER on and off.     
     Two guerillas, ANCHOR and MOUSE, who looks like a mouse, ride   
     on the open flatbed with the cargo.                             
     The tunnel is filled with looming steel shapes that cast
     menacing shadows. Mouse shifts nervously. Suddenly...           
     ...PLINK! SOMETHING WET FALLS ON HIS FACE! He JUMPS.            
     Recovers. Wipes his cheek with his sleeve.

     He takes out a joint. Lights up. The match FLARES. SPLAT!       
     Mouse and the match are soaked by WATER dripping from above.

     Cholo looks up at the TV monitor. Riley follows his gaze,           
     seeing well-dressed PEOPLE sipping cocktails in a club room.

     CHOLO collects his boxes and steps onto an escalator that        
     carries him up into an ENORMOUS ATRIUM. The "mall" we saw on     
     TV. SUNLIGHT splashes through glass walls onto box-planted
     trees. Caged birds CHIRP seemingly in tune with the Chopin

     dressed, stroll past stores. OTHER RESIDENTS lunch at            
     "outdoor" cafes. Cholo pulls out a kerchief and wipes the        
     smudges off his face, trying to make himself presentable.

     RILEY and CHARLIE walk down a street into the city's "ghetto"    
     zone, which is lined with taverns, gambling clubs, strip
     joints, like a boom town from Alaskan gold-rush days. BUYERS
     and SELLERS lurk in the shadows, copulating, dealing drugs.



      iley is welcomed by nearly everyone he passes, greeting         
     them in return with a smile and a nod, handing some bills to
     a FATHER with a YOUNG SON, patting an OLD MAN on the back.

REVOLUTIONARIES, led by MULLIGAN, a defiant man who stands      
on a soapbox. A small audience is gathered in front of him.     
He takes a swig from a bottle of whiskey.

         pull him down off his throne!

to the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE ten blocks away.

         You can't fix a place like this,                       
         Mulligan. You just have to get out

Mulligan holds out his bottle to Riley, who passes it to
Charlie, who takes a swig.




                   RILEY                                        

         Everyone's stoppable.                                  
We hear the sound of a boy coughing. Mulligan's son BRIAN
stands behind him, looking feverish.                            

                   MULLIGAN                                     

         You alright, son?                                      

                   BRIAN                                        

         I'm fine, dad.                                         
As Riley starts past, he stops, pulls something from his        
pocket, and presses it into Mulligan's palm.                    

                   RILEY                                        

         Antibiotics. For your boy.                             
Mulligan looks down with gratitude at a bottle his hand.        
When he looks up again, Riley is gone.

     Turning a corner, RILEY and CHARLIE stop in front of a         
     rundown GARAGE with a tarp hanging down instead of a door.
     Riley pulls it aside and looks in. A HOBO lies asleep on a
     grease-stained floor, curled under some old newspapers.




                        RILEY

              Where's the car?




                         OBO

              (Waking) What car?




                        RILEY

              My new car. I paid for it. I was                      
              here yesterday. There were two guys
              getting it ready for me.




                         OBO

              There was nobody here this morning.




                        RILEY

              Sonofabitch!




                        CHARLIE

              What happened, Riley. Didja get
              fucked?



     Riley stands there, grim-faced.




                        RILEY

              (A whisper) Come on.

      ING! An elevator door opens. CHOLO, carrying the champagne
     and Cohibas, steps out, walks to "PENTHOUSE NUMBER ONE", and   
     rings the bell. An instant after he pushes the button...       
     ...the door is JERKED OPEN by TYLER KNIPP, 50-something, an    
     African American man in a white butler's jacket. Frightened,   
     he's wielding a SCISSORS, poised to strike.                    

                        KNIPP

              (Lowering the scissors) Oh, Mister                    
              DeMora. Mister Kaufman ain't home                     
              and there's some shit goin' down.                     
              No lie. I heard...                                    
     A SCREAM RINGS OUT down the corridor!                          

                        KNIPP (CONT'D)                              

              I heard that!

     ANOTHER SCREAM.                                                 


                        KNIPP (CONT'D)                               

              Oh, man. Mister K. sure gonna be                       
              upset about this.                                      
     Cholo drops his boxes and moves down the corridor.              

                        KNIPP (CONT'D)                               

              I called Security. They should be

     Cholo reaches the door to PENTHOUSE NUMBER TWO. It's locked.    
     ANOTHER SCREAM from inside. He FLINGS himself at the door.      
     The LATCH SPLINTERS out of the frame. The door BURSTS open...   

     INT. PENTHOUSE NUMBER-TWO - FIDDLER'S GREEN - DAY

     ...and CHOLO enters a dark foyer. The only light comes from     
     another room somewhere inside. A soft, rhythmic SQUEAK, like    

                                                                     

     a child's swing moving back and forth, ECHOES through the
     apartment. It's an eerie, incongruous sound.                    
     On guard, eyes straining, Cholo moves inside. The squeak gets
     louder, the light brighter as he turns a corner and sees...     




                                                                     

     ...a MIDDLE-AGED MAN, HANGING DEAD from a HOMEMADE NOOSE
     suspended from a light fixture in the kitchen! THE BODY SWAYS   
     slowly, the harsh glare making the man's face even whiter       

                                                                     

     than it is. A toppled chair lies on the floor at his feet.



     Cholo stands transfixed for an instant. And in that instant... 



     ...HE IS GRABBED FROM BEHIND! He whirls, ready to kill, but     
     finds only a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, 60-something, wearing a         
     tailored suit and expensive jewelry, her perfectness            
     blemished only by her hysteria.                                 

                        WOMAN

              My Johnny, he killed himself, he                       
              killed himself. My Johnny! My                          
              Johnny!                                                
     Cholo shakes her, hard.                                         

                        CHOLO                                        

              Keep it together, lady.                                
     Behind them, in the kitchen, unseen, a dazed YOUNG MAN, walks   
     up to the hanging corpse. He rights the toppled chair and       
     steps on it, lifting a paring to knife cut through the noose.   




                                                                














                                                                














                                                      23.











                   YOUNG MAN                                    

         (Softly, to himself) Dad. Oh, Dad.                     

                   WOMAN

         (To Cholo) Se-Security. Are you                        
         Security?




                    CHOLO

         No, I...




                   WOMAN

         Then, for God's sake, who ARE YOU?!



She resumes her SCREAMING.                                      
In the kitchen, the Young Man is slicing through the rope
when his DEAD FATHER'S EYES POP OPEN! The Young Man is too      

                                                                

busy with the rope to notice. THE HANGED MAN'S EYES BLINK.
Once. Twice. Three times. Its body TWITCHES. And then...        




                                                                

...the Hanged Man turns, making a move on the Young Man. The
motion increases the strain on the light fixture, which pulls   
away, SPARKING, from the ceiling and CRASHES TO THE FLOOR,      

                                                                

along with the Hanged Man and his son.



The entire apartment is PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS. The woman        

                                                                

stops her screaming. Almost as soon as she does, a SNARL can
be heard from the kitchen, followed by another SCREAM, this     
one coming from the Young Man.                                  
Cholo rushes to a nearby fireplace and grabs a POKER and a      
MATCHLIGHT, which looks like a pistol, but shoots FIRE from     

                                                                

its tip. He approaches the kitchen, using the FLAME to light
his way. In the FLICKERING GLOW, he sees...                     
...the Young Man lying on the floor. CHUNKS have been bitten
out of his neck and wrist. The body is CONVULSING in the last   
moments of life. THE HANGED MAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.          
Cholo stands over the Young Man and stabs him in the head       
with the poker, jabbing the point all the way through. The      
woman SCREAMS again from the kitchen doorway.                   

                   CHOLO                                        

         Shut up! I gotta hear. Where'd he                      
         go? Where'd the other guy go?                          
Silence. Cholo pulls the poker out of the Young Man's head.     
SHUFFLING sounds. He follows them to the other end of the       
kitchen, probing the darkness with his matchlight.              
The sounds are LOUDER here. Cholo lifts the poker, ready to     
strike. Just as he does...                                      




                                                                








                                                                














                                                                














                                                                














                                                       24.










...the back door of the apartment BURSTS OPEN and a SECURITY    
GUARD lunges into the kitchen, rifle in hand.                   

                   SECURITY GUARD                               

         (To Cholo) Drop it!                                    
Cholo drops the poker and holds up his hands.




                   CHOLO                                        

         Hey, no problem.                                       
TWO MORE SECURITY GUARDS come through the apartment's front
door and rush into the kitchen.                                 

                   CHOLO (CONT'D)                               

         No problem, no problem! But there                      
         is a problem. There's a dead guy                       

                                                                

         walkin' around in here.



THE HANGED MAN appears without warning, attacking one of the    

                                                                

guards who just entered, BITING OFF half his left CHEEK,
including the EYE.                                              




                                                                

Before his partner can raise his gun, THE WOMAN GRABS IT FROM
HIM! Aims at the Hanged Man.                                    




                                                                


                   WOMAN


         YOU SELFISH BASTARD! YOU LEFT ME                       


         ALONE HERE!                                            

She fumbles with the weapon, not knowing how to make it work.   




                                                                

The bitten security guard starts to lose all strength in his
legs. The Dead Thing holds him up, as if waltzing with him,     
BITING HIM again and again.                                     
Cholo takes the gun from the woman and shoots the Hanged Man.




                   BITTEN SECURITY GUARD                        

         I need help. I need help!



Cholo kills the bitten security guard, too.                     

                   SURVIVING SECURITY GUARD                     

         You...FUCK!



Cholo turns the gun on the surviving security guard.            

                    CHOLO

         You wanna talk about this? I did                       
         what I had to do. I only did what I                    
         had to do!

     RILEY and CHARLIE step into the CELLAR of an old BROWNSTONE.
     Dirt floor. Stone walls. The place is filled with smoke and
     BUZZING with FLIES. As Riley and Charley turn their guns over   
     to TWO BIG BRUISERS inside, a TOUT named ROACH sidles over.     

                        TOUT

              Maybe I can find him for you. Come
              on in.                                                 




                                                                     

     Riley is already in. He has pushed past the Tout and is
     striding into a fog where GAMBLERS are rushing to place bets    
     with heavily-armed BOOKIES. We're reminded of a cock-fighting

      iley strides toward a cluster of BETTORS. A very tall man      

                                                                     

     stands among them, wearing a Texas Stetson that sticks up
     high above all other heads, its peacock feathers poking even
     higher out of a snake-skin hat band.



      iley grabs him and spins him around.



      he man's feet are off the ground. Way off the ground. Far
     from tall, he's a little person, who has been standing on a
     platform, wearing a purple satin pimp-suit. He's a Latino,
     who looks like a Chihuahua. And that's his name. CHIHUAHUA.

              there. My dinero's not there.




                        CHIHUAHUA

              Hey, this is not me. I did not do
              this to you. I am your friend. Put
              me down. Come on. I find out what
              went wrong.

     In a dark CATACOMB, DEAD MEN are chained to the walls. WHAM!    
     A POLE shoots out. A NOOSE on the end encircles the neck of a   
     captive Dead Man and is cinched tight. TWO MEN hold the pole
     while A THIRD sprays RED PAINT on the Thing's face. ANOTHER     
     DEAD THING is dragged in and sprayed with BLACK PAINT.

     INT. CENTER RING - "THE ARENA" - DAY




     RILEY and CHARLIE drift into a large room that's packed with
     BETTORS hooting and hollering like football fans. They're all
     jammed onto tiered wooden viewing stands arranged around an
     IRON-MESH STRUCTURE that looks like a lion-tamer's cage.



     Gates open. THE PAINTED WALKERS are thrust inside the cage.
     Their nooses are released. The gates are locked behind them.

     D

      EAD RED, alarmed by the color of DEAD BLACK's face, reaches
     out and gently touches the paint. Its fingers come away with
     blackened tips.



      lack follows suit, staining its fingers red. Black licks its   
     hand, spitting when it identifies not blood, but something      
     distasteful.                                                    
     BOOKIES drift among the spectators, taking bets with fists      
     full of cash.

         new.                                                  
CLANG! Another gate opens in the cage. A hush falls as
everyone awaits what will come. Including the Dead Men, who
gaze with anticipation at the opening. What comes is...



 ..A WOMAN! Alive, badly bruised, her dress in tatters.
Despite tarnish, she still looks sexy. Last night she was a

                                                               

hooker known as SLACK. Now she's meat in a lion cage.

         Jesus fucking Christ.



The gate SLAMS shut. The Dead Things walk toward the woman.



Riley rushes off. Charlie follows.

 lack backs up, hits the wall of the cage and, terrified,
starts to circle its iron perimeter. The Dead Men flank her.   
Black is the first to touch her. The crowd HOWLS.



 lack's terror turns to determination. She punches Black
three times in the face. The Thing recoils as she glides out
of its grasp.



RILEY and CHARLIE reach the BRUISERS who took their weapons.




                   RILEY                                       

         Give us our guns.                                     

                   BRUISER

         In a little while.                                     
In the ring, BLACK reaches for SLACK again. With one            
lightning-fast move, she kicks it in the chest, sending it
flying into Red's arms. Red shoves Black aside.



Black makes another try for the woman. Red grabs its rival.
This time Black hangs on to Red's shirt. The two twirl around
in a staggering lampoon of a wrestling match.                   
Slack rushes to the side of the cage and starts to climb.
She's agile. Strong. But she almost falls as the cage SHAKES
with the force of...                                            
...Red SLAMMING Black against the mesh.                         
On their way back through the arena, RILEY and CHARLEY push
through the crowd, trying to reach the center ring. A GOON      
steps in front of them.                                         

                   GOON                                         

         No guns in here!                                       
Riley gives him a rifle butt in the face and moves on.

S                                                               





                                                                

 lack continues to climb the cage, almost out of reach, but
Black grabs one of her ankles, pulling her down and slamming
her to the ground.



Black hunkers, drooling, over Slack. As it is about to bite,    
RAT-A-TAT! A short burst from Riley's M-16 shatters Black's     

                                                                

collarbone. Cheekbone. Skull. The Thing drops.



Red lunges for Slack. Riley kills it with another short BURST. 



 he crowd PANICS, stampeding toward the exit. Suddenly MORE
BULLETS FLY, this time from a GLOCK, FIRED by...



...CHIHUAHUA, who, in a rage, is pushing through the LEGS of
the fleeing crowd. He makes it to a clear spot and draws a
steady bead on a target...Charlie. Chihuahua pulls his
trigger. Riley beats him by an instant, FIRING the M-16.



Just as Chihuahua's gun GOES OFF...a LINE of BULLET HOLES
PERFORATES the little man's belly. The round from his Glock
misses Charlie completely.



Riley runs to the cage, where Slack stands, trembling, just
on the other side of the bars.

She nods gratefully.



 hihuahua is still on his feet. And now he is really pissed.
Not because of the holes in his gut, but because...




                   CHIHUAHUA

         My suit! You fucked up my new suit!



Riley turns to Chihuahua, but doesn't have time to lift the
M-16 before...BLAM! The little man FIRES at him. Slack
delivers a powerful KICK into the flexible fencing, sending    
Riley sprawling to the ground and saving him from...



...Chihuahua's round, which misses Riley...but HITS SLACK!
Spun around by the impact, she falls face down.



Chihuahua continues to FIRE. Riley Marine-crawls as bullets
PUNCH around him, SPARKING off the cage. Chihuahua keeps
coming, keeps FIRING, until...



...A SINGLE SHOT from Charlie's .45 shatters his skull. He
drops like a broken pinata.




                                                               

Riley looks up, seeing TWO OTHER MEN with guns. Chihuahua's
GOONS. For a moment it seems as if a major shooting match is
going to break out. But before it does...




                    POLICEMAN (O.S.)                           

         Hold it!

 ..FOUR POLICEMEN burst in. The Goons lower their weapons.     
Riley runs back to the cage, BLASTS the lock on the nearest
gate, and rushes inside. Slack's body is lying on the floor.
He suspects she's dead. When her BODY MOVES, he suspects
worse. He plants the barrel of his M-16 against her temple.




                   SLACK

         I'm alright, I'M ALRIGHT!



Slack uses her left arm to push herself up to a sitting
position. Her right arm is BLEEDING, up near the shoulder.




                   SLACK (CONT'D)

          ucker got my right arm. I'm a lefty.



They look into each other's eyes.

                        POLICEMAN

     A UNIFORMED GUARD leaves CHOLO in a PRISTINE WHITE conference
     room with glass walls overlooking the rotting CITY far below.
     Cholo sets the case of champagne and the box of Cohibas on a

              Death intrudes on us even in the

              what happened with my neighbors.                        

                                                                      

              I'm grateful for your help.

                  brought you back some presents.



     Cholo opens the case of champagne. He pulls a bottle out,        
     untwists the wire, and uses his strong thumbs to pop the         
     cork. FOAM runs.

              you? Sure, a high-toned man likes
              to drink out of a glass.



     Cholo grabs a highball glass from a cupboard, pours champagne
     into it, and brings it, overflowing, to the Silhouetted Man.




                        CHOLO

              I got something else, too.



     Cholo tears open the box of Cohibas. He picks up two cigars,
     bites off the tips, puts one in his mouth, then, walking back
     to the Silhouetted Man, puts the other in his mouth, lighting
     them both with a wooden match that he strikes on his jeans.

                      SILHOUETTED MAN

         Thank you.




                   CHOLO

         No, thank you! Twenty grand. That's
         what I got comin' for last night. I
         never bothered to pick it up.

                   S


                       ILHOUETTED MAN

         You didn't?




                   CHOLO

         Nope. I left it in the bank. Your
         bank. With all my other dough.
          rom all those other nights. I got
         enough now to buy me a place.




                                                              


                   SILHOUETTED MAN

         You mean here? In the Green?                         
The Silhouetted Man steps away from the window. Expensively
dressed, in his early 60s, he is PAUL KAUFMAN. He sets down
the highball glass Cholo gave him, gets out a proper          
champagne flute, and fills it from the bottle, smiling
politely at Cholo.




                   KAUFMAN

         I'm sorry, Mister DeMora, but
         there's a very long waiting list.




                      CHOLO

         How long?




                   KAUFMAN

         This is an extremely desirable
         location. Space is limited.




                   CHOLO

         You mean restricted.




                   KAUFMAN

         Well, I do have a board of
         directors, a membership committee
         that has to approve...



A wave of incomparable sadness sweeps over Cholo's face.

                   C


                    HOLO

         I guess it takes more than money to
         become a "member".

                        KAUFMAN

              Take my advice. Withdraw your funds
              from the bank and spend them
              somewhere else.




                        CHOLO

              (Quietly) Don't do this to me. Don't
              do this to me.




                         AUFMAN

              I'm sorry, but...




                        CHOLO

              No, no, no. Three years! Three
              years I been cleaning up after you,                    
              taking out your garbage, and you
              tell me I'm not good enough? You're
              the one who's no good. You are no
              fucking good. And you are gonna let
              me in. You know why? Because I know
              what goes on around here. How many
              of your fucking "members" know
              what's in that garbage I take out
              for you?



     Cholo lunges at Kaufman, grabs him by the collar.




                        CHOLO (CONT'D)


               OU'LL LET ME IN OR I'LL...




     Cholo feels the barrel of a .45 against his waist. Kaufman,
     who has drawn the pistol from his jacket, is still smiling.




                        KAUFMAN

              Maybe we should talk about this
              when you're less excited.



     Kaufman presses a button under the table. THREE SECURITY
     GUARDS rush in, GRAB Cholo, and drag him away. Kaufman stops
     one of the guards at the door.




                        KAUFMAN (CONT'D)

               Softly) I won't be needing this
              man any more.

      HE SECURITY GUARDS lead CHOLO down the stairs. Cholo WHIRLS
     like a Ninja. He SLUGS one guard, kicks another in the groin,
     the third in the face, and escapes through a fire door.

     INT/EXT. JAIL - AFTERNOON


43                                                            43

     RILEY RIPS off part of his shirt-sleeve and starts to bandage
     the wound on SLACK'S arm. They are in a jail cell that has
     brick walls and a small barred window facing a dark alley.
     CHARLIE, stripped of all his guns, stares outside longingly.




                        RILEY

              (To Slack) Why you? In that arena.
              Why did the little fat man throw
              you in with those things?




                        SLACK

              It wasn't the little man. It was the
              big man. The man upstairs. He's got
              his fingers in everything down here.
              If you can drink it, shoot it up,
              fuck it, or gamble on it, it belongs
              to him. He's just seein' that we get
              a few cheap kicks so we don't go
              thinkin' too hard about why he's
              eating steak and the rest of us are
              lucky to get the bones.




                        RILEY

              Same question. Why you?




                         SLACK

              They found out I was working with
              Mulligan and his people. Tired of
              eatin' off Cbones.




                         HARLIE

              What can you do? Every place is the                    
              same.




                        RILEY

              Places with people. I'm gonna find
              me a place where there ain't no
              people. North. Canada.




                        SLACK

              Wherever you're going, take me                         
               ith you.




                         CHARLIE

              He won't. Riley likes to be alone.
              He might take me. Cuzz havin' me
              around is pretty much the same as
              bein' alone. (Glancing at Riley)
                can make myself useful. And I
               an shoot.

                   SLACK

         I can shoot. And I can be pretty
         fucking useful. I had training. I
         was gonna join the Army. Up the
         Green. Till somebody figured I'd be
         a better hooker than a soldier.




                   RILEY

         I don't need to hear your story.
         Everybody's got a story, and I'm
         tired of hearin' them all!




                   SLACK

         What's your story, Riley?



They look at each other, clearly attracted.

                   R                                            


                    ILEY

         I said everybody has a story. That
         was wrong. I don't have one. Daddy
         was a preacher. Mama kept the
         house. School. Engineering. Nothing
         bad ever happened to me...(turning
         away)...till everything changed.




                    LACK

         Everything changed for all of us.
         Whether we had a story or not.




                                                                

A SOUND outside the window. Charlie glances through the bars.




                     CHARLIE

         Hey...



Riley and Slack look out the window. FOUR SECURITY MEN are      
chasing MULLIGAN into the alley outside. They drive him like    
an animal against a wall, club him, and drag him away.




                     RILEY

         Mulligan.



RILEY instinctively reaches through the window's bars, but
there's nothing he can do. It's a helpless feeling.




                    HARLIE

         What are they gonna do? Kill him?                      

                   SLACK                                        

         Not right away. First, they'll try                     
         to get what they can out of him.                       
         About people like me.                                  
Riley puts his hand on her back.

     CRANE DOWN FROM A FADED SIGN, TONY'S AUTOMANIA, high above
     what was once a car dealership, but is now a fenced-in DEPOT
     full of VEHICLES. A huge WHITE FACE with black cartoon eyes     

                                                                     

     POPS into view, attached to a TEN-FOOT-TALL BODY emblazoned
     TONY BALONEY. It's one of those vinyl ADVERTISING DUMMIES
     that does the hula as air pumps through it. Tony's arms wave
     wildly, like a giant zombie, comic yet oddly unnerving as...



     BLAM! BLAM! Bullets hit it in the face and neck. GUS, a young
     soldier, and his partner BARRETT, are shooting outside the
     SALES OFFICE of the car-lot-turned-depot. A sign is printed
     on the window. "BEST DEALS IN TOWN AND THAT'S NO BALONEY!"

                         ARRETT

     SCREECH! CHOLO pulls a CARGO CARRIER to a stop along the        
     platform of the tunnel. FOXY, PRETTY BOY, MOUSE, ANCHOR, and    
     SCAR, the youngest of the team, leap off the flatbed.

     The steel doors under the "SUBWAY" sign open and CHOLO strides 
     out with his TEAM. A DEPOT GUARD steps forward as the doors    
     close and lock automatically behind them.                      

                        DEPOT GUARD

              You just got back in this morning.                      

                        CHOLO

              Nobody gets a day off these days.

              minute this is from yesterday.

              given you the wrong one. Here...



     Cholo reaches down, but not into his pocket. For his gun.        
     Just before he draws it...SHOTS ring out.                        

                        CHOLO (CONT'D)

              What's that?

              Double or nothing?




                        BARRETT

              Sure.



     GUS aims his rifle at the jerking head of TONY BALONEY. As he    
     is about to fire, there's a SOUND at his back.




                        GUS

              Quit scratching around back there.
              You're tryin' ta fuck up my aim.




                        BARRETT

              I'm just standin' here. I'm not
              doin' nothing.



     The SOUND comes again. From the woods that adjoin the lot.
     Barrett grabs the handles of a KLIEG LIGHT mounted on a pivot    
     and swings it so that it ILLUMINATES the tree-line.

     T                                                                

      here's nothing there. Nothing but BRANCHES being slapped by     
     erratic gusts of wind.



     Barrett pivots the Klieg light back to its original position,
     jumping out of his skin when the bright white beam reveals...    
     A DEAD THING within arm's length.

     Barrett FIRES! The dead thing DROPS OUT OF FRAME, REPLACED BY    
     ANOTHER. BLAM! Barrett SHOOTS again. This creature collapses.    
     It is also replaced by another, which is also shot, as...        
     BLAM! The top of Barrett's head is taken off by a rifle shot.    
     The rifle was fired by BIG DADDY. The barrel is still smoking.   
     In the darkness behind him stands NUMBER NINE. Behind Number     
     Nine are the SHUFFLING SHADOWS of many more dead things.         

     GUS SCREAMS.

              Let's grab the truck.



      HOLO and his team sprint across the lot to DEAD RECKONING.

              Should we send up some `sky flowers'?




                        CHOLO

              No. Those things want to get in

     THE WALKING DEAD march through MACHINE GUN FIRE behind their     
     "leader". BIG DADDY. He is the first to reach the fence          
     surrounding the lot. Pushing against the wire, he is soon        
     joined by NUMBER NINE. Then OTHERS. The FENCE COLLAPSES. The
     Dead Things SWARM into the depot.



     VROOOM! DEAD RECKONING pulls out. Rumbling over the section      
     of fencing the zombies pushed down, it drives into the night.    




              K

     SOLDIERS abandon their stations and scatter, shooting wildly.    
     NUMBER NINE knocks one of them cold with its baseball bat.       
     The soldier falls, losing his M-16. BIG DADDY grabs the bat      
     and throws it aside. Picking up the soldier's M-16, he           
     presses the weapon into Number Nine's hands, even arranging      
     Number Nine's fingers on the trigger.                            
     RATATATAT. With the gun aimed at the ground, Number Nine         
     fires a BURST that sends her into a spastic dance. The           
     soldier sits back up. Draws a pistol. Big Daddy grabs the        
     barrel of the still-firing M-16 and guides it along the          
     pavement to...                                                   
     ...the soldier's legs. Bullets march up his groin, belly,
     chest, and, finally, head. He drops.                             
     ANOTHER SOLDIER attacks. This time, Number Nine aims her

                                                                      

     weapon purposefully and scores a direct hit.



     OTHER DEAD THINGS SMACK at the steel doors that lead down to     

                                                                      

     the subway. They can't get through. Losing interest, they
     drift slowly away, until their attention is refocused by...      




                                                                      

     ...a GRUNT from Big Daddy, who is gazing toward the GLOW of
     the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE across the river, closer now       
     than before. The city. That's where he wants to be. That's

     KAUFMAN RIPS a TURKEY LEG off a cooked bird on a platter in
     front of him and eats. Across the table sits one of his board
     members, HARRISON SUTHERLAND. KNIPP enters.




                        KNIPP

              Phone call, sir.




                        KAUFMAN

              Thank you, Knipp. I'll take it.



     Knipp brings a radio-phone to the table. Kaufman picks up the
     receiver and lifts it to his ear.




                         KAUFMAN

              Yes?

     Kaufman tenses, just enough for Sutherland to notice.

              Put the money on a boat and send it
              across the river to the South Side.

              Trouble?

              In a world where the dead are
              returning to life, the word
              `trouble' loses much of its
              meaning. (Beat) He wants money.

              you a drink?

         and you didn't give it to him, did                   
         you? That's why he's out there

                        SOLDIER

              This piece fires fourteen rounds
              a second.



     Charlie unstraps his own REMINGTON. A la Sergeant York, he
     licks his thumb. Wets the sight. And BLASTS a COCKROACH
     climbing on a wall twenty feet away.

                   SOLDIER

         Can you handle it?




                   SLACK

         Better'n you. The safety's off.



 he Soldier checks the gun. The safety is off. He clicks
it on and embarrassedly hands the weapon to Slack.




                   RILEY

         (To Slack and Charlie) You guys
         don't have to come out with me if
         you don't want to.



Slack ties her hair back with a bandana. Checks her gun clip.




                   SLACK                                         

         I'd feel like a dick if I didn't.




                    HARLIE

         Me too. Just look at me you can
         tell I'd feel like a dick.

     A LONG DOCK juts into the RIVER. DEAD RECKONING stops beside

     The steel doors to the subway tunnel open. RILEY and his TEAM   
     step out. The depot has been DEVASTATED. FIRES BURNING.         
     FENCES DOWN. Only TONY BALONEY moves, still waving spookily.

                        C

              Geez. Cholo made a mess.




                        RILEY

              Cholo didn't do all this.



     Clouds of thick black SMOKE from the fires BILLOW across the
     depot, restricting visibility. Ever-shifting OPENINGS in the
     clouds reveal glimpses of torn BODY PARTS.

                   RILEY (CONT'D)

         Stenches have been at this place.



He leads the way into the depot, his M-16 at the ready.        
Behind him, all eyes peer nervously into the smoke. Everyone   
speaks in HUSHED tones.                                        

                   MANOLETE

         When the truck pulled out, it must
         have knocked the fence down. That's
         how they got in.




                   RILEY

         That fencing was pushed in from
         outside.




                   TEAHOUSE

         You know how many stenches it
         would take to do that?




                   RILEY

         There's a thousand of them out
         there for every one of us.




                   CHARLIE

         Good thing we're smarter.




                   SLACK

         Look who's talkin'.




                   RILEY

         They're getting smart. I saw it in

                                                               

         Uniontown, last time out. They're
         learning how to work together.                        
Thoughts darken. So does the SMOKE, which billows thicker,
virtually blinding the team. SOUNDS come. The MOANING of the   
WIND. The POPPING of burnt metal and wood.                     

                   TEAHOUSE

         What do they want?                                    
Slack looks back as she walks. The zombies have taken down     
another section of the depot fence, beyond which lies a        
suburb. Beyond which is the river. Beyond which is the glow    
of the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE.                              

                   SLACK

Teahouse pulls a Motorola from his belt. Just as he tosses
it to Riley, they hear...GROWLING!



 he team draws their weapons, standing in a loose circle,
their backs to each other, guns searching for a target.
Darting eyes peer into the void. MORE NOISES emanate from       
somewhere. Everywhere. Slowly...



...Charlie unstraps his Remington. Licks his thumb. Wets the
sight of the rifle.




                    LACK

         (Whispering back) Catches the                          
         light. Right now it's moonlight.
         Lets me see where I'm aimin'.



BLAM! Charlie FIRES! A single shot into the black smoke.

                   CHARLIE

A

  DEAD MAN steps out of the smoke! Before anyone can react, it
grabs Slack's shoulder from behind! She whirls around. Pulls
away. Is about to shoot when she sees AN ENTRY WOUND on the    
left side of the Thing's forehead.




                   CHARLIE (CONT'D)

There are SHUFFLING SOUNDS in the smoke. Manolete backs away.

Riley pulls out a flashlight and shines it under the dash.

they can't make out anything. Including each other.

of a bridal gown. The fabric seems to glow in the smoke.       
The bride shuffles toward CHARLIE. We see it coming. No one    
else does. Just as it opens its mouth to bite...

Charlie fired, CLIPPING OFF THE TOP OF HIS EAR before

Riley leads the team into the T-Bird. Manolete starts to get    
out from under the dash. As TEAHOUSE settles into a seat by     
the door...

         God! Oh, GOD, WHAT'S THIS?!



Teahouse HURLS the bloody thing onto the asphalt. Shockingly,
the ARM SPRINGS BACK, THUMPING against Teahouse's face! A
twist of torn muscle, no thicker than clothesline, is keeping
the limb loosely attached to...

         I had a brother. Real brother, by
         birth. Bit. Hung on for six days.
         Before he turned. I was the one had
         to shoot him.




                   SLACK

         And you said nothin' bad ever
         happened to you.




                   RILEY

         That happened to my brother.




                   SLACK

         (Into his eyes) But you kept going.




                    ILEY

     Slack turns to Teahouse.

     KAUFMAN paces with a cigar, passing SUTHERLAND, STYLES,
     and CLIFF.




                          AUFMAN

              I recognize that some of you are
              concerned. We've been threatened by
              a disgruntled employee. I've sent
              people out to take care of the
              problem. However, should something
              go wrong, I want to assure you that
              measures have been taken. I've
              established outposts. With food and
              supplies to support us on our way.

                        C


                         LIFF

              On our way? To where?




                        KAUFMAN

              Alternate sites have been chosen.
              Air transport has been arranged.
              For us and our families. As well as
              necessary support personnel.




                        CLIFF

              What about all the others?



     Kaufman looks at Cliff, as if expecting him to understand.




                         AUFMAN

              All the others can be replaced.
               y others.




                         LIFF

              But...




                        KAUFMAN

              Cliff, let me talk to you for a
              moment.



     Kaufman leads Cliff into...




                                                      51.










...an alcove on the far side of the room, shutting two pocket
doors made of sandblasted glass. Sutherland and the others      
can't hear, but can see, Kaufman and Cliff in SILHOUETTE.       
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOORS: Kaufman leans close to Cliff,   
smiling, his eyes blinking a bit too rapidly.                   

                   KAUFMAN (CONT'D)

         You interrupted me. I was just                         
         talking about how people can be
         replaced. You don't want to be
         replaced, do you?




                   CLIFF


         (

          Nervous) No.




                    KAUFMAN

         No, and I don't want to replace
         you. You have promise. A day may
         come when you earn yourself some
         responsibilities. Right now, the
         responsibilities are mine. All                         
         the responsibilities. It was my                        

                                                                

         ingenuity that took an old world
         and made it into something new. I                      
         put up fences to make it safe. I                       
         hired soldiers and paid for their
         training. I keep the people on the
         streets away from us by giving them
         their games and vices. It costs me
         money! But I spend it because the
         responsibility is mine! Now do you                     

                                                                

         understand "responsibility"?




                   CLIFF

         Yes, but...




                    KAUFMAN

         No buts.




                    CLIFF

         But...



Kaufman looks disappointed. Taking Cliff by the arm, smiling
again, he leads him over to an outer door and opens it. An
armed SECURITY GUARD stands in the corridor outside.




                   KAUFMAN

         Take him out with the rest of the
         garbage. I won't be needing this
         man anymore.

     At the conference table, Sutherland sees the light coming in
     from the outer corridor, better defining the silhouettes as
     the Security Guard drags Cliff away.

      n an overgrown suburban street, a LAWN TRACTOR, driven by a
     GARDENER in work clothes, drives back and forth, back and
     forth, over a swath of dead grass. The gardener is DEAD too.

     CHOLO watches the GARDENER through the windshield.




                        CHOLO

              If I don't have this truck, I'm no
              different to Kaufman than that poor
              Mexican bastard out there.




     CLOSE ON: CHOLO'S WATCH. 11:20.





                         OXY


                                                                      

              He's never gonna pay.




                        CHOLO

              He knows it's his ass if he doesn't.



     Cholo slides open a small window, grabs his crossbow, and        
     SHOOTS the Gardener in the head.

     ANGLE ON: A SOLID WALL OF WOOD. BIG DADDY, NUMBER NINE, and
     OTHERS OF THE DEAD push against it. The wood holds.



     Big Daddy turns, surveying his troops. Focusing on the
     BUTCHER. On the meat cleaver it has in its hand.                 
     Big Daddy pounds on the wood, demonstrating. Points at the       
     meat cleaver. Pounds again. The Butcher gets it. Approaches      
     the wall.                                                        
      HACK! The meat cleaver chops into wood, splintering it.         
     REVERSE ANGLE: from the other side of the wall as the wood
     splinters to reveal BIG DADDY'S EYES staring through at...       
     ...the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE, looming closer than it was     
     before, though it's still across the river.

     CLOSE ON: a small, electronic unit, the size and appearance    
     of a "Game Boy". AN LED SCREEN shows a BLINKING RED DOT        
     moving along a MAP.                                            

                        RILEY (O.S.)                                

              Turn left up here.                                    
     SLACK, driving the T-BIRD now, makes the turn. The car blows   
     through a deserted town, moving fast. Riley notices that       
     Slack is effected by the desolation she sees.                  

                         ILEY

              How long since you been out here?




                        SLACK

              Never been out. Lived in the city
              since...it was a regular city.




                            ILEY

              Pull over.




                        SLACK

              (Surprised) Huh?




                        RILEY

              You said you were going to make
              yourself useful. Right now what I
              could use is for you to pull over.



      he does. The T-Bird stops along a road bordered by a MARSH    
     thick with tall CAT TAILS. Unexpectedly, Riley stands and
     points his automatic at PILLSBURY and MANOLETE.




                        RILEY

              I made a deal with your boss. Find
              Cholo. I'm gonna do it. Keep him from                 
              blowing up the Green. I'm gonna do
              it, I don't want people to get hurt.
              Bring back Dead Reckoning... Sorry.
              That's where I stop. I didn't ask him                 
              for much, just guns, ammo, and a car.
              I've got the guns. I've got the ammo.
              And if I find Dead Reckoning I'm
              gonna have the best fucking car                       
              that's ever been built, and I'm
              taking it to Canada. If any of you
              don't like that idea...



     Riley reaches down and opens the passenger door. Manolete
     looks out and sees the CAT TAILS MOVING. THREE WALKERS are
     slogging through the marsh.

                   PILLSBURY


         G

          ood choice. I like see Canada.



Pillsbury reaches out and slams the car door closed again.




                    ILEY

         Charlie, keep these two covered.



Charlie pulls his .45.                                          
Riley turns around his seat, glancing down again at the "Game
Boy" in his palm. The RED DOT has moved on to ANOTHER MAP.      

                   RILEY (CONT'D)                               


                                                                

         Take a right onto Route Six.



Slack pulls out.                                                

                   SLACK

         This is what you were thinking
         about all along. You got me out
         here figuring I'm a boy scout, and
         now you're telling me we're just                       

                                                                

         stealing a fucking car?




                    ILEY

         You have a problem with that?




                   SLACK


                                                                

         No. I like the way you think.




                    HARLIE

         I like the way he thinks, too.
         Just look at me you can tell I
         like the way he thinks.




                   RILEY

         Take another right.                                    

                   SLACK                                        

         How do you know which way you're                       
         going?                                                 
Riley holds up the "Game Boy". It BEEPS SOFTLY as the RED DOT   
shifts onto another MAP.                                        

                   RILEY                                        

         I built a homing device into Dead

     MOUSE looks at a GRIMY WINDOW as the SHADOW of a WALKER stops   
     just beyond the glass. Mouse FIRES a BURST shattering the       
     window and dropping the Walker.                                 
     Silence. Mouse takes a tentative step toward the window. A
     SCRATCHING SOUND. SOMETHING climbs up onto the sill from        
     outside. Mouse raises his gun, but hesitates when he sees...    
     ...it's a child. A GIRL SCOUT. It died at age nine, still       
     wearing its uniform. Now, it's voracious. It grabs Mouse's      
     gun-hand. The weapon FIRES harmlessly into the floor. Mouse     
     is about to be chomped when...                                  
     ...a STALAGMITE OF GLASS in the top of the shattered window     
     drops, PIERCING the Girl Scout's head.                          
     Mouse runs SCREAMING to the door, where he is grabbed by        
     another DEAD THING. And another. As he is TORN APART, he sees

     WHAM! The door SLAMS behind KAUFMAN as he enters the foyer.     
     KNIPP emerges from the rear.

              No. Pack us up. We might have

     PRETTY BOY eases the vehicle up the road to the complex of      
     buildings: ROSS PARK, a sprawling munitions depot.              
     The searchlight continues to sweep across the night, but NO
     ONE is manning it. It's mounted to an automatic rotator on      
     the roof of the main building.                                  

                        FOXY

              Looks like no one's here.                              
     The gates stand wide open. There's no sign of life.



     CHOLO punches a button. The SIDE HATCH HISSES OPEN.

              Somebody go out and help.



     SCAR grabs his weapons.                                         

                          SCAR

     ONE OF THE DEAD TOPPLES face first into the water, dropping
     out of sight. ANOTHER FALLS. BIG DADDY looks at the spot        
     where his brothers fell in. He looks for a long time, cocking   
     his head like a puppy trying to understand a high wind.         
     The first Dead Thing slowly rises out of the water. Then the    
     Second. They stand, waist deep, in the shallows.                
     Big Daddy gazes down at the water, a concept dawning. Then,     
     with grim purpose, he steps deliberately off the low wall.      
     Hitting the river, he manages to stay on his feet. Standing,    
     waist deep, with the others, he scoops up water with his one    
     good hand. Sniffs it. Tastes it.                                
     He looks up. Sees the CITY LIGHTS REFLECTED ON THE RIVER. He    
     tries to express his thoughts. All that comes from his mouth    
     is a series of inarticulate moans. He's incapable of            
     transmitting his idea. So he does what he's been doing since    
     Uniontown. He leads. He walks toward the city. Out of the       
     shallows. Into deep water. Over his head.

     sunken MOTOR BOAT, HUNDREDS of BEER BOTTLES...AND THOUSANDS

     A knock on a door is answered by A MAN who looks a bit too

     The unmanned SEARCHLIGHT scans the yard, casting intermittent

                        SCAR

              This place is important. The men                       
              here wouldn't just walk out.

              Maybe they had no choice.                              
     FOXY and SCAR move toward a large STORAGE BUILDING where a      
     door swings in the night breeze, SLAPPING alarmingly against    
     the wall. Beyond the opening is a BLACK MAW, like a velvet      
     curtain, past which nothing can be seen.

     Scar nervously pulls out a flashlight. As he CLICKS on the       
     BEAM, he loses his grip. The flashlight drops to the ground.     
     Scar reaches for it. His fingers tip it and it spins. The        
     beam WASHES across his shoes. Then Foxy's shoes. Then finds...   
     ...ONE OTHER SHOE. Someone else's. Gasping, Scar grabs the       
     flashlight, shining the beam up onto what should be a leg,       
     but there's nothing left above its bloody shin.                  
     PLIP! PLOP! PLIP! Beads of BLOOD hit the floor, dropping
     from the DARK FIGURE of a SOLDIER who is approaching. Scar       
     aims the flashlight at the figure's face, recognizing...         

                        SCAR

     Brubaker keeps coming. He has BULLET HOLES in his chest, but
     they're not what's dripping blood. It's another half-eaten       
     FOOT that he's carrying. BRUBAKER IS DEAD. Foxy shoots him.      
     Foxy and Scar move into a hangar-like space. Pitch black.        
     Except for the mote-filled BEAM from Scar's flashlight, which

     THE T-BIRD rumbles along a road lined with large HOMES, once     
     prized for their panoramic views. RILEY'S "Game Boy" BEEPS.

              Cholo's moving out. Looks like he's                     
              heading right for us.

     Riley looks outside. Beyond the homes he can see THE CITY.

               hit. Off this hillside...they can
              shell the Green. Pull in! There!



     SLACK pulls into a driveway, stopping the T-Bird in the         
     shadow of one of the houses.

     ONE HEAD RISES out of the river. It's BIG DADDY, rivulets of    

                                                                     

     water running down the creases of his face. Another head
     rises. And another. NUMBER NINE and the BUTCHER ZOMBIE.         
     More and more heads break the surface. The water FILLS with
     BODIES emerging from the deep. HUNDREDS OF THEM. The CITY       
     LIGHTS REFLECT off their wet clothes as the ARMY OF THE DEAD

     RILEY and HIS TEAM wait in the shadows of the driveway they     
     pulled into. They HEAR the distant GROWL of DEAD RECKONING.     

                                                                     

     Looking over a hedge-row, Riley can see HIGH BEAMS advancing.

              get in, I'll try to leave one open.                     
     Riley takes off. Charlie looks torn. He wants to go with
     Riley, but he has to keep PILLSBURY and Manolete covered.

     The door to the roof opens and the GREASY MAN from "downtown"
     steps out of a fire stair with ANOTHER GREASY MAN. SUTHERLAND    
     remains inside the door.

              Kaufman was gonna leave people
              behind. So we're leaving him.

     RILEY walks down the road. The GROWLING of the diesels is        
     getting louder, the GLOW from the high-beams brighter. Riley     
     is startled by a NOISE behind him. He whirls around and sees

     Riley is about to object, when DEAD RECKONING comes rumbling     
     around a corner a hundred yards down the street. Riley checks    
     his watch again. 11:52.

      out after it.

      MANOLETE has the machine gun aimed at DEAD RECKONING'S open     
      hatch. Where CHOLO is standing.                                 
      Out of the corner of his eye, RILEY sees Manolete's machine
      gun barrel flash in the moonlight. MANOLETE FIRES! RATATAT!     
      RILEY PUSHES CHOLO OUT OF THE WAY JUST IN TIME! He drops from   
      the hatch onto the pavement, wounded in the shoulder.           
      The Walker starts to rip Manolete apart. Slack SHOOTS HIM in    
      the head. Then she and PILLSBURY open fire on the Walker,       
      destroying it.

      The windows are sealed so the NOISE Kaufman hears is MUFFLED,   
      but it is definitely the SOUND OF DISORDER. He goes to a        
      window. Looks down and sees...                                  
      ...flashes of LIGHT from gunfire. SMOKE rising from an

               bricked up.                                             




                                                                       

      PRETTY BOY hits a button. A MAP appears on a MONITOR, showing
      the "GOLDEN TRIANGLE" bordered by the rivers and the             
      barricaded bridges spanning them.                                

                         SLACK                                         

               We could blast our way through.

               Don't want to. If the stenches got                      

                                                                       

               in, there's a war going on in the
               city. We take any of those bridges                      
               we'll end up right in the middle

      Riley runs his finger along the monitor, outlining the           
      natural and man-made barriers that protect the triangle.

      His finger continues down the monitor to "THE THROAT" at the
      base of the triangle, where the long FENCE runs between the      
      two rivers.

      CLOSE ON: KAUFMAN staring out his PENTHOUSE WINDOW, aghast.

      In the pristine plaza that surrounds the building, WALKERS      
      swarm. CITIZENS run, screaming, including SOLDIERS, driven
      from their posts, who SHOOT at the Dead Things.



      CLOSE ON BIG DADDY. Who looks back and forth, as if torn, at
      the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE, at the violence in the streets,
      back at the building, back at the streets. A SOLDIER fires at 
      him! Misses. Big Daddy raises his rifle and blows him away.

      EXT. HILLSIDE HOME DRIVEWAY - NIGHT




      CHOLO and FOXY run up the road to THE T-BIRD. Seeing a WALKER   
      lurking ahead, they duck into the dark cover of the trees.




                            HOLO

               I got it.



      WFFFFT! Cholo picks off the Walker with his crossbow.           

                          HOLO (CONT'D)

               Come on, let's go.



      He slaps a hand on Foxy's back.



       XCEPT IT'S NOT FOXY! It's ANOTHER WALKER that has moved
      between the two men. It grabs the hand that slapped him and
      BITES it.




                          HOLO


               AHHH...FUCK!




      Foxy, a few yards away, whirls, aiming his gun at the Walker.
      Cholo is faster. With no time to reload, in agony, he pulls     
      a FISTFUL OF ARROWS from his quiver and DRIVES THEM THROUGH     
      THE WALKER'S FACE AND SKULL. The Walker falls. So does an       
      ominous silence.




                          HOLO (CONT'D)

               I can't fucking believe it. (A sad
               chuckle) Nothin' works out. It's                       
               like...the world is spinning around

      Foxy aims his rifle Fat Cholo's forehead. Their eyes connect.




                          OXY

               Your choice.



      For a moment, Cholo looks despondent. Then he forces a smile.




                         CHOLO

               No, don't shoot. (A dark chuckle)
                 always wanted to see how the
               other half lives.



      Foxy lowers his gun.

       EAD RECKONING drives upriver. THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: THE

      A CONTROL BOOTH is built into the superstructure of the         
      bridge, about fifteen feet off the ground, on DEAD

      ...SOMETHING SKITTERS across the road, chasing him. Not a        
      zombie. Much smaller. A RIVER RAT.                               
      Charlie draws his REMINGTON. Wets the sight with his thumb.      

      BLAM!

      SKREEEEEEEE! ZOMBIE RATS crawl up onto the roadbed. DOZENS.     
      Riley takes off away from them. Slack and Charlie hurry         
      closer, firing, trying to pick the critters off.                
      The rats reach Riley! Nip at his heels. He leaps. Swings onto
      a girder. Climbs to the control booth. The rats don't follow.   
      Slack heaves a sigh of relief just before...

      She vaults over a railing, dropping several feet to...

      fires at them from above. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! FUR AND BLOOD       

                                                                      

      FLY. But there are too many. He can't shoot them all.

      RILEY reaches the control booth. Draws his .45, expecting       
      danger within. He steps through the opening...                  
      ...but nothing's there. Just a SPIDER WEB that sweeps over

      generator. He flips it. The motor roars to life.



      He turns toward a giant lever that operates the roadbed. It

      RED LIGHTS on the caution gates BLINK, tinting the night.       
      The silence is shattered by a LOUD SIREN that ECHOES across     
      the river. The bridge's roadbed begins to CREAK down slowly.

      THREE DINGHIES lie, upside down, next to the water's edge.      
      SLACK shoves one into the river, climbing onto its upturned     
      bottom. She pushes off. The boat doesn't budge. A tether        
      holds it within inches of the shore.                            
      Slack pulls out a jackknife and goes to cut the rope, but...



      ...rats SNAP at her hands. Slack recoils, but keeps cutting.    
      Finally, the rope frays, enough for the boat to pull free.

      Slack crouches on top of the upturned hull. No way to steer.    
      No paddles. The current carrying her away.                      

                           CHARLIE

               Slack!

      Hearing the scream, RILEY looks out the control booth window    
      and sees...                                                     
      ...SLACK being taken downstream.

      RILEY bursts out of the booth, only to be confronted by...      

                                                                      

      ...the BRIDGEKEEPER. Drooling. Dead. It grabs Riley, pushing
      his head back toward the enormous GEARWORKS of the bridge.      




                                                                      

      Riley struggles. Bests the creature. Spins him around toward
      the gearworks and...                                            




                                                                      

      ...SSSNIPPPP! THE BRIDGEKEEPER'S HEAD is scissored off! It
      drops with a PLUNK into the river below.

      EXT. RIVER - NIGHT




      SLACK, adrift on the boat, lies prone at the bow and begins     

                                                                      

      to paddle with her hands. One of which hits something long
      and slimy. It looks like a snake!                               
      But it's not. It's only a moss-covered rope. Slack grabs on.
      Pulls hand over hand. It seems to take forever for the rope     
      to become taut.                                                 

      A FACE BOBS OUT OF THE WATER!




      Slack SCREAMS.                                                  
      It's the BRIDGEKEEPER'S HEAD, its eyes blinking as it floats    
      off on the current.                                             
       he rope is attached to a stanchion on the opposite shore.      
      Slack's muscles strain as she pulls on it until...              
      ...her boat reaches the stanchion and she jumps off, finding    
      herself at the same boat ramp the army of the dead used. The    
      river has carried her into the very part of the city Riley      
      and the team were trying to avoid. SCREAMS rise nearby. She's   
      in the war zone.

      THE BRIDGE IS LOWERING SLOWLY. Too slowly. RILEY scrambles       
      up the incline of the roadbed and calls back to CHARLIE.

      Charlie pops back into DEAD RECKONING.                           
      Riley climbs to the top of the descending roadbed and...         
      ...LEAPS across the narrowing gulf to the other side.            
      He lands. Falls. Rolls. Gets to his feet and runs toward
      Slack and the city.

      EXT. "GOLDEN TRIANGLE" - NIGHT




      SLACK runs past hysterical PEOPLE toward the FIDDLER'S GREEN     

                                                                       

      HIGH-RISE. BRIAN, Mulligan's young son, rushes by her in a
      panic. Slack grabs him.

                         BRIAN

               We can't get out! There's no way out!




                         SLACK

               There will be. Come with me.




                         BRIAN

               Daddy! Daddy's still locked up.                         
      Slack runs off with Brian, past a MANHOLE surrounded by          
      canvas fences, "CAUTION" signs, and flaming OIL POTS. As
      MAINTENANCE WORKERS scramble out of the manhole...               
      ...DEAD THINGS close in. The Workers, unarmed, pick up the
      ball-shaped pots and BOWL them at the Walkers. As the "balls"
      roll, their FIRES SWIRL, making them look like flaming comets.

      S

       ome of the   pots CRACK OPEN, creating POOLS OF FIRE on the
      street. One   of the "balls" remains whole until it smacks
      against the   feet of a Walker. Then it opens. And the Walker
      is engulfed   in flames.



      Big Daddy looks at the Walker with sadness. He lifts his
      rifle again and shoots the flaming creature in the head.         




      B

      Big Daddy walks to the manhole. TOOLS are strewn around it,     
      pickaxes, sledges, chainsaws, and a pneumatic hammer which is
      lying on the street...RATTATATTAT...still running.



      Big Daddy looks at the FIDDLER'S GREEN SKYSCRAPER. His goal.    
      Finally in reach.                                               
      He looks down at the pneumatic hammer, and picks it up by the
      handle. With the heavy tool vibrating in its hand, Big Daddy
      walks toward the building.



      He doesn't get very far before the hammer's electrical cord
      is pulled out of the extension it's plugged into. The hammer
      stops running. Big Daddy looks at it. Puzzles over its
      stillness for a moment. Then...



      ...he looks at the building. At its doors, abandoned by         
      guards. Doors that are made of glass.



      The barrel of an M-16 is planted against Big Daddy's temple     
      by a MILITIAMAN.



       UDDA-BUDDA-BUDDA! The Militiaman FLIES BACK. It wasn't he

                                                                      

      who fired. It was NUMBER NINE, standing nearby with her M-16.
      The Militiaman lies on the ground, his dead eyes staring at
      Number NINE in utter surprise.



      Seeing what has happened, ANOTHER SOLDIER grabs a grenade,      
      pulls the pin, and is about to toss it at Big Daddy when...



      ...his HAND IS CUT OFF at the wrist by a meat clever held by
      THE BUTCHER. The Soldier's hand, still clutching the grenade,   

                                                                      

      PLOPS into the street. The Soldier looks down in horror, then
      collapses on top of his hand. A MUFFLED EXPLOSION makes jelly
      of his mid-section.



      Big Daddy continues to walk toward the building, carrying the
      pneumatic hammer, as OTHER DEAD THINGS collect sledges,
      pickaxes, lengths of pipe, and follow their leader.

      KAUFMAN and KNIPP, carrying the Prada duffles, rush out of an

      Chopin LILTS, caged birds SING. RESIDENTS SCREAM, running

         They can't get in. Downstairs.                         
         The car.                                               
The Dead Things POUND at the doors. One Guard runs away. The
Other Three follow.




                   KAUFMAN (CONT'D)

          et back here! GET BACK HERE!



Kaufman FIRES THREE ROUNDS at the men! He's not a marksman,
but ONE of the GUARDS is WINGED. Whirls around and levels his   
M-16 at Kaufman.




                   SECURITY GUARD


         YOU STUPID OLD FUCK!




He's about to fire when Knipp steps in front of Kaufman.




                   KNIPP

         DON'T SHOOT! (Grabbing Kaufman's
         gun hand) Boss? Don't you shoot,
         neither. We're all on the same

                   S

         side. Least we're supposed to be.




                    ECURITY GUARD

         I'm on my own side now.



The Guard takes off after his comrades.




                   CHOLO (O.S.)

         Need some help, Mister K.?



Kaufman spins around to see CHOLO walking toward him across     
the atrium.




                   CHOLO (CONT'D)

           been bit, Mister K. I'm a dead
         man, so I don't care about nothin'
         no more. Still care about you,
         though. I wanna make sure you come
         to the same end as me.



 LANG! CLANG! CLANG! The Dead Things at the glass doors are
POUNDING now with shovels, pickaxes, and lengths of pipe.




                   CHOLO (CONT'D)

          hey're going to get you, Mister K.
           want them to get you.



Kaufman raises his gun and aims at Cholo, who aims back with    
his crossbow.

          ut it down, old man, unless you'd
         rather die right now.



BIG DADDY appears outside the doors. Uses his pneumatic
hammer to POUND at the safety glass.



 aufman can't take it anymore. He bolts for a stairway door.
Cholo shoots. An arrows hits Kaufman in the back of his left    
calf. Kaufman sprawls, dropping both his bag of money and his   
gun, which skitters Kaway. Knipp rushes over to help Kaufman.   

                    NIPP

         Just let us go, Mister DeMora. Let
         us get out of here.




                   CHOLO


                                                                

         (Calmly reloading) You can go,
         Knipp, but not him.




                                                                

Kaufman shakes Knipp off. His gun is ten feet away. He heads
for it. Dragging himself on hands and knees.



CRUNCH! The chisel on Big Daddy's pneumatic hammer is the
first tool to PENETRATE the doors. The glass doesn't shatter;
it COBWEBS into tiny crystals stuck together by a thin
plasticine coating. ALARM BELLS SOUND!



Puzzled by the sudden transformation of the glass into
something that looks different, Big Daddy drops the pneumatic
hammer and reaches out. The glass is different. It's soft.
Flexible. Big Daddy POKES HIS HAND right through.



Kaufman has almost reached his gun. Cholo shoots another        
arrow. This one hits Kaufman in the shoulder.                   

                    AUFMAN

         You fucking spic bastard!




                   CHOLO

         I think we should talk when you're
         a little less excited.



Kaufman has a will of iron. He keeps going, gritting his
teeth against the pain, reaching out for his gun, as...



CRUNCH! CRUNCH! CRUNCH! More tools PENETRATE the doors. More
HANDS POKE through.



 aufman looks at his worst nightmare...Dead Things ripping
their way through the cobwebbed doors, invading his temple.

      The commotion distracts Cholo just long enough for Kaufman to    
      lift his gun and FIRE nine rounds.                               
       ost of the shots miss. TWO hit Cholo, one in the belly, one
      in the heart. He is slammed against the wall, his glazing
      eyes staring up into the atrium, the place he so desired.
      It's the last thing he sees before he keels over, dead.          
      Knipp pulls Kaufman onto his feet. They look up to see...



      BIG DADDY leading his army into the atrium. Kaufman aims and
      FIRES. A BULLET HITS BIG DADDY in the upper chest, blowing       
      DEAD FLESH out of his back. The Dead Man feels no pain, but      
      it focuses on Kaufman and starts after him with purpose.



      Kaufman sees something in Big Daddy's eyes. Something that's
      not dead. Kaufman fires again. CLICK! He's out of ammo.

                         K


                          NIPP

               Boss. We gotta get outa here!



      Knipp pulls Kaufman to a stairway door. They rush inside. The
      moment they're out of sight, the Walkers forget about them,
      moving on into the atrium. All except Big Daddy. That rage is
      still in its face as he lumbers toward the stairway door.

      KEYS TURN in the locks of cell doors, which SLACK and BRIAN
      pull open. MULLIGAN and his REVOLUTIONARIES emerge. Mulligan     
      embraces his son and looks gratefully at Slack.                  

                         MULLIGAN

               (To his men) Let's go get our guns,                     
               boys.

       ILEY runs out of a line of trees. In the distance, he sees...



      ...the "THROAT", where much of the CITY'S POPULATION is
      trapped, herded by HUNDREDS OF WALKING DEAD against the layers
      of electrified fencing that were erected to protect them.
      There's no escape. People are being TORN apart and EATEN. The 
      fencing SPARKS as bodies touch it and are ELECTROCUTED.
      Terrible SCREAMS fill the air.

      Riley hears the distinctive ROAR of DEAD RECKONING'S engines,
      the CLATTER of its treads. He moves toward the sound as...



       ..a DEAD THING looms three feet away. Riley lifts his pistol
      and puts a shell through the thing's skull. Blood flies,
      taking on the sudden glow of a halo as it is BACKLIT by...



      ...the glare of DEAD RECKONING'S approaching headlights. The
      dead thing falls to the road, where...



      ...it is turned to apple butter by Dead Reckoning's enormous
      treads. Riley stands right in the vehicle's path.

      THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: RILEY looms larger and larger as the
      vehicle closes in. He doesn't move. PRETTY BOY tries to turn
      the wheel. Too late. RILEY DISAPPEARS!




                          HARLIE

               (Pure anguish) RILEY!



      Three seconds later, Riley's figure comes scrambling across     
      the windshield, climbing up toward...




      EXT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT


139                                                           139     

      ...the two fourteen-inch cannons on the vehicle's turrets.




                          ILEY

               We gotta blow the fences!




                         PRETTY BOY (O.S. LOUDSPEAKER)

               Johnson's are loaded!




                         RILEY

               Yeah, but they're capped!                              
      The barrels of the two fourteen-inchers are still capped.
      DEAD RECKONING keeps rolling. RILEY climbs out onto one of
      the cannon barrels.



      WHAM! A WALKER grabs him by the leg from the road. Riley
      blasts him with his .45. As OTHER WALKERS approach, he shoots
      them with one hand, Rusing the other to uncap the cannon.




                           ILEY

               Number One is clear! I'm going for
               Number Two!

               I don't norm'lly need two shots,
               Riley.



      Riley turns. The road is now filled with WALKERS.



       tanding ASTRIDE the vehicle, riding it as if it were a
      living beast, Riley picks some of them of with his .45.         

      INT. FIDDLER'S GREEN PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT


140                                                             140

      FOOTSTEPS ECHO as KNIPP, carrying one of the Prada duffles,
      helps the wounded KAUFMAN across an underground PARKING         
      GARAGE, a dark and spooky place, made more so by the SOUNDS
      of distant SCREAMING. Kaufman disdainfully SNAPS OFF the        
      shanks of the arrows in his leg and shoulder.                   
      The two men reach a stretch LINCOLN. Knipp BEEPS the doors
      open and they get inside, Knipp behind the wheel, Kaufman in
      the luxurious back compartment, where he pours himself a
      scotch from the built-in bar.



      Knipp starts the engine. The SOUND ECHOES big-time in the
      concrete tomb.




                          NIPP

               (Looking at the fuel gauge) We
                eed gas.



      Kaufman moans. Knipp steers the car slowly, carefully through
      the shadows, pulling in beside a GASOLINE PUMP near the base
      of a RAMP that leads up to the street. Knipp pushes a button
      that pops open the gas tank. He shuts the engine off and gets
      out, taking the keys, which have a Mag-Card attached to them.

      H

       e slides the Mag-Card into a slot, activating the pump. An
      LED scrolls "Thank you, Mr. Kaufman". Knipp pulls the nozzle.
      Freezes when he hears...



      ...FOOTSTEPS ECHOING. A DARK FIGURE is approaching through
      the shadows.



       nipp drops the nozzle. Ducks into the car. SLAMS the door.



      WHAM! A SINGLE HAND SMACKS against the driver-side window.



      A FACE leans in behind the hand. A face full of rage. BIG

      DADDY'S FACE.





                          AUFMAN

               Shoot it! Shoot the damn thing!

                   KNIPP

         You didn't gimme no gun, sir.



Big Daddy moves to one of the rear windows. He can't see        
inside. The window is tinted. He returns to the clear           
windshield, looks back, at an angle, and sees Kaufman in the
rear compartment. Big Daddy recognizes him. From upstairs.      
It's the man who shot him.                                      
The Dead Thing looks up. Sees the gasoline pump. His hand       
drops to the embroidery on its jump-suit..."Texaco". He moves   
deliberately toward the pump.




                   KAUFMAN

         Pull out! PULL OUT!

                   K


                    NIPP

         Sorry, sir. Keys are in the pump.



Big Daddy sees the nozzle on the cement. Picks it up, feeling
the familiarity of it. Pulls the trigger. Gasoline squirts.
The rage in his face turns to a kind of satisfaction.           




                                                                

Using the nozzle as he did the pneumatic hammer, Big Daddy
POUNDS on the windshield, three times, before the SAFETY
GLASS COBWEBS. He POKES the nozzle through the flexible         
fabric and pulls the trigger until it locks. Gasoline FLOODS
into the car.




                   KNIPP (CONT'D)

          ord!



TCHUNG! Big Daddy pulls the driver side door open. As Knipp
tries to run, he is GRABBED by Big Daddy.




                   KNIPP (CONT'D)


          ORD!




Big Daddy looks at the butler. Sniffs him. Then flings him
aside. Knipp is not his prey. With a glance at Kaufman,
cowering in the back seat, Big Daddy slams the car door and,
surprisingly, walks away. Up the ramp toward the street.



The nozzle remains stuck in the "fabric" of the windshield.
Gasoline continues to flow into the car. Kaufman crawls into
the front seat, wincing from his wounds, and KICKS the nozzle
out of the window with his good leg, getting soaked with gas
in the process. He opens the door. Limps to the pump. Grabs
the keys. As he starts back toward the car...



...WHAM! SOMETHING is standing right in front of him. It's
one of the WALKING DEAD. It's...

          aufman shakes his head in disbelief.




                               KAUFMAN

                     N-no, y-you're dead. (Realization
                     dawning) Oh my God. You're dead!



         THE CHOLO THING reaches for Kaufman, vengeance in its eyes.



           aufman breaks for the driver's door. He never makes it. The
         Cholo Thing grabs him and SLAMS him down across the hood.
         Leans over him. Opens a drooling mouth. Kaufman whimpers.

         B                                                               

          RRRUMBLE-UMBLE-UMBLE! The SOUND of a bowling ball.



         Kaufman looks up. It's not a bowling ball. It's an OIL POT,
         rolled down the ramp by Big Daddy. Kaufman SCREAMS. The fire
         ball approaches the gas-soaked Lincoln, the gas-soaked
         Kaufman, and...



         ...WHOOOMPH! Kaufman and The Cholo Thing are IMMOLATED. The
         FIREBALL removes everything from sight, except a few floating
         HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS, burning in mid-air.



          HROUGH LICKS OF FLAME we see...Big Daddy is almost smiling.

         CHARLIE works a joystick. The cannon turret GRINDS above.       
         He takes aim at an area of the fences that is rapidly

      Riley leaps down. The instant he's clear...



      KA-BLOOOOOOOOOOOOOM. The ELECTRIFIED FENCES are BLOWN APART.



       n the dissipating SMOKE, RILEY is the first one through the
      opening. Within seconds, CITIZENS start toward it, heading
      the other way. Riley finds himself running against the tide.
      Searching. Desperately searching. Behind the surging crowd...



      ...WALKERS appear, grabbing people. Dropping them to the
      ground. Eating them.



       iley FIRES in all directions. WALKERS DROP around him. He       
      saves a WOMAN with a BABY...a YOUNG COUPLE...a PRIEST. CLICK.    
      He runs out of ammo. WALKERS close in. The situation seems

      Other than the intermittent BOOM of the fireworks, SILENCE.

      The hand is BIG DADDY'S. He herds OTHERS along, too. A small
      group of TWO DOZEN, including NUMBER NINE and the BUTCHER.

      One of the GATTLING GUNS RATCHETS into position, taking aim

      PRETTY BOY sits at the controls, about to push the firing

      ...RILEY grabs her hand.




                         RILEY

      Riley picks up a pair of binoculars and looks through the          
      windshield at BIG DADDY.

      THROUGH THE BINOCULARS: BIG DADDY looks at DEAD RECKONING.
      For an instant, his eyes meet Riley's, as they did in              
      Uniontown.

Fade In:

A BRIGHT BLUE TIGER

Surrounded by a pack of dogs, ten of them snarling and gnashing their teeth.
The TIGER'S, eyes burn with fury as he wheels in a circle, lunging at one
dog clawing at another, keeping them all at bay.

Suddenly, the TIGER leaps over the dogs and transforms into a WHITE
BIRD, soaring majestically into the sky.


THE FACE OF A JAPANESE MAN


Sits up into frame, sweating, waking from a dream. He is KATSUMOTO.
We will come to know him later.

Fade to black. CREDITS OVER.

The faint SOUND of a BRASS BAND.

                                               WINCHESTER REP (V.O.)
                           the leader in all forms of armament used by the
                           United States Army. When you need a friend,
                           Winchester is by your side.         .

THE FACE OF AN AMERICAN MAN

As he smokes a cigar, barely listening. CAPTAIN _NATHAN ALGREN,
U.S. Army, ret, 36 years old and looking every da y of it. His eyes are lined
and saddened. He takes a swig from a flask. He is BACKSTAGE at:

INT. CONVENTION HALL              SAN FRANCISCO          DAY

Where a trade show is in progress. Scantily clad lovelies in red-white-and-
blue undies demonstrate the nation's most important new export: arms.
Every weapon imaginable is on display: rifles, pistols, even howitzers. Banners
declaim the virtues of Winchester and Springfield. Of Colt and Remington
and Smith & Wesson. Crowds mill around a stage. where:

                                             WINCHESTER REP
                           Ladies and Gentlemen ... the Winchester
                           Corporation is proud to bring to you... a true
                           American hero. A patriot who has proven his
                           gallantry time and again on the field of battle.

LITTLE TIN SOLDIERS are all lined up. A mass of grey. Rebel troops
surrounding a band of blue Union cavalry. A large, metal diorama.

                                             WINCHESTER REP
                           I hope you will join us in welcoming ...Late of
                           the U.S. Cavalry. The Savior of Sutter Hill ...
                           Captain Nathan Algren!

A last swig. Algren steels himself, then strides onstage as we reveal a banner:

                                                                                     2.
WINCHESTER PRESENTS: THE MIRACLE AT SUTTER'S HILL!

Garish limelight from a row of foot lights illuminates Algren.

                                            ALGREN
                            My thanks, Mr. McCabe... Ladies and Gents.

He looks down at the little metal soldiers and begins to tell the story of the
battle that made him famous. His narration is halting, unsteady:

                                                ALGREN
                            ... On that fateful day, Johnny Reb had us in a
                            spot, perched on the lonely top of Sutter's Hill,
                            nothing but grey as far as the eye could see:
                            Unhorsed and out of ammunition, I gazed down
                            into the, um, mael... mael...
                                      (squints to see better)
                            -maelstrom below us, and saw them moving up.

We realize he is reading from cue cards. The little Rebel soldiers begin sliding
up the metal hill.

                                                ALGREN
                            I knew it was fight or die. Into the teeth of the
                            enemy or we would all be buried... buried ...
                                      (loses his place, under his breath)
                            Shit...
                                      (finds it again)
                            ...on the same hill with our comrades a1ready
                            gone to Merciful Heaven...

A sudden flash:

Algren's mind. The real battle of Sutter's Hill. The grim reality is ver y
different from the dashing tale. Union soldiers scream in agony. Those
horses still alive buck and froth at their tether.                      .

Algren, a lieutenant then, moves among the panicked, bloody men. He stops beside a
PRIVATE, his brother, DAVID ALGREN, 19, blonde, not much more than a boy.

                                             DAVEY
                            They're coming, Nate.

He looks over the wall. Rebel troops are moving up the hill.

                                            ALGREN
                            Keep your head down.

                                              DAVEY
                                    (smiling)
                            Papa alwa ys said we should've joined the navy.

                                             ALGREN
                            What'd he know?
                                    (looks fondly at his brother)
                            You watch me now. Do whatever I say. .

                                                                                   3.

                                             DAVEY
                           Aye-a ye, lieutenant.

Algren punches his shoulder and moves on down the line. Nearby, Algren's
friend, SERGEANT ZEBULAH GANT, though severel y wounded, reloads
his revolver with the last of his ammunition.

                                            GANT
                           How're the horses?

                                              ALGREN
                           Better than you. Smell better, too.
                                    (looks at him)
                           Can you hold on, Zeb?

                                              GANT
                                     (fighting the pain)
                           I got I choice?

Algren smiles sadly. His mend will die loon without medical attention.

Algren moves down the line, bullets whizzing overhead. He kneels beside
COLONEL BAGLEY, his commanding officer.

                                            BAGLEY
                                  (panicking)
                           We need a flag. Find me a goddamn white flag!

                                            ALGREN
                           What are you talking about?!

                                            BAGLEY
                           Surrender, damn it! That's an order!

Back to the convention hall:


                                                ALGREN
                           No thought of surrender among those boy.
                           Better to die as God made us, we thought, as
                           soldiers... So I gave the order. Mister Bugler,
                           sound mount up. Mister Bugler, sound prepare
                           arms. There were only thirty of us, but we had
                           fire in us yet. I looked down the hill at the destiny
                           ordained for us. And gave the order. Mister
                                                             .
                           Bugler, charge!

The little Union cavalry soldiers begin moving down slots in the hill.

On Sutter's Hill:

Algren leads a chaotic cavalry charge down the hill toward the advancing rebel
infantry -- artillery explosi ons - bullets snapping, trees shattering.

Algren's brother, Davey, rides beside him.

                                                                                      4.

The wounded Sergeant Gant pulls himself up, waves his cap and yells.

Bagley remains cowering behind the stone wall.


Back to the convention hall:

                                              ALGREN
                           And straight into them we went...

On Sutter's Hill :

Carnage. Union and Confederate soldiers slam together, falling, drowning in mud
and blood, stepped on by panicked hones.

Algren wields his saber in one hand and his revolver in the other, serving
death on all sides.


A soldier riding next to Davey is shot. A horse falls into a shellhole.

Back to the convention hall:

                                              ALGREN
                           "Hip-hip hurray" we shouted, for we
                           had spirit in us yet--

More flashes:

Algren slices right and left with his saber. He is a truly gifted swordsman.

A tree branch knocks Davey from his horse. He sits, dazed, on the ground.
Algren kills a rebel soldier just as be is about to fire on him.

Single-handedly, be rallies his men, screaming orders, then lifts his wounded
brother onto the saddle beside him.

He leads them downhill toward safel y, Davey clinging to him for dear life.

Back to the convention hall:

                                             ALGREN
                           Before they knew what hit them, we had broken
                           through into the rear of the rebel army.

On Sutter's Hill:

Algren and his men gather in a copse of trees. They are giddy with the exhilaration
of having survived.

                                             DAVEY
                           We did it, bro', WE DID IT! Whoeeeee!!

Algren's smile is shortlived, though.

                                                                                   5.

SUDDENLY, the woods ERUPT with gunfire. Trees are shredded.


Algren's men are literally cut to pieces-

Davey is riddled with bullets, his dead body shielding Algren from harm until
he slides, lifeless, to the mud.

                                                ALGREN
                            Davey---!!!!

Men and horses are torn apart -- they contort and writhe in agony ­ jerking
grotesquely as the bullets rip into them. Algren frantica1ly tries to locate the
source of this firepower. Then he sees:

A Gatling Gun.

Six barrels glisten like steel teeth. This early machine gun is the pinnacle of
current military might -- 60 rounds a second -- a triumph in engineering.

                                        ALGREN
                            AHHHHHHH--!!!!!

With insane courage, he wheels and charges the gun.

Bullets rip into horse and rider alike. Algren falls, lifeless, into the mud.

Back to the convention hall:

                                             ALGREN
                            And the 23rd rode on to glory.

Applause.

At the back of the hall three elegantly dressed JAPANESE MEN watch
Algren's performance. They wear Western frock coats and top hats

                                               ALGREN
                            Now let me: tell you, gentlemen, if there's one
                            thing on earth I could have had with me on that
                            glorious day, it would have been this beauty...

Algren holds up a Winchester repeating rifle.

At the back of the audience we note someone else watching Algren.
SERGEANT ZEBULON GANT, whom we last saw on Sutter's Hill.

                                               ALGREN
                            The Winchester Model '73 lever-action rifle.
                            15 shot capacity, one round-per-second,
                            accurate at 400 yards. You'll note the
                            patented loading port just beneath the
                            cartridge chamber and the smooth
                            cocking action. ...Lets' just see here--

                                                                                          6.

He peers into the ejection port as he cocks the weapon and sights out over the
crowd.

KA-BOOM!!! The report echoes among the screams of the ladies. Dust and
glass fall from a rear chandelier.

                                            ALGREN
                           Smooth trigger action, too.

Audience-members murmur nervousl y.

                                             ALGREN
                           This is, gentlemen, The Gun That Is Winning The
                           West... Step on up and take a look. Mr. McCabe is
                           here to answer any question and take orders. I thank
                           you.

Later...


A Winchester representative is handing Algren an envelope.

                                            WINCHESTER REP
                           What the hell was that?

                                              ALGREN
                           Got their attention, didn't I?

                                            WINCHESTER REP
                           Boston in three weeks. And sober this time.

He goes. Algren immediately starts counting the cash.

INT.           SEEDY HOTEL ROOM                      NIGHT

Algren sits alone on the bed. He takes out a leather-bound journal and begins to write.

                                             ALGREN (V.O.)
                           June 17th, 1876. The dead are with me tonight.
                           They return each time I am obliged to tell their
                           story.

INT.            SQUALID BAR                NIGHT

Algren sips absinthe. He stares at the milky, green liquid before him.

                                                 ALGREN (V.O.)
                           I can almost see them in the shadows, their
                           bodies whole and beautiful once more. Sometimes
                           it's as if they call to me in a sweet invitation --

                                                                                    7.
EXT.                   GAS-LIT STREET              NIGHT


Algren walks in the fog. Sputtering gas lamps give an unearthly glow.


                                             ALGREN (V.O.)
                            "We are dead," they whisper, "and we are happy."


INT.           SEEDY HOTEL ROOM                     NIGHT

Algren is back in the hotel room. From his small suitcase, he takes the
Medal of Honor, looks at it for a long moment.

                                              ALGREN (V.O.)
                            "Do not be afraid," they whisper. "You have been
                            dead, too."

A sudden flash:

We are back on Sutter's Hill. Algren's slaughtered cavalry litter the bloody
ground, dead to the last man. A rebel army surgeon gives a cursory look at
each body before it is loaded onto a wagon.

Algren's turn is no different than the others. He is declared dead and hoisted
unceremoniously onto the pile of corpses.

Back in the. hotel room.:

Algren sits, staring into the middle distance.

                                              ALGREN (V.O.)
                            Is this why they gave their lives? So that I might
                            disgrace their memory?

He reaches into the suitcase and takes out a Colt revol ver. Stares at it, cracks
the cylinder to make sure it's loaded. His finger wraps around the trigger,
the barrel makes its wa y toward his head.

And then, unaccountabl y, he is laughing.

                                             ALGREN (V.O.)
                            And why, after taking so many lives, do I find
                            myself incapable of taking just one more?

A KNOCK on the door. Algren shuts his eyes, then calls out.

                                                 ALGREN
                            Go awa y.

                                              GANT (V .O.)
                            Not exactly the greeting I imagined.

                                                                                                                  8.
Algren looks up. He knows that voice. He carefully puts the revolver back into the suitcase and shuts it before
opening the door.


                                            GANT
                           Thought you'd seen the last of me, I expect.

Algren is filled with emotion, which he tries to hide.


                                              ALGREN
                           Zeb...

They embrace.

                                              ALGREN

                           Sit. Please.


Gant moves to the proffered chair with a pronounced limp.

                                               GANT
                           ... Saw your little melodrama         toda y.
                           Very inspiring... .

                                            ALGREN
                           Given up soldiering to become a critic?

Gant smiles and shakes his head.

                                             GANT
                           Got a job for you, unless you're running for
                           office...

                                              ALGREN
                           I have I job.

                                              GANT
                           I mean a real job. Back in uniform.

                                              ALGREN
                           I' m retired.

                                             GANT
                           I don't mean a U.S. uniform.

Algren looks at him. Curious despite himself.


INT.           RESTAURANT                  NIGHT

Gant leads Algren into a lush San Francisco restaurant. Flickering gaslight
and trays of lobster. COLONEL BENJAMIN BAGLEY (whom we saw in
flashback) sits with the three Japanese men. Bagley's hair has greyed. He

                                                                                  9.
has his eye on a political future.

                                             BAGLEY
                            Nathan, good to see you.

                                              ALGREN
                                    (stunned)
                            Colonel Bagley...

                                              BAGLEY
                            Sit down. This is Mr. Omura, from Japan, and
                            his two associates who, so far as I can tell, don't
                            have names...

OMURA 40, is a handsome and intelligent man. He watches Algren closel y
as Algren pours a glass or whiskey from a decanter.

                                                BAGLEY
                            They're looking to hire real American soldiers to
                            create the first Japanese Imperial Army.

Algren looks at him.

                                               BAGLEY
                            Japan's got it in mind to become a civilized
                            country and they're willing to spend what it takes
                            to hire white experts to do the job right.

Algren takes a slow lip of whiskey.

                                             BAGLEY
                            Sergeant Gant has already agreed to serve. You
                            would be m y second-in-command.

                                             ALGREN.
                            With approval from Washington, of course.

                                               BAGLEY
                            Both governments prefer to consider our mission
                            unofficial. We'd be there as non-combatants
                                               BAGLEY
                                               (MORE)
                            only, advisors to the Japanese officers. Help
                            them with training, ordinance and the like.

                                              GANT
                            You ought to think about it., Captain. Unless
                            you intend to take up a career in the theater.

                                              ALGREN
                            I have an agreement with the Winchester
                            Corporation -- I'm sure these people have some
                            concept of what an agreement is.

                                                                               10.

Omura suddenly speaks. His English is flawless.

                                             OMURA
                            You are paid seven dollars for each performance.
                            You do, on average, fourteen performances a
                            year. We will pay you 400 dollars.

                                               ALGREN
                            A year?

                                               OMURA

                            A month.

Algren looks at him. The figure, in 1876, is staggering.


EXT              SHIP--OCEAN                     DAY

A steamship chums its wa y across the great Pacific. Algren leans on the
ship's rail and looks out into an endless processi on of wa ves.

                                               ALGREN (V.O.)
                            June 23, 1876. It is impossible, standing here,
                            not to appreciate one's, own insignificance.

A dolphin crests the surface, arcing into the air.

                                               ALGREN (V.O.)
                            Here there is neither past, nor future. Only an
                            oblivion of water.

In his tiny cabin, Algren finishes writing in his journal and takes out a
daguerreot ype of a HAUNTINGLY BEAUTIFUL BLOND WOMAN.

                                              ALGREN (V.O.)
                            And yet I ask myself, will the dead follow me
                            across the ocean to this strange new land?

He stares at the woman in the picture.


INT.            SHIP ­ CABIN                 DAY


In the main cabin, Algren sits with Gant and Omura. Algren is drinking.


                                              OMURA
                            ...After the Shogun gave up power, the daimyos ­
                            you would call them warlords --knew that Japan
                            needed a centralized government. So they asked

                                                                                      11.
                                            OMURA (CONT'D)
                           the hereditary Emperor, His Highness the
                           Enlightened Meiji, to lead the country.

                                            ALGREN
                           And these warlords just ... gave up hundreds of
                           years of power?

                                             OMURA
                           Economic incentives were offered. Most
                           provincial leaders saw the financial benefits of
                           modernization.

                                            ALGREN
                           What about those that didn't?

                                             OMURA
                           To deal with those who have resisted, the
                           Emperor has decided to create an Army with
                           allegiance only to him... We considered hiring
                           advisors from Germany, but your Ambassador
                           reminded us of your experience in suppressing rebellious
                           elements in your Civil War.

This evocation of the Civil War is not lost on Algren.

                                          ALGREN
                           Who are we supposed to be fighting against?

                                            OMURA
                           His name is Mori Katsumoto. He is samurai.

                                             ALGREN
                           Samurai?

                                              OMURA
                           The word you might use it "warrior". But that
                           does not quite capture it ... Katsumoto once served
                           the Emperor but he is now a traitor who leads a
                           band of traitors. He must be punished.

Algren looks pointedly at Bagley.

                                               ALGREN
                           You told them about our experiences together
                           on Sutter's Hill, did you, Colonel?

                                           BAGLEY
                           They know I was your commanding officer.
                           Yes.

Algren glares at Bagley, then stands.

                                                                                 12.



                                             ALGREN
                           Excuse me, gentlemen. I need some air.
                                    (to Omura)
                           I'm sure Colonel Bagley can amuse you with
                           more stories of patriotic gore.

He walks away.

                                                 OMURA
                           He is insolent.

                                             BAGLEY
                           Get him in front of the troops, you'll see. Top
                           of his class at West Point. Brilliant tactician.
                           Even wrote a book.

                                            OMURA
                           Why did he leave your army?

                                             BAGLEY
                           What's a hero to do when there's no more great
                           battles?

                                              OMURA
                           Is that an evasive answer?

                                               BAGLEY
                           Sir, this man was left for dead at Sutter's Hill.
                           Doct ors swore his heart had stopped beating,
                           but before they could bury him, he came back to
                           life. After the war he fought the Sioux, the Cree,
                           and the Blackfoot.
                                   (leans closer)      .
                           Point him at the enemy. He was born for it.

INT.                SHIP -- ALGREN'S BERTH                      NIGHT

Algren lies in his cramped berth. Can't sleep.

A sudden flash:

On the wagon of dead bodies, Algren's eyes open to stare into the unblinking
eyes of his brother, Davey, half his face shot off. He tries to move but be is
buried beneath the weight of those piled on top of him. Blood drips down
into his eyes and mouth, blinding and choking him.

Back to the ship:

Algren awakens, bathed in sweat. Terror. A silhouette in the doorwa y.

                                                                                 13.
Colonel Bagley stands looking down at him.

                                                BAGLEY
                            I hope you realize the kind of second chance
                            this is for you. I won't tolerate insubordination.

Algren reaches for a nearby glass, drains it.
                                                ALGREN
                            Court-martial me.

                                              BAGLEY
                            Would you rather I hadn't recommended you
                            for the medal. Nathan? Is that it?

                                             ALGREN
                            We both know why you helped me, Colonel.
                            Don't expect me to go all weepy with gratitude.

                                              BAGLEY
                            I expect you to do your job. Save the self-pity
                            for your own time.

He turns and walks out, leaving Algren to stare at the empty glass.


EXT.                 SHIP                       DAY

Algren and Gant stand at the rail.

                                               GANT
                            Hate boats. If the Lord bad wanted man to sail
                            he wouldn't have created infantry.

                                           ALGREN
                            How many rimes you puke today?

                                                GANT
                            I'm down to two.

Omura comes up next to them.
                                                OMURA
                            I understand you are a scholar, Captain Algren.
                                     (to Gant)
                            Have you read his book., Mr. Gant?

                                                GANT
                            Can't say I have.

                                              OMURA
                            An analysis of the triumph of weapons technology
                            over antiquated military tactics.

                                                                               14.

                           A real page-turner. Sold twelve copies.

                                               OMURA
                           Nonetheless, I was impressed. I enjoy reading
                           military history. I spent two years studying
                           English at Princeton University.

                                           ALGREN
                           And where did you learn to speak Japanese?


Omura is perplexed by Algren's remark, then realizes he is being kidded. He
laughs heartily. Algren laughs with him. A connection is made.

                                              OMURA
                           Yes, and in Japanese there are twenty-seven
                           words for "war." I will be impressed if you learn
                           only half of them. .

He walks away. Algren watches him go. His face darkens.

                                             ALGREN
                           I got twenty-seven words too - Reb, Sioux,
                           Pawnee, Blackfoot, Jappo. Only one language
                           when it comes to war.

EXT.               YOKOHAMA HARBOR                           DAY

Like all Japan, Yokohama is at the cusp of a new era.

Ancient sampans and wooden schooners beside freighters and steamships.

EXT.                YOKOHAMA ­ DOCK                            DAY

After 23 days at sea, they are all glad to climb down the gangplank. The
Yokohama docks are a frenzy of languages and looks and smells and sounds.
Japanese competes with German and English and French and Russian.
Warehouses fl y the flags of a dozen countries.

One striking Japanese character dominates: the symbol for, Omura. It is seen
on buildings, warehouses, and the headbands of scores of laborers.

A series of palanquins, litters carried by bearers, await our voyagers.

As does SIMON GRAHAM, a dissipated Englishman who has lived in Japan
for many yean. Slender and pale, with an occasional consumptive cough, in
his 50's, he wears a white linen suit, a bit worse for wear.

                                              OMURA
                           Captain Algren, this is Mr. Simon Graham. He
                           will be your translator.

                                                                                   15.
                                            GRAHAM
                          Pleasure, Captain.

                                            BAGLEY
                          You'll be quartered at the Embassy for now.

                                          OMURA
                          The Emperor will summon you at his pleasure.

Graham ushers Algren and Gant into their own less-ornate version.

                                            GRAHAM
                          If you please, Captain...

                                           ALGREN
                           They're gonna carry us?

                                            GRAHAM
                          You're guests of the Emperor. You cannot walk.

Algren notes the hoods covering the faces of the palanquin bearers.

                                            ALGREN
                          Why the hoods?

                                             GRAHAM
                          So you won't have to burden your eyes by looking
                          at slaves. Oh, excuse me, they're servants now.
                                    (coughs, wipes a bit of blood)
                          This wa y, gentlemen...

INT /EXT            PALANQUIN - YOKOHAMA STREETS                             DAY

Their bearers maneuver them through the bustling streets of Yokohama.
White face painted geishas walk alongside bearded Russians. Traditional
Japanese kimonos alongside European suits and hats, schizophrenic world
of ancient Japan versus modern commercialism.

                                            GRAHAM
                          Twenty years ago Yokohama was a lovel y little
                          port. Then your Commodore Perry arrived and
                          changed all that.

                                             ALGREN
                          All this in twenty years?

                                             GRAHAM
                          Japan has...embraced... Western wa ys. Hired
                          lawyers from France, doctors from Germany,
                          naval architects from Britain, civil engineers,
                          railway designers, scientists, teachers. And, of
                          course, warriors from the United States.

                                                                                      16.

                           Or selling the past...


INT.            GUEST QUARTERS                       DAY

A shoji screen is opened by a bowing servant to reveal the clean, classic lines
of a Japanese room. Algren is about to enter when Graham stops him,
indicating for Algren to remove his boots.

Algren scowls, confused, and struggles to pull off the high, filthy boots. He takes
in the foreigness of the room, an arrangement of fl owers on a low table.

                                             ALGREN
                           No chairs? . .

                                               GRAHAM
                           Correct. And this--
                                     (points to a mat)
                           ..is your bed.

                                             ALGREN
                           And this?


He points to a block of wood.

                                             GRAHAM
                           Your pillow.

                                            ALGREN
                           You mean to say there are no real beds in Japan?

                                               GRAHAM
                           For its entire history Japan his been completely
                           aakoku, I "closed country." Thirty years ago, if
                           you had washed up on Japanese soil... you would
                           have been beheaded on sight. Now, they let you
                           keep your head... and give you a wooden pillow.

EXT.           AMERICAN EMBASSY-. GARDEN                     DAYS LATER

In the pristine grounds of the Embassy, a garden party is in progress.
Incongruous lilting Yankee tunes are heard from the Japanese band.

Algren and Gant, now in their dress uniforms wander through the party with Graham.
Liveried servants pall trays of canapés.

Elsewhere we see diplomats representing all the powers currently trying to devour
Japan: Russia; England; Germany; France; Spain; etc.

                                                                                                     17.
                                           GRAHAM
                          I remember when it was just America and the
                          Dutch. Now ever ybody' s getting into the game.

They pass two German diplomats. The Germans glance to Algren and Gant with suspicion, bow tersely.
Graham greets them in German.

                                          GRAHAM
                          The Germans are particularly eager.

                                          ALGREN
                          What do they want?

                                           GRAHAM
                          Same thing your country wants. Most favored
                          nation status.

                                          ALGREN
                          How long have you been in Japan?

                                               GRAHAM
                          Oh, western time quickly loses its meaning here
                          ... I first came as part of the British legation in 1857.
                          But I was soon relieved of m y position, as a result
                          of various...disagreements with the
                          Crown's attitude toward the locals.


Omura separates himself from his entourage and approaches.

                          America has much to offer us, though. Its'
                          industry and ingenuity are without peer.
                                   (ingratiating)
                          I have spoken to the Emperor about you. He is
                          interested in the most modem theories of warfare.

                                             ALGREN
                          I look forward to the opportunity of meeting
                          him someday.

                                           OMURA
                          You will have that chance sooner than you think.
                          He has requested an audience.

Graham is open-mouthed at this turn of events.

                                                                                       18.

EXT.                  IMPERIAL PALACE                          DAY

Algren and Bagley sit with Graham in an ornate carriage as they cross the
moat and enter the ancestral palace of the Shoguns.

INT.                   IMPERIAL PALACE ­ ANTECHAMBER                            DAY


Algren waits with Bagley and Graham outside the throne room.


                                            GRAHAM
                          Remember that he is arahitogami. A god in
                          human form. During the last two hundred years
                          no emperor was even seen by commoner. You
                          may look at him, with deference, but do not speak
                          unless you are spoken to.

EXT.          IMPERIAL COURT -- THRONE ROOM                      DAY

Algren and Gant are surprised to discover the living god is barely in his
twenties. The divine EMPEROR MEIJI is an intelligent and curious young man,
yet there is a tentativeness about him.

His throne is surrounded by ADVISORS, principal among them is Omura.
Nearby, the American AMBASSADOR SWANBECK a cagey diplomat

The throne room itself is sweeping, beautiful, and extremely restrained. Everywhere,
tasteful displays of the traditional flower of the monarchy: chrysanthemums.
The vibrant yellow bl ossoms haunt the chamber.

As the Emperor considers his guests, Omura whispers into his ear. Then:

                                              OMURA
                          The Emperor bids you welcome. He wishes you
                          to know that he is most grateful for the assistance
                          your country offers ours, in order to rid ourselves
                          of the brutality of the provincial warlords - and
                          to accomplish the same national harmony which
                          you enjoy in your homeland.

The Emperor speaks in Japanese. The advisors are non-plussed, and Omura leans down
for a moment to confer with him, then smiles indulgently:

                                           OMURA
                          The Emperor is most interested in your American
                          Indians, and wishes to know if you have seen
                          them firsthand.

Algren looks at Graham, who nods. He may speak.

                                                                                   19.
                                             ALGREN
                           I have seen many of them, and have fought them,
                           too. They are very brave.

Graham translates. The Emperor nods and smiles.

                                              EMPEROR
                                    (accented English)
                           Thank... you... very ...much.

He stands. Everyone else hurries to follow suit. The audience is over.


EXT.               PALACE GARDEN                       DAY

A1gren, Graham, and Bagley walk through the palace grounds.

                                            BAGLEY
                           That young pup runs this country?

                                             GRAHAM
                           That "pup" runs the country no more than I do.
                           He was installed as a figurehead at age twelve
                           when the warlords realized Japan needed a central
                           government. But don't be fooled -- he may be a
                           powerless god, but to these people he's a god
                           nonetheless.

GENERAL YOSHITAKA appears. He is a seasoned soldier in his 40's. A
decent man. He stops before them, bows quickly.

                                             GRAHAM
                           Gentlemen, may I present General Yoshitaka.
                           He will assist you in training the army.

                                             ALGREN
                           General.

Algren offers his hand. General Yoshitaka does not take it. He bowl his head and
speaks a few words. Graham translates:

                                             YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM
                           He greets you with extreme courtesy and asks if
                           you are ready to meet the Imperial Army.


EXT.           PARADE GROUND                            DAY

About a thousand Japanese soldiers in baggy uniforms are milling around a large
parade ground. Each has an old single shot rifle. Algren, Gant, and Yoshitaka
look down on them from a reviewing stand.


                                             GANT
                           Jesus....

                                                                                          20.

                                             ALGREN
                            Ask the General what training they' ve had.

Graham speaks to General Yoshitaka, then translates his response.

                                                YOSHITAKA/ GRAHAM
                            He sa ys... We have trained them not to shoot
                            their ...asses off.

Algren glances to General Yoshitaka, who looks back wr yl y.


                                               ALGREN
                            Sergeant Gant, have the men stand to attention.

                                            GANT
                            Imperial Army, Atten-tion!

Graham translates, rather mildly.

                                              ALGREN
                            For God's sake, let's not keep it a secret who's in
                            charge here ... Mr. Gant.

                                           GANT
                                   (roars)
                            ALL RIGHT YOU SLANTY-EYED LITTLE
                            BASTARDS STAND UP STRAIGHT OR I
                            WILL SHIT-KICK EVERY ONE OF YOU
                            COCKSUCKERS!!

As the soldiers immediately stand to attention, we begin a montage of the training
of the first Imperial Army:

We see Gant drilling the men. Shouting at his translator. Trying to get them to march
in formation. Algren is nearby, watching.

                                               ALGREN (V.O.)
                            August 4,1876. As I watch this new army train,
                            I cannot help but think of those who rode with
                            me in me 23rd cavalry.

Algren sits in his tent, writing in his journal. Outside, the Japanese are being taught
the basics of firing tactics.

                                              ALGREN (V.O.)
                            For four years they had survived, never once
                            shrinking from the fire. And so, when given my
                            order to charge the advancing rebel infantry,
                            they never hesitated. ...And they all died.

We see Algren showing the Japanese how to fire in formation. The old single-shot
rifles they carry make reloading a painfully slow process.

                                                                                    21.


                                            ALGREN (V .O.)
                           Now I am training another army. In another
                           civil war.

Algren and Gant spar with sabers - Algren's expertise far exceeds Gant's, a
fact which Gant accepts with good humor.

                                             ALGREN (V.O.)
                           Is this why I was spared? Once again to lead
                           men to their death?

It is sunset Algren, Graham, and General Yoshitaka watch the training.
General Yoshitaka speaks.

                                               YOSHlTAKA/ GRAHAM
                           ... the problem is they're peasants. They have
                           never had this sort of responsibility or power.

Algren watches Gant march beside the Japanese. They are illuminated by the
majestic red sunset

                                            ALGREN
                                   (to Graham)
                           Ask him if they have a flag.

Graham translates. Genera1 Yoshitaka responds.

                                               GRAHAM
                           No flag.

                                               ALGREN
                           They need a flag.

EXT.                TOKYO ­ STREET                           EVENING

Tokyo is a city in chaos. Everything seems out of balance. Dystopic. A
collision of Eastern and Western. Algren and Gant watch as Graham prepares
to take a photograph of an old merchant in front of his store.

                                                GRAHAM
                           ... I've been doing this for years. Trying to capture
                           it before it's all gone. Afraid I'm losing the battle.

Algren silently watches the passers-by. Something draws his attention:

Across the street. a man is striding down the crowded sidewalk. His martial
bearings, two swords, traditional dress and unique top knot of hair instantly
identify him to us as a samurai.                                       .

We will meet him again later, he is UJIO. A terse, grim man in his 40's. His
proud gait and rigid, imperious manner intrigue Algren.

                                                                                                        22.
Most of the people on the sidewalk instantly step out of the wa y, bowing in deference. But two young
Japanese in Western dress do not.

Ujio stands before them, waiting for them to move. They don't.
Tense words are exchanged. Ujio glares at them. Algren watches.

                                              ALGREN
                           Mr. Graham...

                                             GRAHAM
                           Ah... now this should be interesting... He's
                           waiting for them to show deference.

Across the street, Uji o barks out some harsh commands to the two
Japanese men. They laugh in response. Then one of the men raises a hand
and barks some clearly disrespectful words back--

Like lightning-- Ujio pulls out his long samurai sword - it flashes --

Cleanly beheading the disrespectful Japanese man --


The beheaded corpse begins to fall--

In one smooth motion, Ujio wipes his blade clean of the corpse as it falls
and sweeps it back into its scabbard. The other man immediately drops to
his belly, prostrating himself.

Without another glance, Ujio walks awa y. His face is completely impassive.

                                            GANT
                           What the hell was that?

                                              GRAHAM
                            That...is a samurai.

INT.          RESTAURANT                         NIGHT

Sergeant Gant gazes unhappily at his dinner: glistening raw fish; tepid
beancurds; boiled rice. Algren, Gant, Graham, and General Yoshitaka sit
cross-legged on the floor. Gant finds this extremely uncomfortable.

                                              GRAHAM
                           ... Before the edicts ever y citizen had to prostrate
                           himself in the presence of a samurai.

                                             ALGREN
                           What edicts are those?

                                            GRAHAM
                           The Council of State has been passing a series
                           of laws designed to eliminate the samurai.


                                              GANT
                           Why?

                                                                               23.

                                             GRAHAM
                           Because you are here now, Sergeant... For the
                           last 800 years guarding Japan and fighting her
                           wars was the exclusive occupation of the samurai.

The next course arrives. Thick, black eel. Gant groans.

                                              GRAHAM
                           Men like Mori Katsumoto were the most elite
                           caste in Japanese societ y until the Council of
                           State -- led by your friend Omura - decided the
                           whole class had to go ...
                                     (munching eel)
                           ... Most of the samurai accepted the new laws.
                           But some didn't. Or couldn't. Like Katsumoto.

General Yoshitaka speaks up. Graham translates:

                                             GRAHAM
                           General Yoshitaka bids you to remember that
                           the word samurai means "one who serves." Their
                           whole existence is based on serving their
                           country as warriors.

Graham finishes translating, then continues on his own:

                                              GRAHAM .
                           Your Imperial Army is taking awa y their only
                           reason for being ... So what are they to do now?

Algren considers this as he pours another cup of sake.
                 .
                                             ALGREN
                           This is sake?

                                              GRAHAM
                           Sake. Rice wine.

                                              YOSHITAKA
                           Hie! Sake.

                                              ALGREN
                           Sake..
                                    (to Yoshitaka)
                           Good.

Yoshitaka nods. Enthusiastically tries an English word.

                                              YOSHITAKA
                           Good!

                                                                               24.
                                              GRAHAM
                           Vexing people, the samurai. Blood-thirsty,
                           honorable, cruel, fabulousl y artistic. Wanted to
                           write a book about them for years, but no
                           Westerner can get close enough.

                                            ALGREN
                           Ask him if he ever saw a samurai in battle.

Graham looks at A1gren.

                                               GRAHAM
                           He is samurai.


Algren looks at Yoshitaka with new eyes.

EXT.                TOKYO ­ STREET                 NIGHT

Later that night.

Algren and Gant, a little drunk by now, wander Tokyo's bustling red light
district. Like Amsterdam, the geishas sit in windows facing the street.

INT.                 GEISHA HOUSE                    NIGHT

This is certainly not the whorehouse they expected. Elegant Japanese
furnishings. Lovel y flute music. The MADAM lowers her head and speaks
quietly in greeting.

                                            GANT
                           My friend and I were looking for some
                           companionship...

The Madam speaks no English. Gant speaks louder, as if to a deaf person.


                                             GANT
                           Ladies of the evening? Hootchie-contchie?
                           Boom-Boom?

                                            ALGREN
                                    ( embarrassed)
                           Zeb.
                                     (tries a bow to the madam)
                           ...so sorry.

Gant flashes a fistful of Japanese currency.

                                            GANT
                           Universal language. boyo.

The Madam nods and bows. Almost magically, two beautifully-dressed
GEISHAS appear, their faces are painted pure white.

                                                                                     25.
One of the Geishas smile. Her teeth are blackened, to better set off the
whiteness of her face paint

                                                GANT
                            That one's yours.

INT.             GEISHA HOUSE ­ ROOM                        NIGHT

Algren and Gant are led into an elegant room with paper screens, and a table
set for the Japanese tea ceremony.                                               .

Gant tries to take the arm of one of the geishas - but she moves awa y,
gesturing for him to sit The other begins the tea ceremony.

                                                ALGREN
                            No tea... Sake.

A musician plays a traditional lute. The geisha begins a graceful fan dance.

                                             GANT
                            Fan dance. Saw this once in Chicago.

Algren smiles at the Geisha preparing the. She smiles back. Algren pours
himself a cup of sake.

Later...

The sake bottle is empty. The interminable lute music continues.

Gant is increasingly agitated as the geisha continues her dance. Algren can't
help but laugh at his frustration. Finally Gant has had enough. He rises, a
bit unsteady from the sake.

                                              GANT
                            Okay, darlin' time to get down to business:

He shoos the musician out of the room, then approaches the geisha, who
shrinks from his intention.

                                               ALGREN
                            Zeb. I don't think she --

                                               GANT
                            She's just shy. Who knows what we white devils
                            have got in our trousers, eh, darlin'?

He takes her arm. She resists - her voice rising.

                                                GANT
                            Come on, now.

He tries to pull her along. Her kimono tears. She calls out in terror. Two men

appear, bouncers presumably, but alight of build.

                                                                                    26.

                                             ALGREN
                           Oh, shit.

The Madam yells angrily at Gant in Japanese. Pushing him out roughly.

                                            GANT
                           Now, hold on there, sister. I paid good money.

One of the bouncers puts his hand, politely, on Gant's arm.

                                             GANT
                           Back off, short-stuff.

This time, the bouncer is more insistent. Gant takes a swing at him. Wrong
move. Before Gant knows what hit him, the little man uses Gant's
momentum in an akido move to flip him to the mat, hard.

Algren can only stare, in awe, at the lethal move. As the second bouncer moves
to confront him, bowing apologetically, Algren speaks in English, smiling,
knowing they can't understand a word he's saying.

                                            ALGREN
                           Obviousl y you can kick the shit out of people
                           much larger than you, so we'll be leaving now...

EXT.               _PARADE GROUND                             DAY

The training continues. We see Gant, now sporting a black eye. Algren
walks with General Yoshitaka and Graham. Graham translates:

                                           YOSHITAKA/ GRAHAM
                           The General wishes to know if you bad a pleasant
                           evening?

Algren looks at Yoshitaka, who gives him. wry look..

                                              ALGREN
                           It was... educational
                                     (Yoshitaka nods)
                           Would the General mind telling me more about
                           our common enemy?

Yoshitaka looks at him. Has Algren deliberately used the word, "enemy,"
knowing that Yoshitaka, too, is a samurai? Algren gives nothing awa y.

                                              YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM
                           ... Mori Katsumoto is an extremely charismatic leader.
                           To those who honor the old ways, he's a hero. His
                           force is estimated at about five hundred and growing
                           by the day. All samurai.

                                           ALGREN
                           What kind of man is be?

Graham translates. General Yoshitaka considers his words.

                                                                              27.

                                              YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM
                           Katsumoto has no fear. He has no pity. He is
                           kotsutai-- the soul of old Japan ... He is my
                           honored kinsman.

                                             ALGREN
                           Kinsman?

                                             YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM
                           We grew up together in Yoshino. Marched
                           together and fought together. He is Kaishaku
                           the brother of my spirit.

Algren considers this as they observe rifle practice. Erratic but
improving. Algren notes Yoshitaka's reaction. The rifles seem to make
him unhappy.

                                           ALGREN
                           Ask him what kind of guns Katsumoto has.


                                            GRAHAM
                           The samurai don't use guns.

                                            ALGREN
                           No, ask him what kind of firearms they have.

Graham obliges. Yoshitaka responds, with disdain:

                                            YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM
                           The samurai no longer dishonor themselves by
                           touching firearms.

Algren is surprised at this bit of information. A servant approaches, bows.

                                            GRAHAM
                           Colonel Bagley requires you.

INT.               TENT              DAY


Colonel Bagley and Algren stand at a map. Omura sits.

                           They're not a fighting unit yet

                           We have no choice.

                           --the railroad has been stopped here. Just as it
                           entered Yoshino, Katsumoto's province.

                                                                                   28.

                           provocation     is strategic. His defeat will
                           demonstrate     to the other disloyal samurai that
                           resistance is   an act devoid of honor.

                                             BAGLEY
                           The rebels don't have a single rifle. They're
                           savages with bows and arrows. You get up there
                           and show 'em how it', done.

                                              ALGREN
                           With respect, sir, I need more time.

                           With all due respect. this railroad cannot wait.

         He bows and leaves them alone. Bagley spins on A1gren.

                                             BAGLEY
                           You think we're the only country interested in
                           Japan?! You don't think the Germans and the
                           French would like to oversee the new army?

                                     (brutally)
                           Why do you think we're here, Captain? Because
                           Remington and Colt and Winchester have
                           powerful allies in Washington. We're here to
                           sell a shitload of American guns...and steel...and
                           timber. That shouldn't be bud for a Winchester
                           whore like you to understand.

Algren looks at him, murderously.

                                                ALGREN
                           Yes, air.



EXT.                    RUINED VILLAGE                               DAY

A STEAM ENGINE lends plumes of smoke into the air as it waits. Algren,
Bagley, and General Yoshitaka ride along the railroad line.

The Imperial Army follows, with Sergeant Gant, on foot.

A traditional Japanese village is being torn aside to make room for the railroad
line. Houses are being leveled and black smoke drifts up. The displaced
villagers gather belongings. Omura guards herd them about rather bruta1ly.

                                                                                 29.
Railroad workers are laying a new spur, building a brick station. A1gren notes
the by now familiar Omura symbol on the new water tower and on the
headbands of the guards and workers.

                                            ALGREN
                          What is that sign?

                          It's the symbol for the Omura Zaibatsu.

                          Zaibatsu?

                          They own all of this?

SEVERED HEADS on pikes line the road, a warning to those who continue

                          province. Here the local warlords have all been
                          convinced to accept the emperor's rule.

They pass a particularly wrenching sight. Villagers kneeling outside what
used to be a Shinto temple. The railroad tracks cut straight through it.

                          it can be reached only during the summer
                          months, and even then with great difficulty.

The Army moves on. Ahead are towering mountains.

                          A long march. And then a battle. A new enemy,
                          but the same feeling I had in my guts at twenty-one,
                          in the cornfield at Antietam -- men will die
                          here, today, and will I be among them?

EXT.                    MOUNTAIN PLAIN                        MORNING

Fog. Obscuring everything.

Algren and Bagley, on horseback, wait with Graham. General Yoshitaka and
a few Japanese Commanders are mounted as well. The thousand strong
Japanese Army is on foot They stand, rifles ready.                            ,

                                        ALGREN
                                   (to Graham)
                           Ask him how they'll come at us.

Graham speaks to General Yoshitaka. Yoshitaka responds:

                                             YOSHITAKA/ GRAHAM
                           They'll come straight on. They will push forward
                           and keep on attacking... And he adds that there
                           is no samurai word for "retreat."

Algren prepares himself.

They wait.

General Yoshitaka is suddenly alert. He speaks quietly to Graham.

                                              YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM
                           He sa ys they're coming...

Algren gazes into the thick fog ahead, sees nothing. Bagley looks worried.

                                             BAGLEY
                           Captain Algren, have you posted a rear guard to
                           protect our supply train?

                                             ALGREN
                           Yes.

                                           BAGLEY
                           Who is overseeing their deployment?

Algren is somewhat confused by the question.

                                             ALGREN
                           No one.

                                              BAGLEY
                           Mr. Graham, you will accompany me to the rear.
                           I want to be certain we are protected from any
                           surprise assault.

                                             GRAHAM
                           Yes. Of course.

Before Algren can respond, Bagley has left the front lines with Graham in

                                                                                    31.
tow. Gant watches as they head out of harm's wa y.                      .

                                               GANT
                            Son of a bitch.

                                                ALGREN
                                      (almost to himself)
                            ...I'm going to kill him.

                                            GANT
                            Waste of good ammo.

Gant checks his two revol vers. The methodical clicking of the chambers as
he checks his rounds is the only sound.                                         .

Then absolute silence. A light SNOW begins to fall.

Algren continues to peer into the fog. Nothing.

Then a sound ... distant ... building through the fog...

The steady rumble of horses. Slowl y approaching. Closer and closer...

Algren notes some of the Japanese soldiers are literally shaking in fear.

Algren peers again into the fog. Nothing. But the sound is closer.

Then the sound abruptly stops.

Silence broken only by the murmured prayers of some of the soldiers.

                                              ALGREN
                            Sergeant Gant, order the troops to assume
                            staggered firing positions.

                                             GANT
                            Imperial Army, assume staggered firing positions.

His order is translated. The Japanese soldiers prepare to fire, one
row kneeling, the other standing behind them.

One of the Japanese soldiers faints from sheer tension.

Algren can see nothing through the dense fog. The tension is unbearable.

Then a form on horseback... ghostly... like lame sort of medieval
monster. An elaborate, horned helmet. Sweeping samurai armor.

All we can see it the eerie silhouette in the fog.


Like something from a nightmare.

And then another figure... and another ... as 500 mounted samurai warriors
slowl y move into position.

                                                                                     32.
The Japanese troops are terrified


                                              GANT
                                   (quickly)
                           Hold the line ... hold the line...

The order is translated.

A terrible, beautiful moment of absolute stasis.

Nothing moves.

The Japanese soldiers wait.

The ghostly silhouettes wait.

Silence.

Then -- as if a silent signal were given -- the samurai suddenly CHARGE,
emerging from the fog in a great wave--! The force of a tsunami.

The silence is shattered as the charging samurai roar out ancient war-
cries that chill the blood -- sweeping forward on their hones like
lightning -swords and spears flashing

                                               ALGREN
                           FIRE!

The Japanese troops fire then quickly begin trying to reload their single shot
rifles -- others fumble at the ask and then break and run--

Panic and chaos--

                                               ALGREN
                           Hold the line!

Too late-- the samurai are on them--

They attack with an intensity few have ever seen -- many of the Japanese
soldiers try to escape, turning and running in blind panic -- they are butchered--
run through by the ashigaru, cut inhalf by the naginata.

Those soldiers who laboriousl y try to reload their rifles are quickly
mowed down by ferocious clouds of samurai arrows, fired by mounted
Samurai.

                                             ALGREN
                           Sound fall back! Sound fall back!

A bugler sounds the order. The Army begins to retreat.

But suddenly they are attacked from behind as well! Arrows shoot from the
fog and more mounted samurai appear.

                                                                                     33.

They are surrounded.

Algren, Gant, and the Japanese Offi cers call out orders but all discipline
soon breaks down -- it is every man for himself--

The battle swirls ever ywhere around us. Fleeing soldiers are run through by
lances, run down and trampled by horses.

Each samurai wears individual, vibrantly col ored armor. Various battle
flags sweep through the fog.

Gant uses his two cavalry revolvers -- firing constantly -- finally out of
ammo he drops from his horse in the cavalry st yle and pulls a Winchester
repeating rifle, crouching and quickly firing--

Algren uses his revol ver first -- firing as he turns on his horse -- when
the revol ver is empty he pulls his cavalry saber. He manages to parry
the lethal blows as the Samurai hurtle past --

But one Samurai, his armor all in black, comes at him on a collision course
and SLAMS INTO HIM, sending both horse and rider to the ground.

Algren scrambles to his feet, his saber nowhere to be found as another
rider heads toward him carrying a lance.

Algren manages to grab it and throw the rider to the ground, wrestling the
lance from his grip and running him through.

In the midst of the battle we notice a peculiar thing. One samurai is just sitting
on his horse. Watching Algren. This samurai wears a BLACK MASK.

The MASKED SAMUARI watches Algren fight.

Algren now wields the lance to battle the horsemen as they sweep past. He
spears one and then unseats another. When a third samurai cuts his lance in
half, Algren uses the remaining half as a club to take him down.

The Masked Samurai continues to watch Algren. Algren's tenacity is amazing.
He continues to fight with heroic passion, refusing to give an inch, long after
Those around him have fled.

Then a blaze of bright yellow ­ a samurai in yellow armor galloping past, firing
arrows steadily from horseback. His control and speed are astounding.

We will come to know him as YORITOMO, a handsome young samurai.

Yoritomo fires arrow upon arrow ­ the speed is breathtaking ­ Two arrows
slam into Gant, knocking him to the ground.

The battle, meanwhile, has become a rout. Those Imperial soldiers who fight
are easily cut down. Those who flee are run down like prey.

Left alone, Algren finds himself confronted by ashigaru ­ samurai foot
soldiers carrying pikes. He turns to discover his retreat cut off by other

                                                                                                         34.
samurai wielding katana ­ the lethal long sword.

But rather than give any quarter, Algren launches an attack. He kills one
samurai before he is RUN THROUGH, at the shoulder, by a lance.

In agony, Algren SNAPS OFF the hilt of the lance, leaving its tip buried
deep in his chest, and fights on.

He manages to parry a blow ­ which SLICES into his side. The next blow
takes off a piece of his scalp. Blood fl ows down his faces and into his eyes.

Algren is now surrounded by ten samurai. A man's heroic stand against
certain death is of great interest to them. As they begin to close in, Algren
whirls the lance around, a tattered battle-flag with TIGER INSIGNIA still
dangling from the end.

The MASKED SAMURAI removes his mask. It is the JAPANESE MAN,
whose dream of the tiger we glimpsed at the beginning of the story. His
eyes wide in surprise, he watches his dream come to life--the blue tiger
holding the dogs at bay.

In SLOW MOTION Algren whirls the lance, as one samurai, wearing
BLOOD-RED ARMOR, advances. With a murderous smile, he draws his
katana.
Algren seems spent ­ he drops to one knee, swaying, on the brink of losing
consciousness.
                                                                      .
But as the RED SAMURAI, lets out a battle cry and propels himself forward for the death blow - Algren
suddenly LEAPS UP and propels the jagged wooden end of the broken lance into the unprotected throat of his
attacker.

As the samurai falls, the rest of his comrades close in to cut Algren off.

A harsh COMMAND stops them in their tracks.

The Masked Samurai leaps from his horse. Everyone steps aside deferentially
so that be might pass by without being jostled.                    .

He looks down at Algren, then removes his battle helmet.

And we meet _MORI KATSUMOTO, the leader of the samurai. He it an
imposing man of about Algren's years.

Sensing that he is about to be killed, Algren pulls himself t o his knees, and SWINGS his saber at Katsumoto.
With blinding speed, Katsumoto pulls his katana from its scabbard.

Algren's saber is SNAPPED CLEANLY IN TWO.

Katsumoto looks down at Algren.

Then Gant appears behind Katsumoto -- limping toward him, cocking his
rifle, urgently trying to save Algren--

Ujio, (the Samurai we saw earlier on the streets of Tokyo) leaps to
protect his Lord. His sword flashes--

                                                                                                      35.
Gant is eviscerated. Algren watches in horror.

A dreadful beat as Gant stands, pathetically trying to hold his guts in. Then he
sinks to his knees.

Katsumoto turns, leaps back onto his horse and trots off.

Algren finally wrenches himself from under his horse. He crawls to Gant,
blood pouring from his own injured back and shoulder.

Gant is dead.

Algren looks up to see the battle is lost. The Japanese soldiers have fled.
Or are surrendering, injured or dead.

And he sees one other thing. General Yoshitaka is still on his horse,
head down. He has not pulled his sword. He has not been hurt.

Katsumoto rides to Yoshitaka. A few serious words are exchanged. Katsumoto bows his bead in respect, seems
to agree to something.

Both men climb from their horses. General Yoshitaka pulls out a small b1ade and hands it to Katsumoto, who
holds it out firmly.

General Yoshitaka quickly and calmly pulls himself on to the blade, plunging
it into his stomach, embracing Katsumoto.

It is seppuku -- the traditional form of samurai suicide.

Algren watches, stunned.

Then a terrible scream cuts through the battlefield.

Algren sees samurai calmly walking among the injured and captured Imperial
soldiers .. killing them one by one with a single stroke.

Algren looks over the slaughter.

And then passes out, bill wounds overcoming him.

Fade to...

EXT.                    MOUNTAIN PASS                               DAY

Algren is unconscious, tied to a horse.

The mounted samurai move up a treacherous mountain pass, disappearing
into the soaring mountains of Yoshino.

EXT.              VILLAGE                                    SUNSET

Katsumoto's village is the other Japan. The Japan we have not yet seen.

The gorgeous mountain scenery of Yoshino envelopes the village. Snow-
capped mountains soar in the distance. A valley below with rice fields.

                                                                                    36.

After the turmoil of Tokyo, this place seems a bucolic paradise. Traditional,
wooden Japanese architecture. Farming. The sense of harmony so markedly
absent from the cities.

Algren, barely conscious, hunches over his horse. He has lost a lot of blood.

Katsumoto leads his samurai into the village. As he passes, ever y person in
the village touches his or her forehead to the ground to show respect.

Most of these villagers have never seen a white face and gaze at Algren with
curiosity. And suspicion.

Katsumoto dismounts in a large square, the rest of his men follow suit. A samurai
helps Algren painfully slide from his horse.

Katsumoto moves to the steps of the largest house. His officers fall
into formation around him. Algren notes Ujio - the grim samurai who killed
Gant -- in jet black armor, glaring at him coldl y.

Ujio walks forward and SCREAMS at Algren in Japanese. Algren doesn't
move. This only makes Ujio more angry. He paces back and forth like a
caged panther spitting invective at Algren.

Algren doesn't move. He watches Uji o evenly. This takes incredible will.
His wounds are so bad that- he can barely stand.

SUDDENLY - Ujio draws his long sword -- it slashes through the air - the
blade singing -- and stops an inch away from Algren's face!
Algren doesn't move.

Ujio brings the cutting edge' into contact with Algren's check. Blood runs
where even this feather-light touch cuts Algren's skin. Algren doesn't move.

Ujio glares at him. Then sheathes his sword and walks away.

Katsumoto looks at Algren deepl y, gauging him. Then be speaks. In English.
Algren is surprised.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           You cannot escape. We are deep in the mountains
                           and winter is coming.

Katsumoto turns and walks into his house. Uji o follows him. Algren collapses.

Fade to black.

As Algren begins his time at the heart of the samurai world.


INT.                        YORITOMO'S HOUSE                           NIGHT

Algren'. eyes open...

A WOMAN is leaning close, her eyes intent on the task of sewing up his
wound. She is beautiful, but he is not really conscious enough to notice, or

                                                                                      37.
even feel the pain. He blacks out again.

INT.                    YORITOMO'S HOUSE                      NIGHT

Algren wakes again. He is lying on a simple mat. His injuries are such that
he can barely move his head. He takes in the traditional Japanese furnishings.

A red ball rolls across the floor. And after it... TOSHIIE, a little boy. around
four. The boy l ooks at Algren. offers him the ball. Smiles.


A1gren blacks out...


INT                      YORITOMO'S HOUSE                       ANOTHER DAY

Algren's eyes open...

Through the archway he can see Toshiie and his older brother HIGEN, around
ten. Also the beautiful WOMAN who earlier was stitching his wound.

From his recumbent position, Algren watches as she ministers to the boys,
who are dearly her sons. Algren is fascinated by her grace and the sweet
attention she gives them.

She seems to sense him. Her eyes raise, meet bit. She speaks to someone,
and YORITOMO appears. He is twenty-one, too young to be the woman's
husband. Yoritomo comes into Algren's room. Speaks to him.


Algren shakes his head. Doesn't understand


Yoritomo speaks to the woman, who approaches and places bowl of soup
in front of Algren. He ignores it

The boys stand in the doorwa y. Yoritomo shoos them awa y.


Algren glances up at the: woman. Her eyes avoid his, her expression is opaque.


INT.                      YORITOMO'S HOUSE                              ANOTHER DAY

Algren now sits in the main room. The woman is changing the dressing on
his wounded right shoulder and arm.

Yoritomo kneels across from Algren. He is impressed at the many battle
wounds on Algren's body; the old bullet wounds and scars. In Japanese, he
indicates his admiration.

Algren his no idea what Yoritomo is saying. Finally he interrupts with the
only Japanese word he has bothered to learn:

                                               ALGREN
                            Sake.

                                                                                 38.

Yoritomo's face breaks into a wide smile.

                                             YORITOMO
                           Sake?

                                             ALGREN
                           Sake.

Yoritomo glances to the woman. She nods, and brings A1gren a saucer of
sake. He drinks it down. Holds out the saucer for a refill

Smiling, Yoritomo indicates for the woman to comply, but before she can
pour another saucer, Algren takes the jug out of her other hand. Yoritomo
laughs as Algren drinks it down.

EXT.                       VILLAGE                               NIGHT

Autumn leaves fall to the ground. In a tiny hut, the village swordsmith begins
work on a samurai blade.

INT.                   YORITOMO'S HOUSE                        NIGHT

Algren writhes on his mat. Trapped in his recurrent nightmare.

A sudden flash:

The wagonload of the dead. Davey's bl oody corpse closes in on Algren
suffocating him.

Back in the house

Yoritomo and the woman are asleep in separate rooms.


A piercing SCREAM shatters the night


EXT.                 VILLAGE                        FOLLOWING

The screaming continues. Lamps are lit around the village...


INT.                YORITOMO'S HOUSE                   FOLLOWING

Yoritomo and the woman hurry to Algren's room --

Algren in the throes of his recurring nightmare - awakens, disoriented.


                                             ALGREN
                           Sake.

Yoritomo and the woman confer. Yoritomo looks It Algren and shakes his
head, no.

                                                                                      39.

                                              ALGREN
                           SAKE!

Yoritomo refuses -- Algren roars and tries to rise. Laughing at Algren's
ferocit y in his weakened condition, Yoritomo easily pushes him back down.

Algren folds in on himself, rocking like a feral animal.


EXT.                  YORITOMO'S HOUSE                              NIGHT

Katsumoto stands outside the house, drawn by the commotion. Ujio stands
with him, shaking his bead.

                                             UJIO
                                   (subtitles)

                           shamed in defeat, be should kill himse1f.

                           Then I will kill him.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                                   (pats him; subtitles)
                           Ujio-San, he will still be shamed tomorrow or in
                           a month. For now there are things I wish to learn.

EXT.                      VILLAGE                      DAY

A glimpse of village life -- fish are hung on lines to dry, children chase each
Other, clothes are washed in the river, and in the rice fields below, farmers
squat as they have for thousands of years. In his hut, the swordsmith
continues to hammer and fold the blade.

INT.                YORITOMO'S HOUSE                       NIGHT

Algren sits hunched in a dark corner. His body is convulsed with shivering.
His withdrawal from alcohol, his wounds, his isolation and his imagined sins
are devouring him.                                                                .

Then we see he is not alone. The woman stands in the doorway, watching
him closel y. Finally she enters with a bowl of soup.

He glances up, something like panic in his eyes.

She kneels and attempts to hand him the soup, but be knocks it out of the
wa y and grabs her by the throat.

                                                                                     40.
                                               ALGREN
                            Sake!

She stares at him, the breath being squeezed out of her, but there is not even
a whisper of fear in her eyes. She is utterly impassive. Shaken, he lets her
go, and crumples to the floor.                         .

                                             ALGREN
                                      (mumbling to himself)
                            Sake...

The woman leaves the soup and wa1ks away.


INT.                    YORITOMO'S HOUSE                           DAYS LATER

Daylight streams in, finding Algren lying on his back. The worst of the detox
is past. As be lies there, these first moments of repose lead to:

A sudden flash of memory:

The beautiful blond WOMAN from the picture laughs merrily, and falls
back languorousl y in a grassy fi eld.

Back in the room

Algren shakes off the memory as harsh SOUNDS from outside draw him to
the window.                  .

EXT.                    YORITOMO'S HOUSE                      MORNING

Algren watches from the window as the samurai train. It is like nothing else
in the world. Part sacred ritual, part martial preparation, samurai training
com bines athletic prowess and graceful artistry into one effortless whole.

Finally well enough to walk, Algren comes out onto the porch to watch the
spectacle. In front of him, is a Kendo (The Way of the Sword) master
practice with their long and short swords. They have incredible control.

NAKAO, a mountain of a man, is a Karate master. He stands unarmed,
four samurai facing him. They attack with wooden swords. He effortlessly
defeats them -- the agility of the huge man is shocking.

Kyudo ("The Way of the Bow") masters use their bows for target practice.
Yoritomo holds a bundle of arrows. In the distance, a line of plums.

Algren watches. Yoritomo just seems to stand there, his eyes hall-open.

And then -- in a stunning blaze of movement -- Yoritomo fires the arrows --
one after another, amazingly fast -- cleanly hitting each plum. The final arrow
splits the previous one as it buries itself in the tree.

A wooden sword leans against the porch.

Algren idly picks it up, feeling its balance. In a flash, Uji o has raced over and
grabbed it from him. Algren stands motionless as Ujio screams at him.

                                                                                  41.


The training stops, as everyone watches Uji o berate Algren.

Even as Ujio continues screaming. Algren simply shakes his head, turns
awa y, and walk back into the house.

INT.               YORITOMO'S HOUSE                         DAY

As the sounds of training resume outside, Algren explores the house.

He comes upon Higen and Toshiie playing with the red ball. They are
embarrassed to encounter him alone. There's a moment of suspension, and
then Higen throws the ball to Algren.

Algren looks back and forth between the two boys, fixes his gaze on Higen
but throw the ball to Toshiie, causing both boys to laugh and run awa y.

Algren walks on.

INT.                SMALL ROOM                           DAY


Algren opens a sliding shojii screen and discovers a small room that has been
made into a kind of shrine.

Cand1es and incense burn, a small Buddha sits on a dais, and Algren's eyes
are drawn to what seems like an apparition standing in the corner.

The BRIGHT RED ARMOR of the warrior Algren killed in the fog, is held
upright by an unseen stand. It is almost as if the dead warrior himself is
swing back at him.

Algren senses someone behind him and turns. The woman is standing across
the hall. Their eyes meet. She turn, and walks away.

EXT.               VILLAGE                            NIGHT

A first, light snowfall has covered the ground. A1gren walks out into the still
night. He turns a corner and confronts curious sight:

Ten warriors kneel, motionless in the snow, their eyes closed in concentration.

As Algren puzzles over this, he becomes aware that Katsumoto is now
standing next to him.

                                                   KATSUMOTO
                              They are training.

                                                   ALGREN
                              Training what?

                                                 KATSUMOTO
                              Their minds. It is called bushido...

                                                                                   42.

Algren looks at him. He has never heard the word.


                                           KATSUMOTO
                       The wa y of the warrior. We study from when
                       we are young. Are my words correct?

Algren does not respond.

                                              KATSUMOTO
                            I will practice my Eng1ish with you.

                                            ALGREN
                            Why do you learn English?

                                            KATSUMOTO
                            To know m y enemy.

                                             ALGREN
                            If I am your enemy, why have you not killed
                            me?

Katsumoto doesn't answer.

                                           ALGREN
                            Was General Yoshitaka your enemy?

                                             KATSUMOTO
                            No, I honor his memory as my kinsman.

                                            ALGREN
                            That why you helped him kill himself?

                                                KATSUMOTO
                            If a samurai is defeated in battle, he must take
                            his own life to spare himse1f the shame of capture.
                            It is required that his kaishaku his trusted friend,
                            help him. I was honored to by his kaishaku.

                                                ALGREN
                            Hell of an honor.

                                               KATSUMOTO
                            It was his destiny. He knew it, he died at peace.

                                            ALGREN
                            Who was the warrior in the red armor?

                                            KATSUMOTO
                            My son-in-law. His name was Hiroshi.

                                           ALGREN
                            And the woman who cares for me?

                                                                               43.
                                           KATSUMOTO
                           My daughter, Hiroshi's wife. Her name is Taka.

         Algren is incredulous.

                                             ALGREN
                           I killed her husband?

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           It was an honorable death.

Katsumoto walks awa y.


INT.             YORITOMO'S HOUSE                       DAY

Algren it now well enough to kneel at the table with the others. Taka treats
him with utter politeness and dignity. He watches her intently, seeking any
sign of the animosity he's certain she must feel.

She hands him a bowl of rice.

                                           ALGREN
                                  (smiling politely)
                           You hope I choke on it, don't you?

She bows, uncomprehending.

                                             ALGREN
                           You want to poison it and watch me fall over
                           the table and foam at the mouth.
Yoritomo bows in response to Algren's new willingness to communicate.

                                             YORITOMO
                                   (to Taka, subtitles)
                           I promise I'll make him take a bath.

                                             TAKA
                                   (subtitles)
                           Soon. Please.

.EXT.             VILLAGE -- BATHING TUB                            DAY

Yoritomo leads Algren to a large, wooden bathing tub in I secluded part of
the village. A banked fire smolders beneath it.

Embarrassed, Yoritomo indicates to Algren that be needs to bathe. Algren
strips off his filthy uniform then lowers himself into the steaming water.

Yoritomo begins taking off hit own kimono. A1gren is taken aback. Used to
Western privacy, he is a bit disquieted about bathing with another man.

Yoritomo, unconcerned, climbs into the tub. He chats pleasantly as they
bathe, showing off his old battle wounds.

                                                                                      44.
Algren's discomfort turns to outright alarm when a toothless old grandmother
appears. .She happily strips and joins them in the tub!

Algren sinks a little lower into the water. The old grandmother smiles at
him with her toothless grin.

EXT.            VILLAGE                          DAY

Algren. feeling self-conscious in the clean kimono he's wearing for the first
time, walks back with Yoritomo. Kids start walking with them, pointing at
his Japanese garb, laughing as he stumbles in his wooden clogs. They pass
by Ujio training a group of samurai using wooden kendo swords.

Nearby, Higen and Toshiie are imitating the grown-ups, sparring with wooden
swords that are much too big for them. Yoritomo watches his nephews proudly,
murmuring details of their prowess to Algren, who has no idea what he's talking
about.

Higen charges his little brother, but goes careening past, right toward Algren,
who deftl y dodges out of the wa y. This causes gales of laughter from the
boys, one of whom takes Toshiie's sword and offers it to Algren.

Algren looks at the sword in his hand and unthinkingly twirls if with a f1ourish --
causing the boys to applaud. Yoritomo bows, and encourages A1gren in
Higen's direction. Algren shakes his head politely, but Higen is already on
the attack.

Algren dodges one thrust, then parries another, as the boys begin to cheer.

Suddenly, ever yone goes silent. Algren turns.

Ujio is standing behind him, arms folded.

Ujio barks a command in Japanese. He wants Algren to drop the sword.
It is obvious to Algren what it must mean, but he does nothing.

Ujio approaches Algren slowl y. Algren holds the wooden sword casually,
only his eyes betraying the tension of the moment.

Ujio's wooden sword FLASHES, quicker than the eye can follow. Algren's
sword is knocked from his hands, then, somehow in the same fluid
movement, Ujio brings the sword around and cracks Algren across the
chest hard enough to knock the breath from his body and lend him to his
kneels.

Satisfied with himself, Uji o starts to walk away, but the expressions of the
bystanders cause him to turn back: .

Algren is standing again, and again holding the sword.

With grim purpose, Uji o returns to Algren, who has assumed a ready pose.

Again Ujio's SWORD FLASHES. Algren manages to parry one blow, before
he is cracked across the face, and blood begins to flow free1y from his nose.

                                                                                          45.
 Ujio knocks Algren's legs out from under him, and while Algren is sprawling
on the ground, Ujio kicks Algren's sword out of his hand, and starts away.

Again, Algren manages to stand up, and before Ujio can turn, charges him.

But Uji o doesn't need to turn. In a sliding move, he dodges and cracks Algren
in the side, then the legs, then the neck. Gasping for breath, at least one rib broken,
Algren writhes on the ground. Ujio digs the point of his sword into
Algren's hand until he releases his grip. Again Ujio kicks the sword away.

The ever-enlarging crowd gasps as Algren once again struggles to his feet.
This time without hesitation, Uji o runs back and rains blows upon Algren's
now defenseless body. First the wrist, then the back, then the stomach, then
finally the head.

Algren hits the ground, unconscious, his fingers still clutching the sword.
Ujio reaches down, pries it from his fingers, and breaks it across his knee.

INT.              YORITOMO'S HOUSE                                   EVENING

Algren lies painfully on a mat, his eyes unfocused.


A sudden flash of memory:

The lovel y blond woman, tears in her eyes, looks up to Algren's shining face,
the epaulets on his crisp officer's, uniform gleaming gold in the sun.

The reverie is broken.

As Taka kneels to swab the cuts on his face. He stares at her darkly.

                                            ALGREN
                         Who are you people anywa y?

She makes no attempt to understand or respond.

                                               ALGREN
                         You have no God, you have no mercy, you don't
                         even have any fucking walls. Your walls are
                         made of paper, what's the matter with you?

She pushes his head aside so she can attend to his neck.

                                                 ALGREN
                         This man tries to kill me and I've done nothing
                         to him, and you, I kill your husband and you act
                         like, what? Like I'm a guest in your house.
                         What is wrong with you?

This last said so intensely that she glances at him before picking up a bowl
of soup she had brought for him, and bringing it to his lips...

                                               ALGREN
                         Do you have a soul at all?

                                                                                  46.

He stares at her for a moment, then knocks the soup out of her blinds.

Her eyes FLASH for one moment, before resuming their usual mildness.
But that flash is enough to satisfy him, and he calms down. She walks away.
He sighs, exhausted, only to see her approach again with a new bowl. Their
eyes meet, and hold for a moment. She does have a soul. He takes a sip.

INT.                 SHINTO SHRINE                        DAY

Algren is led past baldheaded monks into an ancient shrine. Katsumoto
kneels before a small altar. He doesn't seem aware that Algren is present.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           Ujio is teaching you the wa y of the Japanese sword.

                                              ALGREN
                           Is that what he's doing?

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           At what age did you become I soldier?

                                              ALGREN
                           Nineteen.

                                             KA TSUMOTO
                           To fight in your American civil war.

                                              ALGREN
                           Yes.

                                             KA TSUMOTO
                           Tell me about that war'.

                                              ALGREN
                           What about it?

                                              KATSUMOTO
                           Everything.

                                            ALGREN
                           Everything about the civil war?


Katsumoto sits impassively, staring at the altar.

                                            ALGREN
                           That would take a year.

                                           KATSUMOTO
                           You have pressing business elsewhere?

Shaking his head, Algren sits down.

                                                                                             47.


                                              ALGREN
                           The civil war began on April 12. 1861 when the
                           rebs attacked Fort Sumter. Well, actually, it
                           probabl y began three years earlier when the
                           Supreme Court decided a runaway slave had to
                           be returned to his master

                                                                               DISOLVE TO:

The TWO OF THEM, hours later--

                                              ALGREN
                           --and Pickett says he wants to do it, over
                           Longstreet's objections and Lee doesn't know
                           what to think, but he lets him. So 15,000 men
                           go up that hill. And most of them die.

                                                KATSUMOTO
                           Was that wise?

                                                ALGREN
                           No, it was stupid.

                                                KATSUMOTO
                           Why?

                                             ALGREN
                           The point of a battle is to win, or at least have
                           enough men survive to fight another day.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           You did not try to survive when we took you
                           prisoner.

Algren eyes him, frustrated.

                                          ALGREN
                           What do you want from me?

                                          KATSUMOTO
                           What do you want for yourself?

                                           ALGREN
                           You know they're not going to ransom me.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           We have little use for money.

                                                                                   48.
                                              ALGREN
                                     (mounting fury)
                            Then what are you doing, why are you asking me
                            these questions, what is going on here?

                                               KATSUMOTO
                            The snows will melt in May, and the passes will
                            open, and the events of the world will unfold.
                            Until that time, you are here.
                                     (smiles)
                            I enjoyed this conversation in your English. I
                            hope you will honor me with more tomorrow.

Katsumoto stands, bows, and leaves.


INT.                  YORITOMO'S HOUSE                             DAY

Young Toshiie sits near Algren. He labors over a scroll with a brush, the
gentle brush strokes are hypnotic as they sweep across the rice paper.

Algren tries to indicate that he would like pen and paper for himself. Toshiie
gives him what he asks. Algren begins to write:

                                              ALGREN (V.O.)
                       Day unknown, month unknown, 1876. I continue
                       to live among these strange people.

EXT.                        VILLAGE                            DAY

Katsumoto watches Ujio bark orders to the men he is training. A sudden
Movement of their eyes, causes Uji o to stop. He turns to find:

Algren standing at the end of the line, holding I wooden sword.

An almost imperceptible look passes bet ween Ujio and Katsumoto, but Ujio's
Resentment is over-ruled. Without a word, he continues.


Algren does his best to follow the exercise.


Katsumoto, the slightest hint of a smile on his face, walks away.

                                              ALGREN (V.O.)
                            Each day I am confounded by their strange customs
                            and contradictions, savagery followed by
                            mildness.

INT.            YORITOMO'S HOUSE                          NIGHT

Algren now kneels at the table with the rest of the family as they eat. He is
in considerable pain from the rigors of training. He tries to roll the stiffness
out of his neck, when be notices that Higen it imitating him. Toshiie laughs.

                                                                                                     49.
                                               ALGREN (V.O.)
                            They seem to value nothing more than their
                            families, and yet they kill defenseless wounded
                            men without a shade of remorse..

Yoritomo sternly tells Higen not to make fun of their guest. Yoritomo
apologizes to Algren, who shakes his head unnecessary.

                                               ALGREN
.                           Raisu? [Rice?]

They stop, shocked. He has spoken!

Yoritomo calls for Taka to serve him more rice, then begins yammering
enthusiastically in Japanese. Algren holds up his hand.

                                              ALGREN
                            Not so fast Ko...toba? [Words?]
                                     (bolds up chopsticks)
                            What is this?

                                               YORITOMO
                            Hashi.

                                               ALGREN
                            Hashi.

Yoritomo is hysterical with glee now.

                                               YORITOMO
                            Hail!

The boys are suddenly dervishes, pulling various objects from the table and around the room, shouting the
Japanese words for each.

Algren shakes his head, and smiles for the first time in this stor y.

Yoritomo manages to quiet the boys. He points to himself.

                                               YORITOMO
                            Yoritomo.

                                                ALGREN
                                      (points to himself)
                            Algren.

                                               YORITOMO
                            All-gren.
Algren nods, and the boys start screaming "All-gren!"

                                              YORITOMO
                                    (points to each in rum)
                            Higen. Toshiie. Taka.

                                                                               50.

                                            ALGREN
                                  (bowing)
                          Higen. Toshiie.
                                  (turns to Taka)
                          Taka.
She meets his eyes for the slightest moment, then looks down and walks away.


INT.              KATSUMOTO'S HOUSE                            NIGHT

Katsumoto is arranging flowers. Algren watches in confusion, as this
powerful lord goes about doing something so feminine and delicate. Finally:

                                           KATSUMOTO
                          The parliament of your country has two houses.
                          Why is that?

                                           ALGREN
                          To keep either one from being too powerful.

                                           KATSUMOTO
                          Does not a people need a powerful ruler to
                          protect them?

                                           ALGREN
                          We believe the opposite.

Katsumoto thinks about this.

                                             ALGREN
                          I have a question. How do you come to speak
                          English?

                                               KATSUMOTO
                          Members of the Council were required to study
............              it. ........Yes, I was a member of the government.
                          I helped restore the Emperor to the throne.

                                            ALGREN
                          So that Japan could have a powerful ruler to
                          protect it.

Katsumoto understands Algren's irony, but doesn't smile.


                                         ALGREN
                          And now you must hate him for what he's done.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                          He is my blood. I serve him with my life.

                                            ALGREN
                          By fighting his army?

Katsumoto looks at A1gren.

                                                                                                             51.

                                              KATSUMOTO
                           I do not fight the emperor. I fight those who
                           seek to influence him, those who betray the soul
                           of my country.

He slowl y draws his long samurai sword, and places it next to the flowers on the table in front of him.

                                              KA TSUMOTO
                           The Emperor gave this blade to my ancestors
                           400 years ago. It has been used only to defend his
                           sacred honor.

Katsumoto hands the sword to Algren. Algren studies it.

                                             KATSMUOTO
                           It takes many years to make a sword. It is a holy
                           Act. A samurai's sword is his soul.

                                             ALGREN
                           This sword is flawed. What is this uneven line
                           near the edge?

Katsumoto smiles at Algren's ignorance.

                                              KATSUMOTO
                           One man is flexible and compromises too much
                           to avoid conflict. Another man is so fierce he
                           wins ever y battle, but so rigid he can never know
                           peace. A man who knows both is the perfect
                           warrior. The lame is true of a blade .. one steel
                           bends, and the other cuts. And where they
                           meet is never perfect Hold the blade up. .

Algren holds the sword, cutting edge up. Katsumoto takes a silk cloth and drops it. It gently billows down -- and
splits evenly on the edge.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           Some believe a blade is thirsty until it tastes the
                           blood of its enemy.

Algren hands the sword back. Suddenly, Katsumoto swings the sword, cleanly splitting the table in two.
Silence.

                                           ALGREN
                           The crew at Winchester can produce one rifle ever y
                           seven minutes.

                                            KA TSUMOTO
                           We gave up firearms two hundred years ago. It
                           takes no courage to kill. A man from half a mile
                           awa y. You must look into the eyes of your enemy
                           to know who you have killed.

                                                                                                       52.
                                             ALGREN
                          I'm not sure an artillery officer would agree.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                          Do you?

                                              ALGREN
                          I think all killing's a filthy business.

                                              KATSUMO
                          TO Taking a man's life is
                          nothing. It is his honor you
                          can never take awa y.

                                           ALGREN
                          In other words you have no respect for human life.

                                              KA TSUMOTO
                                   (fierce) .
                          What do you know of human life? You come here to kill for
                          money Where is your family? Where is your wife, your sons?
                          What is your legacy?

                                             ALGREN
                                   (undaunted)
                          And what is yours? To rebel against the future? I fought the
                          South in our civil war. Their leaders believed they were fighting
                          for "honor" just as you do. And their people died by the thousands!

Katsumoto simply looks at him.

                                           ALGREN
                          And my wife is dead.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                          Mine, too.


They look at each other. Some unexpected recognition has taken place.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                          Tomorrow we will discuss your country's wish for
                          dominance in the..."Far East."

                                             ALGREN
                          ...I look forward to it.


Algren turns to go.


EXT.VILLAGE SQUARE DAY

We see the village swordsmith at work. He has been forging the same long samurai blade for months... Algren
watches him as he works.

                                                                                                               53.
                                            ALGREN (V.O.)
                          March 9. 1877. I have never known such a disciplined
                          people.

EXT. VILLAGE DAY

Algren trains with the other men. He attempts an attack, which is easily brushed aside by Nakao. Algren ends
up in the dirt again.

                                             ALGREN (V.O.)
                          From the moment they wake, they devote themselves
                          to the perfection of whatever they pursue--

EXT. VILLAGEDAY


Algren walking with Katsumoto -- they are deep in conversation.

                                           ALGREN (V.O.)
                          And yet the more time I spend here, the less I understand them.

EXT.               VILLAGE                      DAY
Two women are bowing repeatedly, chattering in smiling, earnest argument.

                                            ALGREN (V.O.)
                          Everyone is polite, every nuance of behavior seems to
                          have a great meaning, and increasingly I am convinced
                          that the lower they bow, the leas they mean it.

EXT.              YORITOMO'S                         HOUSE

Algren, holding the wooden sword in 1870'5 baseball manner, is coaxing Higen to throw the ball at him. The
children laugh as Algren hits it onto the next porch.

Taka watches her sons impassively. It is dear how much they like Algren.

                                           ALGREN (V.O.)
                          And I am sure they regard my wa ys to be as confounding
                          and unfathomable as I find theirs.

AN ICE CRYSTAL ON THE END OF A BRANCH


Starts to drip. SPRING bas begun.

BXT.                 VILLAGE                         DAY

Villagers laugh as they go about the business of life. A man throws a sack of rice to another. Two women hurry
awa y from a farmer who is teasing them.

Algren is once again among the training warriors. He and another man face off, each waiting for the other to
attack with his wooden sword.

                                                                                                                54.
Algren moves first, but his opponent counters, and strikes him easily. They wheel around and engage again,
and again Algren is bested. Furious, he throws himself at his opponent, reverting to classic saber technique.

In a flurry of movement, his opponent manages to deflect the blows and also knock Algren to his knees.
Yoritomo approaches and bows.

                                            YORITOMO
                           A1gren -San. Please forgive. Too many mind.

                                             ALGREN
                           What?

                                           YORITOMO
                                  (pointing as he explains)
                           Mind sword, mind face, mind people watch, too many mind.
                                  (on Algren's confused expression)
                           No mind.

                                             ALGREN
                           No mind?

                                           YORITOMO
                           Hai! No mind. You try.

Algren nods, uncertainly, and picks himself up. Again he faces the opponent, shaking off the tension and trying
to stay calm.

This time the opponent charges first, and Algren manages to parry one blow, before he is again bested.

Yoritomo bows happily and begins yammering in Japanese, clearly taking credit for Algren's progress.

Across the square, Katsumoto watches.


EXT.                     IMPERIAL PALACE GARDEN                                   DAY

The cherry blossoms have emerged, creating a scene of intense col or, beauty,
and serenity. The Emperor sits cross-legged next to a shrine. He is approached by Omura and two other
advisors.                                                                        .

                                             OMURA
                           Your majest y, beg permission to approach.
                                    (the Emperor nods)
                           Your humble servants are most anxious to know if his
                           Majest y has signed the order regarding the railroad progress.

                                               EMPEROR
                                   (after a long moment)
                           I am most impressed at the wa y the blossoms float
                           upon the air, as if held by unseen hands.

                                             OMURA
                           Yes, they represent the highest form of gyoko.
                           About the order, your Majest y.

                                                                                                                 55.
                                              EMPEROR
                            This railroad must go through Yoshino Province?

                                               OMURA
                            It is absolutely necessar y your Highness.

                                                EMPEROR
                            If you sa y so, I shall sign.

EXT.                                VILLAGE                          DAY

Algren walks through the village, past the swordsmith who is now honing the blade, carefully sharpening it.

.EXT.                    CHERRY TREE FOREST                              DAY

Algren makes his way through a stunning cherry forest near the village. The pink and red blossoms are dazzling
and abundant. Other villagers can be seen gathering cherry bl ossoms.

It is a place of otherworldly beaut y.

It is all so beautiful that Algren just stops. Takes it in for a moment. He reaches out and touches a blossom.

                                             KATSUMOTO (O.S.)
                            A perfect blossom is a rare thing...

Algren turns. Katsumoto is kneeling nearby, meditating.

                                             KA TSUMOTO
                            You could spend your life looking for one.
                            And it would not be a wasted life.

                                            ALGREN
                            Were you praying?

                                                KATSUMOTO
                            Just sitting... I do not think I have the word.
                            Satori it means, maybe, awareness.

                                               ALGREN
                            Of what?

                                              KATSUMOTO
                            This moment alone, apart from all others ... You
                            know this?
                                     (Algren shakes his head)
                            I am writing a poem about this time we hive spent.
                            I have only written one line on "His eyes were like my
                            own but seen through a deep and troubled ocean."
                            Can you suggest a second line?

                                             ALGREN
                            I'm not much of a writer.

                                              KA TSUMOTO
                            Is this why you spend so much time with your journal?

                                                                                     56.

                        .                     ALGREN
                             How do you know that?
                                      (no answer)
                             She told you.

Katsumoto appraises Algren.

                                              ALGREN
                             Did you love her husband as your own son?

                                             KA TSUMOTO
                             You have sent men to their deaths, just as I have.

                                                ALGREN
                             The difference is, you feel nothing.

                                              KA TSUMOTO
                             Before you were a soldier, you were a farmer.

                                              ALGREN
                             What does that have to do with anything?

                                               KA TSUMOTO
                             You lived on a farm. Or in a forest of trees.

                                            ALGREN
                             How do you know?

                                              KA TSUMOTO
                             The wa y you look at the cherry blossoms.

                                               ALGREN
                                      (reluctantly)
                             We lived in a place called Connecticut. My...brother
                             and I climbed the maple trees.

                                              KA TSUMOTO
                             Were they beautiful?

                                               ALGREN
                             Yes.


                                              KATSUMOTO
                            And you were sad to see them die in the winter.

A beat. Something flickers in Algren's eyes.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                             You were something before you were a soldier. You
                             were a boy who was sad to see the leaves fall and the
                             trees die.

Katsumoto looks at him deepl y.

                                                                                              57.
                                                KA TSUMOTO
                             Like those trees, we are all dying. The future is
                             an illusion, our plans are an illusion, our fears an illusion.
                             We live life in every breath. Eat, drink, fuck. Now. Every cup
                             of tea. Every word we write... Every blossom we hold.

He smiles sadly.


                                               KA TSUMOTO
                             Every life we take.

A beat. He stands, takes in the beautiful cherry orchard.


                                               KATSUMOTO
                             Life in every breath. That is bushido. The wa y of the
                             samurai.

He goes. Algren stands for a moment deep in thought

INT.                      YORITOMO'S HOUSE                               NIGHT

Algren is asleep. And then we note that the ground is vibrating .. he slides
across his mat .- wakes with a start

An unholy rumbling-

Algren bolts up ... just as a paper wall rips open, the wooden framework to the room splits
and the roof collapses--

An earthquake. Common for this part of Japan.

EXT.                     VILLAGE                            NIGHT

Yoritomo appears. He and Algren crawl out of the house just as the ground lurches
violently-

Part of the house contorts and caves in

Around the village, the wooden frame houses are swa ying and lurching they have some
torque, but not enough

Ujio directs the villagers as they battle a fire-

Taka appears, calling frantically for Toshiie.

Then an even larger seismic tremor suddenly TEARS THROUGH THE
VILLAGE

Houses are ripped apart -- the whole world shifting.

Though the smoke, Algren sees Toshiie cowering under an eave

                                                                                               58.

A heavy ceiling beam breaks loose, threatens to crush Toshiie

Algren dives forward, grabs Toshiie and pulls him out of the wa y... the front
of the house collapses, the beams smashing to the ground..

Taka and Higen race to Algren and Toshiie. The boy is safe.

Taka grabs the child and cradles him. Her look to Algren is fierce, protective,
almost feral -- as if he were the threat instead of the rescuer.

EXT.                       VILLAGE                               DAY

Algren watches the villagers rebuild. Yoritomo and Higen strugg1e with a large
wooden framework.

                                                   ALGREN (V.O.)
                            I am str    uck by these people and their acceptance of Fate
                            in a1l it   s variations. At a time like this, they seem utterly
                            without      sentiment. Even the children have a gravity
                            beyond      their years.

Algren goes to them. Silently begins to help them.


INT.                 YORITOMO'S HOUSE                                    DAYS LATER

Algren works with Yoritomo, binding the wooden framework. Higen prepares
the paper walls nearby. He does this with considerable skill.

Taka is getting water from a rain barrel she observes Algren helping
rebuild her home. Yoritomo is working nearby.
Algren's Japanese is rough but improving:

                                             ALGREN
                                    (in Japanese, subtitles)
                            Would last longer ... if stone.

                                             YORITOMO
                                   (subtitles)
                            No. House fall. House go back easy with wood.

Algren shakes his head. Taka appears with cups of water. Algren looks at her
For the first rime, she holds his gaze.


EXT.                  YORITOMO'S HOUSE                               EVENING

Torches illuminate a small stage in the center of the village square. Several
samurai perform a ritualistic Noh drama. (A form which, by the wa y, the
samurai invented.) Others play flutes and large steel drums.

                                               ALGREN (V.O.)
                            And yet I have never seen a people with more capacity
                            for the joy found in the simplest things of life.

                                                                                                59.

Katsumoto himself plays the lead role. An enthusiastic actor, he plays to the children in
the audience. They are delighted with his broad theatrics.

INT. YORITOMO'S HOUSE

Taka is carrying in a huge lack of rice. Algren goes to help her.

                                               TAKA
                                     (subtitles)
                             No, please.

                                                    ALGREN
                                        (insistent)
                            Hai.
He carries the rice for her into the pantry area.

                                              TAKA
                                    (subtitles)
                            Japanese men do not help with this.

                                                  ALGREN
                                        (subtitles)
                            I know.

She looks at him, a little surprised.

                                               ALGREN
                                     (subtitles)
                            I am not Japanese.

In spite of herself, she smiles a little. There is an awkward moment.


                                                ALGREN
                                      (subtitles)
                            1... didn't know he was your husband.

                                              TAKA
                                    (struck; subtitles)
                            He did his duty. You did your duty.

                                              ALGREN
                                    (subtitles)
                            And you do yours.

                                                    TAKA
                                        (softl y)
                            Hai.

They look at each other for a long moment. She starts to move, but he stops
her. They are close enough to smell each other's hair, to feel the warmth of
the other's breath. She looks up at him, pleading with her eyes not to take this any further.

                                                                                                  60.

He lets her go.

EXT.                 VILLAGE                   DAY

Algren stands across from Ujio, ready again for the ken-jutso.

They stand frozen for a long time, hands on the hilts of their wooden swords.
Other samurai watch.

Algren and Ujio stare at each other.

But there is something different about Algren's expression. Not as much
fury and competition, more a sense of balance and alertness. He studies Ujio's eyes, his hands,
the folds of his kimono, the attitude of his body.

We watch A1gren closel y.

Gradually all SOUND drains away. We hear only Algren's steady breathing. He is
aware of everything. A bird in a tree. A woman grinding rice. A plum about to fall.
A gently swa ying battle flag,

Slow-motion as:

Algren attacks -- no fury, just control-- Ujio tries to deflect the blow, Algren
anticipates - he swings his sword elegantly - -Ujio blocks it -- Algren counters --

Algren presses forward, his sword slashing masterfully, forcing Ujio back
Ujio counters with complex moves as he retreats --Algren keeps moving
forward, calm -- finally Ujio's sword is swept aside in one clean
movement. Algren ends with the edge of his wooden sword It Ujio's throat.

The other samurai watch. Amazed.

Algren twirls his sword in a fancy cavalry "fl ourish." The pride he has alwa ys taken in his
swordsmanship has been restored. He bows to Uji o.

Ujio nods his head, slightly, in respect


The other samurai, led by the hearty Nakao, congratulate Algren.

EXT. MEADOW                            DAY

Algren carries water from the river through a riot of spring wild-flowers. Something
makes him stop, and see the sunlit clouds in the deep blue sky, the colors around him, hear the
buzzing of the bees, feel the kill of the air.

A sudden flash of memory

His beautiful wife, in green field not unlike this one, laughing, tossing her hair, falling
back into the long grass.

Back to Algren

                                                                                                  61.

The force of the memory causes him to link to the ground.

Another flash of memory, longer this time:

His wi fe leans over and kisses his mouth, and his cheek, and his forehead. He holds
her al tightly as be can.

Back to Algren

As tears begin to course down his face, and he sinks down into the flowers and the grass,
looking up into the impossibl y beautiful sky. He gives in to the sobs wracking his body.

EXT.          VILLAGE                              DAY

As Algren returns with the water, he sees Katsumoto approaching with Ujio and several warriors.

                                           KATSUMOTO
                           The Emperor has requested my presence.
                           We leave tomorrow. You will be released in Tokyo.

He goes. Algren stands, not sure how to react.

INT.             YORITOMO'S HOUSE                         NIGHT

Algren writes on parchment by the light of an oil lamp.

                                             ALGREN (V.O.)
                           April 13, 1877. Tomorrow we return to
                           civilization. As eager as I am to be among my
                           own kind, I confess to a curious reluctance.

EXT.         KATDUMOTO'S VILLAGE                     DAWN

Algren stands overlooking the village as the sun rises over the misty peaks.

                                           ALGREN (V.O.)
                           These months have marked me, and I don't fully
                           know yet wh y.

EXT.                 YORITOMO'S HOUSE                     DAY

Algren prepares to mount up. Yoritomo says goodbye to his family.

                                              ALGREN (V.O.)
                           I do know it is here that I have known my first
                           untroubled sleep in many years.

Taka comes to Algren, bows her head.

                                             TAKA
                                   (subtitles)
                           You are alwa ys welcome in our home.

                                             ALGREN
                           Domo Arrigato.

He glances at the unfinished house.

                                                                                        62.
                                              ALGREN
                                   (subtitles)
                           ...You will finish it soon.

                                                TAKA
                                      (subtitles)
                           If that is my destiny.

She bows her head again. Toshiie hands him a scroll: it is a picture of the
Family. Algren is included. Japanese characters list all their names.

Toshiie bows. Algren bows and tucks the scroll into his coat.

Algren and Yoritomo move out with Katsumoto, Ujio, Nakao and his bodyguard of several
dozen Samurai.

The villagers bow and honor the warrior as they pass.


EXT.                    MOUNTAINOUS LANDSCAPE                             DAY


Algren trots alongside Katsumoto.

                                             ALGREN
                           ... The Emperor sends a message for you to return
                           to Tokyo, and you go?

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           Yes.

                                            ALGREN
                           Even though you're in rebellion against him.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           Against the Emperor? Never. I serve him. As
                           I have alwa ys done.    .

                                             ALGREN
                           I don't understand.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           Our Emperor is young, and there are things I must
                           sa y to him.

                                             ALGREN
                           But ever yone around him wants you dead.

                                           KA TSUMOTO
                           And if the Emperor desires, I will take my own life at his
                           command.

He spurs his horse and rides on. A1gren watches him.

                                                                                                       63.
EXT.         MOUNTAIN VALLEY                               SUNSET

They approach a large inn.

A boy working in the fields see Katsumoto approaching. He doesn't believe
it -- the Great Katsumoto. He drops his hoe and races awa y, calling out.

                                              KATSUMOTO
                             We will stop here for the night.

EXT.                      MOUNTAIN VALLEY                              SUNSET

Samurai guards have been posted around the perimeter.


INT.         KATSUMOTO'S RQOM                              NIGHT

Algren is escorted in. Katsumoto kneels at a table. Preparing the traditional Japanese tea ceremony.

                                                KATSUMOTO
                             Sit, Captain.

Algren sits. By now he has learned how to sit on the ground. Katsumoto begins the exacting, delicate and
precise tea ceremony.

                                              KATSUMOTO
                             Do you drink tea?

                                                  ALGREN
                             I've had little else for some time...

Katsumoto continues with the tea ceremony.

                                            ALGREN
                             How's your poem coming?

                                              KATSUMOTO
                             I am having trouble. The truth is I am not a very
                             good poet.
                                     (Algren smiles)
                             Do you know wh y you were sent here? To
                             Yoshino.

                                                ALGREN
                             To protect the railroad.

                .                              KATSUMOTO
                             Why is the railroad here?

                                             ALGREN
                             So Tokyo can control the whole country.

                                                                                                       64.
                                           KATSUMOTO
                           You have seen my province. All mountains.
                           Far from Tokyo. Yet the rail line must come
                           here?

Katsumoto tosses a tiny bit of coal on the simmering brazier on the table. Algren watches carefully.

                                           ALGREN
                           You have something they want

                                           KATSUMOTO
                           What do they want in my mountains?

                                                ALGREN
                           Minerals ... Gold.

                                                KA TSUMOTO
                                    (smiles)
                           There is no gold in Japan.

Katsumoto gently blows on the coal brazier. The coal flares a bit.

                                                ALGREN
                           Coal?
                                    (Katsumoto looks at him)
                           For steamships.

                                          KA TSUMOTO
                           And why would steamships be so important?

                                                ALGREN
                           ...China.

Katsumoto looks up at him. Impressed.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           Japan has nothing. China has ever ything.

                                              ALGREN
                           Mine the coal to create a way station for the trip to
                           China ... Freeze the Europeans out and Japan and
                           America have a monopol y on the China trade.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           Add to this the Omura Zaibatsu. You know the
                           Zaibatus?

                                           ALGREN
                           The wealthy families.

                                                                                                       65.


                                              KATSUMOTO
                           As patron of the railroad, Omura owns all land within
                            four hundred feet of ever y new rail line. As my country
                           grows, so will his wealth.
                                    (looks at him)
                           This is why you are fighting.

Katsumoto completes the tea ceremony. He pours a cup for Algren. Bows his head and offers it to him.

                                              ALGREN
                           And you will tell the emperor to stop them?

                                              KATSUMOTO
                           I do not tell the emperor what to do.

                                           ALGREN
                           Then what do you hope to accomplish?

Katsumoto looks at Algren, the slightest gleam in his eye.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           Will you return to America?

Algren watches him -- why didn't Katsumoto answer?

                                              ALGREN
                           ...I have a job here.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           You should return to your home.

                                             ALGREN
                           Why?

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           Because I do not wish you to be m y enemy again.

Katsumoto returns to his poem, he does not look up.

                                           KATSUMOTO
                           Go home Captain ... Anshinritsumai. I wish you peace.

Algren waits but Katsumoto just continues to work on his poem.

EXT.                      AROUND THE INN                                 NIGHT

The samurai guards are alert, their senses heightened to almost superhuman proportions.

But there is another way. Another way of learning combat. A wa y without the
beaut y, the philosophy and the moral code.

They are almost imperceptible at first... their head-to-toe black clothes a perfect
camouflage... their silence and stealth are otherworldly.

                                                                                                     66.

They were then known as Shinobi, masters of stealth and spying.

We know them as Ninjas.

They float across the ground ... creeping an inch ever y hour... complete
physica1 control. One black-gloved finger moves. Then the next...

They crawl and then wait


Poised on their fingertips and toes.

There is no sound as they strike.

The samurai guards are garroted in an instant. Other Ninjas catch the
samurai's weapons as they fall. No sound disturbs the peaceful night.

EXT.                  INN -- FRONT DOORWAY                                  NIGHT

Silence.

Two samurai guards are in position.

One of them glances up at the stars.

A Ninja throwing star instantly slices into his jugular-- blood sprays -- the other
guard turns ­ a series of Ninja slice into him...

EXT.                    INN--WALLS                                  NIGHT

Silence.

The Ninjas use mew claws to crawl up the walls like spiders.

EXT.               INN ­ ROOF                               NIGHT

Silence.

A samurai guard stands at the edge of the roof. A Ninja silently moves
toward him. Stops. Ten feet awa y.

He pulls out a shuriken -- a small needle-shaped projectile, dips it into a sack of
poison. Places it carefully into the palm of his hand. And with the flick of his
wrist--

The needle flies -- stabbing into the samurai -- he crumples.

Other Ninjas immediately pour over the edge of the roof -- catching the samurai before he falls...

INT.                          INN -- KATSUMOTO'S ROOM                         NIGHT

Silence.

                                                                                                        67.
Katsumoto cannot sleep. He stares out the window at a nightingale.


INT.                       INN--UJIO'S ROOM                   NIGHT

Silence.

Ujio sits in his room. He is unblinking. Alert. Swords at the ready.

INT.                           INN ­ ALGREN'S ROOM                       NIGHT

Silence.
Algren cannot sleep either. He sits leaning against a wall. Thinking.

INT.                       INN -- MAIN HALL                     NIGHT

Silence.

Yoritomo drinks tea with Nakao, the huge martial arts master.


INT.                         OUTSIDE KATSUMOTO'S ROOM                         NIGHT

A guard stands sentinel. Above his head, unbeknownst to him, two Ninjas descend on ropes.
One of them swings a long chain - to which I barbed-knife is attached.

As it lodges in the guard's chest, the second Ninja swings down just in time to catch the dead guard,
silently, before his body hits the ground.

INT.                          INN -- KATSUMQTO'S ROOM                      NIGHT

Silence.

Katsumoto lies in bed listening to the night bird. It stops singing. Katsumoto smiles sadly. He
decides to give up on sleep, leans forward to rise.

This act saves his life.


For when the Ninjas come, they come all at once--

A Ninja suddenly comes TEARING STRAIGHT THROUGH THE PAPER WALL, his sword
slashing down .- just missing Katsumoto.

Katsumoto calls out an alarm, diving and rolling across the floor for his sword. He instantly
kills one Ninja using his steel-tipped "war fan" to slash his attackers throat. Another smashes
in through the window.

INT.                  INN -- MAIN H ALL                      NIGHT

Ninjas EXPLODE into the main hall. Samurai who come out of their rooms are cut down by a
variety of weapons -- one takes a throwing star in the face, others are felled by the traditional
ninja-to, short swords ideal for fighting in confined spaces, chain-knives, nun-chaka and others.

                                                                                                         68.
More Ninjas drop from the rafters on ropes.


INT.                          INN -- ALGREN'S ROOM                              NIGHT

A Ninja SMASHES through the paper wall -- Algren grabs the nearest object, a low tea table.
and swings it at his head. The Ninja dodges the blow and slices at Algren with short-sword.

Algren barely avoids the blow by ducking behind a post as the sword LODGES
deep in the wood. Algren flings himself, bodily, at his attacker.

INT.                      INN-- MAIN HALL                           NIGHT

Ninja throwing stars spin across the room, killing a samurai.

Yoritomo emerges from his room, readying his bow, but the dead samurai falls back
blocking his wa y. From behind the rice wall, Yoritomo lets fly an arrow without even
looking.

It passes THROUGH the wall, killing the Ninja on the opposite balcony.


INT.                         INN-- FIRST FLOOR                    NIGHT

Ujio screams a war cry and begins to battle his way up the stairs. With breathtaking moves, he slashes
hands and limbs, forcing the Ninja back.

Nakao fights his wa y up beside him, desperately trying to reach Katsumoto's room. Using
only his bare hands he catches a Ninja's wrist and hurls him over the railing.

INT.                         INN -- ALGREN'S ROOM                      NIGHT

Algren and the Ninja are in a death struggle, kneeing, gouging, butting. They awkwardly smash
through a paper wall into the next room.

INT.                     INN -- KATSUMOTO'S ROOM                      NIGHT

Katsumoto wields his long sword in one hand and his short sword in the other. It is the first time
we have seen him in action and his movements are both beautiful and deadly.

But more Ninjas are pouring in through the window, threatening to overwhelm him.

INT.                            INN -- ALGREN'S ROOM                    NIGHT

Rolling on the ground, Algren manages to grab a chopstick and STAB his adversary through the eye.
He picks up the fallen short sword and steps out into the hall.

ARROWS whiz past, thudding into the wall beside his head.

INT.                     INN-- KATSUMOTO'S ROOM                          NIGHT

Katsumoto, breathing heavily, his kimono shredded and bloody, is fending off the Ninjas' increasingly
savage attacks as Algren enters.

Algren SCREAMS, distracting them just long enough for Katsumoto to take advantage and kill one.

                                                                                                               69.
Then, just as a Ninja it about to kill Algren, Katsumoto FLINGS his short sword ... it pin-wheels across the
room, hitting Algren's attacker in the chest.

Without missing a beat, Algren pulls the short sword from the dying Ninja's chest and uses it to stab
another Ninja who, thinking Algren defenseless, has launched an attack.

INT.                         INN -- MAIN HALL                       NIGHT

Ujio and Nakao are back to back, a perfect fighting machine as they fight their wa y to
Katsumoto's rescue. They battle Ninjas wielding lethal kusarigamas, the Ninjas swing chains,
the attached blades slice the air--Nakao catches the chains and flinging the Ninja
over the balcony.

INT.               YORITOMO'S ROOM                           NIGHT

Yoritomo is pinned down. Darts and throwing stars shred the rice paper wall above him. He
picks off another Ninja before changing his position.

INT.                   INN-- KATSUMOTO'S ROOM                          NIGHT

The blazing sword battle continues.

Algren throws a beautiful painted standing-screen in front of an attacking Ninja,
momentarily confusing him. Then he stabs THROUGH THE SCREEN -as a blood-
stain SPREADS across the pastoral painting.

But another Ninja catches Algren off-guard and slices at him with his short sword. As
Algren lifts his sword to parry the blow, HIS LITILE FINGER IS CHOPPED OFF.

He drops the sword, momentarily defenseless.

Across the hallway

Yoritomo has been watching the shadowpla y on the rice-paper walls.
Algren's attacker raises his blade to deliver the death blow.

In Katsumoto's room

Algren flinches involuntarily beneath the raised blade. Suddenly the Ninja JACKKNIFES
as if punched by an unseen hand. As he spins, dead, to the ground, we SEE an ARROW
lodged bet ween his shoulder blades. Yoritomo has FIRED blindly, through the wall ­
killing Algren's attacker.

Nearby, a Ninja hurls a throwing star at Katsumoto. With blind instinct Katsumoto
turns and takes the blade in the meat of his arm.

Algren, meanwhile, has ripped the sleeve of his kimono into a tourniquet for his maimed hand.
He uses the rest of the fabric TO TIE HIS HAND TO HIS SWORD before launching himself
back into the fray -- slicing an attacker just as he is about to impale Katsumoto.

Together, he and Katsumoto force the last two Ninjas through a paper wall to the next room.
They fight all the wa y through that room and BLAST through another paper wall to the next.

                                                                                                    70.
INT.                  INN ­ STAIRWAY                           NIGHT

The battle continues unabated on the stairs -- the Ninjas spring for position with
incredible grace --perching and fighting on banisters, leaping from one level to the next.


It is a mayhem of flashing swords and flailing limbs and flyi ng arrows and spinning Ninja stars.

Sprays of blood splatter against the white rice paper walls.

Some of the fighting is less than elegant. Men bite and wrestle and gouge to
survive in close quarters.

All of them arc bloody and sweat y and dirty and tired, heaving for breath, their skin flayed
open, their kimonos ripped, their hands and arms and faces blood-stained.

But more samurai reinforcements follow Ujio up the stairs: Together with Yoritomo
and Nakao, they have begun to gain the upper hand.

Ujio flings both his swords through the air -- killing two Ninjas -- and dives to
fight others - his martial arts skills are dazzling.

Algren and Katsumoto are fighting sidc by side

And we cut to --

EXT.                INN                             NIGHT

Outside of the inn, we slowl y pull away...

The sounds of the battle gradually fade...


Soon it is nothing more than a lovel y rustic inn nestled in the mountains.

INT.                          INN ­ STAIRWAY                        NIGHT

Later. The battle is over.

Ninja and samurai corpses litter the inn.

We slowl y move up the long stairwa y from the bottom...

Yoritomo pulls a Ninja star from Nakao's_shou1der. Then one from his own.

We move up another level, past more bodies...

Ujio moves through the Ninjas. Making sure they are dead. Before sheathing
his sword, he angrily FLICKS it at the rice paper wall, spattering it with the bloody spray.

Katsumoto wipes his sword on a nearby corpse, replaces it in its sheath. He sits beside
Algren on a stair. Both men are exhausted. Bloodied. Alive.

A long beat as we watch the two warriors.

Slow fade to...

                                                                                        71.

EXT.                TOKYO -- IMPERIAL PALACE                     DAY

Algren, Katsumoto and the others are nearing the palace. Algren slows to a
stop -- his path is toward the city. Katsumoto stops, looks at him, then does
something absolutel y extraordinary.


He kneels and bows before Algren. Quickly touching his head to the dirt.


Then he rises, turns and walks toward the palace.


Algren stands, stunned.

EXT.                  PARADE GROUND                              DAY

Algren walks onto the parade ground. The change he sees could not be more remarkable.
Thousands of new Japanese troops are drilling with new bolt-action Mausers. They
are precise, exact and frighteningly mechanistic, their uniforms new and crisp.

New German advisors are barking commands. Colonel Bagley sees him.

                                          BAGLEY
                           Algren? My God, you never cease to astonish.

Bagley runs over, hand extended, but Algren turns to look at the troops.

                                          ALGREN
                           They have new weapons.

                                              BAGLEY
                           The Kaiser was only too happy to help. Along
                           with his friends at Mauser and Krupp. Thank God we
                           Americans still have a few teeth in our head.

And they come to the "teeth." Howitzer cannons. A row of them. Artillery
officers in US Army uniforms arc instructing Japanese offi cers.

                                             BAGLEY
                           The ambassador and I have spent eight months
                           kissing Omura's ass so he'll sign the damn trade
                           pact with us. You spent all this time living with
                           those savages?
                                    (A1gren looks at him)
                           He's going to want to talk to you...

                                              ALGREN
                           I need a bath.

                                           BAGLEY
                           And your back pay, I imagine.

Algren starts walking away.

                                                                                                    72.

                                             BAGLEY
                           They got their flag. ...See?

And we see it... snapping on I flagpole high above the parade ground.


It is immediately familiar. A red circle on a white field. The Rising Sun.

The Howitzers fire in sequence. Thundering blasts that shake the heavens.


EXT,               ROYAL TEMPLE                               DAY


Omura stands above Emperor Meiji respectful but persistent.

The Emperor is kneeling, tending to his iris garden. It is one of the wonders of the Palace: a
sea of white, pink, blue, and purple blossoms.

Retainers and servants stand at a distance. One holds a standard with the Imperial seal: a yellow
chrysanthemum.

Omura sees Katsumoto making his way toward them. He talks a bit more quickly to the Emperor.

Katsumoto begins to prostrate himself before the Emperor, the usual sign of extreme
respect -- but the Emperor stops him:

                                             EMPEROR
                                   (subtitles)
                           No, Mori-san. We arc "civilized" now.

Katsumoto stops prostrating himself. The Emperor offers his hand.

                                              KATSUMOTO
                                    (subtitles)
                           I cannot touch the Sacred One.

                                             EMPEROR
                                   (subtitles)
                           You can.

It is a difficult moment for Katsumoto. He simply cannot do It.

                                             OMURA
                                   (subtitles)
                           Did you have a pleasant journey, Minister Katsumoto?

                                              KATSUMOTO
                                    (subtitles)
                           It was uneventful.

Omura appreciates Katsumoto's droll response. He assumes that Katsumoto is aware of
his part in the assassination attempt.

                                                                                          73.

                                              EMPEROR
                                    (subtitles)
                         If it is not a great imposition. I desire a moment alone with
                         Minister Katsumoto. Omura-San.

                                           OMURA

                                   (subtitles)
                         Enlightened One, perhaps I can be of service in a conversation
                         of state.

                                            EMPEROR
                                  (subtitles)
                         So kind of you, but I fear my old teacher wishes to upbraid
                         me in private for neglecting my studies.

Omura bows his head quickly and goes.


Silence. The Emperor gazes at Katsumoto. Then:

                                           EMPEROR
                                 (subtitles)
                         You rise against me, my teacher.

                                           KATSUMOTO
                                 (subtitles)
                         No, Highness, I rise against your enemies.

                                           EMPEROR
                                 (subtitles)
                         They are my teacher, my advisers, like you.

                                           KATSUMOTO
                                 (subtitles)
                         They advise in their own interest.

                                             EMPEROR
                                   (subtitles)
                         The world is changing, Mori -- you have not seen what
                         goes on beyond our borders, the inventions, the science.
                          I need men who can look outward, or soon we will be
                         left behind, and defenseless.

                                           KATSUM OTO
                                 (subtitles)
                         I am sworn to defend you even to my last breath.

                                            EMPEROR
                                   (subtit1es)
                         The samurai live in the past. You cannot defend against
                         a future you don't understand.

                                                                                         74.
                                            KATSUMOTO
                                  (subtitles)
                         If I am no use, then I will happily end my life,

                                            EMPEROR
                                  (subtitles)
                         No, Mori. It is my wish that you rejoin the Council of State.
                         I need your voice.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                                   (subtitles)
                         It is your voice that needs to be heard, Highness. You
                         are a living God, you can do what ever you
                         think is right.

The young emperor is silent a moment.

                                             EMPEROR
                                   (subtitles)
                         I am a living God only as long as I do what they
                         think is right.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                                  (subtitle)
                         Your Highness, may I beg forgiveness for saying
                         what a teacher must, that such a statement is pathetic
                         drivel not worthy of an ignorant stable boy, let alone
                         a young man I know to have some modest intelligence.

The emperor laughs warmly, almost happy to be scolded as he once was.

                                              EMPEROR
                                   (subtitles)
                         Is it possible a living God can be too afraid to make
                         his voice heard?
                                   (Katsumoto's look is not unkind)
                         Tell me what to do, Mori-San?

                                           KATSUMOTO
                                 (subtitles)
                         You are emperor, my Lord, not me. You must find
                         the wisdom for all of us.

EXT.                YOKOHAMA WHARF                             DAY

A series of warehouses, beyond which we see warships in the harbor. A1gren walks
with Bagley and two other OFFICERS.

INT.                      WAREHOUSE                            DAY


The cavernous warehouse piled high with huge crates.

                                                                                             75.
                                                BAGLEY
                             As soon as they sign the agreement, they're obligated
                             to buy the entire weapons package, from Colt revol vers
                             to Ha1liwell twelve-pounders. Plus this particular item
                             you might recognize.

A few stevedores tear open one of the crates. Algren hides his astonishment:
A Gatling Gun is revealed.

                                              BAGLEY
                             They've been calibrated to fire 200 rounds a minute,
                             The new copper cartridges cut down on jamming.

Algren closes his eyes, trying to keep his memories at bay.

EXT.                           TOKYO STREETS                          DAY

Algren fights the crowds with Colonel Bagley And Ambassador Swanbeck..

                                             ALGREN (V.O.)
                             May 15, 1877. The city I return to is immeasurabl y
                             changed

New construction ever ywhere. Telegraph wires strung next to an ancient
temple. A modern European hotel is going up, dwarfing the traditional Japanese
buildings. Huge billboards advertising Western goods. A new invention, the rickshaw,
has replaced many of the palanquins.

                                             ALGREN (V.O.)
                             As though Tokyo were determined to become
                             another New York or Chicago .- all in one
                             headlong rush.

Spider's web of telegraph cables spread from a tall new brick building.
It is like a New York office building stabbing into the heart of old
Japan.

The familiar Omura character is emblazoned on the side.

.INT.             OFFICES OF THE OMURA ZAIBATSU                                        DAY

Aside from the occasional bit of Japanese decor, this could be a buzzing Wall Street firm.

Telegraph operators click away. Accountants use adding machines. Secretaries
use pneumatic tubes to send documents back and forth. Engineers plot out
railway lines. All are dressed in Western clothes.

Algren, Colonel Bagley, and Ambassador Swanbeck enter.

                                               AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
                                      (to Algren)
                             If he asks, you can talk about ordnance and tactics.
                             But remember, this has to do with a lot more than
                             just weapons.

                                                                                                        76.

An anteroom holds waiting delegations from the various European powers.
A babel of language. ... French ...Dutch ...Russian ...German.

A pretty American secretary looks up from her desk.

                                         SECRETARY
                           Ambassador Swanbeck, if you'll follow me.

Some of the delegates arc craning forward, watching Algren and the others hungrily
as they head into the final office.

INT.             OMURA'S OFFICE                            DAY

Omura stands like an industrial titan before large picture windows offering a dramatic view of Tokyo.
The only decoration in the room is an enormous Caravaggio.

                                             OMURA
                           Please, sit down, gentlemen.

Omura removes a gold cigarette case and lights up. Cigarettes are the newest Western fad
Sweeping Japan.

                                               OMURA
                                     (re: cigarette case)
                           A gift from Czar Alexander... Captain Algren,. it seems
                           you have endured your captivity with little ill-effect.

                                             ALGREN
                           Yes, sir.

                                             OMURA
                           He's an extraordinary man, isn't he?

                                             ALGREN
                           He is samurai.

Omura gazes at him. Slowl y takes I puff from his cigarette.

                                             AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
                           Mr. Omura, my people have been drawing up the documents
                           we discussed. I have a draft--

                                             OMURA
                           We're not quite ready to announce the treaty, Ambassador.

                                             AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
                           Excuse me?

                                              OMURA
                           The Emperor is...sentimental. Katsumoto was his old mentor--
                           he is not eager to offend him. It will take I few more days.

                                                                                      77.
                                         AMBASSJ\DOR SW ANBECK
                         How many da ys is " a few?"

                                           OMURA
                         I assure you the Samurai will not stand in the
                         wa y of our agreement. You are prepared to make deliver y?

                                        AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
                         Soon as your emperor signs on the dotted line.

                                           OMURA
                         Captain Algren you are the expert. Will this array of
                         ordnance be sufficient?

                                         ALGREN
                         Depends on what you're trying to accomplish.

                                          OMURA
                         I want my country to take its place as a modern power.

                                           ALGREN
                         Then they will set you well on your way.

                                           OMURA
                         I am pleased.



                                          AMDASSADOR SW ANBECK
                         Mr. Omura, you assured us you had the influence
                         with your emperor to make this deal come to
                         pass. With all due respect perhaps there is someone
                         else we should be speaking to.

                                           OMURA
                         With all due respect, Ambassador, perhaps there is
                         someone else we should be speaking to, for instance the
                         French. Or the English. Or any of the legations waiting
                         in the next room.

Ambassador Swan beck stands swallowing his rage.

                                          AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
                         Yes, we1l, we look forward to hearing from you.

                                          OMURA
                         Good afternoon, gentlemen.

They start to go.

                                          OMURA
                         Captain Algren, perhaps you can stay a moment
                         And tell me of your experiences in our rebellious
                         provinces.

Bagley looks at Algren. Do as he asks. He leaves A1gren alone with Omura.

                                                                                       78.

                                            OMURA
                          Cigarette?

                                            ALGREN
                          Thank you.


Omura lights his cigarette. A moment as he takes Algren's measure.

                                             OMURA
                          You fought bravely on behalf of our army--
                          against the rebel Katsumoto.

Algren says nothing.                            .

                                           OMURA
                          And yet you helped save his life when attacked
                          by the Ninja.

                                         ALGREN
                          My role was much less significant than you may have heard.

                                           OMURA
                          Tell me about your role in Katsumoto's plans.

                                            ALGREN
                          I have none.

                                         OMURA
                          And your sympathies?

                                            ALGREN
                          Again, I have none.


                                           OMURA
                          I know you have little sympathy for Colonel Bagley.

                                           ALGREN
                          He is.... unsympathetic.

Omura smiles.

                                            OMURA
                          I thought it was we who are inscrutable.

Now it is Algren who smiles.

                                           OMURA
                          You have gained important knowledge of Katsumoto's
                          province, his army, and his rebellion. This is extremely
                          valuable to me.

He watches Algren to see how this lands.

                                                                                           79.

                                            OMURA
                           You also possess significant knowledge of m y army, my
                           weaponry, and my plans. This is extremely va1uable to
                           Katsumoto.

                                             ALGREN
                           Again, you flatter me.

                                               OMURA
                           No. I am a businessman. I recognize what is valuable.
                           And I buy it.
                                     (looks at him)
                           In this case, I value your loyalt y.

Algren considers the implications of what Omura is saying.

                                             ALGREN
                           I didn't know loyalt y was something that could be sold.

                                             OMURA
                           Then perhaps you will give it, as a token of future
                           friendship - for which, as a friend, I would be in your debt.

                                             ALGREN
                                   (stands)
                           Then I will consider it.

                                             OMURA
                           And I will be grateful.

INT.                    SHIPPING OFFICE                      DAY


Algren is in a shipping office. A clerk consults his schedule of departure.

                                              CLERK
                           All righteee, the ANDREW JACKSON leaves tomorrow ­
                           if you want a steamship you'll have to wait six weeks.
                                    (Algren is silent)

                           What can I put you down for?

Algren is silent, concentrating on a calendar hanging behind the clerk. It
features a beautiful Hiroshigi watercolor of mountains.

                                              CLERK
                           Sir..?

                                              ALGREN
                                    (after a moment)
                           Private cabin.

                                                                                                  80.
EXT.                   TOKYO ­ STREET                             DAY


Graham walks with Algren.

                                             GRAHAM
                            Leave? Wh y would you leave now? No white
                            man has ever been in your position. Do you
                            have any idea what it will mean to have Omura
                            as your friend? You want land, you want women,
                            you want boys?

Algren starts to walk faster, but Graham Stops him.

                                                GRAHAM
                            Nathan. I wanted to leave, too. For three years.
                            You must believe me there is a majest y about
                            these people -- can you imagine what your own
                            country would be if it had half the drive and the
                            discipline and the belief and the bravery of these
                            ridiculous little people?

Then raised voices from across the street stop them.

They see Yoritomo surrounded by four Imperial Army soldiers. The soldiers
are rough and imperious, drunk with power. They carry gleaming rifle..

The soldiers bark orders. Yoritomo stands proudly, responding calmly.

                                               ALGREN

                            Whit is this?

                                              GRAHAM
                            My God, it's the edicts...

                                               ALGREN
                            What edicts?

Algren arrives as the situation is clearly growing volatile - the soldiers are
pointing to Yoritomo's head, screaming


Algren steps toward the soldiers--

                                               ALGREN
                            That's enough--

One of the soldiers SCREAMS at him -- raises his rifle -- all the soldiers raise their rifles ­
Yoritomo reaches for his sword -- Algren tries to push through -

                                                                                              81.
                                           ALGREN
                                 (subtitles)
                           YORITOMO, WAIT!

One of the soldiers smacks Algren in the chin with a rifle butt. Algren reels,
and by the time he stands straight again, four others are pointing their
ba yonets at his face.

Graham takes hold of Algren's arm.

                                              GRAHAM
                           Don't be stupid.

Algren makes eye contact with Yoritomo, who -- in deference to his friend --
puts his sword away.

The Japanese soldiers continue to scream at Yoritomo. They force him to his knees.
Rifles pressed to his head.

Yoritomo bows his bead, speaking quietly, as if praying.

Algren witches in horror all one of the soldiers removes his bayonet -- another grab.
Yoritomo's hair, jerks his head back and begins hacking off Yoritomo's traditional top-knot
of hair. Brutally. Blood.

Yoritomo remains kneeling, head down, blood flowing down his face.

The soldiers laugh and move off.

Algren kneels by Yoritomo. Yoritomo looks up at him. There are tears in
his eyes.

EXT.                  KATSUMOTO'S HOUSE                                    DUSK

Katsumoto's house on the outskirts of Tokyo is spacious and
harmonious. Utterly Japanese. Samurai guards in full regalia, stand
menacingly outside.

INT.                   KATSUMOTO'S HOUSE                                   DUSK

Ujio kneels with Yoritomo, dressing the wounds on his head.

Graham sits across the room talking quietly to the mammoth Nakao, taking
notes in a small notebook. Nakao has been brutally shorn of his top knot
as well. His shame is apparent.

INT.                     KATSUMOTO'S CHAMBER                          DUSK

Servants he1p dress Katsumoto in his exacting samurai wardrobe as Algren is ushered in.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           Captain, I had not thought to see you again.

                                                                                      82.
                                             ALGREN
                          I'm leaving tomorrow. But before I go I need to
                          tell you what's going on here.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                          You mean the Gatling Guns and the howitzers,
                          is that how you sa y it?

                                             ALGREN
                          They're about to close a trade agreement that
                          will bring this country more weapons than
                          you can imagine.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                          Yes, if the emperor agrees - but Omura knows
                          the Emperor must be convinced there is cause to
                          need those weapons before be will sign.

                                           ALGREN
                                  (realizing)
                          And you are to be the cause...

                                              KATSUMOTO
                          Elegant, isn't it? Omura passes laws sure to cause
                          a samurai revolt, creating a need for the weapons.
                          The Emperor sees that the weapons are needed
                          so he agrees to the entire treaty, giving your
                          country what it wants and the Omura Zaibatsu
                          what it wants. And my country is sold to yours.

As Katsumoto dresses, Algren notes that Katsumoto's body it at battleground
of old scars, so like his own.

                                            KA TSUMOTO
                          Today the Council passed two edicts. The first called for
                          the elimination of our traditional topknots.

                                             ALGREN
                          I know.

                                          KATSUMOTO
                          The second banned the wearing of sword.

Algren stops. He knows what swords mean to the samurai.


                                            KATSUMOTO
                                  (re: his swords)
                          Hand them to me, will you?

Algren picks up Katsumoto's two swords. Looks at him deeply.

                                             ALGREN
                          If you do this, they will kill you.

                                                                                                         83.
                                                KA TSUMOTO
                           I am hard to kill.

                                           ALGREN
                           You don't know what their weapons can do. All
                           your men butchered ... Just for pride.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           Not for pride. For the emperor.

                                            ALGREN
                           But the emperor is the one signing the agreement.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           He has not signed it yet.

He holds out Katsumoto's two samurai swords.

                                                 ALGREN
                           Is it worth it? ... just for these,

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           I cannot live without my soul ... Can you?

They regard each other.


EXT.                      OUTSIDE KATSUMOTO'S HOUSE                           NIGHT

Algren leaves Katsumoto's gate and sets off on foot.


EXT.                        TOKYO STREETS                               NIGHT

As Algren walks, he becomes aware that he is being followed. Two dark figures
lurk some distance behind him. After a few moments, he whips around to face
them. They stand for a moment, then melt away into the shadows.

INT.                      COUNCIL OF STATE CHAMBER                          NIGHT

The Council of State meets in an august chamber. Many of the Council
members wear Western clothes. Cigarette smoke billows.

The young Emperor sits on a dais off to the side, as befits his
ceremonial role in the proceedings.

Omura is speaking ... be stops ... looking at something ... all the Council members turn ... and gape.


Katsumoto strides into the chamber, his swords proudly displayed.

                                              OMURA
                                    (subtitled)
                           Minister Katsumoto, you honor us.

                                                                                            84.
                                              KATSUMOTO
                                    (subtitled)
                          It is my honor to join again the men who are leading
                          Japan into her glorious future.

                                            OMURA
                                  (subtitled)
                          You arc perhaps unaware of this Council's edict
                          regarding the wearing of swords?

                                              KATSUMOTO
                                   (subtitled)
                          I read ever y edict with singular attention.

                                            OMURA
                                  (subtitled)
                          Yet you would bring weapons into this chamber?

                                            KATSUMOTO
                                  (subtitled)
                          This chamber was protected by m y sword for four hundred
                          years--

                                          OMURA
                                 (interrupting, subtitled)
                          We need no protection... We are a nation of laws now.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                                    (calm, subtitled) .
                          We are a nation of whores. Selling ourselves to our Western
                          "allies."

Katsumoto slowl y looks around at the Members of the Council, but his words are addressed
to the Emperor.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                                  (subtitled)
                          Does Japan no longer need its patriots?

Omura speaks with quiet conviction and honesty.

                          Who is the patriot? The man who would keep his

                          his people into the future?

                          Honor means less to me than feeding our children. And
                          teaching them. And giving them modern medicine so
                          they will live.    .

                                                                                     85.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           And lining your own pockets in the process.

They stare at one another with barely concealed hostility.

                                               OMURA
                                     (subtitled)
                           Minister Katsumoto, it is with great regret that I ask
                           you to remove your sword, as this body has declared
                           in its edict.

Katsumoto's hand closes on his sword hilt

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           This sword serves the emperor, and only he can
                           command me to remove it.


Katsumoto looks to the Emperor, as murmurs fill the room.

                                               OMURA
                                    (quickly)
                           Ah, but it is our tradition that the Emperor's voice is
                           too pure and great to be heard in such worldly
                           circumstance as the Council of State.

One last time, Katsumoto meets the Emperor's eye.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           Then, with great regret, I must refuse to give up my
                           sword.

Omura looks to his associates, and a silent decision is made.

                                             OMURA
                           Minister Katsumoto, I must invite you to
                           accompany our soldiers to Himeji Castle, where
                           you will be our honored guest. I think you will
                           find the surroundings there quite harmonious.

Guards with Mauser rifles move into position around Katsumoto. He turns to
the other Council members. Looks at them.

                                              KA TSUMOTO
                                    (subtitled)
                           Brothers ... One day you will know what you have done
                           and feel what I never will ... shame.

Omura nods to the guards. The guards lead Katsumoto out.

                                                                                                  86.
EXT.                            LIVING QUARTERS                       AFTERNOON

A BEARER is loading the last of Algren's luggage on the back of a rickshaw.
Algren emerges from the building, sees the same two disreputable MEN
who followed him earlier lurking nearby.

He resists the temptation to confront them. Instead he climbs into the
rickshaw and it starts off.
But a moment later, Graham has jogged alongside, huffing and puffing.

                                                      GRAHAM
                                     Thought I'd missed you. Were you going to leave
                                     without even saying goodbye?

                                                        ALGREN
                                     I have a fear of sentimental Englishmen.

                                                       GRAHAM
                                     You sod.
                                              (trying to keep up)
                                     Christ, give us. . second here

Algren indicates for the bearer to stop. Graham tries to catch his breath.

                                                       GRAHAM
                                     You're making a mistake, I promise you.
                                     Katsumoto's under house arrest, Omura's made
                                     his move -- he'll need you more than ever --

Graham stops, sees the look on Algren's face, realizes.

                                                        GRAHAM
                                     Oh, my goodness. How silly of me.. All that
                                     time you were with him, up in those mountains,
..................................   ...I told you they were a remarkable people...

Algren doesn't answer, but isn't denying it either.

                                                     GRAHAM
                                     Then you should get out. Because Omura will
                                     become rather impatient with anyone who isn't on the team.

Graham notices Algren staring at his followers.

                                                       GRAHAM
                                     Case in point.

                                                       ALGREN
                                     Who are they?

                                                       GRAHAM
                                     Ronin would be m y guess. Disgraced samurai
                                     doing odd jobs for his Nibs.

                                                                                 87.

                                           ALGREN
                           What do they want from me?

                                            GRAHAM
                           To make sure you're on the side of God and
                           Country, or to make sure you get the hell out.

                                            ALGREN
                           You've been a great help, Graham. I thank you.

                                            GRAHAM
                           Look who's getting sentimental now.

A look bet ween them, then Algren nods for the bearer to continue.


EXT.                  HARBOR                             SUNSET

Algren stands at the gangplank. Porters wait with his luggage. Algren looks
back into the crowd and sees the ronin. They glare back, no longer trying to
keep out of sight.

A BLAST from the steam whistle.

Algren looks from the ship, to the ronin, to the bustling, chaotic city behind
them. Finally, he looks out at the harbor and the ocean, beyond which
used to lie his home.

He turns to the bearer.

                                             ALGREN
                                   (subtitles)
                           Take back to quarters. I walk.

And Algren starts back into the city.

EXT.             TOKYO STREETS               EVENING

Down a shadowy street, lit only by t orches. Slowl y we realize he is being
followed and that he knows it.

Up ahead, the street appears to dead-end.

The two Ronin step out from the shadows and face him, their hands on
their swords.

Behind him, Another dangerous looking Ronin joins the one who has been
following him.

They begin to close in.

Algren stands completely still. They grow closer.

Algren appears to close his eyes. And the sound of the approaching footsteps
fades as We HEAR ONLY the sound of his breathing.

                                                                                                             88.

The Ronin draw their swords.

Algren gently opens his eyes. Ever ything has SLOWED DOWN: a sign in
the breeze, a piece of rubbish on the street, the flame of a nearby torch.

A BLUR OF MOTION.

Everything happens so fast it is hard to tell just what has taken place. In the
strobing shadows, all we really know is that Algren has leapt to the attack.

Within seconds, four bodies lie in the street

Algren holds bloody sword.

His face is cut and a sleeve of his jacket is ripped, but other than that he is
unharmed. Ujio has taught him welt

As he stands, catching his breath, we HOLD on his face in CLOSE-UP.

A sudden flash:

We see Algren grab one of the torches and smash it across the ronin's face.

It is the attack ­ replayed in real-time.

Rolling to avoid a death-blow, he grabs the fallen man's sword and eviscerates attacker #2.

The two remaining Ronin strike.

He parries the blow of attacker #3, whirls to slice the legs of attacker #4,
whirls again to cut off the hand of attacker #1, who has returned to the attack.

Meanwhile, attacker #3 serums and charges -- just lit attacker #4 is trying to stand.

Algren steps back as attacker #3 impales attacker #4. Algren steps forward and cuts off the head of attacker #3.


Even now, it has happened too fast to be truly appreciated.

BACK TO THE STREET

We move, closer-still on Algren's face.

A sudden flash:

And so we watch the attack again. in super-slow motion now, so we can fully
appreciate it's terrible beauty.

A torch smashes across a face.

A sword slices the sleeve of a coat.

Sparks fly as two swords meet.

                                                                               89.
A severed hand falls in the dirt.

Blood sprays from a decapitated head.

A sword is wiped clean.

BACK TO THE STREET

In real time, Algren kneels to examine one of the dead Ronin. On his arm is
tattooed a familiar emblem:
The sign of the Omura Zaibatsu


EXT.                OMURA CASTLE                       NIGHT

Omura lives in a huge medieval castle on a promontory directly above Tokyo
Ba y. A testament to Japan's martial past.

INT.                  CASTLE ­ TOWER                       NIGHT

Two guards arc: standing at attention in a dank corridor high in one of the
towers of the castle. Cell doors line the corridor.

Katsumoto's samurai swords lean against the wall next to them.

INT.                       CASTLE ­ CELL                           NIGHT

Katsumoto kneels in a cramped cell. A sound draws his attention. He rises
and looks out a barred window.

Bel ow he sees two rickshaws moving up the twisting road to the castle.


INT.                       RICKSHAW                     NIGHT

Algren and Bagley, in formal dress uniforms, sit in one of the rickshaws.
Bagley looks him over.

                                            BAGLEY
                            Oughtta shave more often, Algren. Becomes you.

                                             ALGREN
                            Thought I would follow the Japanese fashion.

                                             BAGLEY
                            ...Heard you were leaving, actually?

                                            ALGREN
                            Why would I do that? Omura wants me to train his
                            personal guard.

                                             BAGLEY
                            Certainly seems obsessed by you. Why do you
                            think that is?

                                                                                               90.
                                           ALGREN
                          Could it be my nose isn't permanently lodged up
                          his ass?

Bagley shakes his bead, turns away. Algren stares up at the looming aide.


EXT.                       CASTLE- MAIN GATES                               NIGHT

The two rickshaws stop by the heavily-guarded main gates. Guards check the occupants. Motion
to other guards atop the gates.

The main gates slowl y swing open.


EXT.                   CASTLE - COURT YARD                 NIGHT

The bearers lower the rickshaws. Algren and Bagley climb from one.
Ambassador Swanbeck climbs from the other.

EXT.              CASTLE -- RECEPTION CHAMBE R                         NIGHT

Omura waits in elegant evening clothes. A woman plays a harp. The interior
of Omura's castle is heavy, oppressive. Old Masters paintings dot the walls.
Leather-bound boob. Chippendale furniture.

                                             OMURA
                          Gentlemen...

                                          AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
                          Omura, you have a lovel y home. It must be very old.

                                             OMURA
                          Nothing is "old" in Japan, ever ything is "ancient."
                          ... But the views are pleasant. Sit down...

They move to chairs by the roaring fireplace as Omura turns to Algren,
noticing the cut on his face, but saying nothing.

                                             OMURA
                          Do you know your Wagner, Captain? This is
                          the 'Leibestod' from Tristan and Isolde.

                                             ALGREN
                          I'm surprised you enjoy it. Literally translated it
                          means `love/death. '
                                   (looks at him)         .
                          A samurai concept, don't you think?

The two men take each other's measures. Servants appear with trays..


                                        OMURA
                          Champagne? And cigars, of course.

                                                                                       91.

Servants light their cigars.

                                                   BAGLEY
                                         (re: cigar)
                               A gift from President Grant?

                                                 OMURA
                                      (smiles)
                               Queen Victoria.

                                               ALGREN
                               Mr. Omura, may I use the necessit y?

                                                 OMURA
                               Certainly.


Omura summons a servant. The servant escorts Algren out.

                                                 OMURA
                               Now, Mr. Swanbeck, regarding our agreement, I noticed
                               a discrepancy in paragraph seven in reference to the
                               investment protocols for coal.

INT.                           CASTLE ­ CORRIDOR                          NIGHT

The servant leads Algren through a corridor, head bowed.

Then, stil1 puffing on his cigar, Algren taps the servant on the back, and as
the man turns, decks him. The servant falls.

Algren flicks hit cigar out onto the sloping roof. We FOLLOW the
BURNING EMBER as it rolls off the roof and lands at the feet of TWO
CURIOUS GUARDS.

EXT.                     CASTLE COURTYARD                        NIGHT

The guards look up, trying to determine where the cigar butt has come from.
But their curiosity lasts only a moment: ARROWS pierce their necks,
strangling any sound.

We REVERSE to discover that one of the rickshaw-bearers has fired the
arrows. As he peels back his hood, we SEE it is Yoritomo.

We realize the other bearers are Ujio, Nakao, and Simon Graham. They
hurry past the dead guards and up the stairs.

INT.                 CASTLE APPROACH                            NIGHT

The three samurai and Graham race up the winding parapets.

Three GUARDS round a corner. Swords flash as Ujio and Nakao dispatch
them without even slowing. They race on, Graham laboring to keep up.

                                                                                  92.
INT.                    CASTLE KEEP                     NIGHT

Algren rounds a corner--

Ujio, Yoritomo, Nakao, and Graham are moving toward him.

                                              ALGREN
                           This wa y...

Clearly, this has all been Algren's plan. They move up a stairwa y.

INT.                CASTLE KEEP (SECOND FLOOR)                           NIGHT

The three guards are still standing at attention outside Katsumoto's cell.
His swords are next to them.

Algren keeps the others out of sight and lowers his head to whisper with
Ujio. Ujio nods, then walks into sight and calmly approaches the guards.

Still hidden, Algren gestures for the others remain to silent. After a
moment, he gestures that they can proceed.

Algren and the others round the comer to discover the bloody remains of
the three guards - whom Ujio has dispatched in absolute silence. They unlock
the cell.

INT.                   CASTLE ­ CELL                         FOLLOWING

Katsumoto is shocked to see Algren enter. Algren tosses him his swords.

                                           ALGREN
                           How's the poem coming?

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           The ending is proving difficult.

INT.                      CASTLE -- RECEPTION CHAMBER                     NIGHT


Omura glances up from the documents.

                                            OMURA
                                What has become of Captain Algren?

INT.                       CASTLE ­ CORRIDOR                          NIGHT

Algren, Katsumoto, and the others race through an upper corridor.

                                           KATSUMOTO
                                   (re:Graham)
                           Who is this?

                                          ALGREN
                           Name's Simon Graham. Wants to write a book
                           about you.

                                                                                   93.

                                                GRAHAM
                           An honor. I have followed your activities with
                           great interest. I think the European public
                           would be fascinated by a book about your
                           adventures.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           Not a book. A play!

Suddenly, from below, the raised voices of guards. They hurry a wa y.

INT.               CASTLE ­ STAIRS                     NIGHT

Guards carrying pikes race up the stairs--


INT.                CASTLE ­ CORRIDOR                  NIGHT

Algren and the others are moving swiftl y down a stone corridor.

The sound of the approaching guards is growing louder.

A silent WILD BUNCH moment of preparation as they stride down the
corridor, five abreast.

Algren pulls the cavalry saber from his dress uniform. Katsumoto prepares
his swords. Nakao stretches his huge arms. Yoritomo and Uji o draw their bows.

EXT.                   CASTLE - UPPER COURTYARD                        FOLLOWING

Ten guards with rifles patrol the upper battlements.

Yoritomo and Uji o crouch and fire. Arrow a fter arrow a fter arrow, as
fast as a repeating rifle, the arrows streak through the night.
Completely silent.

It is a dazzling display. They time shots to sail over walls, shoot through
tiny windows, shoot out torches. Multiple arrows. Perfect aim.

In a matter of seconds all ten guards are dead.

They continue across the courtyard, up some steps --

INT.             CASTLE--TIGHT CORRIDOR                         FOLLOWING

They stride through a tight, dark stone corridor.

Suddenly, a cadre of Omura guards emerge from the shadows.

Without hesitation, they launch into battle. Algren and Katsumoto wield
their swords. Yoritomo and Ujio fire arrows.

Nakao fights with his hands, dramatic martial arts from the huge man.

                                                                                                                 94.
But this corridor is just too tight -- it is a sea of combat.. the guards and
our warriors are slammed together --the swords and pikes sending up sparks
in the darkness as they strike the stone walls.

The right corridor echoes with samurai war cries and clanging swords.

Then...

More guards appear.

These guards have rifles.

Rifle blasts thunder --startling strobe-like bursts of light in the darkness --

Algren dives in front of Katsumoto to protect him-

Yoritomo is hit-

He jerks back -- blood--

Ujio fires arrows at the guards with rifles, hitting two -- but more guards with rifles are appearing, bullets
sending showers of debris and ricochets--

Algren sees a stairway leading to a higher 1evel, barks out a command. As Nakao drags
Yoritomo toward the stairs-- the others bolt a heavy SIEGE DOOR ­
designed to keep attackers at bay.

INT.                        CASTLE SIEGE ROOM                           NIGHT

Ujio fires arrows through the siege ports -- momentarily delaying the guards
as Algren leads them toward a rear stairs.

INT.                       REAR STAIRS                      NIGHT

Algren starts down -- only to discover MORE GUARDS blocking this means
of escape. He backs out of the wa y just in time as rifle blasts SPLINTER
the wooden stairwe11.

Meanwhile, an EXPLOSION from behind them indicates that the guards
have blown the siege door.

Algren, Graham, and Ujio have no choice but to continue upwards into the
castle keep. Nakao helps the wounded Yoritomo as they climb.

INT.                UPPER KEEP                    NIGHT

A narrow ladder leads to the final redoubt. They start to climb but Yoritomo
leans against the wall. He is gravely wounded.

                                                ALGREN
                            Come on.

                                              YORITOMO
                                    (subtitled)
                            You go, Algren-san. I will stop them.

                                                                                   95.

                                             ALGREN
                           No--

                                             YORITOMO
                           ...Please.

Yoritomo's determination is absolute. Finally, Algren nods.

Katsumoto moves to Yoritomo, leans in for a few final words, taking his
head and pressing his forehead to Yoritomo's.

Bullets begin ricocheting around them -- Yoritomo looks to Algren:

                                              YORITOMO
                                    (subtitled)
                           Tell my family.

Algren bows his bead in respect.

Then Algren leads them up the stairs. Ujio fires a final volley, nods with
respect to Yoritomo, then follows the others.


Yoritomo pulls himself erect. Draws his two samurai swords.

A beat. He closes his eyes. Smiles.

Then he opens his eyes and hurls himself down the stairs--

The guards fire hitting Yoritomo - but still he comes -- wading into them
swords flashing -- he is hit again and again -- but still he comes.

It is a glorious death.

EXT.                      SIEGE ROOM                     NIGHT

Algren leads them into the highest room of the castle, the siege room. The
echoes Yoritomo's death rings in their ears.                                   .

Katsumoto glances at Ujio and Nakao. Without a word, they kneel on the
floor, open their kimonos and unsheathe their short-swords, preparing to
commit seppuku.

                                             ALGREN
                           No. Wait...!

Katsumoto glares at him harshly, furious to have his concentration disturbed
at such a moment.

                                              ALGREN
                           There's a wa y out. Look--!

Reluctantly, Katsumoto joins him at the window.

                                                                                                        96.
                                                ALGREN
                             This place is designed to keep people from getting
                             in, not from getting out. We can make it

                                              KA TSUMOTO
                             This was your plan?

                                              ALGREN
                             Do you have a better one?

Nakao and Ujio look at Katsumoto, awaiting his response. He turns to Algren.

                                                 ALGREN
                             I may die. But I'll die trying.

And without another word he LAUNCHES himself out the window, onto the sloping roof.

EXT.                   CASTLE ROOF TOPS                          NIGHT

Like his cigar butt earlier in the sequence, he rolls, then falls, hits another
roof, rolls, slides, falls, hits again.

INT.                  UPPER KEEP                          CONTINUOUS

Katsumoto and the others share a look. Has he survived?

GUNFIRE begins to pepper the floorboards, bullets whistling past them.


EXT.                 CASTLE ROQF TOPS                          CONTINUOUS

Algren slides, bumps, rolls, falls, hits, then slides again. Until he finally plummets into the moat.

As his head rises above water, he lets out a scream of absolute joy.

INT.                  UPPER KEEP                    CONTINUOUS

Katsumoto hears the scream. A look of disbelief spreads over his face.
Then the beginnings of a smile. Without a second look, be leaps out the
window. Ujio follows.

Graham shrinks away in fear. Nakao lifts him bodily, throws him out, and then follows.

INT.                      CASTLE -- RECEPTION CHAMBER                        LATER

Omura stands, very calm, smoking a cigarette, listening to the report of his guards.
Colonel Bagley tries to apologize.

                                               BAGLEY
                             ... 1 don't know what to say, sir. I never would
                             have thought him capable of treason.

                                              OMURA
                             I would say Captain Algren's acts tonight have
                             assured our success.

                                                                                 97.
                                          AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
                           What do you mean?

                                             OMURA
                           Katsumoto will rejoin his kinsmen. They will fight.
                           We will destroy them with your new weapons.

                                             BAGLEY
                           What if he just goes off to the mountains and
                           becomes a damn sheep-herder or some such?

                                             OMURA
                           You still do not understand us ... Katsumoto can
                           do nothing but fight. It is his role in the drama.
                           He must act out his destiny. He knows it.

                                              AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
                           You trust a lot in destiny.

                                               OMURA
                           This story was written years ago. From the first
                           sight of your warships in our harbor...
                                      (stares out the window)
                           It is a1l inevitable.

EXT.             HILLS                           SUNSET

Algren, Katsumoto, and the others ride over rocky ground.

                                            ALGREN (V.O.)
                           June 1, 1877. Yesterday, I passed the field where
                           Zebulon Gant was killed by the man with whom
                           I now ride.
In the distance a steam train chugs along. Inevitable. Progress.


EXT.                 FOREST ­ MOUNTAINS                     DAY

They climb a steep trail. Beyond, the glaciers glow pink.


                                             ALGREN (V.O.)
                           I am beset by ironies -- trained to fight rebels
                           now I am one. And yet 1 ask mysel f... can a man
                           be reborn?:

Algren, Katsumoto, and the others ride through a dense forest Katsumoto
reins his horse. The others follow suit. They wait

                                            ALGREN (V.O.)
                           And if so, what would he make of it?

Mounted samurai emerge from the thick forest As it they were invisible.

                                                                                98.
The leader leaps from his horse and bows, touching his head to the dirt.
All the other samurai follow suit.

EXT.    CHERRY TREE FOREST--NEAR THE VILLAGE                       EVENING

Katsumoto rides at the head of his samurai as they pass through the cherry
orchard. Then he reins his horse and falls in beside Algren.

                                              KATSUMOTO
                                    (his voice troubled)
                           I was prepared to die in Omura's castle. And
                           yet here I am. I cannot help but ask why were
                           you sent into my life. What is the lesson you
                           were meant to give me?

                                            ALGREN
                           Maybe that neither of us is as smart as we
                           thought...

Katsumoto laugh. And then in a surprisingly deft imitation of Algren


                                              KATSUMOTO
                           You...ain't whistlin' Dixie...


He spurs his horse and heads off. Algren shakes his head and follows.

EXT.               VILLAGE                     EVENING

The returning warriors are warmly welcomed by the villagers.


Algren rides directly to Yoritomo's house, dismounts.

Taka and Toshiie are waiting.

He goes to them. His expression tells them all they need to know.

INT.          YORITOMO'S HOUSE                           NIGHT


Algren sits with the family. The boys sit next to their mother.

                                     (subtitles)
                           ... he gave his life to save us. He died bravel y.

                                               ALGREN
                                     (subtitles)
                           If they come here, yes.

                                               HIGEN
                                     (subtitles)
                           Why?


                                             ALGREN
                                   (subtitles)
                           Because they come to destroy what I have come to love.

Taka looks at him, moved and surprised. Suddenly, Higen jumps up and
bolts... out of the room. Algren looks to Taka.

                                              TAKA
                                    (subtitles)
                           The wa y of Samurai is difficult for children. He
                           misses his father.

                                            ALGREN
                           And he is angry because I am the cause of that.

She smiles ever so slightly at his obliviousness.

                                             TAKA
                           No. He it angry because he fears you will die as well.

EXT.             VILLAGE                    NIGHT

Higen stands, looking up at the stars.

                                              ALGREN
                           Higen.

                                   (subtitles)
                           My father taught me it is glorious to die in battle.

                                              ALGREN
                                    (subtitles)
                           That is what he believed.

                                    (subtitles)
                           I would be afraid to die in battle.

                                             ALGREN
                                   (subtitles)
                           So would I.

                                                                                  100.

                                    (subtitles)
                            But you have been in many battles.

                                              ALGREN
                                    (subtitles)
                            And I was always afraid.

Higen looks at him, tears welling in his eyes.

                                               HIGEN
                                     (subtitles)
                            I don't want you to go.

Algren has no answer. He can only gather the boy up in his arms and hold
him.

EXT VILLAGE DAY

Nakao is standing proudly, his massive arms folded across his chest. We
pull back: Graham is bunched behind his photographic equipment. A flash
of phosphorous and the moment is immortalized.

Meanwhile, Algren is working with Higen on the house.

Katsumoto silently watches Algren working with the boy.

                                                 KATSUMOTO
                            Algren-san.

Algren turns.

                                                 KATSUMOTO
                            They are corning.

EXT      MOUNTAINS          DAY

Algren and Katsumoto perch on a precipice, looking down into a valley.

It is a beautiful setting. Towering peaks and peaceful valleys. It is here that
the final act of the inevitable drama will play out.

Bel ow they see the Imperial Army, thousands strong, marching across the
valley toward them. Terrifying martial columns in strict formation.

                                                ALGREN
                            I call it five thousand troops. They'll come in
                            waves of about a thousand, a few minutes between
                            each wave.

Katsumoto listens carefully to Algren's expertise.

                                                                                101.
                                              ALGREN
                           German formations have the infantry staggered
                           with on1y light flanking. They'll come straight on
                           with rifles and fixed bayonets. Mausers are only
                           accurate to about 150 yards. They'll look to
                           overthrow us.

Katsumoto takes this in.

EXT.                  VALLEY                             DAY

Colonel Bagley, Omura, several German advisors and Japanese officers ride
at the head of the Imperial Army.                                         .

Bagley sees something, raises a hand. The troops halt.

Algren and Katsumoto ride up to them. Stop.

                                             ALGREN
                           Colonel.

                                              BAGLEY
                           Captain... (to Katsumoto)... Sir, the Imperial
                           Army of Japan demands your surrender. If you
                           and your fellows lay down your arms you will
                           not be harmed.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           That is not possible. As Omura knows.

Omura meets Katsumoto's look, nods. Bagley turns to Algren.

                                             BAGLEY
                           Captain Algren, we will show no quarter. You
                           ride against us and you are the same as they are.

                                               ALGREN
                           I take that as a compliment, Colonel.
                                      (a deadly calm)
                           I'll look for you on the field.

Algren and Katsumoto wheel their horses and go.

EXT.                 MOUNTAIN RIDGE                      DAY


Algren and Katsumoto ride.

                                           ALGREN
                           They have the howitzers.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           How many?

                                             ALGREN
                           About a dozen.

                                                                                              102.

Katsumoto considers this. Algren looks up into the mountains.

                                              ALGREN
                            A man could get lost up there ... Build an army.
                            Hold out a very long time.

                                              KATSUMOTO
                            Algren-san...Have you seen what happens to the
                            villages that stand In the way of the railroad?

Algren nods. He remembers.

                                               KATSUMOTO
                            That is what will happen to my village if we do
                            not stand and fight.
                                     (looks at him)
                            No. We serve the Emperor here.

                                               ALGREN
                            By dying?

                                               KATSUMOTO
                            Perhaps.

                                              ALGREN
                            At least make it battle, not a suicide.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                            And what would that accomplish?

Algren lifts his head, enjoying the feeling of the sun and wind on his face.

                                                ALGREN
                            It might give you one more day ... One more
                            fine day like this.

Katsumoto stares at him for a long moment, then smiles and spurs his horse. Algren follows.

They ride together, side by aide, the wind billowing their cloaks -- We enjoy the
ride as they do, the trees strobing by, the sun slanting through the leaves.

EXT.                      VILLAGE                       NIGHT
It is the eve of battle. And the samurai rejoice.

Katsumoto is on stage at the center of the village square, enthusiastically
performing a Noh drama. Algren sits with Toshiie and Taka in the audience,
enjoying Katsumoto's theatrics.

Other samurai can be seen around the village, eating, singing, and playing
instruments. Tonight is for celebrating life.

Elsewhere, a flash as Graham takes a photograph of some children.

                                                                                            103.
On the stage, Katsumoto spots Algren in the audience, points to him and
encourages him to join him. Algren resists. Toshiie prods him. Algren
surrenders and joins Katsumoto on the stage. The villagers are delighted.

Katsumoto embroils Algren in the performance. Algren does his best,
laughing at Katsumoto's antics.

It is the freest and happiest we have ever seen Algren. Time
SLOWS as we Savor his simple enjoyment

Toshiie is highly amused. Taka has a deeper response, she is moved as she
watches Algren give himself over to the part.

EXT.            VILLAGE                      LATER THAT NIGHT

A somber mood has descended. Algren sits and writes in his journal.

                                              ALGREN (V.O.)
                            July 14, 1877. For so long now, I have managed
                            to convince myself that there was nothing worth
                            believing in.

A samurai plays a melancholy bamboo flute. The gentle sound floats through the village...

                                              ALGREN (V.O.)
                            Certainly nothing worth dying for.

We see samurai preparing for the final battle. Some check
their armor... Others meditate...

                                             ALGREN (V.O.)
                            Now I am not so sure.

Some make up their faces so they will look handsome when they greet death.
Some methodically polish their swords. Some sit with their families.

                                               ALGREN (V.O.)
                            And so, for the first time in my life, I am truly
                            afraid. Not of dying. But of losing something
                            worth living for.

Ujio is performing a graceful, ritualistic sword-dance to the song of the flute.
Algren Joins Graham to watch him.

                                                GRAHAM
                            What is it:? .

                                              ALGREN
                            The kenbu,.. his dance of death.

Taka comes to them.

                                              TAKA
                                    (subtitles)
                            Algren-san, will you come with me?

                                                                                   104.

Algren leaves Graham and accompanies Taka toward the house.

They pass Higen and Toshiie, who sit with other children at the feet of the
massive Nakao, listening to a quiet story he tells,

INT.                   YORITOMO'S HOUSE                     FOLLOWING

The gentle flute music from outside drifts in.

One of Yoritomo's beautiful kimonos is elegantly spread on a mat.

                                               TAKA
                                     (subtitles)
                            If you wear this, it will honor us.

He nods.

She steps to him.

A moment. She gently reaches forward and unbuttons his collar.

A tender, silent scene as she undresses him and carefully wraps him in the
 kimono. Her hands move gracefull y around his body, never quite touching
him. His movements are gentle in response.

When he is fully dressed, then are tears in his eyes.

Suddenly, fiercely, they are holding each other.

EXT.             KATSUMOTO'S HOUSE -- PORCH                  LATER THAT NIGHT
The quiet evening continues.

Algren, now dressed in the kimono, finds Katsumoto carefully dropping little
leaves of incense into a small flame that simmers inside his battle helmet.

                                               KATSUMOTO
                            So m y hair will have a pleasing scent when I
                            meet my ancestors ... (dry) ... You do not do this ?

Algren smiles, sits.
                                                 ALGREN
                            I studied war at a place called West Point. They
                            taught us about a battle called Thermopylae.
                            Three hundred brave warriors held off the king
                            of Persia's army of a million men. For two da ys
                            they made them pay so dearly that the king lost
                            all appetite for further invasion
                                       (looks at him)
                            ... I have some thoughts about the battle tomorrow.

                                              KATSUMOTO
                                    (bemused)
                            Do you really think we can defeat them?

                                                                                         105.

                                               ALGREN
                            I sure as hell want to find out.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                            You believe a man can change his destiny?

                                              ALGREN
                            No ... But I think a man cannot know his destiny.
                            He can only do what he can, until his destiny is
                            revealed.

A si1ent beat.

Then Katsumoto picks up a long bundle wrapped in cloth. He unwraps it.
A beautilu1 long samurai sword.

He bows his head and offers it to Algren.

There are Japanese characters etched on the blade.

                                                ALGREN
                            What does it say?

                                              KATSUMOTO
                            "I belong to the warrior in whom the old ways
                            have joined the new."

Algren is moved beyond words. He bows.

As the CAMERA pulls away, Algren and Katsumoto squat side by side,
drawing in the dirt with a stick, planning the next day's battle strategy.

Across the square, Ujio continues his elegant dance of death, his graceful
form illuminated in silhouette by a fire.

INT.          YORITOMO'S HOUSE                   MORNING

It is the day of the battle. Algren is buttoning the long coat of his cavalry uniform.

He looks up to see Higen standing in the doorwa y, holding the breast-plate
of his father's armor.

EXT.             YORITOMO'S HOUSE                 DAY

Algren emerges from the house, wearing the breast-plate over his coat.
Taka is at his horse, tying a bag of food to the saddle. She turns and sees her
husband's armor on this man. And her breath stops.

Algren approaches her. They stand very cl ose.

                            Return.

                                                                                         106.

                                                 ALGREN
                                       (subtitles)
                            If that is my destiny ... Anshinritsumai. [I
                            wish you peace.]

                                               TAKA
                            Anshinritsumai.

He bows his head to her, she responds. The boys stand on the porch,
watching. He mounts his horse and trots off. They watch him go.                      .

Algren joins the line of samurai leaving the village. It is the first time we have
seen them in their full battle armor since the battle in the fog.

Katsumoto in his black armor, Ujio in his jet black. And Algren in the blood-red
breast-plate. It is dazzling.

EXT.      BATTLEFIELD           DAWN

We move along the line of waiting samurai. The faces are stoic. Prepared.
Their horses are corralled well behind them.

Algren stands with Katsumoto and Ujio. Graham is nearby. They peer into the
plain beyond.

They have chosen a strong defensive position. A steep mountain pass. Slopes on either
side create a funnel ahead of them. The Imperial Army will have to pass through the
funnel to reach them.

On a hill above them

Higen is revealed. He looks down first at the five hundred Samurai, then
sees, beyond, the overwhelming mass of the IMPERIAL ARMY.

Back on the battlefield

A distant thud followed by a high-pitched whine. A MASSIVE EXPLOSION
ahead of the Samurai. Artillery.

Algren finds Graham cowering at the base of a straw barricade.

                                               ALGREN
                            Mr. Graham....

                                               GRAHAM
                            Captain?

                                            ALGREN
                            Would you please stay with the horses?

Graham would like to be brave enough to remain, but he is not a soldier.

                                               GRAHAM
                            As you suggest.

                                                                                    107.

Graham starts to go --

                                             ALGREN
                            Mr. Graham ... Take this.

From his coat, Algren takes his journal, hands it to Graham.

                                            ALGREN
                            Maybe you can use it for your book.

                                               GRAHAM
                            I will.

He heads back to the relative safet y of the horse corral.

Meanwhile, the samurai remain impassive as artillery is stepped in closer, the
range bracketed. Then artillery rounds begin to fall among them.

Samurai are blown to pieces as they bravel y stand and await
death. Katsumoto BARKS a command to Ujio.

Suddenly, the Samurai break ranks and trot into a new defense
alignment. The artillery rounds now fall ineffectually where once
they stood.

Bagley directs the artillery to be re-targeted, It is a laborious, clumsy
process. They fire again. Another command. The Samurai change
position again.

Bagley is furious. Their fluid tactics have rendered his field artillery useless.

Katsumoto and Algren share a look of grim satisfaction. They are leveling
the playing field.

Bugle calls are heard from the Imperial Army.

                                              ALGREN
                            The call to advance.

The rattle of the snare drums. The sound of marching boots.

And then they appear. Thousands upon thousands of them. The Imperial
Army marching relentlessly forward in strict formation. The Rising Sun displayed.

Katsumoto gazes at the awe-inspiring sight. His 500 samurai face a staggering
5,000 soldiers.

                                              KATSUMOTO
                            Tell me ... what happened to those three hundred
                            warriors at Thermopylae?

                                                                                 108.
                                               ALGREN
                                      (a grim smile)
                             Dead to the last man.

Katsumoto glances to him, smiles.


EXT.                THE SAMURAI POSITION                     CONTINUOUS

The First Division of the Imperial Army moves into the funnel, their numbers
reduced by the size of the access, and head toward the barricade.

Katsumoto and Algren watch as they move closer and closer. We
are expecting the samurai to open fire, but they do not. They just
wait.

Finally the Imperial soldiers are in rifle range. They stop to fi re a volley.

Bullets begin hitting among the samurai. Many fall.

Algren nods to Katsumoto, Katsumoto then calls out a command and the
samurai retreat.

They race back toward the rear of the funnel.

The Imperial Army soldiers climb awkwardly over the first barricade and
pursue--

The samurai, meanwhile, have taken cover behind a second barricade that
had been hidden from the Imperial soldiers' view. Now safel y behind
the second barricade, Katsumoto calls out a command and--

The samurai fire!

500 arrows explode -- almost instantly followed by 500 more --

Like an image from Agincourt, the clouds of arrows sweep across the sky --

Imperial Soldiers fall, the attack falters--

From behind the new barricades, archers fire FLAMING ARROWS, that
Hit the old barricade. It EXPLODES INTO FLAMES, trapping the Imperia1
Army bet ween the two barricades.

And from the second barricade, two large CA TAPULTS send balls of flaming
pitch into the already panicking soldiers.

EXT.                        OPPOSING HILL TOP                    DAY

Colonel Bagley, Omura, several German advisers and Japanese Officers
watch through binoculars. Stunned. As the First Wave is routed.

                                                HAGLEY
                             What the hell?

                                                                                          109.
                                               OMURA
                             It seems Katsumoto will resist his destiny.
                                      (snaps an order)
                             Send in the second wave. Two divisions.

EXT.                  BARRICADES                          DAY

Algren and Katsumoto wait behind the second barricade. We note that this
barricade is the real thing.

Katsumoto removes a piece of shattered armor from his left forearm, a
bullet wound beneath. Algren looks over the barricade.

They see Imperial soldiers using semaphore flags to communicate with their commanders
on the opposing hilltop.

                                                KATSUMOTO
                             How long?

                                                ALGREN
                             They need to regroup and report our position. Then
                             they'll come hard.

Katsumoto considers the bodies of the dead Imperia1soldiers.

                                                 KA TSUMOTO
                             It is sad to see brave men die without faces... You cannot
                             tell one warrior from another.

                                               ALGREN
                             They're not warriors. They're soldiers. It's a
                             modern army.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                             Not my world anymore.

EXT.            BATTLE FIELD                   DAY

Bugles. The attack is reforming. Ranks now bolstered by reinforcements.

They come at a trot, through the narrow defile, skirting the first barricade,
continuing at a trot toward the second barricade.

EXT.              2ND BARRICADE                      DAY

Katsumoto pulls his long sword. Algren does the same.

Katsumoto calls out an order -- the archers fire another round.

The Imperial soldiers are being annihilated but still they come in great waves --
for ever y one who falls it seems there are ten to take his place.

They race forward, stepping over their fallen comrades, bayonets poised --

The Mauser rifles flash --

                                                                                           110.

Bullets explode around the samurai, many are hit.

The Imperial Army has been trained to keep firing on the run. The waiting
Samurai will be decimated, except --

From the hills on either side

Fully half of the Samurai force -- who have been kept hidden until this moment...
charge, screaming into the flank of the attacking Army. Even rifles cannot fire in
three directions at once.

Algren and Katsumoto lead the charge over the second barricade. Some are cut down,
but in moments swords engage ba yonets in brutal hand-to-band combat.

Algren And Katsumoto fight back to back, as if one person, slashing with their
swords, shattering bayonet, dealing death on all sides.

Ujio crouches, his back leg straight and planted, his front leg bent. Still using
his bow, firing off arrows with Stunning speed, refusing to budge--

On the opposing hillside

Bagley and Omura watch the battle through binoculars.

                                                  BAGLEY
                                A classic "V" ambush. Sonofabitcb is using
                                Welt Point tactics.

In the midst of the battle

A charging soldier thrust     s his bayonet into Katsumoto's arm - Katsumoto kills,
the soldier with his short    sword but is awkwardly tangled with his body, a second
soldier races toward him      for the kill - Algren spins and attacks killing the second
soldier - but a third races    toward Algren, bayonet f1ashing

He dodges -- but the bayonet slices into his side --

Algren kicks the soldier away -- tries to use his sword but the soldier springs
back ath1etically .. Ujio appears like a black spectral figure to deliver the
coup de grace.

All SOUND gradually fades and is replaced by the elegaic sound of a bamboo
flute... the images of combat become fragmented and impressionistic.

Bur no matter how bravel y the samurai fight, they are simply outnumbered...

Nakao is like a cornered bear, arcing his two swords wildly around him. He
is shot in the chest, and staggers a moment before continuing. Another
soldier shoots him in the arm at point blank range. Nakao', sword goes fl ying,
so the giant Samurai leaps forward and picks up the shooter bodily, twirling
him around like a wrestler, throwing him finally onto the upraised pike of a
fellow Imperial soldier. But now three more soldiers have levelled their
weapons, and a ruthless volley staggers him again. Shots rain on him as he
tries to continue fighting, but his strength leaves him. Finally, with one last
lunge, he manages to pull an Imperial soldier with him, crushing him as he falls.

                                                                                   111.
More and more fall as Algren, Katsumoto, and their comrades fight desperately...

The mournful flute is the appropriate accompaniment as Ujio is mortally
wounded. The grim award master is cut through with bullets. Still he fights.
An Imperial soldier holds up a rifle to protect himself, and Ujio's blade cuts
through the barrel. The soldier just has time to look at the gun in amazement
before a second sweep of Uji o's sword beheads him. But there are too many
to take the man's place, and finally fi ve men run Uji o through with bayonets,
and he is pinned against the barricade, still upright in death.

At last, what is left of this second wave of the Imperial Army, retreats.

EXT.             PLAIN                            ALMOST SUNSET

The plain before the barricade is littered with Imperial Army dead.

Algren and Katsumoto sit exhausted, leaning against the barricade. They are
both wounded.

Only about. hundred samurai are still alive.

Algren looks over the decimated warriors for a moment. Even those still
alive are in bad shape as they wait for the next wave of Imperial soldiers.

Katsumoto is looking at Ujio's body nearby.

                                           KATSUMOTO
                           He was Kaishaku ... my trusted friend.

                                            ALGREN
                           We won't be able to hold them back this time.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           This is not your battle. You do not have to die
                           here.

 A long beat.

                                              ALGREN
                           I died a long time ago.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           But now you live again.

                                               ALGREN
                           Yes.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           It was not your time.

                                            ALGREN
                           No. Maybe I survived just to live this one last day.

Algren looks at him.

                                                                                      112.
                                               ALGREN
                            I'll stay.

He slowl y pulls himself up. He and Katsumoto gaze at the plain before them.

At the infantry troops massing on the opposing hilltop.

Algren looks at Katsumoto. He reaches into the pocket of his old uniform
and takes out the Medal of Honor he received, long ago, at Sutter's Hill.

He affixes it to his old cavalry tunic.

Katsumoto looks at Algren. They are both thinking the same thing.

Silent agreement.


EXT.                    PLAIN                                  SUNSET

The hundred mounted samurai are a beautiful sight.

They wait in formation in front of the barricade, the long plain through the
funnel to the opposing hilltop before them.

Katsumoto draws his long samurai sword.

Algren draws his.

And they slowl y begin to trot forward...

And then to canter...

BEHIND THE IMPERIAL ARMY

Colonel Bagley and Omura watch, transfixed. There is something
approaching admiration on Omura's face. On Bagley's, there is only malice.

                                              BAGLEY
                            The gatling guns. Quickly.

EXT.                     PLAIN                             SUNSET


Katsumoto points his sword and screams out his war cry. .

And they charge. It is suicidal

It is glorious.

It is the end of the samurai.

They charge forward, their war cries echoing in the canyon.

The Imperial troops fire rifles -- samurai fall .. but still they come: -- pounding
over the earth like something from an ancient dream

                                                                                        113.
Algren and Katsumoto charge side by side. Alive. Warriors.

BEHIND THE IMPERIAL ARMY

Bagley and Omura watch as the samurai fall, one by one.

WITH THE CHARGE

Fifteen or twenty of the samurai -- including Algren and Katsumoto--
somehow manage to fight their way through the lines.

They break into the open.

And continue riding straight toward the rear.

ALGREN AND KATSUMOTO

Are both wounded, yet still they charge. They have only one thought in
mind -- death to their enemies. They gallop forward toward Bagley and Omura.

BAGLEY

Looks around in abject terror. He screams out an order.

TWO WAGONS

Are moving into position. Their rear gates fall open ... revealing the GATILING GUNS.

ALGREN AND KATSUMOTO

Are near enough to see them. Yet they will not be deterred.

They charge on.


Up ahead.

THE GATLING GUNS

Are not yet ready to fire. Japanese soldiers slam ammo belts into the chambers.

ALGREN, KATSUMOTO AND THE REMAINING SAMURAI


Have almost reached their goal.

BAGLEY

Cowers in fear, looks around, but there is nowhere to hide.

THE SAMURAI CHARGE

Even while riding at I full gallop, they have fixed arrows into their long

                                                                                                       114.
bows. They let loose a lethal volley.

BAGLEY

                                             BAGLEY
                            Fire! Fire, dammit!!!!!

But before the guns can open up, he is IMPALED BY ARROW AFTER
ARROW, a human pincushion. The final arrow pierces his forehead.

Then...

The Gatling Guns finally fire. Ripping into the samurai-


Destroying them-

One after another is hit -- and still they come -- their voices raised in glorious cries of triumph-

Graham watches from a hilltop, tears in his eyes.

Katsumoto is hit, blood explodes .- his horse falls -- he spi1ls off--

Then Algren is hit -- he falls--

Algren drags himself to Katsumoto, bullets exploding ever ywhere ­

Algren looks up to see...

The remaining samurai still charging-

And still the Gatling Guns tear through them--

And still they charge ­

Until they are all down.

EXT.             OPPOSING HILLTOP                           SUNSET

A Japanese Officer shouts out an order -- the Gatling Guns stop.

Omura screams at him to continue firing!

The Japanese officer barks out response. Refusing.

Omura sees all the samurai are dead or dying.

But he also sees Algren kneeling by Katsumoto, dragging him awa y. He
screams at the Japanese officer to resume fire!

The Japanese officer refuses.

He just looks over the plain of dying samurai for a moment. Then he does
the most remarkable thing.

He slowl y kneels and touches his head to the dirt.

                                                                                    115.
Then a soldier near him does the same thing. Then another and another.
And then by the thousands.

They kneel and touch their heads to the dirt.

Honoring the last samurai.


EXT.                PLAIN                    SUNSET

A1gren drags the dying Katsumoto to a8 copse of cherry trees nearby...

Both men are bleeding profusel y.

                                                   KATSUMOTO
                             Help me up...

                                                   ALGREN
                             Just -- stay there.

                                                   KATSUMOTO
                             Help me up.

Algren helps him to stand. Without Algren's support, he would fall.

                                                   KATSUMOTO
                             My sword...

                                                   ALGREN
                             No.

                                              KA TSUMOTO
                             You have your honor again. Let me die with
                             mine ... Kaishaku.

Algren looks at him, deeply moved. Katsumoto manages to pull out his short sword.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                             You must help me. Hold it firmly...

Algren supports Katsumoto as he holds the sword's point firmly to his stomach.

                                                   KA TSUMOTO
                             Are you ready?

                                                   ALGREN
                             No, Kaishaku.

                                                                                     116.
 Katsumoto looks at him deepl y, warmly.

                                                 KATSUMOTO
                               We will ride together again.

Katsumoto embraces Algren firmly -- the sma1l sword impales him

Algren holds him tightly. Katsumoto is looking over Algren's shoulder as he dies.

Katsumoto sees something. A look of joy and absolute peace comes to his features.

                                                   KATSUMOTO
                                         (whispers)
                               It is perfect... They are all perfect.

His eyes cl ose. He is dead.

Algren gently kneels with Katsumoto's body

He holds him for a moment and then turns to see what Katsumoto was looking at.

Cherry blossoms.


A display of perfect beauty.


We slowl y fade to...


INT.               IMPERIAL PALACE -- THRONE                            ROOM DAY


Ambassador Swanbeck, Omura, and a retinue of advisors are presenting the
treaty documents for the Emperor's signature. The Emperor sits restively
on his throne.


                                                  AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
                               ...will usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity
                               and cooperation between our two great nations.
A servant comes and whispers into the Emperor's ear.

                                                   OMURA
                                         (subtitles)
                               Highness, if we could just conclude the matter
                               at hand...

The Emperor ignores Omura, and gestures that the doors to the chamber be opened.

Algren enters with Graham. Algren carries something wrapped in a blanket.
He approaches the Emperor. Kneels and sets the bundle at the Emperor's feet.
Algren remains kneeling with his head bowed. He unwraps the bundle.

                                                                                    117.
It is Katsumoto's long samurai sword.


'The Emperor looks at it.

                                               OMURA
                                     (subtitled)
                            All your enemies are dead, Enlightened One.

The Emperor continues to look at the sword. He does not look up.

                                            EMPEROR/TRANSLATOR
                                   (to Algren)
                            You were with him at the end.

                                              ALGREN/TRANSLA TOR
                            Yes. He asked that I bring you this -- that the
                            strength of the samurai will be with you alwa ys.

The Emperor rises from his chair and sits on the floor, in the traditional
Japanese fashion, before the sword.

                                               OMURA
                                     (after a moment)
                            En1ightcned One, we all weep for his loss, but
                            the future of our country lies in-


The Emperor interrupts him, speaking in English -- to ever yone's surprise.

                                               EMPEROR
                            My ancestors have ruled Japan for 2,000 years.
                            And for all that time we have slept. During my
                            sleep I have dreamed. I dreamed of a unified
                            Japan. Of a country strong and independent and
                            modern...
                                     (touches the sword lovingly)
                            And now we are awake. We have railroads and
                            cannon and Western clothing. But we cannot
                            forget who we are. Or where we come from.

The Emperor looks up at the gathered dignitaries.
               .
                                              EMPEROR
                          Ambassador Swanbeck I have concluded that your treaty
                          is not in the best interests of my people.

                                              AMBASSADOR SWANDECK
                            Sir, if I may--

                                              EMPEROR
                            You may not. From this moment on, economic investment
                            from ever y nation will be considered equally.

                                                                                      118.

Ambassador Swanbeck is stunned.

                                            AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
                          This is an outrage--

The Emperor gestures. A servant escorts Swanbeck to the exit. Omura takes a step
closer to the Emperor.

                                            OMURA
                                  (subtitled)
                          Enlightened One, we should discuss this

                                            EMPEROR
                                  (subtitled)
                          Omura, do you know our northern island?

Omura is confused.

                                              EMPEROR
                                    (subtitled)
                          There is a small one called Taraku. A rock in the sea.
                          There is nothing there but crabs who have been known
                          to tear a sleeping man apart ... I have had a small house
                          constructed on the island. You will go there now and
                          await our summons.

                                             OMURA
                                    (subtitled)
                          Sir...?


                                             EMPEROR
                                   (subtitled)
                          I hereby seize your family's assets and present them
                          as my gift to the people.

Omura looks at him, stunned.

                                             EMPEROR
                                   (subtitled)
                          Further, I have decided to stop the railroad cxpansion
                          into Yoshino.

                                            OMURA
                                  (subtitled)
                          Enlightened One

                                             EMPEROR
                                   (subtitled)
                          You have served your function. I have no more
                          need of you ... You can conspire with the crabs
                          now. Remove yourself.

                                                                                         119.
                                                OMURA
                                      (protests, subtitled)
                             Honored Emperor, I do not know wh y you
                             disgrace me.

The Emperor finally looks up from the sword.

                                                EMPEROR
                                      (subtitled)
                             If your shame is too unbearable ... I offer you
                             this sword.

Omura looks at him for a moment. Then bows tersely and goes.

The Emperor looks at Algren, still kneeling before him.

                                              EMPEROR
                                     (in English again)
                             The samurai is not a man now. He is an idea.
                                     (a beat)
                             Tell me how he died.

Algren looks At the Emperor.

                                                ALGREN
                             I will tell you how he lived.

We slowl y fade as Algren begins to speak...

Spring. A few years later.

There are no samurai training in the square, but otherwise the village is
bustling with life. We HEAR Graham's voice:

                             ...And so the days of the samurai had ended.

Graham stands at a lectern on a book tour. A well-dressed audience listens
attentivel y. A banner proclaims, "The Last Samurai," by Simon Graham.

                                                GRAHAM (V.O.)
                             And in the years to come the Rising Sun of Imperial Japan
                             would fl y in triumph over Korea, over Russia, even over
                             China. Nations, like men, it is sometimes said, have
                             their own destiny

We see that Yoritomo's house has finally been completed.. Toshiie sits on the porch,
Instructing a group of younger children in calligraphy.

                                                                                    120.
                                            GRAHAM (V.O.)
                           As for the American Captain, no one knows
                           what became of him. All that is left is his journal
                           which I have published, according to his last request.

Taka steps from the house and passes Toshiie, she carries a basket. We
move through the village with her...

                                             GRAHAM (V.O.)
                           Some lay he died of his wounds, others that he
                           returned to his own country...

She passes an old man teaching the Noh drama to a group of teenagers.

She passes Higen, working on a new building. Apparently he has found a
good life as a carpenter. He seems content.

We go with Taka as she leaves the village...

Taka moves through the cherry orchard.

                                              GRAHAM (V.O.)
                           But I like to think he may have found at last
                           some small measure of the peace we all seek,
                           but few of us ever find.

Taka stops. Watching. We follow her gaze to discover:

Algren, sitting alone. Gazing peacefully sat the cherry bl ossoms.


Waiting for the perfect one. He turns to her, a smile of quiet joy spreads
across his face.

          Vast.    Barren.   No signs of life.

                                WOMAN'S VOICE
                      When I was a little girl, my mother
                      would remind me each night before
                      bed to be sure to open my heart to
                      God, for he was kind, merciful and
                      just. Things changed after my
                      father left a few years later,
                      leaving her to raise me and my
                      brothers alone in a little place
                      out on the edge of the Mojave
                      Desert. She never talked about a
                      kind and merciful God again.
                      Instead she spoke of a prophecy.
                      Of a time when all the world would
                      be covered in darkness and the fate
                      of Mankind would be decided. One
                      night I finally got up the courage
                      to ask my mother why God had
                      changed, why was he mad at his
                      children. "I don't know," she
                      said, tucking the covers around me,
                      "I guess he just got tired of all
                      the bullshit."
          And with these words the last trace of sunlight is SNUFFED
          OUT, leaving us in:

          DARKNESS...
          A darkness filled with the sounds of SIRENS, GLASS
          SHATTERING, SPORADIC GUNFIRE...a CITY FALLING INTO CHAOS.
          TITLE:   "Los Angeles, December 23rd - 1:02 a.m."

          

          A BLOOD RED MOON
          reflected in a greasy puddle of water. Might just be the
          smog that's making it that ominous color. Then we notice
          something moving in the reflection. A dark shape, growing,
          coming down at us fast. Beat...then WHAM!

          TWO BLACK BOOTS
          land hard in the water...and we're in:

          

                                                                      2.

          

          

          

          EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - LATE NIGHT

          A DARK FIGURE in a tattered trench coat tumbles onto the
          pavement, hands out to slow the impact. A beat then slowly
          he climbs to his feet, recovering from what seems to have
          been quite a fall. He has chiseled features, shaved head,
          deep-set eyes. Looks like he's been through one hell of a
          fight.
          His name, we will come to know, is MICHAEL.
          He quickly checks out his surroundings, nothing but brick
          walls above him. Where'd this guy jump from?
          A RUMBLE of thunder...then RAIN starts to hammer down.   Seems
          to motivate him.
          Michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body and dashes
          toward the mouth of the alley. He reaches the STREET just in
          time to see a FLEET OF POLICE CARS tearing around the corner,
          SIRENS WAILING, heading this way.
          He reels back into the alley way, ducks down behind a trash
          dumpster, as the BLUE AND RED LIGHTS of the POLICE CARS whip
          past.
          Michael waits for the lights to disappear, then he pulls a
          MASSIVE ORNATE KNIFE from his jacket. Considers it grimly.
          Runs his finger along its edge. Blood beads up. Razor
          sharp.
          Michael begins to peel off his overcoat, revealing his bare
          chest underneath...and skin literally covered with DARK
          TATOOS. Hard to see what they are in this light.
          As his coat falls to the ground, we DRIFT over to the BRICK
          WALL behind him where we see MICHAEL'S SHADOW crouch over,
          and then...

          ...TWO LARGE SHAPES UNFOLD FROM HIS BACK, STRETCHING UP INTO

          WHAT ARE UNMISTAKABLY...THE SHADOW OF WINGS.
          The RAIN POUNDS harder, as if punishment from the heavens.
          The glint of the KNIFE coming down fast.

          A HORRENDOUS SOUND OF FLESH TEARING AWAY FROM BONE...

          ...THE BLOODY KNIFE CLATTERING TO THE PAVEMENT...

          ...FOLLOWED BY MICHAEL'S UNGODLY SCREAM RISING UP FROM THE
          ALLEY WAY. And then SILENCE...

          CLOSE ON THE GUTTER, AS BLOOD BEGINS TO FLOW FREELY, MIXING,

          SWIRLING WITH THE RAIN...

          

                                                                     3.

          

          

          

          EXT. CITY STREET - A SHORT WHILE LATER

          Michael, face tight with pain, trench coat back on, steps out
          of the alley, stares with determination at a dark storefront
          across the street.

          "GUN & SPORT WORLD"

          

          INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - A SHORT WHILE LATER

          Cavernous. A Costco for survivalists.    Quiet except for the
          sound of RAIN, then...
          SMASH! Michael drops down through one of the skylights in a
          shower of glass.

          

          INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Michael bursts in. Tosses a first-aid kit into the sink.
          His trench coat falls to the floor and here in the
          fluorescent light, we get a better look at him.
          His thin but stunningly well muscled body is TATTOOED
          shoulder to ankle with INTRICATE WRITING. The man's flesh is
          a living book. But the writing is in no language we
          recognize.
          He turns his back to the mirror, revealing two HORRIFICALLY
          OPEN WOUNDS running down between both shoulder blades.

          FRESH. BLOODY.
          He threads a needle not with thread, but with FISHING WIRE,
          and begins to STITCH the wounds closed. BLOOD POOLS on the
          cement floor around his feet.

          

          INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - MOMENTS LATER

          Trench coat and a shirt back on, Michael races along the
          ENDLESS RACKS OF GUNS, searching for just the right weapons,
          his every movement precise, as if he's trained his whole life
          for this.
          Weapon after ferocious weapon gets tossed into rifle bags.
          Whatever this guy's preparing for, it's big.
          Rifle bags filled, Michael heads for the exit.   Stops cold.
          The place is locked up tight.   Metal gate over the front
          doors, bars over the windows.   How the hell's he going to get
          out of here?

          

                                                                         4.

          

          

          

          INT. LAPD SQUAD CAR - DRIVING - SAME

          Two COPS, world weary, cruise through downtown. That's
          BURTON behind the wheel, ESTEVEZ riding shotgun.
          The POLICE RADIO is ABUZZ WITH ACTIVITY.      Busy night.
          Burton stares out at the city's rain soaked denizens with a
          deep hatred, the shadows looming in doorways, the
          streetwalkers.

                              BURTON
                    Goddamn' animals. Nights like this
                    I wish I could take a match to this
                    city just so I could watch all
                    these motherfuckers burn.

                              ESTEVEZ

                        (LAUGHS)
                    A good ol' boy barbecue, huh?
          Burton doesn't even smile.       He's dead fucking serious.

                              BURTON
                    A fresh start. That's what this
                    place needs.
          He holds his finger up like a pistol. Aims it at the people
          they pass, picking them off one by one.

                                  BURTON
                    Pow!   Pow!     Pow!
          Now Burton laughs, a dark, mean laugh.      Estevez eyes his
          partner, wary.

                              ESTEVEZ
                    Jesus... You know Burton, I'm so
                    happy we get to share beautiful
                    moments like this. They really
                    brighten my da--
          KABOOM! Through the WINDSHIELD, we see a storefront EXPLODE
          just ahead, raining fiery debris onto the squad car.
          Burton slams on the breaks and the cops look up just in time
          to see...

          

          EXT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - CONTINUOUS

          Michael, bulging rifle bags in each hand, stepping brazenly
          out of the GAPING HOLE he's blown in the front of the store.

          

                                                                      5.

          

          

                              ESTEVEZ (O.S.)
                    Freeze!
          Estevez and Burton are already out of the squad car,
          crouching behind the open doors, GUNS trained on Michael.

                              ESTEVEZ
                    Drop the bags! Hands on your head!
          In the distance, the POP-POP of GUNFIRE. The POLICE RADIO
          CRACKLES with URGENT CHATTER. MANY VOICES TALKING AT ONCE.
          "Shots fired...Code Three...Officer down!"
          The cops shift about nervously, trying to stay focused.

                              MICHAEL
                        (sensing their unease:)
                    It's starting. There isn't much
                    time.
          The cops shoot a quick, anxious glance at each other -- "what
          the hell?" -- then they turn back to Michael.

                              BURTON
                    Shut the fuck up and drop the bags
                    now!
          Michael lets the gun bags hit the ground.

                              ESTEVEZ
                    Hands on your head!    On your head!
          Michael slowly places his palms on his skull.

                              BURTON
                    Turn around! Turn the fuck around!
          Michael slowly turns around.    Calm.
          Estevez rushes in to restrain Michael, grabbing his wrist,
          FINGERS TIGHTENING. Michael closes his eyes, a terrible
          decision made.
          And that's when he moves, a fucking blur!
          In an instant Michael's broken the cop's arm, spinning him
          helplessly around, turning him into a human shield. Now it's
          Michael who's in charge, gun to Estevez's head, facing off
          with Burton.
          Burton struggles to find a shot, can't.

                              BURTON
                    Let `em go!

          

                                                                     6.

          

          

                              ESTEVEZ
                    Take the shot, Burton!

                              BURTON
                    I said let `em fuckin' g-g-g-g--
          Suddenly Burton starts to SHAKE, the words stuck in his
          throat like a skipping record.

                               ESTEVEZ
                    Burton!?
          THE STREET LAMPS BEGIN TO FLICKER AND STROBE, adding to the
          confusion.
          Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his WHOLE BODY
          QUAKING, heels CLICKING the pavement, as if some massive
          pressure were building inside him.
          And with the horrific sound of CRACKING BONES, BURTON'S MOUTH

          BEGINS TO TWIST INTO AN IMPOSSIBLY WIDE SMILE LIKE A BIZARRE

          CLOWN!
          His eyes SNAP OPEN, focused, the force inside him now fully
          in control.
          Burton looks at Michael with calm recognition, his voice
          GUTTURAL..INHUMAN. A man possessed.

                              BURTON
                    What are you doing, Michael?   These
                    weren't your orders.
          Estevez looks at his partner with confusion.

                              ESTEVEZ
                    What did you say?
          Michael, however, seems to know exactly who he's talking to.

                              MICHAEL
                    I'm following my own orders now.

                              BURTON
                    Then you will die along with the
                    child.

                              ESTEVEZ
                    Burton, you fuckin' know this guy?!
          BLAM! Burton shoots his partner in the head. Estevez drops,
          leaving Michael without cover. Burton re-aims, but Michael's
          faster, already FIRING back.
          Bullets rip up the concrete. SMASH!   The squad car window
          SHATTERS, Burton's chest EXPLODING!

          

                                                                    7.

          

          
          And down he GOES, leaving Michael the only one left standing.
          Smoke rising from his gun.
          With soldier-like efficiency, Michael picks up the rifle bags
          and begins to load them into the trunk of the squad car.
          He gets in the car and FLOORS IT, ROARING AWAY, as the
          FLICKERING STREET LAMPS FINALLY GO OUT IN RAPID SUCCESSION, a
          wave chasing him, PLUNGING THE ENTIRE CITY INTO DARKNESS...

                                                        SMASH CUT TO:

          

          JEEP HANSON (LATE TEENS)
          Bolts awake.   Breathing hard.   Covered with sweat.

          

          INT. JEEP'S ROOM - JUST BEFORE DAWN

          Jeep switches on a lamp, illuminating this incredibly cramped
          bedroom. Not much larger than the bed itself. He's got
          shaggy hair, a sensitive face, clearly not big on sunlight.

          

          EXT. DESERT - PRE-DAWN

          A couple of ancient SILVERSTREAM TRAILERS are bathed in the
          eerie blue light of night's final moments. It looks like the
          trailers haven't moved from this patch of barren ground in
          decades. A single strand of colored Christmas lights dot the
          trailers roof lines, marking the season.
          One of the trailer doors CREAKS open and Jeep steps wearily
          out into the cool western morning. Home.
          Nothing but desert for miles in all directions, save for a
          two lane HIGHWAY and a weather beaten TRUCK STOP DINER that
          Jeep and his father will open for business in a few hours.
          Jeep gazes up to the diner's slanted roof where a large sign
          glows like a beacon in the darkness:

          "PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB"
          A beat as Jeep contemplates the sign.

                              CHARLIE (O.S.)
                    You okay, Jeep?
          Jeep turns to see CHARLIE, a very pregnant girl of about
          twenty, standing in the trailer doorway, rubbing the sleep
          from her eyes. Even with the trailer-trash veneer, she's
          strikingly beautiful.

          

                                                                8.

          

          

                              JEEP
                    Sorry to wake you, Charlie.

                              CHARLIE
                        (stepping out of the
                         trailer, hands on her

                         BELLY)
                    Wasn't you. He's been kickin' up a
                    storm all night. Must know
                    somethin' I don't.
          She approaches Jeep.   Sees the strain in his eyes.

                              CHARLIE
                    Another bad dream?
          He struggles for a moment, nods.

                               CHARLIE
                    It's just stress, Jeep, that's all.
                    You do too much worryin'. About
                    this place. About your dad.

                        (BEAT)
                    About me...
          A glimmer of a smile crosses Jeep's face.

                              JEEP
                    You're the only thing I like
                    worrying about.

                              CHARLIE
                    See what I mean? You're worried
                    about a girl eight months pregnant
                    and it isn't even your baby. Now
                    that's enough to give anybody
                    nightmares.
          Jeep turns away, dejected.

                              JEEP
                    Go ahead, make fun of me.
                    Everybody else does.

                              CHARLIE
                        (turns him back around)
                    C'mon, I was only kiddin'. You
                    know how much I appreciate
                    everything you and Bob are doing
                    for me, but a month from now, this
                    baby'll have a new family and I'll
                    have to start thinkin' about what
                    the hell I'm doin' with my life.
          This is not news Jeep wants to hear.

          

                                                                      9.

          

          

                              JEEP
                    So you're still going through with
                    it...?

                              CHARLIE
                    Jeep, I'm not ready to be a mama.
                    Christ, I can barely take care of
                    myself as it is.

                              JEEP
                    I could help you. We could do it
                    together, you know? I want to.
          Charlie smiles sadly at him, touched by his sweetness, but
          this just isn't where she's at.

                              CHARLIE
                    You gotta stop carryin' the weight
                    of the world on your shoulders.
          Jeep nods, tries to hide the fact that he's dying inside.

                              CHARLIE
                        (rubbing her arms)
                    Now can we go back in? I'm
                    freezing my ass off out here.

                               JEEP
                    Go on.   I'll be right there.
          Charlie kisses him on the cheek and heads back to the
          trailer. He watches her, longing in his eyes. With the
          clank of the door, she's gone.
          And over Jeep's troubled look, the perennial holiday cheer of
          FRANK CAPRA'S "IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE" MIXES up.

                              JIMMY STEWART (V.O.)
                    I don't know whether I like it very
                    much being seen around with an
                    angel without any wings.

                                                            CUT TO:

          

          IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE PLAYING ON A CRUMMY TV
          Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey has just met Clarence, his
          guardian angel-in-training. The signal ROLLS and SNOWS in
          and out. We hear a WHACK, which causes the image to
          momentarily improve and then slowly roll back the other way.

                              CLARENCE (ON TV)
                    Oh, I've got to earn them and
                    you'll help me, won't you?

          

                                                                  10.

          

          

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - DAY

          BOB HANSEN (late 40's), owner and proprietor of this fine
          roadside establishment, attempts to fix the old TV hanging in
          the corner above the counter by banging the shit out it.
          The restaurant itself has the kind of grungy diner charm
          you'd hope to find in a place last renovated in 1963. An old
          plastic Christmas tree strung with flickering lights and
          tinsel occupies a lonely corner. Next to that, a faded
          diorama of the NATIVITY SCENE. The kind you might order off
          the Shopping Network.
          Bob considers the TV with a frown. He deftly rolls an
          ENGRAVED SILVER ZIPPO back and forth over the nicotine
          stained fingers of his right hand. Must be a nervous habit.
          You can tell just by looking at the man that he's a beer
          drinker.
          Behind the counter, a black man named PERCY WALKER (60's) is
          cooking up a storm on the grill with spectacular one-handed
          dexterity. You do get pretty good at this sort of thing when
          your other hand has long been replaced by a METAL HOOK.   The
          dog tags around his neck tell the story. His white cook's
          hat has been temporarily replaced by a red Santa hat.

                              PERCY
                    Lord as my witness, Bob, one of
                    these days that thing's gonna hit
                    you back.

          WHACK!

                              BOB
                    Whaddya talkin' about, Percy? We
                    got a special relationship here.

          WHACK!

                              PERCY
                    Yeah, they got names for that kind
                    a relationship.
          The JUKEBOX on the other side of the diner starts up with the
          MERLE HAGGARD tune "I'M A LONESOME FUGITIVE".
          A stunning looking sixteen-year-old GIRL with dyed-black hair
          and a piercing or three, is leaning seductively over the
          jukebox, swaying gently to the music. The headband doubling
          as her mini-skirt reveals her knock-out figure in a way that
          really doesn't leave much up to the imagination. She's a
          billboard of rebellion.

                              SANDRA (O.S.)
                    It's disgusting.

          

                                                                  11.

          

          

                              HOWARD (O.S.)
                    You're right. It is disgusting.
          Watching the scintillating action from a booth across the
          diner is a conservatively dressed SUBURBAN COUPLE. SANDRA
          and HOWARD ANDERSON. Fish out of water.

                              SANDRA
                    Really, how can she go out in
                    public wearing that?

                              HOWARD
                    I don't know. Why don't we just
                    ask her?

                              SANDRA
                    Howard, don't. You'll embarrass
                    me.

                              HOWARD
                        (shouting across the

                         DINER)
                    Audrey, honey? Your mother was
                    wondering if you got dressed this
                    morning with the specific intention
                    of showing your ass off to the
                    entire world?
          The girl who we now know as AUDREY ANDERSON turns to Howard
          with a caustic smile.

                               AUDREY
                    Yeah, that's cuz I woke up hoping
                    to get double teamed by a couple of
                    meth head truckers in the bathroom
                    of some desert shithole.

                        (BEAT)
                    Good thing we stopped here.
          And with that she turns back to the jukebox. Percy watches
          the exchange discreetly from behind the counter. Loving it.
          Howard turns back to his wife.   Rigid smile.

                              HOWARD
                    I feel satisfied with that answer.
                    I really do.
          Sandra buries her face in her hands.

                              SANDRA
                    I'm being punished for something, I
                    know it.

          

                                                                    12.

          

          
          Across the diner, Audrey goes back to swaying dreamily to the
          music, which is suddenly overtaken by BASS BUMPIN' HIP-HOP.

                                                              CUT TO:

          

          DRIFTING OVER A VAST EXPANSE OF WESTERN DESERT
          The noontime sun bakes the strip of highway slicing through
          this barren country.
          A BLACK CADILLAC ESCALADE blazes a path.   HEAVY BEATS thunder
          from within.

          

          INT. ESCALADE - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

          The stereo in this rig could shake mountains. KYLE WILLIAMS
          (late 20's) handsome as hell, thug style. A straight up bad
          boy.
          He passes a weathered road sign:

          "ENTERING PARADISE FALLS, NEXT SERVICES 50 MILES"
          Kyle's expression says this is not good news.
          He grabs his cell phone off the passenger seat.   No signal.

                              KYLE
                    Shit...
          He spots the truck stop diner just up the road ahead...

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          The Escalade pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the
          lonely row of old gas pumps.
          Kyle gets out and surveys the scenery with dismay. Now in
          the daytime we see this is truly a place time forgot.
          Attached to the diner is a MECHANIC'S BAY. Grease stains and
          rusty car parts litter the ground. Behind the place is the
          SILVERSTREAM TRAILER we saw Jeep step out of earlier.
          The only thing here that looks fairly new is the UHAUL TRUCK
          parked in front of the garage with its hood up.
          Kyle grabs a crumpled hand drawn map from the front seat and
          flattens it out on the roof of the car. He spins it around.
          Which way is north?

          

                                                                   13.

          

          

                               KYLE
                    Darren, your fuckin' directions
                    suck, man.
          He checks his cell phone again. No chance of a signal way
          out here. So he shuffles around to the side of the diner in
          search of a pay phone.
          The good news is that he finds one.   The bad news is that
          it's been broken for ten years.
          Leaning next to the broken phone, however, is Charlie wearing
          a shabby, faded WAITRESS uniform stretched tight around her
          very pregnant belly. Adding to her perfect mother-to-be look
          is that cigarette dangling from her lips. The plastic name
          tag pinned to her chest says "CHARLIE".

                              KYLE
                    Hey...
          She eyes him, mildly intrigued, takes a drag.

                              KYLE
                    You know that shit right there
                    ain't good for the baby.
          She lets out a long slow exhale.

                              CHARLIE
                    Guess I should think `bout quittin'
                    then.

                              KYLE
                    Now hold on, girl, let me bum one
                    before you do.

                              CHARLIE
                    You can buy a whole pack inside.

                              KYLE
                    Tell ya what. You let me have one
                    of yours, and I'll give you two
                    from the new pack you're gonna sell
                    me.
          She considers him for a moment, then pulls out a cigarette.
          Lights it off the end of hers then hands it to him. Kyle
          takes a drag, pulls out his crumpled map.

                              KYLE
                    Am I in the right place?

                              CHARLIE
                        (peers at the map)
                    Only if nowhere's right, `cause
                    that's where you are.

          

                                                                    14.

          

          

                              KYLE
                    Sonuvabitch. There another phone
                    around here? You know, one that
                    works?

                              CHARLIE
                    Bob'll probably let you use the
                    diner phone if you ask him real
                    nice...And pay `im somethin'.

                              KYLE
                    I can handle that.   You got
                    pancakes here?

                              CHARLIE
                    Yeah, we got a buttermilk stack for
                    three seventy-five. We also got
                    french toast for four dollars if
                    you're into that. I personally
                    like the pancakes though.

                              JEEP (O.S.)
                    You okay, Charlie?
          They both turn to see Jeep behind the diner, wearing
          mechanic's coveralls and holding a DUSTY OLD CRIB. Charlie
          quickly hides her cigarette behind her back. Busted.

                              CHARLIE
                    Yeah, I'm okay. This guy's just
                    lost.
          Jeep nods, uncertain, eyes Kyle another moment, then he
          shuffles along out of sight. Charlie brings the cigarette
          back up to her lips. An awkward beat.

                              KYLE
                    Three seventy-five, huh?

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - DAY

          The DOOR JINGLES.   Charlie and Kyle enter.
          Audrey's eyes light up when she sees Kyle. He notices her as
          well. How couldn't he? She's directing every ounce of sex
          appeal she has in his direction.
          Her parents, on the other hand, shoot a look of utter fear in
          Kyle's direction, as if he personified their worst suburban
          nightmare.
          Charlie heads to the register. Digs out a fresh pack of
          smokes from underneath the counter.

          

                                                                 15.

          

          

                              CHARLIE
                    I hope Salem Lights are okay,
                    `cause that's all we got left.

                              KYLE
                    If I can smoke `em, I'll take `em.

                              BOB (O.S.)
                    Where ya been, Charlie?
          Bob steps off the chair.

                              BOB
                    This ain't a resort you know.    I
                    got orders stacking up here.
          In truth there aren't any orders stacking up, but it
          certainly makes Bob feel better to say it.

                              BOB
                        (sees the two cigarettes
                         Kyle's handing her)
                    You best not be smokin' again.    Not
                    in your condition.

                              CHARLIE
                        (gestures to the diner)
                    Bob, do you see where am I right
                    now? Can my condition really get
                    any worse? `Sides, you ain't one
                    to talk.

                               BOB
                    What?   I quit two years ago.

                              CHARLIE
                    Yeah, so why you still carryin'
                    that fancy lighter `round for?

                              BOB
                    It was a gift from my ex-wife,
                    alright? I'm sentimental. I don't
                    wanna forget how much I hate her
                    guts.

                               KYLE
                    Hey man?
          Bob turns to Kyle.   Doesn't like what he sees.

                              KYLE
                    Can I use your phone? My cell
                    doesn't get a signal out here and
                    the pay phone outside is busted.
          Bob is about to respond when:

          

                                                                  16.

          

          

                              HOWARD (O.S.)
                    Excuse me...?
          Howard approaches, oblivious to the conversation he's
          interrupting.

                               HOWARD
                    Any news about when our truck might
                    be fixed? You said your boy would
                    have us on the road two hours ago.
                    The rate we're going, we'll be
                    lucky to make it to Scottsdale by
                    Christmas.
          Bob's expression darkens at this news.

                              BOB
                    Goddamn it. Where the hell is
                    Jeep?

                                                             CUT TO:

          

          A GRIMY PIECE OF WOOD
          A cloth wipes away the dirt, revealing the partial image of
          an ANGEL carved into the surface.

          

          INT. MECHANIC'S BAY - CONTINUOUS

          Jeep is carefully cleaning the old wooden crib on a
          workbench. There's an unsettling intensity in his eyes, as
          if fear itself were driving him.

                              BOB (O.S.)
                    Hey, Leonardo...!
          Jeep freezes, knows he's in trouble He reluctantly turns to
          see his father standing next to the Anderson's broken-down
          Uhual.

                              BOB
                    The fact that this truck's hood's
                    up mean anything to you?
          Jeep stares at the ground.   Couldn't be anymore
          uncomfortable.

                              JEEP
                    Yeah...

                              BOB
                        (approaches, peering past
                         him to the crib)

                              (MORE)

          

                                                                 17.

          
                              BOB (cont'd)
                    Whaddya workin' on that's so
                    goddamn important you're not doin'
                    your job?

                                 JEEP
                    Nothin'...
          Jeep tries feebly to block his path, fails.
          Bob looks down at the crib with dismay.

                              JEEP
                    Found it under a bunch of stuff in
                    the storage shed. I know you never
                    like to throw anything away...
          Bob considers him, softens.

                              BOB
                    Whaddya doin'?

                                 JEEP
                    What...?

                              BOB
                    Jeep, I like Charlie. I do. And I
                    think it's real good of you to lend
                    her a helping hand, but she is not
                    your responsibility.

                              JEEP
                        (heard this before, pushes
                         past him)
                    Oh whatever, leave me alone.

                              BOB
                    Don't walk away from me while I'm
                    talkin' to you!

          

          EXT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          Jeep walks out toward the gas pumps, but Bob's right
          alongside him, not giving up.

                              BOB
                    How long you gonna follow her
                    around like a puppy dog? Cleanin'
                    up the messes she makes while she
                    steps out with every guy around
                    here other than you?!
          Jeep stiffens.   Turns to his father:

                              JEEP
                    Don't say that about her!     She's
                    not like that!

          

                                                          18.

          

          
          Bob gives Jeep a hard stare.    Yeah, she is.

                              BOB
                    You really think she's gonna stick
                    around here after that baby's born
                    and off her hands?
          Jeeps shakes his head, burns.

                              JEEP
                    Look, I know it doesn't make any
                    sense to you, but it's just
                    something I have to do.
          Bob sighs, feels for his boy.

                               BOB
                        (points up at the PARADISE
                          FALLS sign)
                    See that up there? Your mother
                    thought I was crazy for wanting to
                    buy this place, middle of
                    nowhere...But I just knew this was
                    what I was supposed to do. Told
                    your mom, "just wait." Told her
                    when they finally ran the freeway
                    through here like they were
                    plannin' on, this place would be
                    like Grand Central Station.

                        (BEAT)
                    But I was wrong. The freeway never
                    came and now the only people who
                    ever stop here are the ones who are
                    lost.

                        (BEAT)
                    And your mom? Well she got tired
                    of waitin'.

                              JEEP
                    C'mon Dad. You can't blame
                    yourself for what she did--

                               BOB
                    Yeah, I can. And I'm sayin' you're
                    about to make the same damn mistake
                    I made, believing in something
                    that's never gonna happen...Or
                    someone.

                        (BEAT)
                    It's time for you to move on from
                    this place, Jeep. I don't wanna
                    see you wake up one morning old and
                    pissed off, realizing you're lost
                    just like everybody else who stops
                    here.

          

                                                                     19.

          

          
          Jeep looks up at his father, his words hanging heavily.    A
          tough pill to swallow.

                              BOB
                    Now get to work on that truck. I
                    wanna have these people on the road
                    by nightfall.
          Bob walks back into the diner.
          Jeep is about to turn back to the garage when he notices
          something off in the distance.
          Ominous DARK CLOUDS line the horizon to the south like a
          living wall. He shifts his gaze up the highway to the north.
          Same thing. DARK CLOUDS are pushing their way over the
          distant mountains. A storm is coming.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

          Bob reenters the diner to find Kyle sitting at the counter,
          digging into a plate of banana pancakes.
          Kyle is about to address him again, when something else
          steals Bob's attention.

                               BOB
                        (holding up a silencing

                         HAND)
                    Yeah, wait a minute.
          The TV has gone on the fritz again.   Only now the image is
          mostly snow.
          Bob climbs back onto the chair.   Faces the TV.

                              BOB
                    What's wrong with you today?

          WHACK!
          The image flickers but doesn't improve.

                              PERCY
                    I told you to get the satellite TV.
                    But you don't wanna listen.

                              BOB
                    What the hell do I need that crap
                    for?

                              PERCY
                    History Channel, man!

          

                                                                    20.

          

          

                              BOB
                    I got all the history I can take.

                              CHARLIE
                    That's for sure.

                              BOB
                    What's your problem now?

          WHACK!

                              CHARLIE
                    Where do I start?

                              BOB
                    You know this was the top-of-the-
                    line model when I bought it.

                              CHARLIE
                    Yeah, in the Fifties.

                              BOB
                    You shouldn't be watchin' anyways.
                        (rubs his hands together)
                    Okay, baby, this is gonna do it.
          Bob gives the TV one final wallop -- WHACK!
          And the picture snaps into FOCUS.    Only it isn't the picture
          he was expecting.
          The STARK GRAPHIC OF THE EMERGENCY BROADCASTING SYSTEM and
          its accompanying HOLLOW TONE fill the diner.
          Everybody in the place stops and turns to the TV.

                               BOB
                    See?   Clear as day.

                              PERCY
                    Nice work, Bob. What the hell's
                    that?

                              BOB
                    It's just one of those test things.
          That'd be true, except for the words at the bottom of the
          screen, which read:

          "THIS IS NOT A TEST"
          Bob switches the channels.    All the same.

                              CHARLIE
                    Don't look like a test.

          

                                                                      21.

          

          
          Bob steps off the chair and backs slowly away from the TV as
          if a little distance will bring some clarity. He bumps into
          Kyle.

                               KYLE
                     Yo, am I the Invisible
                     motherfuckin' Man here?    Do you
                     have a phone or not?
          Kyle peels a five dollar bill off a serious WAD OF CASH.
          That gets Bob's attention. Bob snaps the money out of his
          hand.

                               BOB
                     In the back past the kitchen.   Make
                     it fast.
          Kyle hustles passed Percy.
          Charlie is standing by the Anderson's table, clearing dishes.
          Everybody's eyes are locked on the TV.

                               SANDRA
                     If there's a real emergency aren't
                     they supposed to give us some
                     information about what to do?

                               HOWARD
                     I'm sure it's a mistake.

                               BOB
                     Hey, Percy, give that old radio of
                     yours a shot. Maybe they got some
                     news about the TV.
          Percy grabs an old battery powered radio off a kitchen shelf.
          Switches it on.
          STATIC.   He spins the dial until he reaches a clear signal.
          The same HOLLOW TONE of Emergency Broadcasting.   Station
          after station the same thing.
          The diner is overwhelmed by a chilling chorus of HOLLOW
          TONES. Everyone goes very still.

                               KYLE (V.O.)
                     Let me talk to him...

          

          INT. DINER - BACK OFFICE - SAME

          Kyle sits at a messy desk in this dark, wood paneled back
          office, phone to his ear.

          

                                                                  22.

          

          

                               KYLE (CONT'D)
                        (on phone)
                    Cuz a father should be able to talk
                    to his son, that's why. Now put
                    `im on the phone.
                        (a beat then a smile)
                    Is that my little man...? Yeah,
                    well I'm working hard, so that I
                    can be with you. You bein' good?
                        (strange STATIC can be

                          HEARD)
                    Wait... You're breakin' up.
                    Hello...?
                        (hangs up in frustration)
                    Shit!
          Kyle stews a beat, then picks up the phone to redial.
          Frowns. No dial tone.

                              KYLE
                    What the hell...
          He keeps trying.    Nothing.

                              HOWARD (V.O.)
                    Maybe there was an earthquake?

          

          INT. DINER - SAME

          Everyone is looking at Howard.

                               HOWARD
                    They keep sayin' we're overdue for
                    a big one.

                              PERCY
                    Lot a folks could be hurt.

                              BOB
                    Not if it was centered in the
                    desert.

                                HOWARD
                    Exactly.    Could be nothing to worry
                    about.

                              SANDRA
                    So then why's the TV out?

                              HOWARD
                    Maybe it just hit the relay
                    stations. Aren't those usually in
                    remote areas?

          

                                                            23.

          

          

                              BOB
                    Yeah, `cause of the radiation they
                    give off.

                              PERCY
                    There ain't no radiation comin'
                    from those things. Plus that don't
                    explain the radio being out too.
                    Some of those stations broadcast
                    over hundreds of miles. Any quake
                    that big and we would a felt it.

                              CHARLIE
                    Percy's right. I didn't feel
                    nothing.

                              AUDREY
                    Maybe it's a terrorist attack or
                    something...?

                              SANDRA
                        (covers her mouth)
                    Oh god...
          Everyone considers that grimly, then:

                              BOB
                    Well, for cryin' out loud. There's
                    no use in speculating. I'll just
                    call my brother up in Needles. He
                    must a heard something.

                              KYLE (O.S.)
                    I don't think so.
          Kyle has reappeared in the diner.

                              BOB
                    Whaddya talkin' about?

                              KYLE
                    Phone's dead. Just tried to make a
                    call.

                              BOB
                    You're shittin' me.
          Kyle shakes his head, sits down at the counter.

                              SANDRA
                    Oh, this is just great.

                              BOB
                    Relax, Mrs. Anderson. Nothing to
                    get excited about. Probably just
                    working on the lines.

                              (MORE)

          

                                                                   24.

          
                              BOB (cont'd)
                    Sides, I'm sure Jeep'll have your
                    truck fixed up quick as can be, and
                    then you'll be on your way.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Jeep is buried under the Uhaul's hood, working at something
          with a socket wrench. It's not going well.

                               JEEP
                    Damn it!
          He pulls himself up. Grease covers his face and hands.       The
          sound of a CAR APPROACHING catches his attention.
          He watches as a beat up EIGHTIES CUTLASS SUPREME pulls off
          the highway and rolls to a stop at the pumps. It's a mystery
          how anyone could see through the LAYER OF DUST on that
          windshield.
          After a moment the car door pops open and the LEGS OF AN
          ELDERLY WOMAN swing down to the ground, followed by the metal
          frame and wheels of a walker.
          The LITTLE OLD LADY gets out of the car, steadies herself on
          the walker, and then slowly makes her way toward the diner
          with the rickety frailness of an old turtle. Jeep watches
          her disappear inside.
          He then looks toward the horizon again.   The WALL OF DARK
          CLOUDS are growing ever closer.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          A JINGLE as the old lady enters. She surveys the scene as if
          feasting on paradise. Maybe her eyes aren't so good.

                              CHARLIE
                    Have a seat wherever you want,
                    Ma'am. Specials are on the board.

                              OLD WOMAN
                    Thank you, dear.
          The old lady settles at a table across from the Andersons.
          She smiles at them pleasantly.
          Charlie is about to hand her a menu, when:

                              OLD WOMAN
                    Oh, I already know what I want.

                              CHARLIE
                    Okay, what'll it be?

          

                                                                    25.

          

          

                              OLD WOMAN
                    I'll have the steak, please.

                              CHARLIE
                    And how'd you like that cooked?

                              OLD WOMAN
                    Rare if you would. And water, no
                    ice.

                              CHARLIE
                    Coming right up.

                              OLD WOMAN
                    Charlie, is it?

                              CHARLIE
                    Yeah.

                              OLD WOMAN
                    What an unusual name for a girl.

                              CHARLIE
                    So they say. I'll be right back
                    with your water.
          The old lady turns to the Andersons.

                              OLD WOMAN
                    Hello, I'm Gladys. Gladys Foster.

                              SANDRA
                    Nice to meet you, Gladys. I'm
                    Sandra and this is my husband
                    Howard.

                              GLADYS
                    What a nice young couple you are.
                    What brings you out to these parts?

                              SANDRA
                    We're moving out to Scottsdale.
                    But our truck broke down, and so
                    we're stuck here while it's being
                    fixed.

                              GLADYS
                    Oh, what a nuisance.
          A FLY begins to buzz around Gladys's head.    She doesn't seem
          to notice it.

                              SANDRA
                    Say, Gladys, it seems the lines are
                    down around here. The phone and
                    TV, you know?

                              (MORE)

          

                                                                  26.

          
                              SANDRA (cont'd)
                    And I just was wondering if you
                    might have heard something on your
                    way up? You know, about what's
                    going on?
          Gladys smiles strangely.

                               GLADYS
                    Oh, don't worry yourself about
                    that, sweetheart. It'll all be
                    over soon.
          Sandra nods at the old woman, unsure of what to make of that
          response.
          The fly that was circling her head, now lands on GLADYS'S
          FACE. It crawls across her cheek without her reacting in the
          least.
          Howard and Sandra exchange looks.    Creepy.
          The door JINGLES and Jeep walks in. He heads straight for a
          quiet huddle with Bob. All the while though, he keeps one
          eye fixed on the old lady sitting at the table near the
          Andersons. Something about her...

                              JEEP
                    The carburetor's shot.    Don't know
                    why. Looks brand new.

                              BOB
                        (glances over at the

                         ANDERSONS)
                    Ah, shit. They're gonna be pissed.

                              JEEP
                    I could try to rebuild it, but it'd
                    take a while, and I don't think we
                    have all the parts. If we call
                    right now, we might be able to get
                    a new one down here tomorrow
                    morning.

                              BOB
                    That's not gonna happen.    Goddamn
                    phone's out.

                              JEEP
                    What?
          Across the diner, Charlie places a bloody red steak in front
          of Gladys.

                              GLADYS
                    Thank you, dear. How far along are
                    you?

          

                                                                    27.

          

          
          Charlie rests a hand on her belly.

                              CHARLIE
                    Just about there.

                              GLADYS
                    The father must be very proud.

                              CHARLIE
                    I wouldn't know.

                              GLADYS
                    You mean he's...

                              CHARLIE
                    Out of sight. Out of mind.

                                 GLADYS
                    Oh, I see.     So you're not married,
                    I take it?
          A fly lands on Gladys's steak. Charlie tries to wave it
          away. But another one lands in its place.

                                 CHARLIE
                    Nope.
          Gladys starts to dig in to the steak with a real
          ferociousness you wouldn't expect from an old lady.   More
          FLIES begin to land on her body. On her food.
          Charlie is still trying to wave them away.

                              GLADYS
                    That's too bad.

                              CHARLIE
                    No, I prefer it that way. I don't
                    a need a man tellin' me what to do.

                              GLADYS
                    But what about the baby?

                              CHARLIE
                    I've got it under control.

                              GLADYS
                    Yeah, but it's gonna burn.
          Charlie freezes. The Andersons turn to look as well.   Kyle
          glances over from the counter.

                              CHARLIE
                    What did you just say?

          

                                                                    28.

          

          

                              GLADYS
                        (all smiles)
                    I said your fucking baby's gonna
                    burn.
          Charlie shakes her head at the woman, not giving in.

                              CHARLIE
                    Go to hell, lady.
          She slaps the check down on the table and walks back toward
          the kitchen, passing Jeep and Bob.

                              BOB
                    What happened?

                              CHARLIE
                    Total fucking Jesus freak.
          Gladys begins to laugh innocently as she continues to devour
          her meat. Red juice drips down her chin. The flies are
          swarming now. How did so many get in here?
          Sandra and Howard are mortified at this sudden turn of
          events.

                              GLADYS
                    All those babies.    They're gonna
                    burn.

                              SANDRA
                    Gladys, please. There's no reason
                    to --
          Gladys's head suddenly whips toward her.

                              GLADYS
                    Shut up, you stupid fucking cunt!
                    All you do is complain! Complain!
                    Complain!
          Sandra covers her mouth in shock.    Everybody in the diner is
          now focused on the old lady.
          Howard gets up from the booth.

                              SANDRA
                    Howard, it's okay!     Don't listen to
                    her!
          But Howard's already standing over Gladys.

                              HOWARD
                    Who the hell do you think you are,
                    lady?! Now, I'd like you to
                    apologize to my --

          

                                                                    29.

          

          

          GLADYS LUNGES AT HOWARD AND TAKES A MONSTROUS BITE OUT OF HIS

          NECK! SHE PULLS BACK TO REVEAL A MOUTH FILLED WITH TINY

          RAZOR SHARP TEETH.
          EVERYBODY FREAKS as Howard crumbles to the floor.
          Gladys rockets to her feet, knocking her table over.   Blood
          covers her face and chest.

                              GLADYS
                    You're all going to fucking die!
          Percy is the first to react. From behind the counter, he
          whips a heavy metal frying pan at Gladys that knocks her head
          sideways. THWACK!
          BONES BREAK AND BURST FROM HER NECK.   Impossibly, Gladys is
          still standing.
          She lets out an INHUMAN SCREAM and SCRAMBLES ACROSS THE
          DINER, knocking tables and chairs over in her wake.
          Bob pulls a shotgun from behind the counter.

                              BOB
                    Don't move!
          But Gladys not only moves, SHE SCURRIES RIGHT UP THE FUCKING

          WALL LIKE SOME KIND OF BIZARRE CRAB!
          Bob can't believe his eyes. But he gets over it real fast,
          as the crab lady rushes toward him -- ACROSS THE CEILING --

          UPSIDE DOWN!
          BOB PUMPS THE SHOTGUN, trying to take her down, but he can't
          track her fast enough. Instead he blows ENORMOUS HOLES in
          the ceiling, a rain of plaster.
          Gladys drops down right in front of Bob.

                               BOB
                        (struggles to cock the

                          GUN)
                    Fuck!
          Gladys smiles sweetly before SLAPPING HIM CLEAR ACROSS THE

          ROOM!
          The shotgun clatters to the floor at Jeep's feet. He
          snatches it up and aims it at Gladys who turns calmly to face
          him.

                              PERCY
                    Shoot her, Jeep!
          Jeep's about to fire, when the old lady's EYES GO ALL WHITE.

          

                                                                       30.

          

          

                               GLADYS
                         (a sickly sweet smile)
                     You'll never save her.
          Jeep freezes, stunned by her words, overwhelming fear
          paralyzing him where he stands.

                               PERCY

                     SHOOT THE FUCKING BITCH!
          Gladys rockets straight at him!
          But Jeep's too afraid to move.    He clamps his eyes shut,
          bracing himself for the end.

          BLAM!   BLAM!   BLAM!
          A RAIN OF BULLETS RIP INTO GLADYS, taking her down like an
          animal.
          Jeep slowly opens his eyes.   His gun's still cocked.
          Gladys lies dead in a smoldering, bloody heap at his feet.
          He turns to see Kyle with smoke rising from the barrel of his
          silver plated WESTERN ARMS 45. If everyone wasn't so
          shocked, they'd probably be wondering why this guy is packing
          such serious heat.

                               SANDRA (O.S.)
                     Somebody help me!
          Sandra is on the floor with her husband.     Blood pours freely
          from his neck.
          Kyle stares at the dying man -- a moment of hesitation --
          then he rushes to help.

                               KYLE
                     Press your hands over the hole!
          Sandra looks fearfully up at Kyle, at the gun still in his
          hand.

                               KYLE
                     Don't look at me like that, lady!
                     I'm tryin' to fuckin' help you!
                     Now put your goddamn hands over the
                     hole before your husband bleeds to
                     death!
          Obeying, she cups her hands over the hole in his neck,
          desperately trying to stop the flow of blood leaking out
          between her fingers. Percy scrambles over with a first-aid
          kit and together he and Kyle get to work on Howard's neck.

          

                                                                    31.

          

          
          A few feet away, Charlie helps Bob, bruised and bleeding, to
          his feet.

                               BOB
                    The fuck was that?!   What the fuck
                    was that!?
          Across the diner, Audrey is pushed back into a booth, her
          knees pulled tightly to her chest, shivering. Her adult
          facade giving way to that of a frightened child
          A DROP OF RED HITS AUDREY'S CHEEK, causing her to look up and
          see Gladys's TRAIL OF BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THE CEILING. An
          ungodly horror.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Kyle, Percy, Sandra and Audrey frantically carry Howard, his
          neck bandaged, to the back of the Escalade.

          

          INT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS

          Howard lies in the back seat. Sandra by his head, clasping
          his hands in hers. Audrey by his feet. Percy rides shotgun.
          Kyle struggles to get the key in the ignition.
          The engine ROARS to life.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          The Escalade fishtails onto the highway.

          

          INT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS

          Kyle grips the wheel.   Picking up speed.

                              KYLE
                    How far to the hospital?

                              PERCY
                    Seventy, maybe eighty miles.
          Kyle shoots him a look. Eighty miles?! Pedal to the floor
          time. Audrey leans forward from the back seat.

                              AUDREY
                    What's that on the road?
          Up ahead, the DARK CLOUDS Jeep saw earlier have finally
          closed in, descending onto the highway like a WALL.

          

                                                                     32.

          

          

                               KYLE
                     They're fuckin' clouds!   What the
                     fuck do they look like?

                               AUDREY
                     Not clouds. Clouds don't buzz.
          She's right.    They're black... Undulating... BUZZING!

          PING!   PING!   PING!
          Suddenly HUNDREDS OF TINY BUGS begin to HIT the windshield --

          SPLAT!
          And that's when they realize it... Those aren't clouds.

          THEY'RE FLIES!
          The Escalade enters the SWARM. The car is PUMMELED by
          insects, the windshield instantly covered in BLACK AND RED
          bug guts. Driving blind!
          The sound of FLIES SPLATTERING and BUZZING is deafening!
          Everyone SCREAMS as hell surrounds them...

          

          INT. DINER BATHROOM - SAME

          Bob is hunched over the steaming sink, pounding a can of
          light beer. Jeep is leaning against the wall, looking like
          he's about to puke or faint.

                                BOB
                     I don't understand how she was
                     still standin' after Percy hit `er
                     with that goddamn fryin' pan.
                     Broke her fuckin' neck. I saw it.
                     I swear I did.

                         (BEAT)
                     And did you see that kid's gun?
                     The hell's he doin' with a gun like
                     that?
          Bob looks over at Jeep, sees him trembling.

                               BOB
                     It's okay, Jeep.   It's okay.
          But for Jeep it's not okay.   He's hurting real bad inside.

                               JEEP
                     I couldn't pull the trigger. I
                     froze. I saw what I needed to do,
                     but I was afraid...
                         (breaks down)
                     She could've killed you!

                               (MORE)

          

                                                                   33.

          
                              JEEP (cont'd)
                    Or Charlie...She would've killed me
                    if it wasn't for...
          He can't get the words out.   Bob rests a hand on his boy's
          shoulder.

                               BOB
                    There's nothin' to be ashamed of,
                    Jeep.

                        (BEAT)
                    Not everybody can play the hero.
          Before Jeep can respond, they hear the sound of the front

          DOOR JINGLE.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          Bob and Jeep appear from the back, as Kyle, Percy, Audrey and
          Sandra carry Howard into the diner, all of them stumbling,
          gasping for air. Charlie moves in to help.
          Percy races for the back.

                              BOB
                        (catching Percy by the

                         ARM)
                    Where you going?!

                              PERCY
                    To get my bible!

                              BOB
                    The hell you need that for?!

                               PERCY
                    Well somebody's gotta start
                    prayin'...
          Bob's about to respond when he hears the BUZZING.
          Bob, Charlie and Jeep slowly approach the windows to see the

          SOLID UNDULATING BLACK CURTAIN OF FLIES SURROUNDING THE TRUCK

          STOP'S PERIMETER A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OUT.
          Everything in the diner is suddenly cast in DARK RED as the
          day's remaining sunlight filters through the swarm.
          Apocalyptic.
          No one breathes.

                                                              CUT TO:

          

                                                                   34.

          

          

          

          A BLACK HAND AND A HOOK TEAR A SHIRT OPEN
          Revealing a bloody mess of muscles and tendons chewed down to
          the bone.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Percy and Charlie are tending to Howard. Sandra is holding
          her husband's hand, trying to comfort him, while Audrey
          watches from a distance with grim fascination.

                              PERCY
                        (raises a bottle of

                         ALCOHOL)
                    Okay, hold `em steady.

                              CHARLIE
                        (nods, peakish, to

                         HERSELF)
                    Oh god, please don't throw up.
          Howard writhes as Percy pours alcohol on the wound.
          Sandra can't help but stare at Percy's hook.
          Meanwhile across the diner, Bob and Jeep peel back the
          tablecloth to examine Gladys' bullet riddled corpse. Kyle
          stands over them with Bob's shotgun trained on the body --
          just in case.
          Gladys is a real horror show. Bones jut out at obtuse angles
          from her neck -- a result of the blow to her head from
          Percy's frying pan.

                              BOB
                    She's cold as a freakin' ice cube.
                    If I hadn't just seen her walk in
                    here, I'd say the old bag's been
                    dead for hours.
          Bob rolls Gladys over, revealing her face -- her enlarged
          mouth filled with dozens of razor sharp baby teeth.

                              KYLE
                    Well, I don't care how long she's
                    been dead, the bitch ain't stayin'
                    in here with us.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          Bob, Kyle and Jeep quickly drag Gladys's body wrapped in the
          plastic table cloth a short ways from the diner. They warily
          eye the curtain of FLIES no more than a hundred yards out.

          

                                                                       35.

          

          

                              BOB
                    I don't get it.    Why don't they
                    come closer?

                              KYLE
                    How the fuck am I supposed to know,
                    man? You askin' me to explain the
                    behavior of a motherfuckin'
                    pestilence.
          A CLANK and Jeep notices the old lady's car keys have dropped
          to the ground.

                              JEEP
                        (holding up the keys)
                    You guys!

          

          GLADYS' CUTLASS SUPREME
          Its windows are completely caked with dust. The men WIPE
          AWAY a layer of brown from the glass, allowing them to peer
          inside the car.

                              BOB
                    You see anything?

                              KYLE
                    No Twilight Zone shit if that's
                    what you mean.
          Jeep slips the key into the driver's side door.     Unlocks it.

                              BOB
                    Careful. Old lady could have some
                    kind of rabid poodle locked up in
                    there.
          Jeep slowly swings the door open and that's when the smell
          hits them.

                               KYLE
                    Agh!   What the fuck is that?
          Bob covers his nose.

                                 BOB
                    Jesus.
          Kyle opens the passenger door, looks in.      Dark, dirty.   But
          nothing unusual.

                              KYLE
                    Nothin' here.

          

                                                                    36.

          

          

                              JEEP
                    How `bout the trunk?
          They go around to the BACK OF THE CAR.   Jeep slips the key
          in.
          The trunk POPS open, revealing a PILE OF DEAD CATS.   ROTTING.

          MAGGOT INFESTED.
          Bob quickly slams the trunk closed.    The guys are reeling
          with disgust.
          Kyle's trying to blow the stench from his nose.

                              KYLE
                    Bitch's got motherfuckin' dead cats
                    in her hoopty! What the fuck is
                    wrong with white people?!

                              BOB
                    Least now we know where that smell
                    was coming from.

                              KYLE
                    Yeah, it was a real motherfuckin'
                    necessity we figured that out, man.

                               JEEP
                        (sees something up the

                         ROAD)
                    Hey...
          They turn to see HEADLIGHTS growing larger in the dim haze.
          A POLICE CRUISER careens off the highway and skids to a wild
          stop in front of the diner. Its ENGINE RATTLES as the dust
          clears around it. No movement can be seen behind its bug
          splattered windows.

                              BOB
                    Okay, now we're talkin'.

                              JEEP
                    Wait a minute. Check it out. It's
                    LAPD. What's an LA cop doing way
                    out here?
          Bob and Jeep look over at Kyle.

                              KYLE
                    I'm from Nevada, man.
          They consider the police car a moment more. See the
          SHATTERED PASSENGER WINDOW, the BLOOD STAINS.

          

                                                                    37.

          

          

                              BOB
                    Give me the shotgun.
          Kyle hands the shotgun over to Bob.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Charlie's face lights up when she sees the police car.

                              CHARLIE
                    Oh, thank God, the police!

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          The door of the POLICE CAR OPENS as Charlie races from the
          diner.
          The three men see her moving toward the car.    Jeep's face
          goes slack.

                              JEEP
                    Charlie, wait!
          The men begin to run toward her...
          While out of the police car steps...

          MICHAEL
          Charlie freezes a few feet from the car when she sees those
          piercing eyes already familiar to us. Michael looks at her,
          as if she was exactly who he expected to see.
          In moments Bob, Kyle and Jeep form a protective shield in
          front of Charlie. Bob raises the shotgun.

                              BOB
                    Take one step closer and I'll drop
                    you right here.
          A long beat as Michael considers Bob.   Icy cold.

                               MICHAEL
                    That how you greet all your
                    customers?

                              BOB
                    Mister, after what we've been
                    through here today, you're lucky we
                    didn't shoot you first and greet
                    you later. Now let me see your
                    teeth.
          Michael stares at him blankly.

          

                                                                       38.

          

          

                              BOB
                    Your teeth goddamn it!       Lemme see
                    `em!
          Michael offers up a dangerous smile, revealing a not so well
          kept but definitely normal set of teeth. Bob and the others
          ease slightly.

                              JEEP
                    No, shark teeth, Pop.
          Bob lowers the gun.

                               BOB
                    Okay... Suppose you tell us your
                    name then.

                                 MICHAEL
                    Michael.

                              BOB
                    Sorry about all that, Michael.
                    This old lady just went crazy
                    inside my place here. She had
                    these teeth. Never seen anything
                    like `em. Practically bit a man in
                    half.
          Michael remains silent.       Doesn't seemed shocked in the least
          by what he's heard.

                              BOB
                    So what are you doin' out here?
                    Gotta say you don't exactly look
                    like a police officer. Even one
                    from L.A. Then again, you have to
                    be, right? I mean, who the hell'd
                    be crazy enough to steal a cop car?
          Bob chuckles for a moment. When Michael doesn't respond in
          kind, Bob falls silent. Anxious. He slowly raises the
          shotgun again.
          Michael sizes up this raggedy group. His gaze drifts over to
          the loosely wrapped body in front of the diner. The plastic
          table cloth flaps wildly in the wind. Turning back to Bob:

                              MICHAEL
                    You don't know, do you?

                                 KYLE
                    Know what?

          

                                                                     39.

          

          

                              CHARLIE
                    We don't know anything. Nothing's
                    working here. The TV, the radio,
                    the phone...
          Michael just shakes his head.

                              MICHAEL
                    I'm running out of time.
          Michael steps toward Charlie with a sense of purpose, but Bob
          blocks his path, brandishing the shotgun.

                               BOB
                    Back off, fella...

                        (BEAT)
                    Now, I don't care if this is the
                    second coming of Jesus fucking
                    Christ, I say it's time for you to
                    either get talkin' or get the hell
                    outta here!
          In a BLUR OF MOVEMENT, Michael rips the shotgun from Bob's
          hands. It all happens so fast that Bob is stunned to find
          himself holding air.
          He's even more stunned to now have the barrel of the gun
          pressed to the bridge of his nose. Everyone freezes.

                               KYLE
                    Easy!   Easy!
          Michael's expression is totally calm.   Merciless.

                              JEEP
                    C'mon, Dad, tell `em you're sorry.
                    Tell `em you were only kidding!
          But Bob can't even speak, he's so scared.   He squeezes his
          eyes closed.

                              CHARLIE
                    Let `em go!
          Michael's eyes flit momentarily in Charlie's direction.
          Considering her.
          The diner door opens and Percy steps cautiously out with hand
          and hook held up to show no threat. He's followed by Sandra
          and Audrey.
          Michael sees them, but offers no indication that he cares.

          

                                                                   40.

          

          

                               PERCY
                    Now, son, I'm sure you don't wanna
                    go spillin' blood for no good
                    reason in front of all these decent
                    people, do ya? Our friend Bob here
                    ain't worth the trouble it'd cause
                    ya.

                        (BEAT)
                    So whaddya say `bout just lettin'
                    `im go and then you can be on your
                    way? Nice `n' easy.
          But Michael doesn't seem to register this plea.   It's not
          looking good.
          No one BREATHES. That's when Kyle notices something out in
          the direction of the road.

          DOZENS OF TINY HEADLIGHTS APPEARING IN THE DARK HAZE.

          APPROACHING.

                              KYLE
                    What the--?
          Michael turns, sees the lights.

                              MICHAEL
                    They're here.
          Michael whips the gun away from Bob's head and thrusts it
          back into his hands. Bob's looks down at the gun,
          speechless.

                              MICHAEL
                    You're going to need this.
          Michael walks swiftly around to the trunk of the cruiser.
          Pops it, revealing a staggering ARSENAL OF WEAPONRY.

          HE BEGINS TO LOAD GUN AFTER GUN.
          Percy stares out at the lights, eyes wide.

                              PERCY
                    Lord, have mercy.
                        (waving back Audrey and

                         SANDRA)
                    You ladies best get back inside.

                              SANDRA
                    What is it? What's happening? Who
                    is this man? Why's he driving a
                    police car?

                              AUDREY
                    Shut up, mom!

          

                                                                    41.

          

          
          Audrey pulls her mother back into the diner.
          Michael hands an MP5 SUB-MACHINE GUN to Kyle. Another one
          goes to Percy. Finally he places a third one in Jeep's
          hands, who stares down at it anxiously.

                               BOB
                    Wait. I don't think that's such a
                    good idea.

                              JEEP
                    Dad, I can handle it.

                              BOB
                        (to Michael)
                    He's just a kid --

                              JEEP
                    I said, I can handle it!
          Michael's eyes narrow, studying Jeep.

                              MICHAEL
                    He can handle it. He doesn't have
                    a choice.
          Michael pulls out twin MP5s for himself. GLOCK 9s are tucked
          everywhere they can go. Michael tosses clip belts to the
          men. Boxes of shotgun shells. The works.

                              MICHAEL
                    If you want to live, you'll do
                    exactly as I say.
          He slams the trunk closed and approaches Charlie.   He cocks a
          Glock and hands it to her.

                               MICHAEL
                    When you fire, you keep your thumb
                    off the slide. Don't hesitate.
                    Don't do anything brave. There's
                    no safety.
          He gives her a hard look.   She nods nervously.   Trusting him
          but not sure why.
          Michael marches into the diner. Kyle glances quickly at the
          others, then he bolts after Michael.
          Percy follows.   Then Charlie.
          Now it's only Jeep and his father left.

                              BOB
                    C'mon, Jeep. We gotta go!

          

                                                                          42.

          

          
          And Bob rushes into the diner.
          A moment as Jeep looks out toward the road.

          THE HEADLIGHTS ARE GROWING BRIGHTER.       CLOSER.
          He contemplates the sub-machine gun in his hands.

                                  JEEP
                     Fuck it.
          And races after his father.

                                                                     CUT TO:

          A DEAD BOLT
          Thrown.   Locking the diner door.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          Frantic activity. Kyle and Michael push a booth in front of
          the door, sealing off the entrance.
          Tables are turned on their sides to form makeshift shields.
          Window blinds are snap closed.

          

          THE BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
          Jeep races in, locks the back door.       Then he pushes a desk in
          front of it.

          

          IN THE DINER - CONTINUOUS
          The place is transformed. Locked up tight.        The ROAR OF
          ENGINES outside grows ever LOUDER, CLOSER.
          Sandra huddles on the floor with Howard, his head in her lap.
          She's running her hands gently through his hair, trying to
          keep calm. He opens his eyes. Pale, weak from blood loss.

                                 HOWARD
                     Sandra?    What's happening?

                                  SANDRA
                     It's okay!     Everything's okay!
          Sandra closes her eyes.        Struggling to believe it.
          Suddenly the ELECTRICITY GOES OUT, dipping the room into

          DARKNESS.

          

                                                                  43.

          

          
          We hear CRIES OF ALARM.   TOTAL BLACK.   Chaos.

                              BOB (V.O.)
                    Jeep, get the flashlights!

                              PERCY (V.O.)
                    Everybody just stay still!

                              KYLE (V.O.)
                    Now that we're locked in here, what
                    the fuck are we supposed to do?
          A flicker of LIGHT. And then FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CUT THROUGH
          THE DARKNESS...coming to rest on Michael's pale face.
          Michael looks up at the ceiling.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - NIGHT

          A hatch opens and out comes Michael followed by Bob, Percy
          and Kyle. They quickly take their places behind the
          "Paradise" sign. Pitch black surrounds them.
          The RUMBLE OF ENGINES is gone, leaving only the RUSH OF THE
          WIND coming up off the desert.

                              KYLE
                    Where the hell did they go?
          Bob turns to Michael sharply.

                              BOB
                    Alright, Rambo. You got us up
                    here. Now you mind explaining what
                    the fuck we're fighting?
          Michael is about to answer, when:

                              PERCY
                    Listen!
          Over the wind, another sound becomes audible.
          The delicate chime of a CALLIOPE.

                              PERCY
                    You hear what I'm hearing?

                              BOB
                    Yeah...The hell is that?
          The CALLIOPE MUSIC grows louder, the melody more distinct.
          Now we recognize the song: SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN.
          But instead of filling them with cheer, it fills them with
          dread.

          

                                                                   44.

          

          

                              PERCY
                    It sounds almost like...

                                 KYLE
                    Ice cream.
          TWO HEADLIGHTS appear in the   darkness. And sure enough, an
          ICE CREAM TRUCK rolls slowly   toward the diner. The EERIE
          CALLIOPE MUSIC emanates from   a speaker on its roof. It's too
          dark to see who's behind the   wheel.

                              KYLE
                    You've got to be fuckin' kidding
                    me.

                              MICHAEL
                    Alright. There's a safety switch
                    on the side of your gun. Push it
                    all the way down. Two clicks.
          The men quickly do as they're told.

                              MICHAEL
                    Now when this starts, you hold on
                    tight, you hear me? If you don't,
                    you're going to blow your hand off.
                    Understand?
          Kyle, Bob shoot quick anxious looks at Percy.

                              PERCY
                    The fuck y'all lookin' at me for?

          Jeep faces the boarded up front door, awkwardly holding the
          MP5, trying to assume a tough guy posture. If only he could
          stop shaking, it might be believable.
          Charlie and Audrey peer between the slats covering the
          windows. The ICE CREAM TRUCK'S HEADLIGHTS fan across the
          diner.
          Audrey and Charlie back away from the windows.
          Charlie stops next to Jeep. Senses him shaking. Rests a
          hand on his arm. And that seems to help...a little.
          Howard smiles weakly at the familiar sound of the CALLIOPE.

                               HOWARD
                    Oh, honey, listen.    It's the Ice
                    Cream Man.

          

                                                                      45.

          

          

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

          The Ice Cream Truck pulls to a stop with its headlights
          facing the diner.
          Everyone aims their guns at the truck.     Tense.
          From the Ice Cream Truck...a DARK BLOODY SHOE STEPS to the
          ground.
          MOVING up the long grey pant leg spotted with blood stains to
          reveal a skeletally thin man in tattered coveralls. Say
          hello to THE ICE CREAM MAN.
          He looks like he's been through hell -- literally. As he
          steps into the beams of the headlights we can see him even
          more clearly.
          He's tall. Too tall. His clothes don't seem to fit him.
          And he's unnaturally thin as if he's been stretched like
          taffy. If he got down on all fours, you might mistake him
          for some kind of spider. He surveys the diner, the garage,
          the roof -- assessing the situation.
          On the roof, the men wait for something to happen.

                              KYLE

                        (WHISPERS)
                    Ah, he don't look that bad.
          The Ice Cream Man's gaze snaps up to the roof.      He heard.

                                 KYLE
                    Oh, shit.     Oh, shit.   Oh, shit.
          That's when the Ice Cream Man's JAW UNHINGES, STRETCHING

          TORTUROUSLY DOWN TO NEARLY THE MIDDLE OF HIS CHEST! ROW
          AFTER ROW OF A RAZOR SHARP TEETH FORM with the sickening
          sound of CRACKING OF BONES.
          From his new mouth, the Ice Cream Man lets out an earth
          shattering HOWL.
          Everyone except Michael is practically hyperventilating with
          fear.

                                 MICHAEL
                    Get ready!
          And the ICE CREAM MAN BOLTS for the diner with STARTLING
          SPEED! His movements aren't at all like those of a normal
          man, but rather like some kind of HUMAN INSECT.
          Michael aims.

          

                                                                       46.

          

          

          BLAM!   BLAM!   BLAM!
          Bullets rip into the creature's body, knocking him flat on
          his back. Still. Arms and legs in a twisted, twitching
          mess.
          Michael keeps his aim.    Waits.   The CALLIOPE music continues
          to play.

                               KYLE
                     Is that it?
          Not even close. A RUMBLING OF ENGINES. HEADLIGHTS. A
          freeway full of VEHICLES of every variety punch through the
          wall of dust, racing toward the diner. They are THE

          COMMUTERS.

                                MICHAEL
                     Now!   Shoot now!
          The men let loose with FEROCIOUS FIREPOWER.

          WINDSHIELDS SHATTER!    TIRES BLOW OUT!   ENGINES EXPLODE!
          Vehicles swerve and COLLIDE!
          DARK SHAPES bolt from the burning vehicles, scattering.
          In the FLASH OF BATTLE we catch glimpses of them: BUSINESS

          PEOPLE. CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. EVEN AN ENTIRE HIGH SCHOOL
          FOOTBALL TEAM. All deformed by some demonic force. Many
          mere BALLS OF FLAME drifting through the darkness.

                               MICHAEL
                     Spread out! Don't let them get
                     close to the windows!
          The DARK SHAPES converge on the diner from all directions.
          They move so strangely fast it seems that their feet don't
          actually touch the ground.
          From the roof it's a full-on turkey shoot as the men follow
          Michael's instructions and cut down everything in sight.
          Their faces lighting up with each FLASH.
          SHELL CASINGS spray from their weapons like water drops from
          a sprinkler.
          BODIES BURST and crumble to the dirt. The creatures don't
          seem to be afraid of dying. Their strategy appears to be in
          their sheer numbers.
          With each wave, the dark figures get ever closer to the
          diner.

          

                                                                        47.

          

          
          ON BOB firing madly.    Then...   CLICK!   CLICK!   Oh, no.   He's
          out of ammo.

                                 BOB
                    Shells!
          Percy tosses him a box of shells. But Bob fumbles the catch
          and the box slides halfway down the sloped roof.

                                 BOB
                    Fuck!
          With the gun still in one hand, Bob reaches frantically down
          for the ammo. Stretching... Further...

          A HIDEOUSLY WOUNDED MIDDLE-AGED HOUSEWIFE CATAPULTS UP FROM
          BELOW THE ROOFLINE! Her hair must have been in curlers
          before most of it BURNED AWAY. Her nightdress hangs in
          tatters off her body. Her jaw CLICKS RAPIDLY, as she
          clatters up at Bob like a GIANT INSECT.
          Bob tries to pull back, but he has no traction and he starts
          to slip down toward her. She's coming fast!
          Percy sees his friend in trouble.

                                 PERCY
                    Bob!
          Bob swings the shotgun like a club -- CRACK! -- knocking the
          bitch clear off the roof. But the move has made his slide
          even faster. He drops the shotgun, trying to hold on, but he
          can't stop!

          BOB IS ABOUT TO HIT THE EDGE WHEN THE HORRID WOMAN POPS UP

          RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM!
          She doesn't even have a chance to react as Bob does something
          akin to a swimmer's push right off her body! WHAM!
          The creature goes flying back off the roof and the opposing
          force halts Bob's slide.

                              PERCY
                        (extending his hook)
                    Grab my hand!
          Bob reaches up and clasps Percy's hook, praying that it stays
          on.
          But this chick ain't finished yet. Up she comes once more.
          Her razor sharp fingernails claw up the metal roof. SCREECH!

                                 BOB
                    Gun!

          

                                                                     48.

          

          
          Percy tosses Bob a Glock. Fortunately this time Bob deftly
          catches it with his free hand just as the deranged woman
          pounces on him.

                              BOB
                        (jamming the gun in her

                         MOUTH)
                    Fuck off!
          BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The back of her head EXPLODES. Her body
          goes limp. Bob struggles to push the corpse off of him.

                              BOB
                    Pull me up!
          Percy extends his hook hand, helping Bob ascend to safety.

          Sandra squeezes her hands over her ears.   A few feet away,
          Audrey clutches a butcher's knife.
          Jeep's eyes darting from one window to another.   Trying to
          keep it together.
          Charlie is crouched down behind the counter, holding the
          handgun close to her pregnant belly. Distant EXPLOSIONS
          rattle the plates on the shelves.
          Charlie peers out from behind the counter to look at the

          Momentary FLASHES of intense light outline the closed blinds.
          Another FLASH lights up Charlie's face.    Staring.

          Closer and closer the creatures come.   Most are eviscerated
          by the fire from the rooftop.

          ON CHARLIE staring at the window.    CLOSER.   Charlie's eyes go
          wide as --
          SMASH!   A DARK SHAPE crashes through the window.    Glass,
          sand and dust swirl in.
          Audrey and Sandra SCREAM.
          Charlie springs up from her hiding place, gun ready.
          Jeep spins around, pointing his gun, searching frantically
          for the intruder. It's so dark!

                              JEEP
                    Where is it?!
          Audrey shakes her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. She
          looks over at her mother. Sandra's eyes are closed. It's
          too much.

                               AUDREY
                    Mom!   Open your eyes!

                    I can't!   I can't!
          Suddenly Howard's body is TORN AWAY from Sandra. Something's
          got hold of his legs!   That gets Sandra's eyes open!

                              SANDRA
                        (springing after her

                         HUSBAND)
                    Howard!
          Howard screams deliriously as he's dragged rapidly through
          the diner toward the broken front window. He flails about,
          desperately trying to grab a hold of something.
          Sandra scrambles after her husband.   Reaching for him.

                               AUDREY
                    Daddy!
          The creature reaches the window. Sandra dives for Howard's
          outstretched hands. She has him!
          The creature's progress is abruptly halted at the shattered
          window.   It turns back toward Sandra -- a shaft of light
          falling across its face, reveals:
          A TEENAGE GIRL of about Audrey's age.   Her skin is a deathly
          blue. Her pupils a GHASTLY WHITE.

          

                                                                   50.

          
          Deep human fingernail scratches have torn open the bloated
          flesh on her arms, neck and face. The self-inflicted wounds
          of a drug addict. Her voice is not QUITE HUMAN.

                              TEENAGE GIRL
                    See what you made me do, mother!?
          Sandra screams, holds on.

                              SANDRA
                    No!
          Charlie and Audrey rush to Sandra's side, grabbing Howard's
          arms.
          Jeep is right behind them ready to fire at the creature, but
          with the women in the way, he can't get a clear shot. So he
          discards the gun and grabs Howard's arms.
          Howard screams as his body is torturously stretched.   A human
          tug-of-war.

          ON HOWARD'S FEET -- TWO MORE SETS OF SINEWY MUSCLE AND BONE

          CLAWS REACH THROUGH THE WINDOW AND GRAB HIS LEGS.
          Howard's body lurches further out the window.

                              SANDRA
                    Howard!
          Howard's torso is almost entirely out the window. Charlie
          daringly reaches for Howard's belt, desperate to gain
          leverage.

          ANOTHER DISFIGURED HAND PUNCHES THROUGH THE BLINDS AND LOCKS

          ONTO CHARLIE'S ARM!
          Charlie screams as she's yanked painfully toward the window,
          losing her grip on Howard's belt.
          Through the broken window, she sees the face of a RAGGEDY
          LOOKING MAN. He smiles at her like a father coming home to
          his baby girl.

                              RAGGEDY MAN

                        (SWEETLY)
                    There you are!
          And he starts to pull her arm even harder...Other creatures
          suddenly notice her as well, focusing their attack as if she
          alone was their target.
          Jeep immediately let's go of Howard and dives for Charlie,
          grabbing her free arm just before she's pulled through.

          

                                                                      51.

          

          
          Without the help, Audrey and Sandra can't hold on any longer.
          Howard is ripped from of his family's hands and out the
          window.

                                 AUDREY

          A FLASH OF STEEL.    SCHING!
          Charlie and Jeep fall back into the diner, the claw like
          hands still grasping Charlie's arm no longer attached to
          their owners.
          Michael leaps over her, a butcher's knife in one hand, a
          machine gun in the other. He lights up everything in his
          path. The window blinds become a WALL OF FIRE. Creatures
          SCREECH and flee into the night, having successfully taken
          their first victim.
          Charlie flings the severed appendages off her and she and
          Jeep scoot away from the window.
          Hysterical, Sandra tries to push past Michael. She's going
          after Howard. He intercepts her before she can make it out.

                                 SANDRA
                    Let me go!     He's alive!
          Sandra slaps at him frantically as he carries her away from
          the window and thrusts her down into a back booth.

                              SANDRA
                    He's alive!

                                 MICHAEL
                    No...     Not anymore.
          Sandra breaks down.

          

                                                                         52.

          

          
          As Charlie climbs slowly to her feet -- a sudden pain.       She
          clutches her belly. Winces.
          Jeep catches her arm to steady her.

                              CHARLIE

                        (RECOVERING)
                    I'm okay. I'm fine.
          She glances back at Michael.       He's watching her.   Those eyes.

                                 CHARLIE
                    Thanks...

                              MICHAEL
                    I told you not to do anything
                    brave.
          Charlie doesn't know how to respond.      She's about to say
          something when --
          Kyle rushes into the room.       A smile on his face.

                              KYLE
                    We got `em runnin'!
          Then Kyle notices the broken window, takes in the room, his
          excitement falling.

                              KYLE
                    Where's Howard?
          No one responds.   Sandra and Audrey are huddled together.
          Crying.
          Bob and Percy follow Kyle in, still shaking from the
          adrenaline.

                              MICHAEL
                    Someone needs to be on the roof.

                                 KYLE
                    I'll go.
          Bob grabs Kyle's arm.

                              BOB
                    Hold on.
                        (approaches Michael,

                         DETERMINED)
                    You better start talking.
          All eyes on Michael.    These people want answers.      Finally:

          

                                                          53.

          

          

                              MICHAEL
                    The first time God lost faith in
                    Man he sent a flood. The second
                    time...he sent what you see
                    outside.
          Everyone takes that in for a moment, then:

                              PERCY
                    You sayin' this is the
                    Apocalypse...?

                               MICHAEL
                    I'm saying this is an
                    extermination.

                        (BEAT)
                    Those things out there are vessels.
                    The Possessed. The weakest willed
                    are the easiest to turn.

                              KYLE
                    Possessed by what?    Demons?

                              MICHAEL
                    No...by angels.
          That silences the room.

                              PERCY
                        (pulls out his bible)
                    Son, I don't know what bible you
                    been readin', but in my version,
                    the angels are the good guys.
          Michael looks squarely at Percy.

                              MICHAEL
                    That's where your book is wrong.

                              SANDRA
                    How come you know so much about
                    them?

                              MICHAEL
                    I know because until last night, I
                    was on their side.

                              JEEP
                    You mean you're...
          Michael considers Jeep, then:

                              MICHAEL
                    Not anymore...

          

                                                                     54.

          

          

                              BOB
                    Right and yesterday I was the
                    fuckin' Easter Bunny. You know,
                    fuck this. I don't even believe in
                    God.

                              MICHAEL
                    That's fine, because He doesn't
                    believe in you either.
          Bob stares at Michael, uncertain how to respond to that.

                              PERCY
                    C'mon, Bob. Have you looked
                    outside recently? Those aren't
                    exactly our regular customers out
                    there.

                              BOB
                    How do we know he didn't bring them
                    here himself?

                              CHARLIE
                    He brings them here and then he
                    saves us from them? You're a
                    genius, Bob.
          Bob falls silent, confounded.
          Audrey hesitantly approaches Michael.

                              AUDREY
                    So you're here to protect us?

                               MICHAEL
                    Not you...
                         (looks at Charlie)
                    Her.
          Charlie reacts in shock, as all eyes are suddenly on her.

                               CHARLIE
                    Me?!   Why me?!

                              MICHAEL
                    Because your child is the only hope
                    humanity has of surviving.
          In response to that, Charlie does the only thing someone can
          do when told such a thing. She LAUGHS.

                               CHARLIE
                    No way!
          But Michael isn't joking and Charlie's laughter becomes
          genuine fear.

          

                                                                  55.

          

          

                              CHARLIE

                        (STUNNED)
                    Jesus Christ...

                               MICHAEL
                    Exactly.
          Jeep stares at Charlie, as if suddenly his entire life is
          starting to make sense.

                              JEEP
                    You're sayin' she's the mother of
                    the Messiah?

                              BOB
                    Wait a minute, isn't Mary supposed
                    to be a vi--

                              CHARLIE
                    Go fuck yourself, Bob!

                              PERCY
                    Makes you wonder about Mary.

                              CHARLIE
                        (approaches Michael, panic
                         setting in)
                    Look, this is not possible! I'm
                    just a waitress! I'm nobody! I
                    can't give birth to the Savior of
                    Mankind!
                        (and finally)
                    I don't even own a car!

                              MICHAEL
                    None of that matters anymore.
                    Either your child lives or Mankind
                    dies.

                              KYLE
                    So what, we're supposed to just
                    hold those things off until Mary
                    over there squeezes one out?

                              MICHAEL
                    That's right.

                              CHARLIE
                    That can't be. I'm only eight
                    months pregnant.

                              KYLE
                    Oh we're fucked.     We are so fucked!

          

                                                                      56.

          

          

                              SANDRA
                    How are we supposed to survive here
                    for a month?

                              MICHAEL
                    We won't have to...
          At this Charlie goes white, the realization hitting her.

                              CHARLIE
                    It's coming soon, isn't it?
          Michael nods.
          Charlie sways on her feet.   Jeep rests a hand on her
          shoulder, steadying her.
          With a CLANK Michael re-arms his weapon, turns to the group
          with finality.

                               MICHAEL
                    If you want to live you'll do what
                    I say. This first attack was a
                    test of our strength. The next one
                    will be a test of our weakness.

                        (BEAT)
                    Something much worse is on its way.
          Everyone exchanges terrified looks.   Finally, Kyle steps
          forward.

                              KYLE
                    Okay, what's your plan?

                              MICHAEL
                    We'll keep watch on the roof in
                    shifts of two. Jeep, go get some
                    tools. We need to close up this
                    window before somebody else goes
                    out.
          Jeep looks anxiously at Charlie, silent, scared, and then he
          follows after Michael, leaving Charlie to stare at the
          SHATTERED WINDOW, the blinds flipping wildly in the wind.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - LATE NIGHT

          Percy and Kyle keep watch, rifles at their sides. They're
          wrapped up from head to toe in blankets to protect them from
          the cold and the flies.
          Percy scans the horizon.   Momentary SPECTRAL FLASHES dot the
          darkness.

          

                                                                   57.

          

          

                               PERCY
                    They're out there. Sons of
                    bitches. I can feel `em.

                        (BEAT)
                    Damn it's cold!
          Percy makes the unconscious motion of rubbing his "hands"
          together to keep them warm. Kyle notices. Sees the dog
          tags.

                              KYLE
                    You were in the Army?

                              PERCY
                    Navy, two tours. But the second
                    one didn't work out so well, so I
                    didn't get to go back for a third.
                    Suppose that makes me lucky in a
                    way. Served with Bob, you know.
                    That's how I ended up in this
                    place.

                              KYLE
                    What was it like?    Being in a war?

                               PERCY
                    Dark.   Like this.
          Kyle nods. Scared. He takes out his 45.     Nervously switches
          it from hand to hand.

                              PERCY
                    So what's with that gun?

                               KYLE
                    What?

                              PERCY
                    Your piece. The one you killed
                    grandma with. Don't reckon it's
                    for huntin' buck.

                              KYLE
                    No. I uh -- keep it for
                    protection.

                              PERCY
                    Protection from what?

                              KYLE
                    From people.
          Percy looks at him skeptically.

                               PERCY
                    People.

          

                                                                     58.

          

          

                              KYLE
                    Yeah, people who might try to give
                    me a hard time, you know?

                              PERCY
                    Just regular people or uh...

                              KYLE
                    Yeah, well, no, not regular,

                              PERCY
                    Irregular people then.

                               KYLE
                    I'm talkin' people whose job it is
                    to give other people a hard time.
                    Kinda person who doesn't get enough
                    fiber in their diet, you know what
                    I'm sayin?

                              PERCY
                    So it's a work thing, is it?

                                KYLE
                    Exactly.    Strictly business.

                              PERCY
                    This business of yours... You like
                    it?
          Kyle's eyes narrow.

                              KYLE
                    Who the fuck are you to be sweatin'
                    me, man? I got my reasons for
                    doin' what I do.
          Percy just stares at him, penetrating.     Finally:

                              PERCY
                    When I was a kid my father would
                    sit by my bed every night before
                    I'd go to sleep and he'd say to me,
                    Percy, if you don't wake up
                    tomorrow, if it turns out that
                    today was your last day on earth,
                    would you be proud of what you've
                    done in this life? Cuz if you
                    ain't, then you better start
                    gettin' square.
          Kyle looks at Percy, fear in his eyes, then he turns back to
          the darkness...and the evil that surrounds them.

                                                                CUT TO:

          THE SILVER ZIPPO
          rolls between dirty fingers.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - NIGHT

          Bob plays with his trusty zippo with one hand and grills up
          some steaks with the other. He pauses in his cooking every
          few moments to take a slug from a can of beer. Can't get it
          down fast enough.
          Sandra sits at the counter across from him, staring at a
          prescription bottle tipped in front of her, pills spread
          around.
          Bob glances over, sees the devastation in her eyes. He pulls
          another can of beer from underneath the counter, pops it and
          places it in front of her.

                              BOB
                    On the house.
          She looks up at him.    Smiles weakly.   Takes a sip.

                                 SANDRA
                    Thanks.

                              BOB
                    You hungry?

                              SANDRA
                    Couldn't eat if my life depended on
                    it.

                              BOB
                    Well I figure just cuz the world's
                    coming to an end, it doesn't mean a
                    man's gotta starve. All I can say
                    is thank heavens they left the gas
                    on.
          Sandra takes another sip of beer.   Considers it.

                              SANDRA
                    Never much cared for beer.
                    Howard's the beer drinker in the
                    family.
          The moment the words leave her mouth, the grief hits her
          again. She gathers up some pills from the counter, tosses
          them back and downs her beer like there's no tomorrow. This
          is a battle she's losing.

          

                                                                  60.

          

          
          Meanwhile in a booth across the diner, Audrey is fiddling
          with Percy's old radio. Back and forth on the dial.
          Listening for anything. Nothing but STATIC.
          Up at the front of the diner, Jeep silently helps Michael
          nail broken table planks across the shattered window. He
          eyes the strange tatoos running down Michael's arms, the two
          jagged wounds visible above his shirt line.

                              JEEP
                    What did you do...you know, before
                    you came here...?
          Michael considers the question a beat, then:

                              MICHAEL
                    I was a soldier, a general, in His
                    army.

                              JEEP
                    Well, what changed?   What made you
                    leave?

                              MICHAEL
                    I was given an order I didn't
                    believe in...
                        (off Jeep's look:)
                    He lost faith. I hadn't.
          Michael drives the last nail into place, securing the window.

                              JEEP
                    So what happens to you...after this
                    is over?
          Michael pauses a beat, as if unsure how much to say, then:

                              MICHAEL
                    Sometimes we have to face the thing
                    we fear the most in order to be
                    free of it.
          Michael picks up his gun.

                              MICHAEL
                    It's almost time for the next
                    shift.
          Michael heads for the roof, leaving Jeep to stare after him,
          deep in thought.

                                                            CUT TO:

          The faintest glint of sunlight through the dark red dusty
          haze. A new day has forced itself into existence.
          TITLE:   "December 24th - 6:05am"

          

          EXT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - ROOF - MORNING

          Michael is searching the horizon in front of the diner for
          movement. His expression focused, determined.
          On the other side of the roof, Bob keeps watch, struggling to
          stay awake. The beer taking over. His eyes droop closed.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Sandra awakens with a start.

                                 SANDRA
                     Howard?
          But Howard's not there. And everyone else in the diner is
          still asleep. The drugs have started to wear off... and her
          fear is returning.

          

          INT. DINER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Sandra splashes water on her face.   Stares at herself in the
          mirror. A living wreck.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Sandra steps out of the bathroom.

                               VOICE
                         (a whisper)
                     Sandra...
          Sandra freezes.

                               SANDRA
                     Who's there?
          A beat then:

                                 VOICE
                     Sandra...
          Sandra spins around.    Searching.

          

                                                                      62.

          

          

                                 SANDRA
                    Howard?     Is that you?
          It sure sounded like Howard.

                                 VOICE
                    Help me...     Please...
          This time, it's clear where the voice is coming from.      Sandra
          turns to face the BACK DOOR. A desk blocks it.
          Sandra ever so slowly approaches the door.

                              VOICE
                        (from behind the door)
                    Help me. Sandra...
          Sandra is stricken.    What the hell is she going to do?
          That's when Sandra notices the TRANSOM WINDOW above the door.
          She climbs onto the desk and stretches up until she can see
          out.

          SANDRA'S POV:
          Howard. Her husband. Ten feet away from the door.     NAILED

          TO AN UPSIDE-DOWN CROSS.
          But wait. It gets worse. His skin is covered with horrible
          black boils. And even worse than that. Howard's boils are
          breathing.
          Sandra goes slack with horror.

                              HOWARD
                    Help me, please!
          Howard's torn open shirt reveals the BREATHING PUSTULES
          covering his body. He writhes in slow, excruciating agony.

                                 SANDRA
                    Howard!
          Sandra scrambles down off the desk and frantically pushes it
          away from the door. She's reaching for the dead bolt when
          Audrey and Kyle appear in the doorway.

                                 AUDREY
                    Mom!
          Kyle races to restrain Sandra.

                                 SANDRA
                    Let me go!     He's alive!

          

                                                                     63.

          

          
          She struggles against him, throwing a wild elbow that tags
          Kyle in the face. Down he goes.
          Sandra is about to open the door when Audrey pounces on her.

          

          INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

          The SHOUTING from the back office awakens the rest of the
          sleepers. Percy springs up. Charlie is shaking Jeep.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

          The ROAR OF WIND ripping off the plain is all that can be
          heard. ON BOB as his head drops down with drunken fatigue.
          Sleep.

          RISING OVER HIM TO SEE...
          Howard nailed to the upside-down cross below.

          

          INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - BACK OFFICE - SAME

          Sandra and Audrey are locked in battle. Sandra slaps Audrey
          hard. Audrey stumbles over Kyle and hits the floor. Percy
          appears in the doorway.
          Now is her last chance. Sandra whips open the back door and
          that's when the world hits SLOW MOTION.
          Howard is there.    A few feet away.   Alive.
          Sandra races toward him.    Just behind her comes Percy.

                                SANDRA
                    Howard!
          And that's when the speed ACCELERATES TO NORMAL --
          -- and the boils covering Howard's body explode -- spraying
          streams of dark fluid toward Sandra --
          -- just at the moment Percy spins around her, shielding her
          from the spray, which hits him in the back. But he's not
          stopping. Percy pushes Sandra back into the diner, the door
          SLAMMING closed behind them.
          Percy releases Sandra, letting her stumble hysterically into
          the room. Kyle and Jeep grab her, forcing her to the ground.
          But she's not fighting anymore.
          Charlie turns to look at Percy who is still standing with his
          back to the door, breathing heavily.

          

                                                                        64.

          

          

                                 CHARLIE
                       Percy?
          He takes a step forward, then falls to ground.
          The entire back side of his body is gone.      Burned away.

                                                                CUT TO:

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - FREEZER ROOM - DAY

          Percy's body lies covered on the table. Bob stares ruefully
          at his dead friend. A broken man. Tears stream down his
          face. He rolls the Zippo between his fingers.
          Jeep watches his father from the doorway.

                                 JEEP
                       We should get back out there...

                                 BOB
                       Just gimme another minute with him,
                       okay?
          Jeep nods, quietly leaves his father at the side of his dead
          friend.

                                                                CUT TO:

          Catatonic.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - A SHORT WHILE LATER

          Michael and Bob are tying Sandra to a chair. Not like it
          looks like she's capable of going anywhere, but you never
          know.
          Across the diner, Charlie eyes Michael cautiously. Michael
          never goes for more than a few moments without looking up at
          her. It's not lecherous. More like a protective father
          making sure his child hasn't strayed too far.
          In a booth, Audrey watches, red-eyed, as Michael restrains
          her mother. Then she returns her attention to Percy's radio.
          Tuning. Trying to find something, anything in the STATIC.

          

                                                                       65.

          

          
          She brings her ear up close.      Wait.   Is that a VOICE?
          She adjusts the antenna, trying to bring the signal into
          focus. CLEARER.

                                 AUDREY
                     Hey...
          CLEARER.   Yes.   It's a VOICE!

                               AUDREY
                     Hey! You guys, I think I got
                     something here!
          Everyone drops what they're doing and quickly gathers around
          the radio.

          THROUGH THE HAZE OF STATIC, A GRAVELY, TIRED VOICE.      STRAINED

          BEYOND BELIEF. BUT STILL BROADCASTING.

                                RADIO VOICE
                     ... battling has been fierce. The
                     numbers of casualties are unknown
                     but all indications are that they

                     If you're just joining us, we're
                     getting some of the first bits of
                     good news, if you can call it that,
                     since this apocalypse began just
                     twenty-four ago. A human militia
                     has formed on the outskirts of Las
                     Vegas and has begun to engage the
                     enemy. Also down in the Four
                     Corners area, we've been receiving
                     unconfirmed reports of another
                     resistance force gathering in Red
                     Rock National in the northern
                     Mojave Desert area.

                               JEEP
                     Red Rock...

                               CHARLIE
                     That can't be more than an hour up
                     the highway from here.

                               AUDREY
                     Does that mean we can leave?

                                 MICHAEL
                     No.    We're not going anywhere.

                               BOB
                     What the hell are you talkin'
                     about? This is our chance!

          

                                                                   66.

          

          

                                  MICHAEL
                       We can't risk being on the move
                       when the child comes. It's too
                       dangerous.
          Bob looks over at Charlie, defeated. She shakes her head,
          anger building. She sweeps some plates off the counter and
          races for the bathroom.

                                 RADIO VOICE
                       ... And as we fight this new
                       enemy, may God give us the strength
                       to survive and show mercy for those
                       of us who are already lost...

                                                             CUT TO:

          

          A CIGARETTE
          being lit.

          

          INT. DINER BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Charlie stands at the sink, cigarette to her lips, water
          running, stealing a private moment. She takes a deep drag,
          feels the smoke filling her lungs, defiant.
          Then she catches a look at herself in the mirror, runs her
          hand along the curvature of her belly. Tears well up in her
          eyes, fear and anger overtaking her.
          She stamps out the cigarette in a fit of frustration.

          

          INT. DINER - A SHORT WHILE LATER

          It's quiet. DRIFTING past sleeping figures to find Charlie,
          wide-awake, sitting at a booth, lost in thought.

                                 JEEP (O.S.)
                       Guess it's your turn not to sleep.
          Charlie looks up to see Jeep sit down across from her.

                                   CHARLIE
                       Hey...
          Jeep sees the strain on her face.

                                   JEEP
                       You okay?

          

                                                                     67.

          

          

                              CHARLIE
                    You mean besides the fact that I
                    just found out that I'm the mother
                    of the Messiah?
          Jeep smiles, nods.

                               CHARLIE
                    Crazy thing is...I didn't want this
                    baby. I even went down to the
                    clinic, you know that?
                        (off Jeep's reaction:)
                    I remember sitting there in the
                    waiting room, absolutely sure I was
                    doin' the right thing...And that's
                    when the feeling started. Like I
                    was falling into the deepest,
                    darkest hole imaginable. I
                    couldn't breathe, I couldn't speak.
                    I kept thinking this must be what
                    death is like. And when finally
                    they called my name, I ran.

                        (BEAT)
                    For a while after that I tried
                    pretending that it was just cold
                    feet, that I could go back if I
                    wanted to, that I could decide to
                    end it like I'd planned. Then I'd
                    start to have that feeling again
                    and I knew I didn't have a choice.
                    Somehow this had already been
                    decided. And it made me hate this
                    thing that's been growing inside
                    me.
          A long beat, as Jeep considers her, then:

                              JEEP
                    You shouldn't say things like that,
                    Charlie. It isn't right. You'll
                    get through this. I know you will.
          She turns to him, the bitterness overtaking her:

                              CHARLIE
                    How come you have so much faith in
                    me, Jeep? God knows I've never
                    given you or anybody else a reason
                    to. Or is it that you just can't
                    find any other hard-luck case to
                    follow around?
          Jeep's face hardens.   He gets up.   Hurt.   Frustrated.

          

                                                                     68.

          

          

                              JEEP
                    You know, you're not the only who's
                    suffered, okay? Let me know when
                    you stop feeling sorry for
                    yourself.
          And with that, Jeep walks away, leaving Charlie to stare
          after him, disturbed and surprised by his response.

                                                            CUT TO:

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - LATE AFTERNOON

          Sand and wind.    The INVISIBLE SUN is sinking.
          Kyle and Audrey are bundled together on the roof, keeping
          watch. Kyle is showing her how to hold the MP5.

                              KYLE
                    ...Then you just flip this --
          Audrey flips the safety.

                              AUDREY
                    Yeah, I got it. All the way down.
                    Two clicks.
          She points the gun out into the haze like she's been holding
          one all her life.
          Off Kyle's surprised look:

                              AUDREY
                    Dated this guy last summer. A
                    marine. Had a thing for guns.
                    Parents hated him.

                              KYLE
                    I bet they did.
          After a moment, Audrey switches the safety back on.   Hands
          the gun over to Kyle.
          Audrey stares into the red nothingness surrounding them. Her
          expression growing distant. She seems to have aged years
          overnight.

                              AUDREY
                    My parents hate everything I do.
                    That's why we were moving.

                                KYLE
                    Yeah?

          

                                                                         69.

          

          

                              AUDREY
                    They thought a more "wholesome"
                    environment would help me "change
                    my ways." So fucked up. Only
                    reason they care at all is cuz they
                    don't want to be embarrassed in
                    front of their friends at the
                    country club.
          Kyle considers her thoughtfully.

                              KYLE
                    The only time my old man ever paid
                    attention to me was when I was
                    doing somethin' bad. So you know
                    what I did?

                               AUDREY
                    What?

                              KYLE
                    I got really good at being bad.
          She smiles at this confession.    Can obviously relate.   He
          wipes a tear from her cheek.
          She leans in.   Kisses him.   Passionately.   Desperately.
          His hands trace over her body.
          She claws at him. Her passion growing out of control.
          She's practically devouring him. Kyle can barely keep up.
          It's like something else beyond sensual need has taken over.
          She moves down his chest.     Further.   Kyle leans his head
          back. Further.
          Just then the SPOT LIGHTS that illuminate the roof sign come
          to life.   The young couple stops to look up at the brilliant
          red word "Paradise" illuminated above them.
          Down below, the gas pumps LIGHT UP.      The station's
          FLUORESCENTS flicker on.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

          All at once the entire diner COMES BACK TO LIFE.
          The jukebox WHIRS ON, filling the room with Merle Haggard's
          "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive".
          Bob's TV glows with bright rolling STATIC.
          The electric fan spins on above the grill.

          

                                                                    70.

          

          
          Jeep and Michael move to look through the slats at the
          window.
          Charlie is giving Sandra some water through a straw.
          Bob wanders in, squinting at the sudden presence of light.

                              BOB
                    We back in business?

                              MICHAEL
                    I don't think so.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

          The truck stop is lit up like a Christmas tree. If you
          didn't know better, you might mistake the place for business
          as usual. Kyle and Audrey stand on the roof, taking in the
          dramatic change.

                              AUDREY
                    Is it over?

                              KYLE
                    I don't know.
          HEADLIGHTS appear on the highway.

                              KYLE
                        (raising his gun)
                    You better get downstairs.

                              AUDREY
                    No, I can handle it.
          Kyle stares at Audrey's beautiful, determined face.    Then he
          pulls out his silver 45.

                              KYLE
                        (handing her the gun)
                    Just in case.
          The headlights become a FAMILY MINIVAN careening wildly off
          the highway to stop at the pumps.

                                 KYLE
                    Get ready.
          They aim their weapons at the vehicle.
          A well dressed MAN in his mid-thirties jumps out of the car.
          He looks around nervously, scared. Then, seeing that the
          coast is clear, he offers a calming wave to his WIFE and
          YOUNG BOY who wait anxiously for him inside the car.

          

                                                                     71.

          

          
          He races around to the gas pump.

                              KYLE
                        (lowering his gun)
                    Wait a minute.

                              AUDREY
                    Kyle, are they...
          A distant SCREECH from behind. Kyle and Audrey spin to look
          out over the back side of the diner.
          AN ARMY OF DARK SHAPES are swarming in fast.
          Kyle looks urgently back at the family.    The father lifts the
          pump. Flips the lever.

                              KYLE
                    It's a trap. They saw them coming
                    and turned on the lights. It's a
                    fucking trap!
          Kyle and Audrey wave their arms frantically at the family.

                             KYLE AND AUDREY
                    Hey! Get back in your car!      It's a
                    trap!
          But down below, the man can only hear the sound of RAGING
          WIND as he pumps the gas.
          Kyle fires his gun in the air.   BLAM!   BLAM!     BLAM!
          At the sound of gunfire, the man looks quickly up to the
          roof.   His family heard it too and they start to SCREAM TO
          HIM. The man can only see silhouettes in this light, but
          he's not waiting around to see if it's friend or foe.
          Audrey watches in horror as the dark shapes reach the diner.

                              AUDREY
                    They're not gonna make it.
          The father dashes to the driver's side.    He throws open the
          door.
          But he's too late. He looks over his shoulder just in time
          to see a BLUR OF MOVEMENT RUSHING AT HIM.
          His BLOOD PAINTS the car windows.
          Kyle raises his MP5 to fire upon the dark shapes that
          surround the vehicle like swarming insects.
          The wife and boy scream hysterically as they are torn from
          the vehicle by skeletal hands.

          

                                                                      72.

          

          

                              AUDREY
                        (pushing his barrel down)
                    Wait! You'll hit them too!
          So Kyle makes a desperately courageous play. He leaps onto
          the roof's sloped overhang -- sliding fast -- he drops to the
          ground in front of the diner.

                              AUDREY
                    Kyle!
          Kyle charges the dark mob. Creatures peel away from the
          woman and boy to confront Kyle head-on.
          He lets loose with a rain of bullets, eviscerating everything
          that comes at him.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          The group gathered at the window sees Kyle racing out toward
          the pumps.

                               BOB
                    Jesus Christ, what the hell is that
                    boy doin'!

                              CHARLIE
                    We have to get `im back in here!
          Bob springs into action.   Pushes the booth away from the
          front door.
          The sound of a gun COCKING.
          Bob looks over to see Michael pointing a gun at his head.

                              MICHAEL
                    Don't. You open that door and we
                    could all be dead.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          The Possessed move in from all sides, but Kyle is remarkably
          agile, dropping one after another in a stunning display.
          He closes in on the family, blasting back the creatures
          huddled around them.
          He finds the YOUNG BOY curled up with his hands protectively
          covering his face.
          Kyle swoops down and gathers the boy into his arms.

          

                                                                     73.

          

          

                                 KYLE
                    I got you!
          Kyle moves on to the mother. But something odd is happening.
          The creatures have stopped coming at him.
          In fact, they're just standing there watching him.   Waiting.
          Kyle freezes.   CLOSE ON HIM as he senses something terribly
          wrong.

                                 YOUNG BOY (O.S.)
                    Mister...
          Kyle looks over at the boy in his arms.   GHOSTLY WHITE EYES
          stare back at him.

                               YOUNG BOY

                        (WHISPERS)
                    Fooled ya.

          A FLASH OF TEETH AS KYLE'S THROAT IS TORN OUT.
          Kyle drops to his knees.
          Up on the roof, Audrey watches helplessly as Kyle falls.

                                 AUDREY
                    Kyle!

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Bob kicks over a table in disgust.

                              BOB
                    Damn it all to hell!

                               CHARLIE
                    Oh, no.   Audrey...
          Out the window they see Audrey drop down from the roof and
          run towards Kyle.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          The young boy stands over Kyle, silently watching the life
          drain from his body.
          The boy looks up to see Audrey approaching fast. Tears
          suddenly appear in his eyes. He opens his arms pleadingly to
          her.

          

                                                                      74.

          

          

                                 YOUNG BOY
                    I'm sorry!     I didn't mean to!

                                 AUDREY
                    Fuck you!
          Audrey raises the 45 and ...     CLICK.   CLICK.   CLICK.
          She keeps pulling the trigger.    Nothing.
          The boy's tears stop instantly. He looks at her with an
          eerie calm for someone so young.

                              YOUNG BOY
                    You're gonna die now.
          The boy moves toward Audrey, stepping over Kyle's body.
          Audrey backs away. She looks toward the entrance to the
          diner. Blocked by advancing creatures.
          They're everywhere.    She's trapped.
          She notices the open door to the MINIVAN.     And so she BOLTS.
          Audrey dives into the car as the throng of creatures rapidly
          closes in. She hammers the auto door lock. CLUNK!
          She moves to the center of the car as gruesome faces press
          against the windows. A nightmare come to life.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Panic.
          Charlie rushes to Michael's side.

                              CHARLIE
                    Do you have no heart?!     She's just
                    a kid!
          But he's immovable.

                              CHARLIE
                    You can't let her die!
                        (grabbing a gun from the

                         TABLE)
                    I swear if you don't do something,
                    I will!
          Charlie COCKS the gun, moves toward the door.

                                 MICHAEL
                    Wait.

          

                                                                    75.

          

          
          Charlie looks back at him, defiant.   No one breathes.   Then:

                              MICHAEL
                        (raising his guns)
                    Open the door.
          Bob springs into action, clearing the door and flipping the
          dead bolt. The door is opened and Michael charges passed
          Charlie and out into hell.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          With stunning calm, Michael marches straight for the pumps.
          IN THE MINIVAN, Audrey screams as the windows begin to CRACK.
          She's running out of time.
          Michael grabs a gas pump, flips the lever and points it at
          the minivan. What's he up to?
          The creatures covering the car turn to look at Michael as if
          they've just now noticed him.
          And that's when he starts spraying gas at them. But wait,
          there's more to this trick. Up comes Michael's Glock in his
          other hand and BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
          The spray of gas EXPLODES into a SPRAY OF FIRE!
          The MINIVAN is engulfed in flames.
          Creatures tear away from the car like fiery comets through
          the night.
          The windows EXPLODE, showering Audrey with tiny shards of
          glass.
          Michael drops the gas pump.
          He reaches through a fire rimmed broken car window and
          unlocks the door.
          Audrey looks up to see Michael's expressionless face CIRCLED

          BY A RING OF FIRE.

                              MICHAEL
                    Come with me.
          Meanwhile, fire is spreading quickly under the car...
          Michael pulls Audrey from the flaming vehicle.

                              MICHAEL
                    Run.

          

                                                                    76.

          

          
          And together they run toward the open diner door.

          BEHIND THEM THE MINIVAN EXPLODES.   A BALL OF FIRE ROARS AT

          THEM!

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          Everyone's eyes go wide at the insanity they're witnessing.
          Audrey is the first one in.
          Michael is almost there.   But the fire is faster, ENGULFING

          HIM IN FLAME!

                               CHARLIE
                    Michael!

                              BOB
                        (pulling Charlie away from
                         the door)
                    Get back!
          BURSTING OUT OF THE FLAMES, Michael marches confidently into
          the diner. Jeep slams the door CLOSED just as the WALL OF

          FIRE REACHES THEM.
          Everyone hits the deck as the FIRE SHOOTS THROUGH THE SLATS
          covering the windows like spindly fingers reaching for prey.
          Michael's clothes are a smoky, smoldering mess.   Jeep and Bob
          rush to pat him down.
          Audrey's coughing from the smoke.

                              CHARLIE
                    I'll get some water!
          Charlie dashes behind the counter to the sink.    She fills up
          a pitcher of water.
          She turns away from the sink with the filled pitcher...
          And SCREAMS!
          The YOUNG BOY with the lifeless white eyes stands before her
          wielding an ENORMOUS BUTCHER'S KNIFE.
          The pitcher shatters LOUDLY on the floor.
          The boy swings the knife at her, slicing open the waitress
          outfit covering her pregnant belly.
          Charlie tumbles back to the ground behind the counter. She
          frantically pushes herself away from the approaching boy.

          

                                                                       77.

          

          
          But she doesn't have far to go before she'll run out of room
          to maneuver.

                                 YOUNG BOY
                       C'mon, don't be scared. I just
                       wanna play with your baby.
          That's it.    She's backed against the end of the counter!
          The boy raises the knife to strike.
          Charlie grabs a baking pan off a shelf. Swings it out in
          front of her body like a shield, as the KNIFE IS DRIVEN DOWN.
          CLANG! The knife hits the pan hard and stops. But the boy's
          hands don't. They slip off the handle and run right down the
          blade.
          The knife CLATTERS to the ground.
          The boy instinctively raises his hands to strike again, but
          there's no knife.
          Charlie watches in horror as the boy calmly realizes that his
          THUMBS ARE MISSING. Blood sprays from the stumps.
          Charlie pulls her legs in close then rockets them out at the
          boy's chest. He's catapulted away from her.
          Michael leaps over the counter, landing in front of Charlie,
          guns ready for action. But the boy is gone.

                                 MICHAEL
                       Are you hurt?
          Charlie shakes her head no.

                                 CHARLIE
                       Where is he?!
          That's when the electricity goes out once again, PLUNGING THE

          DINER BACK INTO DARKNESS.

                                 JEEP'S VOICE
                       He's still in here!
          FLASHLIGHT BEAMS fan out across the diner.
          LIGHTING under chairs.    Under tables.

                                 BOB'S VOICE
                       Where the fuck is he?!
          A SCAMPERING SOUND... MOVING FAST.    Everybody spins to track
          the location of the sound.

          

                                                                       78.

          

          
          As soon as they move in one direction, the SCAMPERING is
          heard in another.
          Jeep's LIGHT CATCHES SOMETHING ON THE GROUND.      A TRAIL OF

          BLOOD.

                                JEEP
                      He's bleeding!

          THE BEAMS OF LIGHT JOIN TOGETHER, MOVING FAST TO TRACK THE

          BLOOD ACROSS THE DINER WHERE IT ENDS AT...

          A WALL...
          Jeep raises his LIGHT UP THE WALL WHERE THE TRAIL OF BLOOD

          REACHES THE CEILING AND...STOPS.

                                BOB
                      What the fuck?

          SCREECH!   THE BLOODY BOY SPRINGS OFF A TABLE BEHIND THEM AND

          LANDS ON BOB'S BACK.
          Bob flails around trying to pull the boy's small, but deadly
          strong arms away from his neck.

                                   JEEP
                      Dad!
          Jeep can't get a clear shot.       Bob's gasping for air.
          Michael grabs the boy and fiercely rips him off of Bob's
          back. He swings the boy around like a living shot put.

                                   MICHAEL
                      Get ready!
          Jeep and Bob whip up their guns as Michael throws the wicked
          creature into the air.
          Sandra's vacant face flickers in the light as the SOUND OF
          GUNFIRE AND INHUMAN SCREAMING fill the diner.
          And then in moments...      All is QUIET.
          BEHIND THE COUNTER, Audrey helps Charlie to her feet.       She
          WINCES. Doubles over, clutching her stomach.

                                   CHARLIE
                      Oh, no!
          Michael lowers his flashlight.      CLEAR FLUID runs down
          Charlie's legs.

                                                                 CUT TO:

          Inky darkness.   A flickering light emanates from within the
          diner.
          TITLE:   "December 25th - 3:33am"
          The sound of CHARLIE'S SCREAM, carries us to:

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - LATE NIGHT

          Charlie, drenched in sweat is writhing on the ground with
          Michael holding down her arms and Audrey kneeling between her
          legs. Pots of steaming water surround them.

                               AUDREY
                     What am I supposed to do? Just
                     `cause I'm a girl doesn't mean I
                     automatically know how to do this!

                               MICHAEL
                     Just do as I say.

                               AUDREY
                     Yeah, but, how do you know how to
                     do this?!

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

          Bob and Jeep keep watch.
          The SPECTRAL LIGHTS in the distance seem to be growing larger
          -- closer.
          Charlie's SCREAMING rises up from below.

                                BOB
                     What a way to bring a child into
                     the world.
                         (looks over at Jeep)
                     She ever tell you his name?

                               JEEP
                     She's never said. I just assumed
                     it was Joe Danvers. You know how
                     she's always had a thing for bad
                     boys.
          Bob hears the spite in Jeep's voice.

          

                                                                     80.

                    Jeep, sooner or later she'll
                    realize you're the best thing
                    that's ever happened to her.

                              JEEP
                    I thought you said I should move
                    on?

                              BOB
                    Can't a father be wrong sometimes?
          Jeep considers Bob with a smile, then comes the sound...
          A DEEP, LONG, BODY RUMBLING TONE rising up off the plain, as
          if emanating from the largest HORN ever constructed.

                              JEEP
                    What was that...?
          The SPECTRAL LIGHTS dot the landscape now with untold
          numbers.

          Michael reacts to the sound. An urgency comes over him.
          Audrey arrives with more steaming water.

                              AUDREY
                    What is that?!

                              MICHAEL
                    He's coming. We have to hurry.

                              AUDREY
                    Who's coming? Whaddya mean hurry?
                    This isn't something you can
                    exactly hurry, is it?

                              MICHAEL
                    Charlie, I need you to push. I
                    need you to push as hard as you
                    can.

                              AUDREY
                    Michael, who's coming?!
          Charlie pushes, tears streaming down her face, delirious with
          pain. It's a gruesome, bloody affair. It's getting close.

                              MICHAEL
                    We're almost there...

          

                                                                    81.

          

          

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

          Jeep and Bob watch helplessly as the ARMY OF CREATURES has
          closed within a hundred yards of the diner. Their ranks
          stretch back seemingly without end into the darkness.

                              JEEP
                    We're not gonna make it outta here,
                    are we?
          Bob looks at his son.   The agony stretched across his face.

                              BOB
                    I'm sorry Jeep. This shouldn't be
                    happening to you...
          Jeep rests a comforting hand on his father's shoulder. Bob
          pulls his son close and hugs him with all his might, tears
          filling his eyes.

          

          INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

          Amidst the dirt and darkness, Charlie lets out a final
          agonizing SCREAM...
          ...and then comes a BABY'S CRIES.   Audrey, eyes wide, holds
          up the CHILD. Stunned. Elated.

                              AUDREY
                    Oh my god...we did it!    Charlie,
                    you did it!
          Audrey places the child in Charlie's arms. She stares at the
          baby, holding it at a distance, unsure of whether to embrace
          it or be terrified by it. A commitment she's not yet ready
          to make, even at this late hour.

                              AUDREY

                        (CONFUSED)
                    It's okay. The baby's okay.
          Charlie looks to Audrey, tears streaming down her face.

                              CHARLIE
                    I don't...I...
          Audrey looks to Michael, unsure.

                              MICHAEL
                    Take him... Give her a minute.
          Audrey nods, takes the baby back from Charlie, tries to
          soothe him by pacing around the diner.

          

                                                                        82.

          

          

                                AUDREY
                      It's okay...It's okay...Shhh...
          Another DRONE OF THE HORN RATTLES THE WALLS.      Menacing.
          Closer.
          Audrey   reacts, crosses to the counter, turns on the radio,
          trying   to drown out the sound of the approaching menace. Out
          of the   STATIC, the haunting sounds of BING CROSBY singing
          SILENT   NIGHT fills the room. The quiet before the storm.
          Michael helps Charlie quickly clean herself up.     She stares
          at him, a burning spite in her eyes.

                                CHARLIE
                      So are we safe now?   Is it over?

                                MICHAEL
                      No. Killing the child would have
                      ended the war before it had begun.
                      Now, at least, he will have a
                      chance to grow up, a chance to lead
                      the world out of darkness.
          Those words provide her little comfort.

                                CHARLIE
                      And what happens until then...?

                                MICHAEL
                      You'll need to teach him how.
          Charlie shakes her head, this is all too much.

                                CHARLIE
                      What makes you think I can do that?
                      What makes you think I want to do
                      that? If he's so important, why
                      don't you take him?

                                MICHAEL
                      Each of us has a burden. This one
                      is yours and yours alone. Maybe
                      someday you'll understand what that
                      means.
          Off Charlie's look, we move across the diner where Audrey
          approaches her mother, kneels down in front of her. Despite
          how much her mother pisses her off, it breaks her heart to
          see her in such a demoralized state.

                                AUDREY
                      Mama? Can you hear me?
                          (holds up the baby)
                      We did it...The baby's alive.

                                (MORE)

          

                                                                   83.

          
                                 AUDREY (cont'd)

                        (BEAT)
                    Mama?
          If Sandra hears her daughter, it doesn't show in her face.
          Tears well up in Audrey's eyes as she moves away from her
          mother. But we HOLD here and...
          DRIFT DOWN BEHIND THE CHAIR TO REVEAL Sandra's hands are
          loosening the bonds. BLOOD TRICKLES from where the rope's
          cut through her skin.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          DRIFTING THROUGH the dark shapes as the BABY'S CRIES
          reverberate up and down the ranks. They begin to look about
          frantically, agitated by the sound. Some even begin to back
          away from the diner.

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

          

          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUOUS

          Off in the distance, the diner is but a dim flickering light
          above the plain. It could almost be mistaken for a stable in
          a desert town a long time ago.
          THREE STARS burn bright and low in the black sky.
          All around us the DARK CREATURES are cowering from sound of
          the CRYING INFANT whose wails seem to grow even LOUDER the
          further away from the diner we get.

          

          HIGH ABOVE THE TRUCK STOP
          In the darkness below we see the lights of the legions of
          creatures dot the landscape and at the center of it all, the
          truck stop.
          The sound of WINGS BEATING AGAINST THE WIND.

          AND WE'RE DRIFTING DOWN TOWARD THE DINER ENTRANCE.   LIKE A

          BIRD CIRCLING ITS PREY.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Jeep and Bob enter the diner to see Michael helping Charlie
          to her feet, while Audrey continues to pace, the bundle of
          bloody blankets cradled in her arms.

                              JEEP
                    Something's happening.    They're
                    moving away.

          

                                                                       84.

          

          

                              MICHAEL
                    The Possessed can't come near the
                    child, so He sent someone that can.
                    Someone like me.

                                 BOB
                    Who?

                              MICHAEL
                    Gabriel. My lieutenant.      He's come
                    to do what I wouldn't.
          ON JEEP as the realization hits him.

                              JEEP
                    Your orders...
          Michael looks at Jeep.

                              JEEP
                    You were the one who was supposed
                    to kill the baby? That was the
                    order you didn't obey.
          Michael nods grimly.    Charlie looks urgently at Michael.

                              CHARLIE
                    What's he talking about?
          The baby CRIES LOUDER.

                              CHARLIE
                    Michael, what the hell's he talking
                    about?!

                              MICHAEL
                    There was never meant to be a
                    Second Coming. But we've just
                    changed that. The child lives.
                    The future is unwritten. There's
                    still hope.
          Charlie, shaken by this revelation, reaches out to Audrey.

                                 CHARLIE
                    Audrey...?
          Audrey moves to hand over the baby to Charlie...

          ...AND THAT'S WHEN SANDRA SPRINGS OUT OF HER CHAIR AND

          SNATCHES THE BABY FROM AUDREY'S ARMS!
          Sandra backs away from them, moving toward the front door.
          Hers is the face of madness.

          

                                                                    85.

          

          

                               SANDRA
                     Stay away from me!    Don't come any
                     closer!

                                AUDREY
                     Mom!

                               BOB
                     Don't do it, lady!

                               SANDRA
                     You heard what he said. They just
                     want the baby. Maybe if we just
                     give it to them, then they'll let
                     us go!
          Michael cocks his gun.   Points it at Sandra.

          THE HORN BLARES ONCE MORE, DEAFENING, SHAKING EVERYTHING IN

          THE DINER. IT'S RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR.
          Charlie squares off with Sandra, panic in her eyes.

                               CHARLIE
                     Give him to me!

                               SANDRA
                     Why?! You never wanted him in the
                     first place!
          Charlie stares at her in horror, the truth of those words
          rattling her to the very core.

                                CHARLIE
                     No...   I...
          Sandra is almost to the front door.

                               SANDRA
                     It's just one baby.   Just one.

          CRASH!   THE DOOR IS TORN OFF ITS HINGES.
          A brilliant SPECTRAL LIGHT pours into the diner.
          Sandra is blinded.   She raises a hand to block the light.
          And that's when Michael fires.    BLAM!
          Sandra staggers back, blood dripping from the hole in her
          forehead, and...

          ...THE BABY GOES FLYING OUT OF HER HANDS!
          Charlie screams and the WORLD MOVES INTO SLOW MOTION...   And
          everything suddenly goes very QUIET.

          

                                                                     86.

          

          
          Michael fires again.   Blowing Sandra's body back through the
          doorway.
          Jeep watches the baby sail SLOWLY through the air.
          The time for Jeep to act is now!
          Jeep DIVES for the baby...catching the bundle of rags mere
          inches from the ground! And then he looks up to see...
          The dark SILHOUETTE OF A MAN approaching from out of the
          spectral light. A MAN WITH WINGS.
          Jeep's eyes grow wide as the FIERCE ANGEL steps into the
          diner. But this looks like no angel we've seen before.
          This is a creature built for war. Rough hewn, battle
          scarred. His body armor making him appear disturbingly
          insect like. His wings are not feathery or gentle. Rather
          they are hard, mechanical, an organic machine.
          The angel's wings retract with clockwork-like precision.
          And now that we see the his face clearly, we notice his
          striking resemblance to Michael. We might even mistake them
          for brothers.
          His name is GABRIEL.
          Gabriel raises a massive, ferocious, strangely mechanical
          looking MACE in his powerful hands.
          And the world returns to NORMAL SPEED as Gabriel brings the
          mace arcing down at Jeep.
          Jeep rolls! CLANG! The weapon just misses him, hitting the
          floor in a spray of sparks, literally CRACKING THE GROUND.
          Gabriel brings the mace up again.   Jeep won't be so lucky
          twice.

                              BOB (O.S.)
                    Sonuvabitch!
          Bob charges at the creature, sub-machine gun blazing.
          Gabriel reacts by instantly UNFOLDING HIS WINGS and launching
          himself into the air. The bullets clawing up the wall behind
          him.
          But Bob's heroic move has given Jeep time to get up and run
          with the baby for the back of the diner. He thrusts the
          child into Charlie's hands. And without even thinking, she
          pulls the child protectively to her chest.

          

                                                                    87.

          

          
          Gabriel drops down in front of Bob, whipping his wings around
          like a deadly, RAZOR SHARP FAN!
          Bob stops firing, a look of surprise stretches over his face.
          His gun falling from his hands.
          Blood begins to pour out of the slice across his belly.

                               JEEP
                    No!
          With a sweep of his hand, Gabriel sends Bob flying across the
          diner where he crashes down behind the counter near the
          stove.
          Michael GRABS JEEP'S HAND before the boy can rush back into
          the fray.

                               MICHAEL
                    No, Jeep! You must protect the
                    child now!

                               JEEP
                    Me?!   What about you?

                              MICHAEL
                    My path ends here. You are the
                    true protector. You always have
                    been.
          Jeep shakes his head, panic setting in.

                              JEEP
                    But I don't know what to do!

                              MICHAEL
                    Find the Prophets.   Learn to read
                    the instructions.
          Michael lets go of Jeep's hand and turns away to face
          Gabriel, leaving Jeep to contemplate those final words.

                              JEEP
                    Prophets? What Prophets?   What
                    instructions?!
          And that's when Jeep opens his hand to find the KEYS to
          Michael's Police Cruiser.
          Jeep looks up from the keys to see Charlie, Audrey and the
          baby. The responsibility crashing in on him. Then he closes
          his hand around the keys, determination building.

                               JEEP
                    C'mon!

          

                                                                  88.

          

          
          Charlie looks past Jeep to see Michael returning to the fray.

                                 CHARLIE
                    Wait!     We can't leave him!

                              JEEP
                    We have no choice!    We have to get
                    to Red Rock!
          He pulls Charlie past the counter toward the back office.
          Jeep stops when he sees his father's broken body lying on the
          ground by the stove in a pool of his own blood.
          Bob's half open eyes focus on his son. In his outstretched
          hand is that goddamn ZIPPO LIGHTER... and next to that, a
          BROKEN GAS PIPE leading to the stove.
          Jeep is terrified.

                                 JEEP
                    Dad!
          Jeep tries to help him up.

                              BOB
                    Leave me, Jeep.     My place is here,
                    remember?

                              JEEP
                    But Dad...!
          Bob smiles weakly at his son and says simply:

                                 BOB
                    Run.
          And so Jeep, fighting back tears, does what his father says.

          Michael and Gabriel square off in the diner, not like
          enemies, but like brothers on opposite sides of a terrible
          family conflict.

          

                                                                    89.

          

          

                              MICHAEL
                    I knew he'd send you, Gabriel. You
                    were always so eager to please Him.

                              GABRIEL
                    Unlike you...the rebellious son.
                        (noticing Michael's scars)
                    Pity about your wings. They would
                    have helped you now.

                              MICHAEL
                    To not feel their burden...is a
                    dream.

                              GABRIEL
                    You think you can defy Him and not
                    pay the price?

                              MICHAEL
                    The child lives. What happens to
                    me doesn't matter now.

                               GABRIEL
                    Yours is a fool's sacrifice. You
                    can help them sneak out the back
                    door, but they won't escape.

                        (BEAT)
                    And neither will you, brother.
          Michael slowly approaches Gabriel.

                               MICHAEL

                        (SOFT)
                    I'm not running anymore.
          Gabriel hesitates, doubt clouding his face.    This was not
          what he was expecting.

                              MICHAEL

                        (SENSING)
                    Join with me. You don't need do
                    this. There's another way.
          A beat, then Gabriel's expression hardens.

                              GABRIEL
                    There is no other way...
          He pulls back from Michael, raising the mace -- SCHING! --
          LONG DEADLY SHARP SPIKES BURSTS FROM ALL ITS SIDES...as if it
          wasn't bad-ass enough.
          And the fight begins.

          

                                                                    90.

          

          
          It's mace against machine gun and strangely enough, it seems
          under Gabriel's deft control, the mace is the vastly superior
          weapon.
          With the aid of his wings, Gabriel moves with staggering
          speed, defying gravity to avoid the rain of bullets. The
          place is getting absolutely shot to hell.
          Michael leaps from table top to table top as Gabriel brings
          the mace brutally down -- splintering everything it touches.
          Michael leaps onto the last unbroken table top -- spins to
          fire. Gabriel pushes into the air, jabbing a spike straight
          into the barrel of Michael's MP5. The gun explodes in
          Michael's hands, sending him rocketing backwards where he
          lands on the counter.
          Gabriel swoops in fast. Michael kicks him in the chest,
          sending him fluttering back.
          Michael thrusts himself to his feet.   Gabriel recovers, jabs
          again.
          Michael grabs a hold of Bob's ceiling mounted TV for support
          and lifts his body just above the deadly spike.
          Michael kicks Gabriel in the head, momentarily stunning him.
          Michael dives at Gabriel, landing an awesome flurry of
          punches.
          Gabriel is rattled back by the assault.   He clumsily lifts
          his mace and thrusts with it.
          Michael narrowly evades the razor point, which drives into a
          wall.
          Michael smashes down on Gabriel's wrist, CRACKING the bones.
          A swift kick to the chest and Gabriel is thrust crashing
          back, losing his grip on the weapon.
          Michael takes a running leap onto Gabriel's back.
          Gabriel launches wildly into the air, trying to throw Michael
          off. They hit the ceiling, but Michael hangs on. Choking
          the life out of Gabriel.

          Audrey and Jeep help Charlie quickly move around the side of
          the diner where the cruiser is parked. They are buffeted by
          winds and sand.
          Jeep puts Charlie and the baby into the front passenger seat

          Jeep turns the key but the ENGINE STRUGGLES TO FIRE UP.
          Panic.

                     I'm trying!
          Jeep gives it some gas, but the ENGINE'S NOT CATCHING.
          A DARK SHAPE POUNCES ONTO THE HOOD OF THE CAR. The light
          catches it, revealing the disfigured face and beard of a
          SHOPPING MALL SANTA CLAUS, his oversized belly gruesomely
          distended.
          Charlie screams.

                                JEEP
                     Fuck!
          Jeep pumps the gas and the ENGINE BURSTS TO LIFE!
          The creature's about to punch a fist through the glass

                               JEEP
                         (throwing the car in

                          REVERSE)
                     Hang on!
          Jeep floors it, causing the cruiser to rocket backwards
          toward the highway.

          BUT THE CREATURE HANGS ON!
          Jeep pulls the wheel hard and the cruiser whips around a full
          180 onto the road.

          THE CREATURE SHOOTS OFF THE CAR AND HITS THE ASPHALT.
          Jeep throws it in drive just as the POSSESSED SANTA rises
          from the pavement.
          Pedal to the metal.

          

                                                                  92.

          

          
          The creature doesn't have a chance as the cruiser PLOWS into
          him.
          BONES CRUNCH as a flash of red and white is sent sailing over
          the car and tumbling down onto the road behind them in a
          cloud of dust.
          Jeep clenches the wheel, pedal to the floor.

                              JEEP
                    Okay, we need to figure out our
                    weapon situation.   Hopefully
                    Michael didn't take everything out
                    of the car.
          Jeep places his Glock on the dash. He sees that he's got a
          police issue shotgun in the front seat rack. Charlie
          searches under her seat.   Pulls out a...GRENADE.

                              CHARLIE
                    Is this what I think it is?

                             JEEP
                    Yes. Now just put it down...
                    Slowly.
          Charlie places it onto the seat.
          Audrey fishes around in the backseat.

                              AUDREY
                        (holding up each item)
                    Okay, all I got is a flare gun
                    thing. Looks like we got a box of
                    flares to go with it.

                               JEEP
                    Okay. Okay. Handgun. Shotgun. A
                    a flare gun... And a grenade.
                    Alright.
                        (hands Charlie the Glock)
                    Load this.

                        (BEAT)
                    Audrey, can you figure out how to
                    load that flare gun without killing
                    us all?

                                 AUDREY
                    I can try.

                              JEEP
                    Try real hard, okay?
          Audrey anxiously sets about loading the flare gun.

          Gabriel flies into a wall in an attempt to crush Michael.    He
          fails that but succeeds in leaving a massive dent.
          Gabriel runs/flies for the opposite wall. This one doesn't
          hold and the two enemies crash through it into the bathroom.
          Unbelievably Michael is still holding on.
          Gabriel is up. He thrusts himself back into the bathroom
          mirror. It shatters painfully behind Michael.
          Gabriel rages out of the bathroom and into the diner.
          Michael continues to ride him like a wild bull.
          Gabriel slams Michael into a wall once more.   It's a brutal
          struggle.
          Gabriel spots his mace sticking out of the wall within arms
          reach.
          He grabs it, holding it futilely in front of him. From this
          angle he'd never be able to hit Michael with it. Gabriel's
          strength is giving way. Michael is winning.
          Gabriel lets out a tremendous ROAR and plunges one of the
          mace's long spikes into his own stomach. Michael's eyes go
          wide with surprise, his grip loosens. Gabriel has run them
          both through.
          Gabriel rips the mace from his body and stumbles forward.
          Blood pours from a huge hole in Michael's chest.   Right
          through his heart.
          Gabriel looks down at the hole in his own belly. Not nearly
          as bad as Michael's. Apparently there's not a lot of blood
          left in this guy.
          Michael falls to his knees.   Weakening.
          Gabriel looms over Michael.   Michael looks up at him, blood
          leaking from his mouth.

                    of them...Now you'll know how it
                    feels to die like one of them.
          Gabriel raises the mighty mace above his head.
          Michael closes his eyes.   Submitting.
          The mace comes swinging down...

          the source of the CLICKING.
          He steps behind the counter and finds Bob lying in a massive
          pool of blood.
          It takes the creature a moment to realize that the CLICKING
          sound is coming from Bob's SILVER ZIPPO.
          Bob is focusing every last ounce of life in his body to
          lighting that lighter. CLICK... CLICK... CLICK...
          Bob looks at Gabriel.

                               BOB
                    Sorry...   We're closed.
          And with one last brush of his thumb, Bob's trusty ZIPPO

          IGNITES.
          Gabriel's eyes go wide as the TINY FLAME DANCES in front of
          the stove's broken gas line.

          of sign swirling in its wake.

          

          INT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

          From the back seat, Audrey watches the fire recede into the
          distance.

                              AUDREY
                    I can't believe it.   Is it really
                    over...?
          Up front Jeep stares out at the dark road ahead.

                              JEEP
                    No...It's just starting...

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Burning wreckage everywhere.
          DRIFTING THROUGH IT until we settle on the SPIKE-SCEPTER
          stuck firmly in the ground. Flames ring the handle.

          

          EXT. HIGHWAY - SAME

          The cruiser blazes down the highway.

          

          INT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - SAME

          Charlie cradles the baby, apprehensive. The baby looks up at
          her, smiles. She can't help but smile back at him. Jeep
          eyes her.

          

                                                                    97.

          

          

                              JEEP
                    Better not hold him too long.
                    Might get attached.
          Charlie looks over, feels his lingering anger.

                              CHARLIE
                    Look, I'm sorry for what I said to
                    you earlier, `bout you following me
                    around. I didn't mean it.

                              JEEP
                    Nothin' to be sorry about. It's
                    true. I did follow you around. At
                    least now I know there was a good
                    reason.
          Charlie's reacts, a bit stung.
          Jeep tries to hide his pleasure that the tables have turned
          at least a little. Charlie is about to respond when Audrey
          leans in from the back seat.

                              AUDREY
                    We're here.
          She points ahead to a beaten up road sign that says:
          "Now Entering Red Rock National Park, Next Rest Stop 30

          MILES"

                              JEEP
                    Okay, all we gotta do is --

          CRASH!
          The roof buckles above them.   The windows BLOW OUT.

          

          EXT. RED ROCK NATIONAL PARK ROOD - CONTINUOUS


          GABRIEL SMASHES DOWN ON THE CRUISER'S ROOF WITH MASSIVE

          FORCE!

          USING HIS MIGHTY WINGS FOR BALANCE HE BEGINS TO STOMP ON THE

          ROOF, CRUSHING IT DOWN AS IF IT WERE A SODA CAN!

          

          INT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

          Jeep, Charlie and Audrey slip frantically down in their seats
          as the roof presses down at them. The windows BURST.
          Jeep grabs the Glock and fires wildly up at the roof.

          

                                                                     98.

          

          

          

          EXT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

          Gabriel takes a direct hit in the thigh, causing him to slide
          off the roof and onto the trunk where he grabs a hold of the
          rear window frame for support.

          

          INT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

          With tremendous strength, Gabriel pulls his upper body
          through the broken back window toward Audrey.

                              AUDREY
                    Jeep!
          Jeep swings the gun around.

                              JEEP
                    Duck!
          BLAM! Gabriel takes one in the shoulder, but it doesn't slow
          him down.

                              JEEP
                    Audrey, the flare gun!
          Audrey desperately tries to load a flare while avoiding
          Gabriel's grasp. Jeep can't get off another shot without the
          risk of hitting Audrey.
          Gabriel is almost entirely in the car now.
          Audrey swings the flare gun toward Gabriel, but he knocks her
          hand aside just as she pulls the trigger and the flare goes
          off INSIDE THE CAR!
          Jeep ducks. The CAR SWERVES MADLY. The flare RICOCHETS
          through the cabin, lighting it up like the Fourth of July!
          Gabriel lunges for Charlie just as the flare bounces off the
          windshield - PING! - and nails him right in the face, SETTING

          HIS HAIR ABLAZE.
          And that gives Jeep the chance to swing around and FIRE.
          BOOM! Gabriel is blown back partially through the rear
          window. He holds onto the car with an iron grip. Starts to
          pull himself back in. Nothing slows this guy down.
          Jeep pulls the trigger again and...CLICK.    No bullets!
          Audrey frantically reloads the flare gun. Brings it up to
          fire, but he's too fast! WHACK! Gabriel knocks her into the
          side of the car with a sweep of his hand. She's out cold.

          

                                                                     99.

          

          
          Now he's clawing his way unobstructed toward Charlie again.
          Jeep knows there's only one thing to do.

                              JEEP
                    Get down on the floor!
          Charlie pushes herself and the baby down on the floor in
          front of the passenger seat.
          Jeep PUNCHES IT.   The speedometer leaps ahead.

          70...80...90...
          Gabriel's now completely in the car.   They're helpless.
          Gabriel lunges over the passenger seat, grasping for Charlie,
          his ferocious hand only inches from her and the baby, when...

                              AUDREY (O.S.)
                    Get off her, you fucking asshole!
          Audrey leaps onto Gabriel, pulling him away from Charlie just
          in time. He flails wildly about but this young girl rides
          him like one helluva a cowboy.

          100...110...120...

                              AUDREY
                    Do it, Jeep! Do it now!

          JEEP SLAMS ON THE BREAKS, SENDING GABRIEL AND AUDREY SHOOTING

          FORWARD THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD LIKE A BULLET.
          The intertwined bodies of Gabriel and Audrey hit the road
          with a sickening crunch and ROLL INTO A BALL OF FIRE.

          

          EXT. RED ROCK PARK - CONTINUOUS

          The Cruiser spins out of control, swerving off the road and
          careening into a large rock formation.
          This ride is over.

          

          INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

          Jeep's side of the car is crushed.   Blood is running down his
          forehead.
          Charlie crawls up from the floor.

                              CHARLIE
                    C'mon, Jeep!

          

                                                                    100.

          

          
          He tries to focus on her.

                                CHARLIE
                    Jeep!
          She kicks open her door and begins pulling him out.

                                JEEP
                    The baby?

                                CHARLIE
                    Alive.

                              JEEP
                    And what about...

                              CHARLIE
                    Nothing could have survived that.

                              JEEP

                        (ANGUISHED)
                    Audrey...

                              CHARLIE
                    She saved us, Jeep. Audrey saved
                    us. Now c'mon, we gotta go!
          Charlie, the baby bundled in her hands, leads Jeep away from
          the demolished Cruiser.

          

          EXT. RED ROCK RIDGE - PRE-DAWN

          Jeep and Charlie, battered and bruised, struggle to make the
          long climb up the ridge.
          Charlie looks up.
          STARS completely fill the pre-dawn sky.   Breathtaking.

                              CHARLIE
                    How can this happen?

                                JEEP
                    What?

                               CHARLIE
                    How can this happen in a world so
                    beautiful?
          Jeep follows her gaze to the sky.
          Endless stars.    Confounding.
          Jeep shifts his eyes to the TOP OF THE RIDGE just ahead.

          

                                                                    101.

          

          

                              JEEP
                    C'mon, we're almost there.
          They are only a few steps from the EDGE OF THE RIDGE when --

          GABRIEL ROCKETS UP IN FRONT OF THEM!
          Charlie screams! Jeep pushes her and the baby out of the way
          just as Gabriel comes down hard in front of them, kicking up
          a cloud of dust.
          Gabriel's mechanical wings haltingly retract. The crash has
          done some serious damage. Much of his skin has burned away.
          Chunks of his armor and flesh are missing as well, including
          a large part of his head, revealing that under his human
          visage is a NIGHTMARISH CREATURE.
          Gabriel charges at Jeep fast. Jeep whips up his Glock, BLAM!
          Gabriel takes the bullet, then slaps the gun out of Jeep's
          hand.
          Jeep throws a wild punch, connects with Gabriel's chin,
          rocking him back. More annoyed than surprised, Gabriel
          knocks Jeep savagely to the ground.
          Jeep struggles quickly to his feet, comes right back at
          Gabriel swinging. But Gabriel simply knocks him to the dirt
          again.
          Jeep slowly gets up once more, bleeding, hurt.   Raises his
          fists. This kid will simply not give up.
          Jeep moves in again, swinging hard, but Gabriel blocks it,
          shoots out a hand and grabs Jeep by throat, lifting him clear
          off the ground.

                              GABRIEL
                    So brave. So pointless. You
                    should have worried more about
                    saving yourself.
          Jeep's feet dangle. His eyes bulge out. He claws at
          Gabriel's iron-fast grip, but there's no hope.
          Charlie watches in horror.

                               CHARLIE
                    Stop!   Please! Don't kill him!
          But Gabriel is doing just that. Jeep is rapidly losing
          consciousness. The battle is lost.

                              GABRIEL
                    Go to sleep...
          Jeep's eyes flutter.   He's almost gone.

          

                                                                   102.

          

          

                               CHARLIE
                    Stop it!   I'LL GIVE YOU THE BABY!
          This gets Gabriel's attention.
          Charlie climbs to her feet, holding the bloody bundle out to
          him.

                              CHARLIE
                    I don't want this responsibility!
          Tears run down her face.   She's dead fucking serious.
          Gabriel lets go of Jeep.   He falls to the ground, gasping
          desperately for air.

                              JEEP
                    Charlie, no!
          Gabriel takes the bundle from Charlie, turning away from her.

                              GABRIEL
                    "And as the child's cries are
                    extinguished, an eternal darkness
                    at last descended upon the world."
          He peels the cloth back, revealing...

          THE GRENADE.
          He spins around to face Charlie.
          She's holding the pin.

          KABOOM!

          GABRIEL IS BLOWN TO BLOODY BITS.
          The creature is gone at last.
          The sound of a BABY COOING.
          Charlie picks the child up out of the brush.
          She helps Jeep to his feet and together they slowly make
          their way to the top of the ridge.

          

          EXT. RED ROCK RIDGE - DAWN

          Jeep and Charlie stand overlooking the desert valley below.
          ON THEIR FACES, reacting to what they see.
          Charlie takes Jeep's hand in hers.

          

                                                                      103.

          

          

                               JEEP
                     We made it.

                               CHARLIE
                     Yep, we sure did.
          And now we see it too:

          

          THE MOJAVE DESERT - DAWN
          Vast.   Barren.   No signs of life.
          No resistance force.    No nothing.

          

          ON JEEP AND CHARLIE
          Taking it in.     Breathing hard.

                               JEEP
                     I'm sure they're just over the next
                     ridge.
          He glances at Charlie.    Worry in her eyes.

                               CHARLIE
                     What if we're on our own now?

                                JEEP
                     Don't be afraid.    We'll be okay.

                         (BEAT)
                     Believe me.
          At those words, Charlie looks deep into Jeep's eyes.       Sees a
          confidence in them she's never seen before.
          And she leans in and kisses him.      Tender.
          When they part, Jeep stares back at her with surprise.      Then
          the surprise melts into a smile.
          And they descend the ridge...out of sight, leaving us with a
          view once again of --

          

          THE MOJAVE DESERT - DAWN
          A BLOOD RED SUN rises behind the distant mountains. The
          unbearable cold will soon become an unbearable heat.
          And we're back where we started.
          A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE.    Solemn.   Weary.   Determined.

          

                                                                   104.

          

          

          IT'S CHARLIE'S VOICE.

                              CHARLIE'S VOICE
                    Someday when my son is older, I
                    will tell him about the time of his
                    birth when all the world was
                    covered in a great darkness...

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          INT. CAR - DRIVING - MORNING - WEEKS LATER

          Jeep is at the wheel. He looks aged, scarred from the
          experience. His exposed arms are completely covered with the
          INTRICATE WRITING...The Instructions. The boy he once was is
          gone at last and the warrior protector has replaced him.

                              CHARLIE'S VOICE
                    ... And how just at the moment when
                    everything seemed lost...
          Charlie sits across from him, the baby cradled in her arms.
          It's strange, but you might actually mistake them for a happy
          family. Of course you'll have to ignore the ARSENAL OF
          WEAPONRY in the back seat.

                              CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                    ...a mighty warrior fell in order
                    to save me.

          image of maternal bliss.

          USINE DE MONTAUBAN - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Le ciel gris du jour qui va bientôt se coucher, au-dessus de la
          cour de l'usine de matériel de Travaux Publics de Fernand Naudin à
          Montauban. Une pelleteuse à chenilles sort lentement d'un hangar,
          avec le godet en position haute. Derrière la pelleteuse apparaît
          Monsieur Fernand Naudin, le directeur de l'usine, en grande
          discussion avec un ouvrier. Il porte un costume gris très élégant
          avec chemise et cravate, et un manteau noir, lui aussi très
          élégant.
                         
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           C'est quand même pas la première fois, non ?
                         
                          PREMIER OUVRIER
           Je dis pas que c'est la première fois que vous montez à
           Paris, Monsieur Fernand, je dis que ça tombe mal. Si le
           vent est frisquet, vous avez une couverture à l'arrière et
           Germaine a mis du thé dans le thermos.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et pourquoi pas de la quinine et un passe-montagne ? On
           croirait vraiment que je pars au Tibet.
                         
          Il s'approche de sa voiture, une Peugeot 404 noire, qu'un autre
          ouvrier vient d'amener dans la cour. Pendant qu'il enlève son
          manteau pour être plus à l'aise pour conduire, le premier ouvrier
          se précipite vers la voiture. Le deuxième ouvrier sort de la
          voiture.
                         
                          DEUXIÈME OUVRIER
           Au revoir, Monsieur Naudin.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Au revoir, Gustave.
                         
          Il s'installe au volant.
                         
                          PREMIER OUVRIER
           Monsieur Fernand, la foire battra pas son plein avant
           dimanche, si vous pouviez quand même être là.
                         
          Fernand a fermé sa portière et il allume une cigarette. Le premier
          ouvrier se penche vers la vitre ouverte.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Je t'ai déjà dis que j'en avais pour quarante-huit heures
           maximum, et puis enfin - Bon Dieu quoi ! - vous avez quand
           même pas besoin de moi pour aligner dix tracteurs dans un
           stand, non ? Hein ?... Tachez plutôt qu'elle tombe pas en
           panne comme la dernière fois.
                         
                          PREMIER OUVRIER
           Qu'est-ce qui a été en panne ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           La dépanneuse.
                         
                          PREMIER OUVRIER
           Oh ! Monsieur Fernand...
                         
          Fernand remonte sa vitre et démarre sa voiture, phares allumées.
                         
          On suit la voiture qui sort de la cour, et la caméra s'arrête sur
          l'enseigne à l'entrée de l'établissement :

          La voiture de Fernand roule dans la nuit, phares allumés.
                         
          Sur l'image, apparaît le générique en lettres blanches.
                         
          Le générique continue sur un plan rapproché du pare-brise de la
          voiture, avec Fernand au volant.
                         
          VOITURE FERNAND - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Nous sommes maintenant à l'intérieur de la voiture, derrière le
          conducteur. Les maisons d'une bourgade endormie défilent derrière
          le pare-brise.
                         
          Le générique continue.
          ROUTE - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Retour sur le plan rapproché du pare-brise, avec la suite du
          générique.

          Retour sur le feu clignotant. Suite du générique.
                         
          Le « cube » Citroën est doublé par Fernand. Suite du générique.

          Les Champs-Élysées déserts et éclairés par les lampadaires de
          chaque côté de l'avenue, avec l'Arc de Triomphe en face de nous.
          Suite du générique.
                         
          La voiture de Fernand avance vers nous, venant de la Place de
          l'Étoile. La caméra la suit. Le clignotant droit clignote. La
          voiture se range le long du trottoir. Suite du générique.
                         
          Plan rapproché sur Fernand, vu à travers la vitre de la portière.
          Il serre son frein à main, puis sort un papier de sa poche.
                         
          Fin du générique.
                         
          VOITURE FERNAND - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Gros plan sur la papier, posé sur le volant : il s'agit d'un
          télégramme, sur lequel est inscrit : « Louis de retour. Stop.
          Présence indispensable. Stop. Snack 11 Champs Élysées. Stop.
          Urgent. Henri »
                         
           MONSIEUR FERNAND (voix off)
           « Louis de retour - présence indispensable »... Présence
           indispensable ! Après quinze ans de silence, y en a qui
           poussent un peu quand même.
                         
          Fernand replie le télégramme et le range dans sa poche. Il a le
          visage un peu fermé. On continue à entendre ses pensées.
                         
           MONSIEUR FERNAND (voix off)
           Quinze ans d'interdiction de séjour. Pour qu'il abandonne
           ses cactus et qu'il revienne à Paris, faut qu'il lui en
           arrive une sévère au vieux Louis, ou qu'il ait besoin de
           pognon, ou qu'il soit tombé dans une béchamel infernale.
                         
          Fernand ouvre sa portière et sort de sa voiture.
                         
          BOWLING - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Fernand monte un escalier au décor assez neutre. On entend les
          bruits d'une salle de bowling.
                         
          Fernand arrive sur le palier et pénètre dans la grande salle de
          bowling. L'endroit est désert à cette heure très matinale. Un
          homme, en chemise à carreaux, est assis sur une chaise au fond de
          la salle. Fernand se dirige vers lui. L'homme se retourne en
          entendant les pas de Fernand.
                         
          L'homme, assis près des pistes de bowling, où un seul client est
          en train de jouer, se lève et se dirige vers Fernand en souriant.
          Il s'agit d'Henri, le patron du bowling. Les deux hommes se
          serrent la main. On aperçoit, derrière Henri, un autre homme
          chauve, en costume gris, assis à la table que vient de quitter
          Henri, et sur laquelle est étalé un tapis de feutrine, et sur le
          tapis, des cartes à jouer. Il s'agit de Raoul Volfoni. Il bat
          lentement les cartes
                         
                          HENRI
           Eh bien ma vieille, tu nous fais attendre, la route a pas
           été trop toc ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ben, suffisamment.
                         
                          HENRI
           Ça fait plaisir de te revoir, le Mexicain commençait à
           avoir des impatiences.
                         
          Fernand donne une petite tape amicale sur la nuque d'Henri.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah, parce qu'il est revenu, c'est pas un char.
                         
                          HENRI
           Oh ben, je me serais pas permis.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Avoue que ça fait quand même une surprise, non ?
                         
                          HENRI
           Les surprises, t'es peut être pas au bout... Viens !
                         
          Il entraîne Fernand vers la sortie de la salle de bowling. Raoul
          les suit des yeux, la cigarette au bec, tout en continuant à
          battre ses cartes, mais il ne bouge pas de sa chaise.
                         
          PALIER D'IMMEUBLE - INTERIEUR NUIT
                         
          Palier d'un immeuble visiblement assez cossu.
                         
          Henri sort de l'ascenseur, suivi de Fernand. Il se dirige vers une
          double porte en bois, et appuie sur le bouton de la sonnette. La
          porte s'ouvre sur un homme en chemise blanche et cravate, la
          cigarette au bec. Il porte un holster, garni d'un pistolet. Il
          s'agit de Pascal, le garde du corps de Louis le Mexicain. Pascal
          regarde Fernand, le visage assez neutre.
                         
                          HENRI
           C'est Fernand !
                         
          Pascal hoche la tête et pénètre dans l'appartement. Henri et
          Fernand le suivent.
                         
          APPARTEMENT DU MEXICAIN - ENTRÉE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
          Fernand referme la porte d'entrée. Une grande plante verte et des
          petits tableaux au mur. Une porte est ouverte sur une chambre.
          Pascal est dans la chambre, debout près de la porte, la main sur
          la poignée. Il fait un signe de tête vers l'entrée.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Monsieur Fernand est là !
                         
          APPARTEMENT DU MEXICAIN - CHAMBRE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Louis le Mexicain, en pyjama, est allongé sur le ventre sur son
          lit. On ne voit que son visage, mais on voit, par contre, le reste
          de la pièce, reflété dans la grande glace, qui couvre tout le mur
          derrière la tête du lit. En gros plan, au premier plan, une grosse
          seringue, que l'on est en train de remplir
                         
                          LOUIS
           Oui, qu'il entre, qu'il entre !
                         
          Dans la glace, on voit Pascal qui fait signe à Henri et Fernand
          d'entrer dans la pièce.
                          LOUIS
           Et ben, c'est pas trop tôt, je croyais que t'arriverais
           jamais... ou bien que t'arriverais trop tard.
                         
          Dans la glace, on voit Fernand s'approcher du lit. Henri reste en
          retrait près de la porte, que Pascal referme derrière lui avant de
          sortir de la pièce. La seringue disparaît du champ.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu sais, neuf cents bornes, faut quand même les tailler,
           hein.
                         
          Derrière Fernand, on voit passer le porteur de la seringue, un
          médecin apparemment, qui se dirige de l'autre côté du lit.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Ça fait quand même plaisir de te revoir, vieux voyou !
                         
          Dans la glace, on voit le sommet du crâne du médecin apparaître
          au-dessus de la tête capitonnée du lit.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           A moi aussi...
                         
          Fernand semble un peu gêné par le spectacle du médecin en train de
          piquer les fesses de Louis. Il détourne légèrement la tête.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Et j'ai eu souvent peur de clamser là-bas au milieu des
           macaques sans avoir jamais revu une tronche amie...
                         
          Louis fait une grimace et serre les dents, au moment où le médecin
          lui pique les fesses.
                         
                          LOUIS
           ... et c'est surtout à la tienne que je pensais.
          Fernand se dirige vers Henri, qui s'est assis dans un fauteuil,
          les bras croisés.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu sais, moi aussi, c'est pas l'envie qui me manquait
           d'aller te voir, mais on fait pas toujours ce qu'on veut,
           hein ?
                         
          Fernand enlève son manteau et le pose sur un autre fauteuil.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et toi ? J'ai pas entendu dire que le gouvernement t'avait
           rappelé. Qu'est ce qui t'a pris de revenir ?
                         
          Il s'assoit sur une chaise, près du lit.
                         
          Dans son lit, Louis, maintenant allongé sur le dos, serre la main
          du médecin.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Merci toubib, merci pour tout.
          Le médecin borde un peu le lit avant de s'éloigner.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Henri, dis-leur de monter...
                         
          Le médecin récupère sa sacoche, posée sur un meuble. Fernand, dont
          la chaise est juste à côté de ce meuble, se lève et recule sa
          chaise, pour permettre au médecin d'être plus à son aise.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Pardon.
                         
          Henri se lève de son fauteuil. Le médecin referme sa sacoche et se
          dirige vers la porte. Fernand rapproche sa chaise du lit.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu crois pas qu'il vaut mieux quand même...
                         
                          LOUIS
           Me coupe pas, sans quoi on aura plus le temps.
                         
          Le médecin ouvre la porte, suivi par Henri.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Henri, fais tomber cent sacs au toubib !
                         
          Le médecin, avant de sortir, fait un petit signe de tête à Louis
          pour le remercier. Henri ferme la porte derrière eux.
                         
          Fernand est maintenant assis sur sa chaise, tout près du lit de
          Louis.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bon alors ? Qu'est ce qui se passe, Louis ?
                         
          Louis parle lentement, avec une certaine fatigue dans la voix.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Je suis revenu pour caner ici et pour me faire enterrer à
           Pantin avec mes viocs. Les Amériques, c'est chouette pour
           prendre du carbure, on peut y vivre aussi à la rigueur,
           mais question de laisser ses os, hein... y a que la France.
                         
          Fernand allume une cigarette.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Et je décambute bêtement, et je laisse une mouchette à la
           traîne, Patricia, c'est d'elle que je voudrais que tu
           t'occupes.
                         
          Fernand a l'air surpris par la dernière phrase de son ami.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et ben dis donc, t'en as de bonnes toi !
                         
                          LOUIS
           T'as connu sa mère, Suzanne « beau sourire » ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           T'es marrant, dis donc, c'est plutôt toi qui l'a connue.
                          LOUIS
           Au point de vue oseille, je te laisse de quoi faire ce
           qu'il faut pour la petite. J'ai des affaires qui tournent
           toutes seules. Maître Folace, mon notaire, t'expliquera.
           Bah, tu sais combien ça laisse une roulette, soixante pour
           cent de velours.
                         
          Fernand se lève.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et sur le plan des emmerdements, trente-six fois la mise,
           hein ?
                         
          Il se dirige vers une petite table basse pour récupérer un
          cendrier.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah, écoute Louis, ta môme, tes affaires, tout ça c'est bien
           gentil mais... Moi aussi, j'ai mes affaires, tu comprends ?
           Et les miennes en plus, elles sont légales.
                         
          Fernand s'est rassis sur sa chaise.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Ouais, j'ai compris, les potes, c'est quand tout va bien.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ça va pas toi, dis ? Hein ? J'ai pas dis ça, hein !
                         
          Fernand a haussé le ton.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Non, non, t'as pas dis ça, t'as pas dis ça, mais... tu
           livrerais ma petite Patricia aux vautours. Oh, mon petit
           ange...
                         
          La voix de Louis se fait pleurnicharde.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ton petit ange, ton petit ange, hein ?
                         
          Fernand se lève et marche de long en large dans la pièce.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Oui, oh, maintenant que t'es dans « l'honnête », tu peux
           pas savoir le nombre de malfaisants qu'il existe, le monde
           en est plein. Ils vont me la mettre sur la paille, ma
           petite fille. On va la dépouiller et on va tout lui
           prendre. Je l'avais faite élever chez les soeurs, apprendre
           l'anglais enfin... tout. Résultat : elle finira au tapin,
           et ce sera de ta faute. Hein, t'entends ? Ce sera de ta
           faute.
                         
          La voix de Louis est de plus en plus pleurnicharde, presque
          geignarde à la fin.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Écoute, arrête un peu, hein ? Depuis plus de vingt piges
           que je te connais, je te l'ai vu faire cent fois ton
           guignol, alors hein ? Et à propos de tout, de cigarettes,
           de came, de nanas, la jérémiade, ça toujours été ton truc à
           toi. Et une fois je t'ai même vu chialer, alors tu vas pas
           me servir ça à moi, non ?
                         
          Fernand s'est énervé au fur et à mesure qu'il parlait, et il
          termine presque en colère.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Si ! Ben, tu te rends pas compte, saligaud, qu'elle va
           perdre son père, Patricia, que je vais mourir ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Je te connais, t'en est capable. Voilà dix ans que t'es
           barré, tu reviens et je laisse tout tomber pour te voir et
           c'est pour entendre ça ? Et moi comme une pomme...
                         
          On frappe à la porte. Fernand s'arrête net de parler et se tourne
          vers la porte.
                         
          Louis a soudain l'air un peu inquiet. On frappe de nouveau, mais
          d'une façon un peu codé. Louis plonge les deux mains sous ses
          draps, puis il fait un signe d'acquiescement à Fernand.
                         
          Fernand se tourne vers la porte.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Entrez !
                         
          La porte s'ouvre. Pascal, le veston sur l'épaule, entre le
          premier, suivi d'Henri, puis de Raoul Volfoni, que nous avons déjà
          vu dans la salle de bowling. Derrière, entre un homme au type un
          peu allemand et au regard inquiétant. Il s'agit de Théo, qui est
          suivi de son « ami », car Théo est homosexuel. Paul Volfoni, le
          frère de Raoul, ferme la marche.
                         
          Fernand regarde les nouveaux arrivants d'un oeil interrogateur, et
          pas vraiment aimable. Il s'assoit sur une commode.
          Ils se rapprochent tous du lit de Louis, qui a toujours les mains
          sous ses draps. Louis tourne la tête vers Théo.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Ben dis donc, Théo, t'aurais pu monter tout seul ?
                         
                          THÉO
           Si sa présence doit vous donner de la fièvre...
                         
                          LOUIS
           Oui, chez moi, quand les hommes parlent, les gonzesses se
           taillent.
                         
          L'ami de Théo se penche vers lui.
                         
           L'AMI DE THÉO (chuchotant)
           Je t'attends en bas.
                         
                          THÉO (CHUCHOTANT)
           A tout de suite...
          L'ami se dirige vers la porte et sort, sous le regard de Pascal,
          qui monte la garde près de la porte. Il a remis sa veste, mais sa
          main est posé, à travers la veste, sur son arme.
                         
          Louis est assis dans son lit, calé sur ses oreillers, les mains
          toujours glissé sous les draps. Dans le miroir derrière lui, on
          peut voir tous ses « visiteurs », alignés au pied du lit.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Voilà... je serai bref. Je viens de céder mes parts à
           Fernand ici présent. C'est lui qui me succède.
                         
          Dans le miroir, on voit Fernand qui a un petit mouvement de
          surprise.
                         
          Raoul se rapproche du lit.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Mais... tu m'avais promis de m'en parler en premier !
                         
          Retour sur Louis allongé dans son lit.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Exact ! J'aurais pu aussi organiser un référendum, mais
           j'ai préféré faire comme ça. Pas d'objections ? Parce que
           moi, j'ai rien d'autre à dire.
                         
          Les frères Volfoni se regardent. On sent Raoul près à émettre une
          « objection », mais il croise le regard, et surtout le sourire
          narquois, de Pascal, planté près de la porte, et il comprend que
          son « objection » sera mal reçue !
                         
          Retour sur Louis sur son lit.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Je crois que tout est en ordre... Non ?...
                         
          Raoul sort le premier, suivi de son frère et de Théo.
          Henri tape sur l'épaule de Fernand, qui semble avoir quand même un
          peu de mal à digérer la décision inattendue de Louis.
                         
          Henri sort de la pièce, suivi de Pascal, qui lui sourit.
                         
          Gros plans sur le visage de Louis, couché sur ses oreillers. Il
          semble soudain très mal en point. Il chuchote :
                         
                          LOUIS
           Pascal... Pascal...
                         
          Fernand, perdu dans ses pensées, se redresse, le visage inquiet.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oh Louis !...
                         
          Il se rapproche du lit, et secoue son ami.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ben Louis ? Louis, quoi merde !... Louis...
          Il se tourne vers la porte et appelle :
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Pascal !...
                         
          Pascal entre dans la chambre, et, voyant la scène, ferme la porte
          et se précipite vers le lit.
                         
          Louis a la voix très affaiblie.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Je ne vais plus pourvoir tenir longtemps.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Déconne pas, Louis !
                         
                          LOUIS
           Tu sais de quoi je parle.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu veux pas que je t'ouvre la fenêtre un petit peu ? Hein ?
           Merde !...
                         
          Il se dirige vers la fenêtre, Pascal reste près du lit.
                         
          Fernand tire les rideaux. Le jour commence à poindre.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu vois ?... Regarde, il fait jour.
                         
          Pascal a posé sa main sur le front de Louis.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Ouais... D'ici... On voit que le ciel ! Mais je m'en fous
           du ciel...
                         
          Pascal ouvre les draps pour prendre le pistolet que Louis tient
          toujours serré dans sa main. Il le pose sur la couverture.
                          LOUIS
           J'y serai dans peu de temps.
                         
          Pascal récupère le pistolet serré dans l'autre main de Louis.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Non, ce qui m'intéresse... C'est la rue.
                         
          Pascal remet le drap en place sur le torse de Louis.
                         
          Gros plan sur le visage en sueur de Louis.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Et ils m'ont filé directement de l'avion dans
           l'ambulance... J'ai rien pu voir. Dis donc, ça a dû
           drôlement changer, hein ?
                         
          Pascal a remis sa main sur le front de Louis.
                         
          Fernand est devant la fenêtre, mais lui tourne le dos.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu sais, pas... pas tellement quoi !
                         
          Retour sur le gros plan du visage de Louis. La main de Pascal est
          toujours sur son front et l'autre main masse la poitrine de Louis,
          dont, la voix est de plus en plus faible.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Raconte quand même !
                         
          Fernand tourne légèrement la tête vers la fenêtre, mais ne regarde
          pas vraiment la rue, et invente en fait ce qu'il raconte. Il a
          l'air assez ému.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et ben... C'est un petit matin comme tu les aimes... Comme
           on les aimait quoi...
                         
          PARIS - CHAMPS-ÉLYSÉES - EXTÉRIEUR AUBE
                         
          Le jour se lève à peine sur les Champs, qui sont encore déserts.
          Mais les lampadaires sont déjà éteints.
                         
           MONSIEUR FERNAND (voix off)
           Les filles sortent du Lido, tiens ! Pareil qu'avant. Tu te
           souviens ? C'est à cette heure-là qu'on emballait.
                         
          La caméra remonte lentement vers le ciel.
                         
          Fondu enchaîné.
                         
          BOWLING - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Fernand est debout devant le guichet de réception. Il a son
          manteau sur le bras. Derrière lui, Théo, dans une alcôve réservé
          au téléphone public, termine une conversation téléphonique et
          tient toujours le combiné dans sa main. Son ami est appuyé sur la
          cloison de l'alcôve.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Si un jour on m'avait dit qu'il mourrait dans son lit
           celui-là !
                         
          Théo jongle avec le combiné et le raccroche.

          Théo éteint la lumière de l'alcôve. Fernand s'est tourné vers lui,
          et l'écoute sans comprendre ce qu'il raconte.
                         
                          THÉO

           Traduction de ce que vient de dire Théo : « La vie d'un
           homme entre ciel et terre passe comme le saut d'un poulain
           blanc franchissant un fossé... un éclair... et c'est
           fait... »
          Il sort de l'alcôve, et prend un paquet de cigarette dans la poche
          intérieure de sa veste. Son ami s'est éloigné.

          Il sort une cigarette du paquet.
                         
          Henri est assis devant les pistes de Bowling, à côté de la table
          sur laquelle sont toujours étalées les cartes à jouer.
                         
                          HENRI
           On nait... On vit... On trépasse...
                         
          Paul Volfoni s'approche du bar, une chope de bière à la main.
          Derrière le bar, son frère, Raoul.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           C'est comme ça pour tout le monde.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Pas forcement ! Enfin, je veux dire, on meurt pas forcement
           dans son lit !
                         
          Il regarde Fernand qui passe le long du bar. Fernand s'est arrêté
          de marcher aux dernières paroles de Raoul.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ben voyons !
                         
          Paul se tourne légèrement vers Fernand, puis regarde son frère en
          souriant. Il donne un élan à sa chope de bière, qui glisse sur
          toute la longueur du bar, et vient s'écraser sur d'autres verres.
                         
          Fernand s'approche d'Henri. Il regarde Paul qui s'éloigne le long
          du bar pour aller se chercher une autre bière. Il se tourne vers
          Henri en se frottant les yeux.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Dis donc, je tiens plus en l'air, moi. T'aurais pas une
           bricole à grignoter, là.
                         
                          HENRI
           Bien sûr.
                         
          Il se lève. Fernand avise un paquet de cigarettes sur la table au
          milieu des cartes.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           C'est à toi, ça ?
                         
                          HENRI
           Sers-toi !
                         
          Henri passe derrière le bar. Paul revient s'installer devant son
          frère avec une bière fraîche. Fernand prend une cigarette dans le
          paquet, et s'installe à une autre table. Il pose son manteau sur
          un fauteuil, et s'assoit dans une autre fauteuil.
                         
          Raoul est toujours derrière le bar, et son frère en face de lui.
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Y a vingt piges, le Mexicain, tout le monde l'aurait donné
           à cent contre un, flingué à la surprise, mais cet homme-là,
           ce qui l'a sauvé, c'est sa psychologie.
                         
          Il s'éloigne de l'autre côté du bar. Paul reste à sa place et se
          tourne vers Fernand.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Tout le monde est pas forcement aussi doué.
                         
          Pascal vient d'entrer dans la salle et se plante devant Théo, qui
          est toujours appuyé sur la cloison de l'alcôve téléphonique.
                         
                          PASCAL
           La psychologie, y en a qu'une, défourailler le premier !
                         
          Il s'éloigne. Théo, la cigarette au bec, ricane.
                         
                          THÉO
           C'est un peu sommaire, mais ça peut être efficace.
                         
          Raoul, un verre à la main, s'avance vers la table de Fernand.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Et le Mexicain, ça été une épée, un cador. Moi je suis
           objectif, on parlera encore de lui dans cent ans.
           Seulement, faut bien reconnaître qu'il avait décliné,
           surtout de la tête.
                         
          Il pose son verre sur la table de Fernand. Fernand prend le verre
          de Raoul et le pose sur la table voisine. Raoul se tourne vers le
          bar.
                         
          Son frère Paul continue à boire sa bière, accoudé au bar.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           C'est vrai que sur la fin, il disait un peu n'importe quoi.
           Il avait comme des vapes, des caprices d'enfants.
                         
          Henri apporte une assiette pleine, une demi-baguette de pain, un
          verre et une bouteille de vin qu'il pose sur la table devant
          Fernand.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Merci Henri.
                         
          Il se sert un verre de vin.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Enfin, toi qu'y a causé en dernier, t'as sûrement
           remarqué ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Remarqué quoi ?
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           T'as quand même pas pris au sérieux cette histoire de
           succession ?
          Fernand boit un peu de vin.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Pourquoi ? Fallait pas ? Ben, j'ai eu tort.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ah ! Et voilà !
                         
          Paul se rapproche de son frère.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Tu vois Raoul, c'était pas la peine de s'énerver, monsieur
           convient.
                         
          Raoul s'assoit en face de Fernand, qui beurre un morceau de pain.
          On entend un téléphone sonner. Henri s'approche du bar pour
          décrocher le téléphone posé dessus.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Y en a qui abuseraient de la situation, mais mon frère et
           moi, c'est pas notre genre. Qu'est ce qu'on peut faire qui
           t'obligerait ?
                         
          Fernand mange son morceau de pain beurré. Au bar, Henri répond au
          téléphone.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Décarrer d'ici. J'ai promis à mon pote de m'occuper de ses
           affaires. Puisque je vous dis que j'ai eu tort, là.
           Seulement tort ou pas tort, maintenant, c'est moi le
           patron. Voilà.
                         
          Henri met la main sur le micro du combiné et se tourne vers les
          pistes où Pascal, en chemise, est en train de jouer.
                         
                          HENRI
           Pascal !
          Pascal se retourne. Fernand et les Volfoni regardent dans la
          direction d'Henri.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Oui ?
                         
          Henri lui fait signe de venir au téléphone.
                         
          Assis à une table,juste au bord des pistes, donc en contrebas par
          rapport à celle de Fernand, Théo est en train de se raser avec un
          rasoir sans fil, en se regardant dans un petit miroir. Son ami,
          qui jouait au bowling, vient de s'assoir à côté de lui. Pascal,
          venant des pistes, passe derrière Théo. L'ami de Théo regarde
          Pascal s'éloigner.
                         
          Paul est toujours debout près de la table de Fernand.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Écoute, on te connaît pas. Mais laisse-nous te dire que tu
           te prépares des nuits blanches, des migraines, des
           « nervousses brékdones », comme on dit de nos jours.
          Derrière Paul, Henri se rapproche de la table, et fait un signe
          discret à Fernand.
                         
          Fernand ramasse son manteau et se lève lentement de table.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           J'ai une santé de fer. Voilà quinze ans que je vis à la
           campagne, que je me couche avec le soleil, et que je me
           lève avec les poules.
                         
          Il ramasse un morceau de pain dans l'assiette.
                         
          Théo est toujours en train de se raser avec son petit rasoir de
          voyage.
                         
          Fernand ramasse le paquet de cigarettes, et se dirige vers le bar.
          Derrière lui, au bord des pistes, Théo s'est retourné pour le
          regarder. Il se lève, son rasoir toujours allumé à la main, et
          s'éloigne. Son ami le suit.
                         
          Devant le bar, Henri explique la situation à Fernand.
                         
                          HENRI
           Y a du suif chez Tomate. Trois voyous qui chahutent la
           partie. Les croupiers ont les foies pour la caisse, ils
           demandent de l'aide.
                         
          Derrière eux, Pascal, qui a remis sa veste, déballe un pistolet
          d'un emballage de papier blanc.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ça arrive souvent ?
                         
          En contrebas, au bord d'une table, Théo souffle dans son rasoir
          pour le nettoyer.
                         
                          THÉO
           Jamais !
                         
                          PASCAL
           Ça doit pouvoir se régler à l'amiable.
                         
          Il introduit le pistolet dans le holster sous sa veste.
                         
                          HENRI
           Si tu tiens à regagner ta province rapido, t'auras intérêt
           à aller voir, ce serait toujours ça de gagner, c'est sur
           ton chemin.
                         
          Derrière eux, Théo, qui est remonté du bord des pistes, se
          rapproche d'eux, et s'assoit à une table.
                         
          Fernand tourne légèrement la tête vers les Volfoni. Raoul est
          toujours assis à la table que vient de quitter Fernand, Paul
          debout derrière lui. Fernand fait un petit signe discret à Henri.
                         
                          HENRI
           Oh ! Les Volfoni. T'inquiètes pas !
          Théo réajuste sa cravate.
                         
                          THÉO
           « La bave du crapaud n'empêche pas la caravane de passer ».
                         
          Henri hausse les épaules, passe devant Fernand et lui tapote
          légèrement l'épaule.
                         
                          HENRI
           Tchiao !
                         
          Fernand le regarde s'éloigner en finissant de manger son pain. Il
          se tourne vers Pascal.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Dis donc, ça te gêne pas qu'on y aille ensemble ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           C'est pas que vous gênez, Monsieur Fernand, mais je ne sais
           pas si ça va bien vous plaire ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et ben ça, je te le dirais !
                         
          Derrière Fernand, Henri, debout les mains dans les poches, discute
          avec Raoul.
                         
          Fernand et Pascal se dirigent vers la sortie du bowling. Avant de
          partir, Fernand a un dernier regard vers Théo, qui le regarde
          partir, les bras croisés. L'ami de Théo remonte du bord des pistes
          et rejoint Théo
                         
           L'AMI DE THÉO (chuchotant)
           A ton avis, c'est un faux caïd ou un vrai branque ?
                         
                          THÉO
           Pour moi, c'est rien du tout. Un coup de téléphone, et dix
           minutes après... Il existe plus.
          PARIS - UNE RUE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          La voiture de Pascal roule dans Paris. Pascal est au volant,
          Fernand est assis à côté de lui. La voiture s'arrête, un peu
          brutalement, à un feu rouge.
                         
          Plan rapproché sur le pare-brise. On voit Fernand qui se frotte la
          joue.
                         
                          PASCAL
           J'admets qu'ils ont l'air de deux branques, mais je n'irais
           pas jusqu'à m'y fier, non ? C'est quand même des
           spécialistes. Le jeu, ils ont toujours été là-dedans, les
           Volfoni brothers, à Naples, à Las Vegas, partout où il y a
           des jetons à la clé, ils tenaient les râteaux, hein ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Mais... l'autre, là ? Le... le coquet ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           L'ami Fritz ?
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Hmm.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Il s'occupe de la distillerie clandestine.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           C'est quand même marrant, les évolutions. Quand je l'ai
           connu le Mexicain, il recrutait pas chez tonton.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Vous savez ce que c'est, non ? L'âge, l'éloignement. A la
           fin de sa vie, il s'était penché sur le reclassement des
           légionnaires.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah ! Si c'était une oeuvre, alors là !... Là, c'est autre
           chose.
                         
          Le feu repasse au vert. La voiture redémarre.
                         
          Fondu enchaîné.
                         
          VOITURE PASCAL - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          La voiture roule très lentement. A travers les vitres, on aperçoit
          une sorte de ferme, au milieu d'un terrain en friche. Une échelle
          est appuyé contre le mur de la ferme et atteint l'une des fenêtres
          du premier étage.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Voilà, ici c'est chez Tomate.
                         
          CHEZ TOMATE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan rapproché sur la voiture, côté conducteur.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Je m'attendais à quelque chose de plus important, mais
           c'est un clapier !
                         
          Pascal ouvre la porte de la voiture, et sort.
                         
                          PASCAL
           D'après Tomate, ce qui passionne le joueur, c'est le tapis
           vert.
                         
          Fernand sort à son tour de la voiture.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Ce qui il y a autour, il s'en fout, il voit même pas.
                         
          Soudain, Pascal semble en alerte.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Planque toi !
                         
          Il s'accroupit derrière la voiture. Fernand contourne la voiture
          et s'accroupit derrière la calandre.
          Une grosse voiture américaine noire arrive sur le chemin qui mène
          à la « ferme ». Elle roule lentement.
                         
          Plan rapproché sur la voiture. Les vitres sont ouvertes. En plus
          du conducteur, un passager est assis à l'arrière et tient une
          grosse mitraillette, dans le style de celles utilisées par les
          gangsters de Chicago à l'époque de la prohibition.
                         
          Fernand contourne la voiture de Pascal pour mieux se cacher. On
          entend la mitraillette tirer.
                         
          Plan rapproché sur l'américaine et le tireur de mitraillette en
          action.
                         
          Fernand court au milieu des voitures garées autour de lui.
                         
          A travers le pare-brise de l'une de ces voitures, on voit la tête
          de Fernand qui émerge lentement de l'autre côté de la voiture.
                         
          La voiture américaine s'éloigne de la « ferme ».
                         
          La tête de Fernand sort prudemment de derrière la voiture qui lui
          sert de refuge.
                         
          La voiture américaine fait demi-tour et revient vers la « ferme ».
                         
          Fernand court entre les voitures garées sur le parking improvisé,
          et va se cachet derrière un arbre. Derrière lui, l'arme à la main,
          Pascal sort en courant de derrière sa propre voiture.
                         
          Il s'accroupit devant une Deux Chevaux Citroën.
                         
          La voiture américaine revient. Au premier plan, derrière la Deux
          Chevaux, on aperçoit l'extrémité du canon silencieux du pistolet
          de Pascal.
                         
          L'homme à la mitraillette a passé la tête par la vitre arrière de
          la voiture américaine et vise vers Pascal et Fernand.
                         
          Le pistolet de Pascal est dirigé vers la voiture américaine. On
          entend les deux « plop » caractéristiques du tir avec un
          silencieux.
                         
          La vitre de l'une des voitures garées vole en éclats.
                         
          Le tireur à la mitraillette tire en direction de Pascal.
                         
          D'autres vitres de voiture volent en éclats.
                         
          Pascal se redresse et tire.
                         
          Le tireur à la mitraillette lâche son arme et fait une grimace de
          douleur. La voiture continue à rouler.
                         
          Pascal tire de nouveau.
                         
          Le conducteur de l'américaine s'écroule derrière son volant.
                         
          Gros plan sur la roue avant de l'américaine, qui pivote.
          Gros plan sur le pied du conducteur, coincé sur l'accélérateur.
                         
          A travers le pare-brise de l'américaine, on voit les buissons qui
          se rapprochent.
                         
          Gros plans rapides et successifs sur le conducteur mort, qui tient
          toujours son volant, sur la roue avant, qui pivote dans tous les
          sens, enfin sur la calandre de la voiture, qui part en tonneau.
                         
          La voiture américaine se retourne et se retrouve sur le toit. La
          portière s'ouvre sous le choc. Un chien aboie.
                         
          Fernand et Pascal observent la scène. Pascal a toujours son
          pistolet à la main.
                         
                          PASCAL
           A l'affût sous les arbres, ils auraient eu leur chance.
                         
          Pascal commence à dévisser tranquillement le silencieux de son
          pistolet, sous le regard intrigué de Fernand.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Seulement, de nos jours, il y a de moins en moins de
           techniciens pour le combat à pied, l'esprit fantassin
           n'existe plus.
                         
          Il souffle dans le silencieux de son pistolet.
                         
                          PASCAL
           C'est un tort.
                         
          Ils se mettent en marche vers la « ferme ».
                         
          Ils passent devant la voiture retournée sur le toit.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et c'est le scénario de qui, d'après toi... les Volfoni ?
                          PASCAL
           Ce serait assez dans leurs sales manières.
                         
          Il s'arrête de marcher et retient Fernand par la manche.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Monsieur Fernand... Je serais d'avis qu'on aborde molo, des
           fois qu'on serait encore attendu...
                         
          Fernand se remet en marche. Pascal le retient de nouveau.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Mais, sans vous commander, si vous restiez un peu en
           retrait... Hein ?
                         
          Pascal passe devant. Fernand le regarde s'éloigner, un peu
          inquiet.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ouais, n'empêche qu'à la retraite de Russie, c'est les mecs
           qu'étaient à la traîne qu'ont été repassés.
          Il suit Pascal vers la ferme.
                         
          CASINO TOMATE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Nous sommes au sous-sol de la « ferme ». Le chien aboie toujours.
          Une porte s'ouvre et Tomate apparaît. Il est en chemise ouverte et
          en veste de toile.
                         
                          TOMATE
           C'est toi qui fais tout ce foin ?
                         
          Pascal est debout devant l'escalier de descente, Fernand derrière
          lui.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Je m'excuse. Monsieur Fernand, le nouveau taulier.
                         
                          TOMATE
           J'étais pas au courant.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Comme ça, tu l'es !
                         
          Il entre dans la pièce, suivi de Fernand, que Tomate dévisage.
                         
                          TOMATE
           Je suis Tomate, le gérant de la partie.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bonjour.
                         
                          TOMATE
           Enchanté, mais qu'est-ce que c'était que cette fusillade ?
           On ne se serait pas permis de vous flinguer sur le
           domaine ?
                         
          La pièce, dans laquelle ils viennent d'entrer, est visiblement la
          chaufferie, avec une grosse chaudière qui trône au milieu de la
          pièce. Derrière la chaudière, Freddy, « l'homme à tout faire » de
          Tomate.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et ben, on s'est permis.
                         
          Pascal inspecte les bouteilles rangées sur des étagères sur le mur
          au fond de la pièce, devant un petit bar, sur lequel est posé un
          téléphone. Fernand passe devant Freddy et le dévisage longuement.
                         
          Derrière la chaudière, une longue table entourée de chaises.
          Pascal a ramassé des dés à jouer sur la table, et les fait jongler
          dans sa main.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Tomate ?
                         
                          TOMATE
           Oui ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Tu devrais envoyer Freddy faire un tour. Y a une charrette
           dans le parc avec deux gars dedans, ça fait désordre...
                         
          Tomate fait signe à Freddy d'aller exécuter les ordres de Pascal.
          Freddy sort de la pièce
                         
                          PASCAL
           Où sont les autres ?
                         
                          TOMATE
           Quels autres ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Les mecs qui faisaient du scandale.
                         
                          TOMATE
           Du scandale ici ? Mais j'aimerais comprendre.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Moi aussi.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Comment ? Mais c'est pas vous qui avez téléphoné ?
                         
                          TOMATE
           La nuit était tout ce qu'il y a de normal.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Qu'est ce que c'est que cette embrouille ?
                         
          Fernand se dirige vers le téléphone.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Le numéro d'Henri ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Balzac quarante-quatre, zéro cinq.
          Fernand prend le téléphone du bar et commence à composer le
          numéro. Pascal continue à jongler avec les dés.
                         
          BOWLING - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Le téléphone sonne sur le bar. Derrière la main qui décroche, on
          peut voir un agent de police en uniforme, avec képi et bâton
          blanc, et un type en imperméable et chapeau de feutre, qui est
          visiblement un inspecteur de police.
                         
          Henri est allongé par terre devant le bar, le corps entouré d'une
          marque à la craie. Il a perdu un de ses chaussons, posé à côté de
          son pied en chaussette, et lui aussi entouré d'un trait de craie.
          Il est entouré d'inspecteurs en civil et d'agents de police en
          uniforme. Un inspecteur le photographie. On entend la voix off de
          Fernand, qui commente les évènements.
                         
           MONSIEUR FERNAND (voix off)
           Maintenant, Henri, y peut plus expliquer les choses... à
           personne... Trois morts subites en moins d'une demi-heure.
           Ah ! ça part sévère, les droits de succession.
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          La 404 de Fernand est garée devant un coquet petit manoir du XVIII°
          siècle, situé au milieu d'un parc boisé.
                         
          Pascal et Fernand viennent visiblement de quitter la voiture.
          Pascal précède Fernand et porte sa valise et un cintre sur lequel
          est pendu un costume sombre. Fernand porte son manteau sur
          l'épaule.
                         
          Ils montent les marches du perron de l'entrée principale.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Le Mexicain l'avait achetée en viager à un procureur à la
           retraite.
                         
          Pascal sonne à la porte.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Après trois mois... l'accident bête... Une affaire !
                         
          La porte s'ouvre. Pascal s'efface pour laisser entrer Fernand.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - VESTIBULE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Le vestibule, comme le reste du manoir d'ailleurs, est meublé en
          meubles anciens, qui semblent tous authentiques.
                         
          La porte d'entrée est maintenue ouverte par Jean, le maître
          d'hôtel. Il porte pantalon noir, veste blanche, chemise blanche et
          cravate noire.
                         
          Fernand entre le premier, suivi de Pascal. Fernand regarde autour
          de lui. Derrière son dos, Jean fait un signe discret à Pascal, qui
          lui répond par un autre signe affirmatif.
                         
                          JEAN
           Welcome sir, my name is John !
           (Traduction : Bienvenue, monsieur, je m'appelle Jean)
                         
          Fernand regarde Pascal d'un oeil interrogateur pendant que Jean
          referme la porte. Pascal hausse légèrement les épaules et fait une
          petite moue, qui signifie « sans importance », puis il s'éloigne
          avec la valise, qu'il dépose au pied de l'escalier. Il jette
          négligemment la veste sur la rampe en bois ouvragé. Fernand
          récupère sa veste, la secoue et l'accroche sur la rampe par le
          cintre. Jean, qui l'a suivi, lui indique le chemin à suivre.

           Please...

          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - CUISINE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Maître Folace est assis, en robe de chambre sur son pyjama, devant
          la table, terminant son petit déjeuner. Pascal est debout devant
          lui.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Il est mort, il y a deux heures.
          On découvre la table, sur lequel il y a un jeu d'échec, avec un
          livre sur les échecs ouvert devant Folace, qui termine son verre,
          et fume une cigarette, fichée dans un fume-cigarette. A côté des
          échecs, plusieurs bouteilles de Champagne vide.
                         
                          PASCAL
           On aurait pu être là plus tôt, mais on a été retardé. Des
           espèces de contestation. Et puis... Henri s'est fait
           descendre.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Les Volfoni ?
                         
          Pascal écarte les bras et fait une moue signifiant « je n'en sais
          rien ».
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Quand le lion est mort, les chacals se disputent l'empire.
           Enfin, on ne peut pas demander plus aux Volfoni qu'aux fils
           de Charlemagne.
                         
          Fernand vient d'entrer, une cigarette au bec. Folace se lève.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Ah ! Maître Folace, notaire.
                         
          Fernand et Folace se serrent la main.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bonjour monsieur.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Heureux de vous accueillir, j'aurais préféré, bien sûr, que
           ce soit dans d'autres circonstances. Votre chambre est
           prête, le Mexicain avait donné des ordres.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et bien, vous êtes gentil, je vous remercie, mais... ce qui
           m'arrangerait surtout, c'est si on pouvait régler nos
           affaires dans la journée, quoi...
                         
          Folace marque un temps et revient lentement vers la table.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Vous étiez l'ami de Louis depuis longtemps ?
                         
          Il se rassoit à sa place derrière la table.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Depuis toujours.
                         
          Jean, qui vient d'entrer dans la pièce, tend un briquet allumé à
          Fernand.
                         
                          JEAN
           Mademoiselle va avoir du chagrin.
                         
          Maître Folace s'est servi un café à partir du percolateur en verre
          posé devant lui.
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Ah non... Stop... Sujet interdit ! Attention messieurs, pas
           de fausses notes, la volonté du défunt est formelle : pour
           Patricia, le plus longtemps possible, son papa se porte
           comme un charme. Il joue les centaures quelque part dans
           les sierras Mexicaines, mal desservies par la poste, ce qui
           explique son silence.
                         
          Pascal pose la main sur l'épaule de Folace.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Bon, je dois partir. Maître Folace sait toujours où me
           joindre, j'habite chez ma mère.
                         
          Fernand et Pascal se serrent la main.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oui merci, hein !
                         
          Pascal sort. Fernand enlève sa veste.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Je suis bien content que vous soyez là, vous savez. Parce
           que moi, avec la petite, j'y arrive plus. C'est peut être
           parce que je la connais depuis trop longtemps. Pensez,
           c'est moi qui l'aie tenu sur les fonts baptismaux, alors...
                         
          Fernand a posé sa veste sur une chaise, et il retrousse ses
          manches. Jean se rapproche de la table et verse du café dans une
          tasse.
                         
                          JEAN
           Y avait une belle cérémonie, mademoiselle était déjà
           ravissante.
                         
                          MAÎTRE FOLACE
           Dites-moi, mon ami, si vous montiez les bagages de Monsieur
           Naudin ?
                         
          Jean se met au garde-à-vous, et crie :
                         
                          JEAN
           Yes sir !
           (Traduction : Oui, monsieur)
                         
          Fernand sursaute.
                         
          Jean sort de la pièce. Folace fait un petit signe muet à Fernand.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Dites moi, si ça vous fait rien, j'aimerais bien qu'on
           aborde un petit peu les choses sérieuses. Parce que... les
           caprices d'une gamine c'est bien beau, ça, mais faut quand
           même pas s'en faire pour ça non, on est bien d'accord ?
                         
          Folace a repris son fume-cigarette.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Ah mais moi, je ne m'en fais pas, je ne m'en fais plus.
           Maintenant que vous êtes là, c'est vous que ça regarde.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Comment ça, moi ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Eh ben ? Vous avez accepté de vous occuper d'elle, non ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ben oui.
                         
          Folace soulève sa tasse de café.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           A la bonne votre, mon cher. Vous allez connaître tout ce
           que j'ai connu : les visites aux directrices, les mots
           d'excuses, les billets de renvoi...
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Vous allez quand même pas dire que mademoiselle Patricia
           s'est fait éjecter, non ?
                         
          Il se lave les mains dans l'évier.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Ah ! De partout, mon cher.
                         
          Il se lève, prend un toast sur la table, le renifle, prend un air
          un peu dégoûté, et jette le toast en l'air.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Mademoiselle n'a jamais tenu plus de six mois. Juste le
           temps d'user les patiences. Oui, vraiment, je suis content
           que vous soyez là.
                         
          Fernand coupe le robinet et se secoue les mains. Puis il prend un
          torchon pour se les essuyer.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oui, mais pas pour longtemps, parce que ça va changer, et
           vite, hein, c'est moi qui vous le dit. La boite que je vais
           lui trouver, va falloir qu'elle y reste, croyez moi ! Ou
           sinon, je vais la filer chez les vraies soeurs, les vraies,
           la pension au bagne avec le réveil au clairon et tout le
           toutim, non mais sans blague ?
                         
          Il jette son torchon d'un geste rageur.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Et bien, faut le lui dire à elle.
                         
          Fernand remet sa veste.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oh mais, je vais lui dire, et puis tout de suite. Où est-
           elle ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Elle dort. Elle a organisé une petite sauterie qui nous a
           entraîné jusqu'à trois heures du matin.
          Fernand exécute une légère courbette de surprise. Jean entre dans
          la pièce.
                         
                          JEAN
           Your room is ready sir !
           (Traduction : Votre chambre est prête, monsieur)
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Il veut dire que votre chambre est prête.
                         
          Jean ressort de la cuisine.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah bon. Dites donc, il picole pas un peu, votre British ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Oh la la ! Et puis il est pas plus British que vous et moi.
           C'est une découverte du Mexicain.
                         
          Les deux hommes se dirigent vers la porte de la cuisine.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - VESTIBULE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Les deux hommes sortent de la cuisine et longent l'escalier.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Il l'a trouvé où ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Ici, il l'a même trouvé devant son coffre-fort. Y a dix-
           sept ans de ça. Avant d'échouer devant l'argenterie, l'ami
           Jean avait fracturé la commode louis XV.
                         
          Folace commence à monter l'escalier, suivi de Fernand.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Le Mexicain lui est tombé dessus juste au moment où
           l'artiste allait attaquer les blindages au chalumeau.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et bien, je vois d'ici la petite scène.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Vu ses principes, le patron pouvait pas le donner à la
           police, ni accepter de régler lui-même les dégâts.
                         
          Ils viennent d'arriver sur le palier du premier étage.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Résultat : Jean est resté ici trois mois au pair comme
           larbin pour régler la petite note. Et puis, la vocation lui
           est venue, le style aussi, peut-être également la sagesse.
           Dans le fond, nourri, logé, blanchi, deux costumes par an,
           pour un type qui passait la moitié de sa vie en prison...
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Il a choisi la liberté quoi !
                         
          Ils continuent vers le deuxième étage, sur le palier duquel Jean
          les attend. Ils passent devant lui.
                         
          Fondu au noir.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - SALLE DE BAINS - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Gros plan sur l'évier. On voit la main de Fernand qui pose le
          rasoir sur le rebord de l'évier, puis qui ouvre le robinet.
                         
          Zoom arrière. Avec ses deux mains, Fernand, qui est torse nu, ôte
          le reliquat de mousse sur son visage. Puis il prend une serviette
          de toilette pour s'essuyer.
                         
          Il relève la tête, et dans la glace de l'armoire de toilette au-
          dessus du lavabo, on voit Patricia debout à l'entrée de la salle
          de bains.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Oh, c'est drôle, je vous voyais plus grand, plus bronzé,
           mais c'est pas grave. Vous êtes bien l'oncle Fernand ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ben... Oui.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           On pourrait peut être s'embrasser ? Ça se fait.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah bon, ben alors... Si ça se fait, ben allons-y !
                         
          Ils se déposent mutuellement une bise sur chaque joue. Fernand
          renfile sa veste de pyjama. Il avait, bien entendu, gardé sa
          culotte de pyjama !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Dis donc, heureusement que je viens de me raser, hein ?
                         
          Patricia porte une petite robe simple sans manche. Une broche de
          pierreries (vraies ou fausses ?) est accrochée sur la robe. Elle
          s'assoit sur le bord de la baignoire.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Papa m'avait annoncé votre arrivée.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Quand ça ?
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Dans sa dernière lettre, il y a bien un mois. Ça vous
           étonne ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Euuuuh... Non... oh non !
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Y avait trois pages, rien que sur vous, vos aventures, vos
           projets, sans compter tout ce que vous avez fait pour lui.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Dis moi, tu sais, j'aimerais bien avoir un petit peu de thé
           et du pain, du beurre et peut être des oeufs au bacon aussi,
           hein ? Tu ne pourrais pas t'occuper de ça en bas ?
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Du thé à sept heures du soir ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           C'est à dire qu'en ce moment, je suis un tantinet décalé
           dans mes horaires... oui !
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Ah bon !
                         
          Elle va pour sortir, puis se ravise et se tourne vers lui.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Oh ! Au fait, ça a du être quelque chose la fois où vous
           l'avez sorti du fleuve ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qui ça ?
                         
          Elle rentre dans la salle de bains.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Ben, papa. Il m'annonçait dans sa lettre : « Fernand m'a
           sorti d'un drôle de bain ». Ce qu'il a oublié de me dire,
           c'est quel fleuve c'était ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Écoute, soit gentille, moi, je meurs de faim, alors va
           t'occuper de mon petit en-cas, tu veux ? Hmm ?...
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Vous ne voulez pas me répondre ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Mais c'est pas que je veux pas, mais comment tu veux que je
           m'en rappelle moi, hein ? La-bas des fleuves t'as que ça, à
           droite, à gauche, devant, derrière, partout, et bourrés de
           crocodiles en plus, voilà t'es contente maintenant ? Bon
           alors maintenant va, et laisse-moi finir ma toilette, et
           puis on parlera après, hein ? Parce que tu t'en doutes,
           Patricia, faut quand même qu'on parle.
                         
          Il la raccompagne jusqu'à la porte.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Oui, mon oncle.
                         
          Elle affiche un petit sourire un peu moqueur.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qu'on parle de choses sérieuses.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Oui, Tonton. Ça ne vous ennuie pas que je vous appelle
           Tonton ?
                         
          Elle sort. Fernand rentre dans la salle de bains, mais Patricia
          réapparait à la porte.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Vous en avez tué beaucoup ?...
                         
          Fernand se retourne lentement.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Des crocodiles ?
                         
          Elle rentre dans la salle de bains.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Et là-bas y a que ça, devant, derrière, à gauche, à droite,
           partout ! Bon, eh bien, je vais m'occuper de votre thé.
                         
          Après avoir, tout en parlant, fait un tour complet autour de
          Fernand, elle ressort, les mains croisées derrière le dos, avec
          une fausse allure de petite fille bien sage.
                         
          Fernand regarde pensivement la glace de la salle de bains et se
          masse la nuque.
                         
          Fondu enchaîné.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - SALON - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Un salon richement meublé. Dans une vitrine, des miniatures
          militaires napoléoniennes, visiblement d'époque et authentiques.
                         
          Folace, le fume-cigarette au bec, entraîne Fernand, habillé d'un
          costume sombre vers le milieu de la pièce.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Puisque la fermeté a l'air de vous réussir, je vais vous
           donner l'occasion de vous distinguer.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Mais à propos de quoi ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           D'argent !... D'argent qui ne rentre pas. Depuis deux mois,
           les Volfoni n'ont pas versé les redevances de la péniche.
           Tomate a plus d'un mois de retard, et Théo etc...
                         
          Folace a ramassé des documents sur une table, et il les feuillète
          sous le regard de Fernand.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Mais qu'est ce que c'est ? Une révolte ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Non sire, une révolution !... Personne ne paie plus rien !
                         
          Il donne les documents à Fernand, qui les feuillète à son tour.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Non mais, ces mecs-là auraient quand même pas la prétention
           d'engourdir le pognon de ma nièce, non ?
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           On dirait.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Le Mexicain était au courant.
                         
          Folace tire les double-rideaux sur la fenêtre.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Ah non, non, surtout pas ! C'était un homme à tirer au
           hasard sans discernement, alors les ragots... dans la
           presse, si c'était tombé sous les yeux de la petite, vous
           voyez ça d'ici !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ouais, ce que je vois surtout, c'est que si on doit arriver
           à flinguer, vous préférez que ce soit moi qui m'en charge,
           hein, c'est ça ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Un tuteur, c'est pas pareil.
                         
          Fernand pose les documents sur la table.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ça se guillotine aussi bien qu'un papa !
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Mais qui vous demande d'intervenir personnellement ? Nous
           avons Pascal. Je le convoque ou pas ?
                         
          Fernand se dirige vers la porte du salon.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Si je devais pas être à la foire d'Avignon dans quarante-
           huit heures, je dirais non, mais je suis pris par le temps.
           Et puis je reconnais que c'est jamais bon de laisser dormir
           les créances, et surtout de permettre au petit personnel de
           rêver.
                         
          Il sort du salon.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - PETIT SALON - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Fernand entre dans un autre salon.
                         
          Un jeune homme portant un tricot gris ras-du-cou, et dessous une
          chemise et une cravate, lui saute dessus. Il s'agit d'Antoine
          Delafoy, le « fiancé » de Patricia.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Vous parlez de rêver... rêvez-vous en couleur ? Antoine
           Delafoy, le plus respectueux, le plus ancien, le plus
           fidèle ami de Patricia.
                         
          Il s'incline respectueusement devant Fernand, qui semble on ne
          peut plus surpris.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Je vous connais, monsieur, et je vous admire.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Hein ?...
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Patricia vous évoque, vous cite, vous vante en toute
           occasion, vous êtes le gaucho, le centaure des pampas,
           l'oncle légendaire...
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et moi, elle m'a jamais parlé de vous.
                         
          Il s'éloigne de lui. Antoine reste sur place, mais se retourne
          pour continuer à lui parler.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Ah... Patricia n'a pas eu le temps, mais ça ne fait rien.
           je ferais donc mon panégyrique moi-même, c'est parfois
           assez édifiant et souvent assez drôle, car il m'arrive de
           m'attribuer des mots qui sont en général d'Alphonse Allais
           et des aventures puisées dans la vie des hommes illustres.
                         
          Il se dirige vers Fernand. Et l'on découvre que ce dernier est
          debout près d'un canapé, sur lequel Patricia est assise. Sur une
          table basse devant le canapé, quelques bouteilles d'alcool.
          Fernand regarde Patricia d'un oeil interrogateur.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Il est toujours comme ça ?
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Absolument pas ! C'est son côté agaçant, il faut qu'il
           parle. En vérité c'est un timide. Je suis sûre que vous
           serez séduit, quand vous le connaîtrez mieux.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Parce qu'en plus, monsieur séduit.
          Jean vient d'entrer dans la pièce, portant un petit seau à glaçons
          en cristal.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Je ne séduis pas : j'envoûte...
                         
          Jean pose le petit seau sur la table basse. Antoine le lui prend
          des mains.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Leave it, Jean, and I'll do it
           (Traduction : Laissez, Jean, je vais le faire)
                         
          Jean s'incline légèrement. Fernand s'assoit dans un fauteuil en
          face du canapé.
                         
                          JEAN
           Thank you, sir.
           (Traduction : Merci, Monsieur)
                         
          Antoine verse du whisky dans un verre. Jean sort lentement de la
          pièce. Avant de sortir, il regarde longuement Fernand, qui lui
          rend son regard. On comprend qu'ils ont, tous deux, la même
          opinion d'Antoine.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Pour en revenir à vos rêves en couleur, savez vous que
           Borowski les attribuent au phosphore qui est contenu dans
           le poisson ?
                         
          Il tend le verre à Fernand, qui regardait Jean sortir et qui se
          retourne pour prendre le verre.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Moi je préfère m'en tenir à Freud, c'est plus rigolo.
           Qu'est-ce que vous en pensez ?
                         
          Fernand prend une petite bouteille d'eau gazeuse sur la table
          basse.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Rien. Je ne rêve pas en couleur, je ne rêve pas en noir, je
           ne rêve pas du tout. Je n'ai pas le temps.
                         
          Antoine prend la petite bouteille de la main de Fernand.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Je vous déconseille l'eau, ce serait un crime, il a dix ans
           d'âge.
                         
          Fernand reprend la petite bouteille d'un geste rageur. Il regarde
          Patricia avec, dans les yeux, une visible colère contenue.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Tonton est débordé par ses affaires.
                         
          Antoine s'accroupit devant le fauteuil de Fernand. Derrière lui,
          on voit Jean qui rentre dans la pièce.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Vous viendrez bien avec nous demain soir.
                         
          Jean est suivi par Folace.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et où ça ?
                         
          Fernand verse de l'eau dans son whisky. Antoine grignote une
          olive.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Il demande où ça ? Oh, oh, Dieu, qu'il est drôle. Franck
           Émile jouera pour la première fois à Pleyel.
                         
          Fernand, de plus en plus agacé par le déluge verbal d'Antoine, se
          tourne vers Folace, qui met la main devant sa bouche pour masquer
          son hilarité.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Corelli, Beethoven, Chopin, tout ça c'est très dépassé,
           c'est très con...
          Fernand se tourne de nouveau vers Folace, qui, cette fois-ci, lui
          fait un petit signe discret, et sort de la pièce.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           ... mais avec Mills, ça peut devenir féroce, tigresque.
           Bref, tout le monde y sera.
                         
          Fernand repose son verre, tapote sur le genou d'Antoine, puis se
          lève lentement.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           D'accord, d'accord, je sais que c'est la coutume d'emmener
           l'oncle de province au cirque. Je vous remercie d'ailleurs
           d'y avoir pensé, mais vous irez sans moi.
                         
          Il ouvre vivement la porte. Mais il ne sort pas tout de suite. Il
          maintient la porte ouverte, tout en regardant longuement Patricia
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Moi demain à sept heures, je ne serais pas loin de
           Montauban, quant à mademoiselle Patricia, elle, sera à ses
           études, nous sommes bien d'accord, Patricia ?
                         
          Patricia hoche la tête.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Oui, Tonton !
                         
          Fernand fait un petit signe de tête à Antoine, qui s'est approché
          de la porte et le regarde avec les mains dans les poches. Fernand
          sort de la pièce en refermant la porte derrière lui.
                         
          Antoine reste un instant devant la porte fermée, puis il se tourne
          vers Patricia en faisant une petite moue.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Je crois que t'as raison, faut pas le brusquer.
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - VESTIBULE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Les mains sur les hanches, près de la porte qu'il vient de fermer,
          Fernand regarde Folace et Pascal, qui vient certainement
          d'arriver, car il a encore son imperméable sur le dos.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qu'est-ce qui se passe encore ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Notre ami va se faire un plaisir de vous l'expliquer...
                         
                          PASCAL
           Les Volfoni ont organisé, à la péniche, une petite réunion
           des cadres, façon meeting si vous voyez ce que je veux
           dire, enfin quoi, on parle dans votre dos.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et tu tiens ça d'où ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Je ne peux pas le dire, j'ai promis, ce serait mal.
          Fernand fait un petit signe de tête à Folace.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Alors ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Eh bien, y a deux solutions : ou on se dérange... ou on
           méprise...
                         
          Il parle avec un petit sourire forcé. Il regarde Pascal, qui hoche
          lentement la tête. Son sourire s'efface.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Oui, évidemment, n'importe comment, une tournée
           d'inspection ne peut jamais nuire, bien sûr !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Eh bien, on va y aller !
                         
          Il va pour ouvrir la porte du petit salon, mais Pascal l'en
          empêche.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Monsieur Fernand ?... Y a peut être une place pour moi dans
           votre auto... Des fois que la réunion devienne houleuse ...
           J'ai une présence tranquillisante...
                         
          Il se frotte lentement les mains, avec un petit sourire entendu.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - SALLE A MANGER - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          La salle à manger communique avec le petit salon par une grande
          ouverture sans porte. On entend la porte du petit salon s'ouvrir.
          Patricia est en tain d'allumer des bougies, et sans se retourner,
                         ELLE DEMANDE :
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Vous préférez le foie gras pour commencer ou pour finir ?
                         
          Fernand s'avance vers elle, suivi par Antoine.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           C'est à dire que je le préférerais demain, je suis obligé
           de sortir. Un conseil d'administration...
                         
          Antoine s'accroupit légèrement, les mains tordues par une surprise
          un peu trop affectée.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Quoi ? Vous n'allez pas dîner avec nous ? Moi qui venais de
           dire à Jean de nous monter du champagne ?
                         
          Fernand se tourne vers Antoine, mais lui parle d'une voix très
          froide.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Votre invitation me bouleverse ! Bon appétit quand même !
                         
          Derrière Antoine, on voit Fernand qui traverse le petit salon,
          puis sort de la pièce. Antoine s'avance lentement vers la table,
          ramasse quelque chose dessus et le mange. Puis il se penche pour
          sentir le foie gras.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           C'est du bidon !
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Sûrement pas. Il vient de Strasbourg, on le paie un prix
           fou...
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Non, je parle du conseil d'administration de ton oncle. Si
           tu veux mon avis, l'oncle des pampas va courir la gueuze.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Tu crois ?
                         
          Antoine lui répond par une petit mimique très explicite.
                         
          PÉNICHE - SALLE DE JEU - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          La salle principale de la péniche sur laquelle les Volfoni ont
          organisé une sorte de casino clandestin. Cette salle principale
          est la salle de roulette. Au centre de la pièce, une grande table
          avec, dessus, une roulette et le tapis correspondant. Sur le côté
          de la pièce, un petit bar.
                         
          Raoul est debout en bout de table. Il semble très en colère.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Voilà quinze ans qu'on fait le trottoir pour le Mexicain,
           j'ai pas l'intention de continuer à tapiner pour son
           fantôme.
                         
          Il s'assoit. Assise à côté de lui, Madame Mado, la maquerelle
          semble apprécier moyennement les dernières paroles de Raoul.
                          MME MADO
           Le trottoir, le tapin, c'est drôle, ça ? On croirait que tu
           cherches le mot qui blesse ?
                         
          Paul, la cigarette au bec, debout, mais à moitié avachi sur la
          table, joue négligemment avec la roulette.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           C'est des images.
                         
                          MME MADO
           Les images, ça m'amusait quand j'étais petite, j'ai passé
           l'âge ! Je dis pas que Louis était toujours très social,
           non... il avait l'esprit de droite.
                         
          Assis à côté de Mado, Freddy joue négligemment avec les jetons,
          qu'il lance sur le tapis. Aux dernières paroles de Mado, il se
          tourne vers Raoul, qui réagit mollement.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Oh, dis... hé !
                          MME MADO
           Quand tu parlais augmentation ou vacances, il sortait son
           flingue avant que t'aies fini. Mais il nous a tout de même
           apporté à tous la sécurité.
                         
          Raoul tape sur la table et se lève d'un bond.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ramasser les miettes, vous appelez ça la sécurité, vous ?
           Vous savez combien il nous a coûté le Mexicain en quinze
           ans ? Vous savez combien qu'il nous a coûté ? Oh, dis leur,
           Paul, moi je peux plus.
                         
          Il se rassoit, en proie à une émotion intense.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           A cinq cents sacs par mois, rien que de loyer, ça fait six
           briques par an, quatre-vingt-dix briques en quinze ans.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Plus trente briques de moyenne par an sur le flambe. Vous
           savez à combien on arrive ? Un demi milliard !
                         
          Il se tourne vers Tomate, assis à côté de lui en face de Mado.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Et toi, pareil pour la petite ferme.
                         
          Il s'emporte un peu.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ben dis que c'est pas vrai !
                         
          Tomate s'amuse à empiler des jetons. Il reste très calme.
                         
                          TOMATE
           J'ai rien dis !
          Assis à côté de Tomate, Bastien, le porte-flingue des Volfoni,
          puis à côté de lui, Paul, toujours avachi sur la table et occupé à
          jouer avec la roulette.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ben moi, je dis que je lâcherais plus une tune ! Et je vous
           invite à tous en faire autant.
                         
          A côté de Freddy, l'ami de Théo fume une cigarette, et à côté de
          lui, Théo fume un cigare. Théo est donc assis de l'autre côté de
          la roulette, en face de Paul. Il parle calmement avec son léger
          accent allemand.
                         
                          THÉO
           Vous invitez, vous invitez... C'est très aimable, mais il y
           a des invitations...
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Qu'est ce qui te gêne, toi ?
                         
          Théo se tourne pour regarder Raoul droit dans les yeux.
                          THÉO
           Le climat... trois morts depuis hier, si ça doit tomber
           comme à Stalingrad... Une fois ça suffit. J'aime autant
           garder mes distances.
                         
          Raoul se lève. Il s'emporte progressivement au fur et à mesure
          qu'il parle.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Dis donc, t'essaierais pas de nous faire porter le chapeau
           des fois ? Faut le dire tout de suite, hein ? Il faut
           dire : « Monsieur Raoul, vous avez buté Henri, vous avez
           buté les deux autres mecs. Vous avez peut être aussi buté
           le Mexicain, puis aussi l'archiduc d'Autriche »...
                         
          PÉNICHE - PONT - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Sur un ponton, bâti sur la rive à côté de la péniche, on
          distingue, dans un halo de lumière au milieu de la pénombre
          ambiante, Pascal et à côté de lui Folace, une sacoche à la main.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Hé ! Léo, c'est moi, Pascal.
                         
          Il agite le bras. On entend une voix qui répond.
                         
           LEO (voix off)
           J'arrive... Qui est avec toi ?
                         
          Léo, habillé en marinier, marche sur le toit de la péniche, venant
          de la cabine de conduite.
                         
           PASCAL (voix off)
           Je suis avec le notaire.
                         
          Fernand grimpe sur une échelle qui part de la rive, en contrebas
          du ponton, pour atteindre le pont de la péniche.
          Léo, qui vient d'apercevoir Fernand, ramasse une grosse clé
          anglaise par terre.
                         
                          LEO
           Tu me dis que vous êtes deux, vous êtes trois...
                         
                          PASCAL
           J'annonce les employés, pas le patron...
                         
                          LEO
           Possible, mais j'attends un ordre de Monsieur Raoul.
                         
          Léo regarde, avec un visage peu aimable, Fernand s'avancer vers
          lui. Fernand, sans prévenir, lui balance un violent coup de poing
          dans le menton.
                         
          Léo recule sous le coup et bascule dans l'eau
                         
          Fernand se lèche un peu la main qui vient de frapper Léo. Derrière
          lui, Folace et Pascal grimpe à leur tour sur le pont par
          l'échelle. Folace, portant imperméable noir et chapeau de feutre,
          regarde Léo, que l'on entend barboter et gémir dans l'eau.
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           C'est curieux chez les marins ce besoin de faire des
           phrases...
                         
          Pascal leur fait signe de le suivre vers l'entrée de la péniche.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Allons !
                         
          Fernand pousse Folace devant lui.
                         
          PÉNICHE - SALLE DE JEU - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Les personnes présentes n'ont pas changé de position. La salle est
          juste un peu plus enfumée. Raoul est debout en train de
          « haranguer ses troupes ».
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Si vous marchez tous avec moi, qu'est-ce qu'il fera votre
           Fernand ?... Un procès ?
                         
          On frappe à la porte. Bastien se lève pour aller ouvrir la porte.
          Mais, d'un geste, Raoul l'arrête, et fait signe à Freddy d'aller
          ouvrir. Freddy se lève et se dirige vers la porte. Il débloque le
          verrou et ouvre la porte.
                         
          Fernand lui assène un violent coup de poing dans le menton. Freddy
          part à reculons et s'écroule contre le mur.
                         
          Fernand entre, immédiatement suivi de Pascal, qui a un pistolet
          dans chaque main.
                         
          Bastien, qui était resté debout, glisse la main sous sa veste pour
          prendre son arme.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Laisse.
          Folace entre le dernier, et enlève son chapeau. Il salue
          courtoisement les personnes présentes.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Bonsoir messieurs ! Madame !
                         
          Fernand s'avance dans la pièce.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Je croyais pas t'avoir invité...
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Mais t'avais pas à le faire, je suis chez moi.
                         
          Il marche lentement vers Raoul.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qu'est ce que t'organises ? Un concile ?
                         
          Bastien cherche à s'interposer. Fernand le repousse.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu permets ?
                         
          Bastien glisse la main sous sa veste, mais, d'un signe, Raoul lui
          enjoint de rester calme.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Je les avais réunis pour décider ce qu'on faisait pour le
           Mexicain, rapport aux obsèques.
                         
          Fernand enlève son manteau et le donne à Bastien, qui le laisse
          tomber par terre.
                         
          Lentement, Fernand contourne la table de jeu.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Si c'est des obsèques du Mexicain dont tu veux parler,
           c'est moi que ça regarde, maintenant si c'est celle
           d'Henri...
                         
          Il est arrivé derrière la chaise de Raoul, dont il tient le
          dossier à deux mains.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           ... tu pourrais peut-être les prendre à ta charge.
                         
          Fernand s'assoit sur la chaise de Raoul.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Non, ça va pas recommencer, je vais pas encore endosser le
           massacre.
                         
          D'un claquement de doigt, Fernand donne l'ordre à Tomate de se
          lever. Ce dernier, la pipe au bec, s'exécute.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           On parlera de ça un peu plus tard.
          Folace s'installe sur la chaise de Tomate, ouvre sa sacoche, et en
          sort des dossiers.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Pour l'instant on a d'autres petits problèmes à régler,
           figure-toi. Priorités aux affaires. Je commence par le
           commencement.
                         
          Il prend l'un des dossiers que Folace vient de déposer sur la
          table.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Honneur aux dames. Madame Mado je présume ?
                         
                          MME MADO
           Elle-même.
                         
          Fernand feuillète le dossier de Mado.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Chère madame, Maître Folace m'a fait part de quelques...
           Pffff... quelques embarras dans votre gestion, momentanés
           j'espère. Souhaiteriez-vous nous fournir quelques
           explications ?
                         
          Il sort un paquet de cigarettes de sa poche. Mado répond en fumant
          une cigarette plantée dans un long fume-cigarette.
                         
                          MME MADO
           Les explications, Monsieur Fernand, y en a deux :
           récession et manque de main d'oeuvre. Ce n'est pas que la
           clientèle boude, c'est qu'elle a l'esprit ailleurs. Le
           furtif, par exemple, a complètement disparu.
                         
          Freddy se relève lentement et rejoint son siège à côté de Mado. Il
          se masse le menton et a l'air un peu sonné.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Le furtif ?
                         
                          MME MADO
           Le client qui vient en voisin... Bonjour mesdemoiselles, au
           revoir madame. Au lieu de descendre maintenant après dîner,
           il reste devant sa télé, pour voir si par hasard il ne
           serait pas un peu l'homme du vingtième siècle.
                         
          (NOTE : « L'homme du Vingtième Siècle » était un jeu télévisé,
          très célèbre à l'époque du film, puisque diffusé sur la seule et
          unique chaîne de télévision qui existait alors. Il avait débuté en
          1961 et s'est terminé en 1964.)
                         
          Fernand allume une cigarette, et l'écoute patiemment.
                         
                          MME MADO
           Et l'affectueux du dimanche... disparu aussi. Pourquoi ?
           Pouvez-vous me le dire ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Encore la télé ?
                          MME MADO
           L'auto, Monsieur Fernand ! L'auto !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah !...
                         
          Folace taille tranquillement son crayon.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Mais dites moi, vous parliez de pénurie de main d'oeuvre
           tout à l'heure...
                         
                          MME MADO
           Alors là, Monsieur Fernand, c'est un désastre ! Une bonne
           pensionnaire, ça devient plus rare qu'une femme de ménage.
           Ces dames s'exportent, le mirage africain nous fait un tort
           terrible. Et si ça continue, elles iront à Tombouctou à la
           nage.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bien, je vous remercie, Madame Mado, on recausera de tout
           ça...
          A côté de Mado, Freddy a l'air prêt à s'endormir sur sa chaise.
          Mado se lève et s'éloigne.
                         
          Fernand referme le dossier de Mado. Il prend un autre dossier, et
          regarde Folace.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qui est-ce, le mec du jus de pomme ?
                         
          Folace, de la pointe de son crayon, lui indique Théo.
                         
          Freddy est maintenant écroulé sur la table.
                         
                          THÉO
           Ce doit être de moi dont vous voulez parler !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Dis moi, dans ta branche, ça va pas très fort non plus,
           hein ! Pourtant du pastis vrai ou faux, on en boit encore ?
                         
          Théo ricane et prend un autre cigare dans la boîte posée à côté de
          lui.
                         
                          THÉO
           Moins qu'avant... La jeunesse française boit des eaux
           pétillantes, et les anciens combattants, des eaux de
           régime.
                         
          Fernand regarde Folace, qui sourit.
                         
                          THÉO
           Puis surtout il y a le whisky.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et alors ?
                         
                          THÉO
           C'est le drame ça, le whisky...
                         
          PÉNICHE - ANTICHAMBRE DE LA SALLE DE JEU - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Pascal et Bastien se sont installés, assis côte à côte, dans
          l'antichambre de la salle de jeu. Pascal a toujours un pistolet à
          la main, et surveille ce qu'il se passe dans la salle, par la
          porte ouverte. Bastien regarde le pistolet de Pascal et émet un
          petit sifflement.
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Dis donc, je le connais pas, celui-là. Il est nouveau ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           C'est le petit dernier de chez Beretta. Je te le conseille
           pour le combat de près, et puis pour les coups à travers la
           poche, ou le métro ou l'autobus.
                         
           THÉO (voix off)
           Le whisky...
                         
                          PASCAL
           Mais note, hein ? Faut en avoir l'usage, sans ça, au prix
           actuel, on l'amortit pas.
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Le prix s'oublie, la qualité reste, c'est pas l'arme de
           tout le monde, ça ! T'as eu ça par qui ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Par l'oncle Antonio.
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Le frère de Berthe ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Oui.
                         
          Bastien semble songeur. Pascal se penche pour suivre ce qui se
          passe dans la salle de jeu.
                         
          PÉNICHE - SALLE DE JEU - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
                          THÉO
           Tout ça pour vous faire comprendre, Monsieur Fernand, que
           le pastis perd de l'adhérent chaque jour. Le client devient
           dur à suivre.
                         
          Mado apporte une théière et une tasse sur la table. Freddy dort
          toujours sur le tapis de jeu.
                         
          Fernand a l'air un peu fatigué par la longue tirade de Théo sur le
          whisky. Il repose lourdement sa tête sur sa main.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oh tu sais, c'est un petit peu dans tous les domaines
           pareil, moi si je te parlais motoculture...
                         
          Il s'arrête net, et referme le dossier de Théo.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ouais enfin !
                         
          Mado donne une tasse de thé à Fernand.
                         
                          MME MADO
           J'espère qu'il est encore chaud.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Merci.
                         
          Fernand écrase sa cigarette pour boire son thé.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bien... et maintenant à nous...
                         
          Il regarde Raoul, qui se tient debout derrière Folace, la
          cigarette au bec. A côté de lui, Tomate a pris la place laissé
          vacante par Bastien. Paul s'est assis à côté de Tomate.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Dans votre secteur, pas de problème, le jeu a jamais aussi
           bien marché.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Que tu dis !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ce qui vous chagrine, c'est la comptabilité. Vous êtes des
           hommes d'action, je vous ai compris, et je vous ai arrangé
           votre coup.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           T'arranges, t'arranges, et si on était pas d'accord ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu vas voir que c'est pas possible, j'ai adopté le système
           le plus simple.
                         
          Il prend le document que lui tend Folace.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tiens, regarde ! On prend les chiffres de l'année dernière,
           et on les reporte.
                         
          Paul tend la main vers la roulette pour jouer avec. Raoul lui
          donne une claque sur le bras.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Arrête, toi !
                         
          Tomate, toujours sa pipe au bec, regarde Fernand.
                         
                          TOMATE
           L'année dernière, on a battu des records !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et bien, ben vous les égalerez cette année ! Vous avez
           l'air en pleine forme, là ? Gais, entreprenants,
           dynamiques...
          Il boit son thé.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Et en plus, il nous charrie, c'est complet.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Pascal !
                         
          Pascal entre dans la salle.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Oui, Monsieur Fernand.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu passeras à l'encaissement chez ces messieurs sous
           huitaine.
                         
          Raoul se tourne vers Pascal.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           C'est ça, puis si on paye pas, tu nous butes ?
          Pascal hausse les épaules.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Hé, monsieur Raoul...
                         
          Fernand repose sa tasse.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bien, messieurs, il ne me reste plus qu'à vous remercier de
           votre attention...
                         
          Il remet les documents dans les dossiers, qu'il donne à Folace. Il
          regarde tout le monde et se lève.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Madame...
                         
          Il s'incline légèrement devant Mado. Folace range les dossiers
          dans sa sacoche. Fernand récupère son manteau et passe devant
          Raoul, suivi de Folace, qui remet son chapeau en place sur sa
          tête. Tomate fait tranquillement une réussite.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Bastien ! Accompagne ces messieurs !
                         
          Pascal, suivi de Fernand et de Folace quittent la pièce. Bastien
          sort derrière eux, et referme la porte derrière lui.
                         
          Mado, tout en fumant son long fume-cigarette, regarde Raoul d'un
          air narquois.
                         
                          MME MADO
           Toi, Raoul Volfoni, on peut dire que tu en es un ?
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Un quoi ?
                          MME MADO
           Un vrai chef.
                         
          Raoul ne semble pas apprécier l'insulte sous-jacente dans les
          propos de Mado. Il la foudroie du regard.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Mais y connaît pas Raoul, ce mec ? Y va avoir un réveil
           pénible. J'ai voulu être diplomate à cause de vous tous,
           éviter que le sang coule, mais maintenant c'est fini. Je
           vais le travailler en férocité, le faire marcher à coup de
           lattes ! A ma pogne, je veux le voir ! Et je vous promets
           qu'il demandera pardon et au garde à vous...
                         
          On frappe à la porte. Raoul se précipite, à grandes enjambées vers
          la porte, qu'il ouvre d'un geste vif. Il prend le poing de Fernand
          en pleine figure, et va s'écrouler sur le mur d'en face.
                         
          Fernand, dans l'encadrement de la porte, se masse légèrement la
          main. Pascal, derrière lui, porte son manteau.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           J'avais oublié : les dix pour cent d'amende... pour le
           retard.
                         
          Il jette un regard froid dans la pièce, puis se dirige rapidement
          vers Pascal, qui lui donne son manteau. Ils s'éloignent tous les
          deux.
                         
          Raoul est assis par terre, appuyé sur le mur.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Il a osé me frapper. Il se rend pas compte.
                         
          Théo tourne vaguement la tête vers lui, et se remet tranquillement
          à téter son cigare, pendant que Raoul se masse le menton.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - VESTIBULE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Jean ouvre la porte d'entrée. Fernand entre, suivi de Folace. On
          entend de la musique classique en fond sonore. Folace ôte son
          chapeau et aborde Jean en souriant.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Cette petite fête m'a rajeuni de vingt ans. Monsieur Naudin
           a quelque peu bousculé Monsieur Volfoni senior.
                         
          Jean a pris la sacoche de Folace, puis il prend les manteaux des
          deux hommes.
                         
                          JEAN
           Mes compliments, monsieur.
                         
          Fernand tend le doigt vers l'endroit d'où provient la musique.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qu'est ce que c'est encore que ça ?
                         
          Jean sourit et écarte les bras en signe d'impuissance.
                          JEAN
           Ohhh !...
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - PETIT SALON - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Fernand entre dans la pièce, qui baigne dans une semi-pénombre. La
          musique devient plus présente. En constatant ce qu'il se passe
          dans la pièce, Fernand se met les mains sur les hanches.
                         
          On voit le dos du canapé, qui a été tiré devant la cheminée, où
          flambe un feu de bois. Au moment où Fernand allume la lumière,
          Patricia et Antoine se relèvent du canapé, sur lequel ils étaient
          allongés. Antoine semble agacé par l'intrusion de Fernand.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Oh non, au moment où la petite flûte allait répondre au
           cor, vous êtes odieux !
                         
                          PATRICIA
           C'est vrai, Tonton, ces choses-là ne se font pas.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah, Patricia, je t'en prie, hein ?
                         
          A côté de la cheminée, un électrophone est posée sur une table de
          marbre. Un disque est en train de tourner dessus.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Qu'est ce qui vous arrive, mon oncle ? Vous avez été
           contrarié dans vos affaires ?
                         
          Fernand se dirige vers l'électrophone, et relève le bras du
          tourne-disque.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oh, à peine.
                         
          Fernand se tourne vers Antoine, les mains croisées derrière le
          dos. On sent sa colère contenue. Il regarde furtivement les pieds
          du jeune homme.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Si ça ne vous fait rien, Monsieur Delafoy, j'aimerais bien
           avoir une petite explication. Mais remettez d'abord vos
           chaussures, vous êtes ridicule.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Qu'est ce que vous voulez que je vous explique, cher
           monsieur ?
                         
          Patricia allume une cigarette sur l'une des bougies allumées.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tout ça, lumière tamisée, musique douce, et vos godasses
           sur les fauteuils, Louis XVI en plus !
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           La confusion peut encore s'expliquer, mais les termes sont
           inadéquats.
          Antoine va récupérer ses chaussures posées sur un petit
          fauteuil... de style Louis XV !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah, parce que c'est peut être pas du Louis XVI ?
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Euh non ! C'est du Louis XV. Remarquez, vous n'êtes pas
           tombé loin, mais surtout les sonates de Corelli ne sont pas
           de la musique douce.
                         
          Il s'assoit sur le fauteuil pour remettre ses chaussures.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oui, ben pour moi, c'en est. Et je suis chez moi !
                         
          Il a haussé le ton sur la dernière phrase.
                         
          Antoine pointe le doigt vers lui.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Ah, j'aime ça, la thèse est osée, mais comme toutes les
           thèses, parfaitement défendable.
                         
          Il se lève de son fauteuil, et s'avance vers Fernand, semblant
          tout à fait à son aise, malgré la situation.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Nous allons donc, si vous le voulez bien, discuter de la
           musique par rapport au local, de l'élixir et du flacon, du
           contenu et du contenant.
                         
          Il termine sa phrase en bafouillant un peu, car Fernand vient de
          lui jeter un regard on ne peut moins aimable. Fernand se masse le
          visage, pour tacher de rester calme, et se dirige vers Patricia.
          Il plaque ses deux mains sur la cheminée.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Patricia, mon petit... je ne voudrais pas te paraître vieux
           jeu, ni encore moins grossier. L'homme de la pampa, parfois
           rude, reste toujours courtois, mais la vérité m'oblige à te
           le dire : ton Antoine commence à me les briser menu !
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Si nous parlions de moi pendant que vous dînerez ?
                         
          Fernand ne le regarde même pas et s'adresse à Patricia.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bon, toi, tu vas monter dans ta chambre !
                         
          Il lui arrache sa cigarette des mains et la pousse vers la porte.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Bonne nuit, Antoine.
                         
          Fernand éjecte Patricia dans le vestibule, dont la porte est
          restée ouverte. Patricia ne demande pas son reste et s'éloigne en
          courant. Fernand revient vers Antoine d'un pas décidé.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et quant à vous, brillant jeune homme...
                         
          Il l'attrape par le bras et le pousse vers la sortie. Antoine a
          juste le temps de ramasser son veston sur un fauteuil.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Ne vous donnez pas la peine, je connais le chemin...
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Justement, faudrait voir à l'oublier, hein !
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - VESTIBULE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Ce n'est pas du tout gentil, Oncle Fernand.
                         
          Il est maintenant devant la porte d'entrée, que Fernand ouvre pour
          lui.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Monsieur Fernand, s'il vous plaît. Aller hop !
          Fernand le pousse dehors, mais Antoine résiste.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Soit, les manières y gagneront ce que l'affection y perdra.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et bien, c'est ça. Pensez donc à moi.
                         
          Il claque la porte, se retourne et s'arrête net, levant les yeux
          vers l'escalier.
                         
          Patricia a observé la scène, debout sur la quatrième ou cinquième
          marche de l'escalier.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Vous m'avez terriblement déçue, vous n'avez pas été gentil
           avec Antoine.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oui, et bien, j'ai fait ce qu'aurait fait ton père, figure-
           toi. Il a jamais pu supporter les voyous, là.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Antoine, un voyou ? Antoine est un grand compositeur, il a
           du génie.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et bien, les génies se baladent pas pieds nus, figure-toi !
           Hein ?
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Et Sagan ?
                         
          Fernand ne sait visiblement quoi répondre à cette dernière
          réplique. Peut-être d'ailleurs qu'il ne sait pas qui est Françoise
          Sagan.
          Patricia le regarde en ricanant, et se remet en marche dans
          l'escalier, après lui avoir tiré la langue.
                         
          Fondu enchaîné.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - SALLE A MANGER - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Un peu plus tard.
                         
          Fernand, en chemise, et la cravate un peu dénouée, est en train de
          manger une cuisse de poulet, qu'il tient dans sa main. En fond
          sonore, et assez fort, on entend la musique qu'écoutaient Antoine
          et Patricia. La pochette du disque est appuyé sur la corbeille qui
          contient la bouteille de vin. Sur cette pochette, on peut lire
          « Corelli ». Fernand lève des yeux légèrement inquiet vers la
          porte-fenêtre.
                         
          Derrière le rideau, on peut apercevoir deux silhouettes qui
          bougent.
                         
          Fernand plisse les yeux, en essayant de comprendre ce qui se
          passe.
          La porte-fenêtre s'ouvre, et Pascal entre dans la pièce.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Bonsoir !
                         
          Il est suivi par Bastien, qui fait un sourire et un petit signe de
          tête à Fernand. Puis il referme la fenêtre, et tire le rideau.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qu'est-ce qui vous prend ? Vous êtes louf, non ? Qu'est-ce
           que c'est que ces façons d'arriver en pleine nuit par le
           jardin ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           On ne voulait pas sonner à cette heure-là, réveiller toute
           la maison. Si la demoiselle se posait des questions. A cet
           âge-là, on imagine.
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Et puis, on avait à vous parler.
                         
          Fernand dévisage Bastien.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Vous, je vous ai déjà vu quelque part...
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Tout à l'heure, chez les Volfoni. J'étais de l'autre côté.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bon, ben asseyez-vous, je suis en train de becter.
                         
          Il glisse la pochette du disque entre son dos et le dossier de la
          chaise.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Alors là, on est vraiment confus !
          Les deux hommes prennent chacun une chaise et les installent
          autour de la table devant Fernand. Bastien s'assoit, mais Pascal
          reste debout.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Voilà, si on est venu à deux, y a une raison ! Bastien,
           c'est le fils de la soeur de mon père, comme qui dirait un
           cousin direct... Vous saisissez la complication, Monsieur
           Fernand.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Non, pas encore !
                         
          Pascal s'assoit.
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Ah, forcément, t'as pas donné à Monsieur Fernand mes
                          RÉFÉRENCES
                         
          Il se lève et prend un air solennel.
                          BASTIEN
           Première gâchette chez Volfoni, cinq ans de labeur, de nuit
           comme de jour, et sans un accroc.
                         
          Pascal, de la main, rassoit Bastien sur sa chaise.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Vous la voyez ce coup-là, l'embrouille ? Dans le monde des
           caves, on appelle ça un cas de conscience, nous on dit : un
           point d'honneur. Entre vous et les Volfoni, il va faire
           vilain temps. En supposant que ça tourne à l'orage, Bastien
           et moi, on est sûr de se retrouver face à face, flingue en
           pogne, avec l'honnêteté qui commande de tirer. Ah non, un
           truc à décimer une famille.
                         
          Ils hochent la tête tous les deux.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ouais, je vois...
                         
          Il prend une bouteille de champagne dans un seau.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Vous voulez boire un coup ?
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Non, non, merci, jamais entre les repas.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Moi non plus, chez nous c'est la règle : santé, sobriété.
                         
                          BASTIEN
           On en a trop vu qui se sont gâté la main aux alcools.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Je peux rien vous reprocher, les histoires de famille, ça,
           c'est comme une croyance, ça force le respect. Bon, alors,
           qu'est ce que vous proposez ?
                          PASCAL
           Bastien a donné sa démission à Monsieur Raoul.
                         
          Fernand boit le verre de champagne qu'il vient de se servir.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           La tienne va suivre ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Je peux pas faire moins, Monsieur Fernand, faut comprendre.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Je comprends.
                         
          Fernand reste pensif, et on suit sa pensée en voix off.
                         
           MONSIEUR FERNAND (voix off)
           Ouais, quand la protection de l'enfance coïncide avec la
           crise du personnel, faut plus comprendre, faut prier !
                         
          Fondu au noir.
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - PETIT SALON - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Fernand, en costume gris, est en train de lire une dissertation
          rédigée par Patricia, assis dans un confortable fauteuil.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           « Et si la vieille définition n'avait pas tant servie à
           propos de Racine et de Corneille, nous dirions que Bossuet
           a peint Dieu tel qu'il devrait être et que Pascal l'a peint
           tel qu'il est »... Et ben, dis donc.
                         
          Il retourne la copie, et regarde la note.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Comment ? Ils t'ont donné que seize sur vingt ?
                         
          Il se lève.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ben, permet moi de te dire qu'ils y vont un peu fort, hein,
           parce que moi, là, je t'aurais donné plus.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Vous êtes très gentil, mon oncle...
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Non, Patricia, mon enfant, mercredi dernier, quand je suis
           arrivé, nous dérivions et le navire faisait eau de toute
           part...
                         
          En parlant, Fernand s'est approché d'une glace accroché au mur, et
          dans laquelle on voit Jean entrer dans la pièce.
                         
                          JEAN
           Un Monsieur, au téléphone, un appel de Montauban.
           L'interlocuteur me semble... comment dirais-je ?... un peu
           rustique, le genre agricole.
          Fernand sort de la pièce.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - UN AUTRE SALON - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Fernand prend le combiné téléphonique et le porte à son oreille.
          Un grand panneau vitré, inséré dans le mur, sépare le petit salon
          du salon où se trouve le téléphone, ce qui permet de voir
          Patricia, qui écoute avec attention ce que dit son « oncle
          Fernand ».
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Allo oui ?... Oui, c'est moi... Ça va, ça va... Alors ?...
           Hein ?... Oui... Oui... Oui, ben, si je suis pas rentré
           vendredi, c'est que j'ai pas pu... Et ben, je ne sais pas,
           moi... huit jours, peut être quinze...
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - PETIT SALON - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Patricia suit toujours la conversation téléphonique de Fernand,
          pendant que Jean lit la dissertation de la jeune fille.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et ben, y a qu'à faire le nécessaire... Enfin, c'est quand
           même formidable, qu'on dirait qu'à chaque fois que je
           m'absente, c'est toujours pareil, faut toujours qu'y ait
           des histoires... et ben, démerdez vous...
                         
          Il raccroche d'un geste rageur, et s'éloigne du téléphone.
                         
                          JEAN
           « Et Pascal l'a peint tel qu'il est »... Eh ben, moi,
           j'aurais donné à mademoiselle vingt sur vingt, et en cotant
           vache.
                         
          Patricia lui fait un beau sourire.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Vous êtes gentil.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - SALON - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Folace et Fernand discutent. Folace semble un peu énervé.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Vous savez combien il reste au compte courant ? Soixante
           milles, six briques...
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ben qu'est ce que ça veut dire ? Y aurait du coulage ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Du coulage, oh, c'est bien plus simple... Y a que l'argent
           qui devait rentrer sous huitaine, n'est toujours pas
           rentré.
                         
          Le téléphone sonne. Folace fait le tour de la vitrine
          napoléonienne pour aller répondre.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Y a que l'éducation de la princesse, cheval, musique,
           peinture, etc... atteint un budget « Élyséen ». Et y a que
           vos dépenses somptuaires ont presque des allures
           africaines.
                         
          Il décroche le téléphone.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Allô oui ?... Oui... oui... Il est là. Une seconde.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qui est-ce ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Justement... Raoul Volfoni.
                         
          Il tend le combiné à Fernand.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah, tout de même !...
                         
          Fernand sourit en mettant le combiné à son oreille. Folace
          l'écoute en prenant une cigarette dans un paquet dans sa poche.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Allô ?... alors on a enfin compris... on casque !
                         
          PÉNICHE - BUREAU - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Raoul, assis sur le bureau, en costume rayé, est en train de
          parler au téléphone.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Oh ben, tu fais de l'obsession, t'es la proie des idées
           fixes. Je te téléphonais seulement pour t'avertir qu'à la
           distillerie, y sont en plein baccara, tu devrais t'en
           occuper, c'est ton rôle, grand chef.
                         
          Paul, assis derrière le bureau, écoute la conversation grâce à
          l'écouteur de courtoisie du téléphone.
                         
           MONSIEUR FERNAND (voix off au téléphone)
           Mais de quoi tu t'occupes ?
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Tu vois comme t'es injuste, on cherche à t'obliger, t'es
           encore pas satisfait.
                         
          DISTILLERIE - PREMIER ÉTAGE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Tomate, Théo, son ami et Freddy sont installés dans une sorte de
          salon aménagé au premier étage de la distillerie, avec des meubles
          anciens un peu disparates et mal assortis. Tomate, Théo et Freddy
          sont assis dans des fauteuils, et l'ami de Théo sur les marches de
          l'escalier. Freddy est en train de lire un roman.
                         
                          TOMATE
           Tu crois que Raoul sera tombé dans le piège ?
                         
                          THÉO
           Il n'aura pas résisté à la joie d'annoncer une mauvaise
           nouvelle à l'autre imbécile.
                         
                          TOMATE
           C'est étonnant que le butor n'ait pas déjà téléphoné.
                         
                          THÉO
           Y a des impulsifs qui téléphonent, y en a d'autres qui se
           déplacent...
                         
          Bruit de klaxon insistant. L'ami de Théo sursaute. Théo, lui,
          reste calme.
                         
                          THÉO
           ... et voilà !
                         
          Il se lève.
                         
                          TOMATE
           Et c'est Volfoni qui portera le chapeau.
                         
                          THÉO
           T'es rassuré ?
                         
                          TOMATE
           Ouais.
                         
                          THÉO
           En voilà un qui est pratiquement sorti du bagne.
                         
          Il récupère un pistolet, l'arme, puis le glisse dans la poche
          intérieure de sa veste.
                         
                          THÉO
           Maintenant, ce n'est plus qu'une affaire de patience. Dans
           un mois, les Volfoni...
                         
          Il fait, avec son pouce, le geste que les empereurs romains
          faisaient pour signifier la mise à mort d'un gladiateur.
                         
                          THÉO
           ... et les affaires du Mexicain, ça deviendra Théo, Tomate
           et Cie.
                         
          Il claque des doigts. Son ami s'approche. Théo ramasse un cendrier
          sur une table.
                         
                          THÉO
           Planque ça, des mégots à la pommade rose, l'homme de Cro-
           Magnon pourrait trouver ça bizarre.
                         
          Nouvel appel de klaxon, encore plus insistant que le premier. Théo
          allume sa cigarette sur une bougie.
                         
                          THÉO
           Voilà, voilà, on arrive.
                         
          Il regarde Tomate.
                         
                          THÉO
           Allez, dans cinq minutes... vous filez.
                         
          Théo sort du « salon ». Le reste du premier étage est totalement
          désert, bien que ce soit un local très vaste, sans aucune cloison.
          Théo le traverse d'un pas rapide.
                         
          Nouvel appel de klaxon.
                         
          Théo descend un petit escalier qui mène au rez-de-chaussée.
                         
          DISTILLERIE - REZ DE CHAUSSÉE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Fernand, en costume gris, venant de l'extérieur, entre dans une
          sorte de hangar dans lequel sont empilés, dans un savant désordre,
          des centaines de bouteilles vides.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Alors ça vient, oui ?
                         
          Une voix vient du haut de l'escalier. Fernand lève la tête.
                         
           THÉO (voix off)
           Voilà, j'arrive...
                         
          Il arrive en bas de l'escalier et regarde Fernand avec surprise.
                         
                          THÉO
           Vous, Monsieur Fernand ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ben quoi ? Ça a l'air de t'épater ?
                         
                          THÉO
           Raoul Volfoni est ridicule ! Je lui avais demandé de
           m'envoyer un chauffeur, pas de vous déranger.
                         
          Fernand regarde, avec intérêt, le bric-à-brac qui l'entoure.

          Théo et Tomate sont assis au bord de la route. Théo se réchauffe
          en buvant du café à partir d'un thermos. A côté de Tomate, une
          mitrailleuse est posée sur son socle de support. Tomate allume son
          briquet pour consulter sa montre.
                         
                          TOMATE

          Plus loin, le camion roule toujours sur la route. Il passe, sans
          que Fernand ne s'en rende compte, devant une moto, planquée au
          bord de la route, tous feux éteints, avec l'ami de Théo assis
          dessus. Juste après le passage du camion, la moto allume son
          phare, et l'ami de Théo s'élance à la poursuite du camion.
                         
          La moto roule derrière le camion. Le conducteur ne porte pas de
          casque. Il rattrape le camion, puis le double.
                         
          La moto est maintenant devant le camion. Elle arrive en vue d'un
          bosquet d'arbres dans lequel Freddy est planqué. L'ami de Théo
          fait des appels de phare.
                         
          Freddy allume une puissante lampe torche, et fait, lui aussi, des
          appels de lumière.
                         
          Tomate, dans sa planque, reçoit les appels lumineux.

          Freddy attend que la moto soit passée, puis il jette des clous à
          quatre pointes sur la route.

          Le camion fonce dans un panneau publicitaire vantant l'apéritif
          « Martini » !

          publicitaire, qu'il a défoncé.
                         
          Dans leur planque, Théo actionne la mitrailleuse, pendant que
          Tomate guide le ruban de balles dans l'arme.

          Le pare-brise et toutes les vitres du camion éclatent, mais
          restent en place, s'étoilant en petites particules, selon le
          principe du verre Sécurit.

          Théo se remet à tirer.
                         
          Sous le tir de la mitrailleuse, le chargement du camion finit par
          s'enflammer.

          Théo est atteint d'une telle frénésie que Tomate a du mal à le
          détacher de la mitrailleuse. Ils regardent tous deux dans la
          direction du camion.
                         
          Le camion est totalement en flammes.

          coussin de l'un des sièges du camion et le projette dans le pare-
          brise. Le verre éclaté de ce dernier se détache vers l'extérieur
          du camion, ouvrant ainsi une sortie possible pour Fernand, qui se
          dégage de la cabine du camion.

          Il ouvre la porte, et prend le poing de Fernand dans la figure. Il
          recule en titubant jusqu'au mur, devant lequel il s'écroule.
                         
          Paul se penche légèrement pour regarder son frère.
                         
          Fernand entre dans la pièce, le cheveu en bataille, et le coude du
          costume toujours déchiré. On comprend qu'il est venu directement
          du lieu de l'accident à la péniche. Il claque la porte et tourne
          le verrou. Quand il se retourne, on constate que sa veste est
          déchirée aussi dans le dos, et même brûlée.
                         
          Paul relève la tête et sourit à Fernand.

          Fernand ignore Raoul toujours assis par terre contre le mur et se
          dirige vers le bureau. Il prend une grosse sacoche de cuir posée
          sur le bureau et la retourne, vidant tout ce qu'elle contenait sur
          les papiers de Paul, qui se recule légèrement et enlève ses
          lunettes. Puis il contourne le bureau vers le coffre-fort, qui est
          grand ouvert. Il s'accroupit et commence à remplir la sacoche de
          liasses de billets de banque.

                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Bien !
                         
          Il pose la sacoche sur le bureau pour la fermer.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tout m'irrite !
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Bon bon !
                         
          Il traverse la pièce en jetant un rapide regard à Raoul, qui se
          relève lentement. Il sort et claque la porte derrière lui. Raoul
          se touche le menton.
          On frappe à la porte. Raoul se dirige vers la porte. Il a déjà la
          main sur la poignée, lorsqu'il se tourne vers son frère, et lui
                         CHUCHOTE :
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           T'es toujours de cinquante pour cent dans l'affaire ?
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Ben... bien sûr !
                         
          Raoul fait deux pas dans la pièce et désigne la porte du pouce.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Alors va ouvrir !
                         
          Fondu au noir.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          De nombreuses voitures sont garées devant l'entrée du manoir. On
          entend de une musique assez puissante qui provient de l'intérieur
          de la maison, mais cette fois-ci, il ne s'agit plus de musique
          classique, mais de musique plus moderne, de musique de danse.
          Toutes les fenêtres du rez-de-chaussée sont illuminées.
                         
          La 404 de Fernand se gare à côté d'une petite voiture anglaise
          décapotable et décapotée. Fernand sort de sa voiture, et le
          propriétaire de la décapotable, un jeune homme élégamment habillé,
          fait le tour de la sienne. Il fixe la housse, qui protège la
          capote lorsqu'elle est rangée derrière le siège arrière, comme
          c'est le cas actuellement. Fernand fait quelques pas, et s'arrête,
          visiblement mécontent de la musique de danse qu'il entend dans le
          manoir. Le jeune homme le regarde, intrigué. Puis il fait quelques
          pas vers lui, en fumant sa cigarette d'un air distingué.
                         
           LE JEUNE HOMME
           Convocation : neuf heures !
          Fernand se retourne.
                         
           LE JEUNE HOMME
           J'ai l'impression, mon cher, que nous ne sommes pas en
           avance.
                         
          Fernand revient vers sa voiture, dont il ouvre le coffre.
                         
           LE JEUNE HOMME
           Vous êtes un ami de Pat ou un copain d'Antoine ?
                         
          Fernand prend la sacoche dans le coffre, qu'il referme. Il lance
          un rapide regard au jeune homme, et se dirige vers le manoir.
                         
           LE JEUNE HOMME
           Je me demande s'il la saute ?
                         
          Fernand se retourne vers le jeune homme.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Si qui saute qui ?
           LE JEUNE HOMME
           Ben... Antoine... Patricia...
                         
          Fernand soupire, pose la sacoche sur le coffre de sa voiture, puis
          flanque une raclée au jeune homme. On ne le voit pas actuellement
          frapper le jeune homme, mais on en entend les bruits
          caractéristiques. Fernand récupère sa sacoche et se dirige vers le
          manoir.
                         
          Le jeune homme est étalé dans sa voiture, une jambe sur le pare-
          brise, et l'autre jambe par-dessus la portière. Il est
          complètement sonné. Les essuie-glace balaient inutilement le pare-
          brise.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - VESTIBULE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Plan rapproché sur la porte d'entrée. La musique est encore plus
          puissante. On voit Fernand à travers les vitres de la porte. Il
          frappe très fort sur la porte. Un type, qui était adossé au mur
          près de la porte, tourne la tête vers lui, et ouvre la porte.
                         
          Fernand entre et regarde autour de lui, d'un air à la fois surpris
          et mécontent. Une fille se trémousse en rythme devant lui. Fernand
          referme la porte. D'autres invités, assis alentour, marque le
          rythme de la musique. D'autres danseurs apparaissent dans le
          champ.
                         
          Plan en plongée du haut de l'escalier. Le vestibule est plein de
          jeunes gens en train de danser. D'autres, debout dans l'escalier,
          marquent le rythme. Fernand, près de la porte, contemple cette
          scène sans bouger. Jean traverse le vestibule, un plateau à la
          main.
                         
          Retour sur un plan moyen de Fernand, qui semble de plus en plus
          mécontent. Il aperçoit Jean et l'appelle.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Jean ?
                         
                          JEAN
           Une seconde, monsieur.
                         
          Jean entre dans un salon, son plateau à la main.
                         
          Fernand traverse le vestibule.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - UN SALON - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Antoine et Patricia sont en train de se bécoter. Antoine relève la
          tête et aperçoit Fernand.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Le cercle de famille s'agrandit.
                         
          Patricia regarde dans la direction de Fernand, avec des yeux un
          peu effrayés. Elle pousse Antoine vers un coin plus discret.
                         
          Fernand traverse le salon vers l'endroit où Jean est en train de
          servir les invités. Il bute dans un jeune homme qui est dans son
          chemin.
                         
           UNE JEUNE FILLE LÉGÈREMENT ÉMÉCHÉE
           Encore un peu, Jean, s'il te plaît.
                         
                          JEAN
           Tu picoles trop toi, tu vas être ronde.
                         
           UNE JEUNE FILLE LÉGÈREMENT ÉMÉCHÉE
           Vas donc m'en chercher une autre bouteille, s'il te plaît.
                         
                          JEAN
           Mais oui.
                         
          La jeune fille s'éloigne. Fernand se rapproche de Jean. Un jeune
          homme, qui vient, lui aussi d'être servi, s'éloigne de Jean, qui
          sourit béatement.
                         
           LE JEUNE HOMME
           Tchiao.
                         
          En voyant Fernand, le sourire de Jean s'efface.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Jean ? Où est Patricia ?
                         
          Jean fait un petit signe d'impuissance.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et maître Folace ?
                         
                          JEAN
           À la cuisine... il aide, lui.
                         
          Jean a dit les derniers mots sur un ton de léger reproche. Fernand
          le regarde de façon peu aimable, puis traverse le salon, en
          essayant d'éviter les danseurs, et en cherchant visiblement
          Patricia.
          Dans un coin discret, Antoine et Patricia observent la scène. Ils
          se parlent en chuchotant.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Continuer de me cacher, c'est très désagréable.
                         
          Ils regardent tous les deux dans la direction de Fernand.
                         
          Fernand continue à zigzaguer entre les invités, tenant toujours sa
          sacoche à la main.
                         
           PATRICIA (voix off)
           Oncle Fernand ?
                         
          Fernand se retourne. Patricia vient vers lui. Fernand semble un
          peu en colère.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah te voilà, toi ! Et c'est ça que t'appelles une petite
           dînette au coin du feu, hein, dis ? Alors tu vas
           m'expliquer un petit peu maintenant, hein ?
          Elle l'entraîne dans un coin plus calme que la piste de danse.
          Elle regarde la manche déchirée de son veston.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           D'où viens-tu ?
                         
          Fernand regarde dans la direction d'un groupe, que l'on ne voit
          pas, mais qui, à l'expression affichée sur le visage de Fernand,
          sont visiblement dans une position assez intime. D'une main
          autoritaire, Patricia leur fait signe de dégager. Deux filles et
          un garçon sortent de la pièce.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           De... de chez des amis.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Ah ! Des anciens paras ? Vous avez évoqué le bon vieux
           temps, cooptation, close combat, vous avez joué au lance-
           flamme...
                         
          Fernand pose brutalement sa sacoche sur la table, prend une
          bouteille de whisky et se sert un verre.
                         
          Un invité lui tend une petite bouteille d'eau gazeuse.
                         
                          L'INVITÉ
           Sec ou à l'eau ?
                         
          On sent que Fernand est sur le point de perdre encore son sang-
          froid. Il arrache la bouteille des mains de l'invité. Patricia
          fait à l'invité un signe discret de dégager. Celui-ci sort
          calmement, en regardant Fernand d'un oeil peu aimable.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Chez soi, ça fait plaisir, hein ?
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Oh ! Je t'ai demandé la permission d'inviter des amis,
           t'étais d'accord. Tu sais qu'ils sont tous d'excellentes
           familles ? Celui qui vient de t'offrir du scotch, tu sais
           qui c'est ? Jacques Le Tellier, le fils du contre-amiral.
                         
          Fernand boit son verre à grandes gorgées.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Écoute, tu tiens toujours à ce que je passe mon bacho,
           alors soit logique !
                         
          Fernand récupère sa sacoche, et va pour s'éloigner, mais Patricia
          l'arrête.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Oui, le bacho sans relations, c'est la charrue sans les
           boeufs, le tenon sans la mortaise, une nièce sans son petit
           oncle ! En fait, c'est rien. Avoue que tu n'avais jamais
           pensé à ça, hein ?
                         
          Fernand a écouté tout le petit discours de Patricia, débité sur un
          ton un peu enjôleur, avec une impatience qu'il a du mal à
          contenir.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           C'est fini, oui ?
                         
          Fernand va pour sortir, Patricia le retient de nouveau.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Entre nous, à quoi penses-tu en général ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           À Montauban... on ne devrait jamais quitter Montauban !
                         
          Il dégage la main de Patricia de son épaule, et sort à grandes
          enjambées. Patricia le regarde partir en haussant les épaules.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - CUISINE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Folace est seul dans la cuisine, en costume gris, assis devant une
          table encombrée de bouteilles vides de champagne, de seau à glace,
          et surtout de tout ce qu'il faut pour confectionner des sandwiches
          et des canapés. D'ailleurs Folace beurre un canapé. La porte
          s'ouvre, Fernand entre et referme la porte derrière lui. Folace se
          tourne vers lui, et lui parle sur un ton très badin.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Charmante soirée, n'est ce pas ? Vous savez combien ça va
           nous coûter ? Deux milles francs... nouveaux !
                         
          Fernand s'avance lentement vers la table, l'air sévère, pendant
          que Folace continue à beurrer ses canapés.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Y en a qui gaspillent, et y en a d'autres qui collectent...
                         
          Du bras, il dégage, sans ménagement, un espace libre sur la table.
          Il y dépose lourdement la sacoche, qu'il ouvre. Des billets
          débordent de la sacoche et tombent sur la table.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qu'est ce que vous dites de ça ? Hein ?
                         
          Folace sourit. Jean entre dans la cuisine. Fernand met la main sur
          la sacoche. Jean referme la porte, et pose son plateau sur un plan
          de travail derrière Folace.
                         
                          JEAN
           Faudrait encore des sandwichs à la purée d'anchois, ils
           partent bien ceux-là.
                         
          Il se retourne et voit la sacoche.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Les voilà, vos encaissements en retard... et encore avec
           une avance en plus.
                         
          Folace regarde la manche déchirée de Fernand.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Les Volfoni ont essayé de me flinguer, oui maître.
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Ce n'est pourtant pas leur genre.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et ben ça prouve qu'ils ont changé de genre. Voilà.
                         
          Jean fait le tour de la table et ouvre une porte du buffet.
                         
          Gros plan sur une boîte à biscuits. La main de Jean plonge dans la
          boîte, et en sort un pistolet, que Jean arme.
                         
          Il met le pistolet dans la poche intérieure de sa veste avec un
          petit sourire.

           Quand ça change, ça change, faut jamais se laisser

           Vous croyez qu'ils oseraient venir ici ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Les cons, ça ose tout ! C'est même à ça qu'on les
           reconnaît.
                         
          Bruit de sonnette insistant.

          Plusieurs couples sont en train de danser dans le vestibule. A
          travers la vitre de la porte, on voit les visages des frères
          Volfoni. Ils continuent à sonner, mais personne, parmi les
          danseurs, ne semble les entendre. Finalement, l'une des danseuses
          se rend compte de leur présence et ouvre la porte. Raoul entre
          suivi de Paul, qui referme la porte d'un coup de pied. Ils
          regardent autour d'eux, un peu surpris.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           T'es sûr que tu t'es pas gouré de crèche.
                         
          Raoul lui répond d'un ton irrité.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Je me goure jamais, en rien.
                         
          Il avance à travers la foule des danseurs, suivi de son frère. Ils
          passent dans un salon.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - UN SALON - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Raoul dévisage les danseurs, cherchant une tête connue. Des
          bouteilles sont posées sur un meuble. Une jeune fille se tourne
          vers eux, un verre dans chaque main.
                         
           LA JEUNE FILLE
           Scotch ou jus de fruit ?
          Paul va pour prendre le verre qu'on lui tend, mais Raoul, les
          mains enfoncées dans les poches, foudroie la fille du regard.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           C'est rien !
                         
          La fille s'éloigne avec ses deux verres, sans demander son reste.
          Raoul la regarde partir.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Si c'est notre pognon qu'ils sont en train d'arroser, les
           petits comiques, ça va saigner !...
                         
          Il avise Jean au milieu des invités.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Dites donc, mon brave.
                         
          Jean s'avance vers eux, l'air grave.
                         
                          JEAN
           Monsieur ?
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Il est là, votre patron ?
                         
                          JEAN
           Qui demandez-vous ?
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Monsieur Fernand Naudin.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Monsieur Fernand... Fernand l'emmerdeur, Fernand le
           malhonnête, c'est comme ça que je l'appelle, moi.
                         
                          JEAN
           Si ces messieurs veulent bien suivre...
          Jean s'éloigne à travers la foule des invités.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Et comment.
                         
          Il fait quelques pas derrière Jean, puis se retourne vers son
          frère.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Alors, tu viens dis !
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - VESTIBULE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Jean, suivi de Raoul, puis de Paul, entre par une porte située
          derrière l'escalier. Il s'arrête devant la porte de la cuisine.
                         
                          JEAN
           Si vous voulez vous donner la peine d'entrer.
                         
          De la main, il leur montre le chemin. Raoul entre, suivi de Paul,
          sous le regard froid et sarcastique de Jean.
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - CUISINE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Folace est toujours assis à table, en train de beurrer des
          canapés. Sur la table, la sacoche, débordante de billets de
          banque, est toujours grande ouverte. Fernand est debout, en
          chemise, en train de s'essuyer les mains avec un torchon.
                         
          Raoul entre le premier, une main enfoncée dans l'une des poches de
          sa veste.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Bougez pas ! Les mains sur la table. Je vous préviens qu'on
           a la puissance de feu d'un croiseur et des flingues de
           concours.
                         
          Jean entre derrière eux, pistolet à la main. Il referme la porte
          de la cuisine.
                         
                          JEAN
           Si ces messieurs veulent bien me les confier...
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Quoi ?
                         
          Patricia entrent en trombe dans la cuisine, un plateau à la main.
          Sans s'en rendre compte, elle écrase Jean entre la porte et le
          mur.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Ah mes enfants, nous sommes en panne de sandwiches.
                         
          Elle sourit aux frères Volfoni, et pose le plateau dans l'évier
          devant Fernand.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Tu sais, mon oncle, si tes amis veulent danser...
          Elle ramasse une assiette de canapés posée devant Folace et
          ressort. Jean, pistolet toujours pointé vers les Volfoni, claque
          la porte derrière elle.
                         
                          JEAN
           Allons vite, messieurs, quelqu'un pourrait venir, on
           pourrait se méprendre, et on jaserait. Nous venons déjà de
           frôler l'incident.
                         
          Fernand continue à s'essuyer les mains tranquillement.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu sais ce que je devrais faire, hmm ?... rien que pour le
           principe ?
                         
          Il jette son torchon. Folace se lève et récupère le pistolet de
          Raoul dans sa poche. Jean, planté derrière les Volfoni, les tient
          toujours en joue. Machinalement, Raoul se caresse le menton.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Tu trouves pas que c'est un peu rapproché ?
          Folace tâte le haut de la veste de Raoul, pour s'assurer qu'il n'a
          pas d'autre arme. Paul lui donne le pistolet qu'il tient à la
          main. Folace lui tâte le haut de la veste.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Je te disais que cette démarche ne s'imposait pas. Au fond
           maintenant, les diplomates prendraient plutôt le pas sur
           les hommes d'action. L'époque serait aux tables rondes et à
           la détente. Hein ? Qu'est-ce t'en penses ?
                         
          Fernand les regarde longuement.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Je dis pas non.
                         
          Folace, les armes des Volfoni à la main, sourit.
                         
          Fernand s'assoit, et prend un couteau et une tranche de pain.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Mais dis donc, on est quand même pas venu pour beurrer des
           sandwiches ?
                         
          Fernand ne lui répond pas, et commence à beurrer la tranche de
          pain.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Pourquoi pas ? Au contraire, les tâches ménagères ne sont
           pas sans noblesse...
                         
          Il s'assoit sur une chaise, les yeux rivés sur la sacoche
          débordante de billets de banque. Raoul reste debout, le regard
          sévère. Folace dépose les pistolets des Volfoni dans le tiroir de
          la table, puis se rassoit à sa place... devant le tiroir ! Jean
          est toujours debout près de la porte, arme au poing.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           ... surtout lorsqu'elles constituent le premier pas vers
           des négociations fructueuses. Hein ?...
                         
          Folace tend deux assiettes à Paul, une de rillettes, et une autre
          avec des tranches de pain de mie.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Merci.
                         
          Jean regarde Fernand, puis remet son arme dans la poche intérieure
          de sa veste. Raoul lui jette un regard en coin. Jean sort de la
          cuisine. Raoul affiche un sourire un peu crispé et agite une boîte
          de bonbons, probablement des Cachou. Fernand tend la main, et
          Raoul lui dépose un bonbon dans la main. Comme il est penché sur
          la table, son regard ne peut quitter la sacoche de billets. Il
          plonge son autre main à l'intérieur, tout en continuant à agiter
          sa boîte de bonbons, sans se rendre compte que Fernand a retiré sa
          main.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Maître Folace...
                         
          Raoul se redresse, et arrête d'agiter sa boîte.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           ... vous avez oublié de planquer les motifs de fâcherie.
                         
          Folace referme vivement la sacoche. Raoul sourit niaisement.
          Folace prend la sacoche et la dépose sous la table. Paul suit la
          sacoche du regard. Il reste néanmoins quelques billets sur la
          table.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Oh, Monsieur Fernand...
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu connais la vie, Monsieur Paul...
                         
          Raoul s'assoit entre Fernand et Folace. Il remet la boîte de
          bonbons dans sa poche. Fernand et Folace se remettent à beurrer
          des tranches de pain de mie.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Mais pour en revenir au travail manuel, là, ce que vous
           disiez est finement observé. Et puis, ça reste une base.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ça, c'est bien vrai, hein. Si on bricolait plus souvent, on
           aurait moins la tête aux bêtises.
                         
          Folace lui tend un couteau et une tranche de pain. Raoul commence
          à beurrer la tartine.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ouais !...
                         
          On entend la porte de la cuisine qui s'ouvre.
                         
           LA JEUNE FILLE ÉMÉCHÉE (voix off)
           Jean !
          Fernand, Raoul et Folace se retournent.
                         
          Une jeune fille, visiblement éméchée, vient d'ouvrir la porte de
          la cuisine. C'est apparemment la même jeune fille, qui, quelques
          temps auparavant, réclamait déjà de l'alcool à Jean.
                         
           LA JEUNE FILLE ÉMÉCHÉE
           Ben, où il est, Jean ?
                         
          Paul, absorbé par son travail de « tartinage », n'a même pas
          relevé la tête.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qu'est ce que vous lui voulez ?
                         
          Elle se penche sur la table en bousculant Paul.
                         
           LA JEUNE FILLE ÉMÉCHÉE
           Y a plus de glace et y a plus de scotch !
                         
          Fernand essaie de rester calme.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Maître Folace, donnez-lui des jus de fruit, allez...
                         
                          UNE INVITEE
           Pas de jus de fruit, du scotch. Vos jus de fruit vous
           pouvez vous les...
                         
          Folace essaie de repousser la fille qui avance vers Fernand.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Allons, mademoiselle !
                         
          Il réussit à la repousser, et prend un air très sérieux, presque
          sentencieux.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           L'oncle de Patricia vous dit qu'il n'y a plus de scotch, un
           point c'est tout.
                         
           LA JEUNE FILLE ÉMÉCHÉE
           Vous n'avez qu'à en acheter, avec ça.
                         
          Elle ramasse une poignée de billets, qui trainent encore sur la
          table.
                         
          Folace lui saisit fermement le poignet. En la voyant toucher à
          l'argent, il a instantanément changé. De calme et pondéré, il est
          devenu quasiment hystérique.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Touche pas au grisbi, salope !
                         
          Il la regarde sauvagement, les dents serrés, les lèvres
          tremblantes et les yeux agités de tics.
                         
          Raoul et Fernand regardent la fille d'un air sombre, presque
          menaçant.
          La fille, soudain effrayée, sort en titubant de la pièce et claque
          la porte derrière elle.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           De l'alcool à cet âge-là !
                         
          Il soupire.
                         
          Fernand semble un peu énervé.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah non, mais c'est un scandale, hein ?
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ben... Nous par contre, on est des adultes... on pourrait
           peut-être s'en faire un petit ? Hein ?...
                         
          Il continue à beurrer sa tranche de pain, et regarde Fernand avec
          un petit sourire. Fernand semble calmé.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ça, le fait est. Maître Folace ?
          Du regard, il désigne les cadavres de bouteille sur la table.
                         
          Folace se lève.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Seulement, le tout venant a été piraté par les mômes.
           Qu'est ce qu'on fait, on se risque sur le bizarre ?
                         
          Il se penche, ouvre une porte du buffet, et en sort une bouteille
          pleine, qui contient un bon litre d'alcool. Elle ressemble à une
          petite bonbonne, avec un bouchon à vis et une petite poignée en
          verre près du goulot. Sur l'étiquette, sont dessinées trois cartes
          à jouer, avec trois rois. Au-dessus, en lettres gothiques, est
          écrit : « The Three Kings » (Les Trois Rois), et en-dessous, aussi
          en lettre gothiques, est écrit : « Scotch Whisky ».
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Ça va rajeunir personne.
                         
          Raoul regarde la bouteille en souriant.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ben, nous voilà sauvés.
                         
          Folace s'assoit et commence à dévisser le bouchon de la bouteille.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Sauvés, faut voir !
                         
          Jean entre dans la cuisine, un plateau vide à la main. Il referme
          la porte et pose son plateau sur le buffet. Il s'avance vers la
          table et regarde Folace remplir un verre.
                         
                          JEAN
           Tiens, vous avez sorti le vitriol ?
                         
          Folace tend le verre à Fernand.
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Pourquoi vous dites ça ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Hé !...
                         
          Il ricane et lui tend un verre. Paul le prend et le regarde.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Il a pourtant un air honnête.
                         
          Jean pose d'autres verres sur la table et sourit à Paul.
                         
          Fernand inspecte le contenu de son verre.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Sans être franchement malhonnête, au premier abord, comme
           ça, il... a l'air assez curieux.
                         
          Folace donne un verre à Raoul et en remplit un autre pour Jean.
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Il date du Mexicain, du temps des grandes heures, seulement
           on a dû arrêter la fabrication, y a des clients qui
           devenaient aveugles. Alors ça faisait des histoires.
                         
          Folace remplit un autre verre pour lui-même.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Allez !
                         
          Il trinque avec Fernand, puis avec Folace, qui trinque aussi avec
          Fernand. Jean trinque avec Paul, et Fernand lève son verre vers
          Jean et Paul.
                         
          Raoul approche son verre de ses lèvres.
                         
          Les autres le regardent avec expectative.
                         
          Raoul finit par boire une gorgée.
                         
          Les autres le regardent avec encore plus d'attention.
                         
          Raoul baisse son verre. Il a la voix un peu rauque.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ah ! Faut reconnaître...
                         
          Il a un haut-le-coeur.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           ... c'est du brutal !
                         
          Paul, lui, a carrément les larmes aux yeux.
                         
          (NOTE - Pour la petite histoire, lors du tournage de la scène, les
          copains de Jean Lefebvre, qui jouait le rôle de Paul Volfoni, lui
          avaient fait une blague. Alors que l'accessoiriste avait mis de
          l'eau colorée dans les verres, ses copains, non seulement, lui
          avaient vraiment mis de l'alcool dans son verre à lui, mais avait
          en plus rajouté du poivre ! Ses larmes sont donc bien réelles ! -
          Cette anecdote est d'ailleurs racontée par Jean Lefebvre lui-même
          dans l'un des bonus du DVD du film.)
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Vous avez raison, il est curieux, hein ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           J'ai connu une polonaise qu'en prenait au petit déjeuner.
                         
          Il boit une gorgée à son tour. Et c'est avec, lui aussi, une voix
          un peu rauque, qu'il dit :
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Faut quand même admettre, c'est plutôt une boisson d'homme.
                         
          Paul s'essuie les yeux avec son mouchoir.
                         
          Raoul finit son verre, Paul aussi. Fernand se racle la gorge avant
          de finir le sien.
          Folace finit son verre, claque la langue, enlève ses lunettes et
          tombe la veste. Jean finit son verre, le pose sur la table, prend
          la bouteille et commence à resservir tout le monde.
                         
          Raoul boit une gorgée et se penche vers Fernand.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Tu sais pas ce qu'il me rappelle ?
                         
          Fernand secoue la tête en signe de dénégation.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Cette espèce de drôlerie qu'on buvait dans une petite taule
           de Biên Hoa, pas tellement loin de Saïgon. Les volets
           rouges et la taulière, une blonde komac. Comment qu'elle
           s'appelait, Nom de Dieu ?

           T'as connue ?
                         
          Fernand hausse les yeux au ciel.
                         
          Paul sent le contenu de son verre.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Je lui trouve un goût de pomme.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Y en a.
                         
          Raoul fait toujours ses confidences à Fernand.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Et bien, c'est devant chez elle que Lucien le Cheval s'est
           fait dessouder.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et par qui ? Hein ?
                         
          Raoul réfléchit, mais ne trouve pas la réponse.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ben voilà que j'ai plus ma tête.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Par Teddy de Montréal, un fondu qui travaillait qu'à la
           dynamite.
                         
          Fernand prend la bouteille pour se resservir. Il sert d'abord
          Raoul.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Toute une époque !
                         
          Fernand hoche la tête.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - SALON - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
          C'est maintenant le temps des « slows » avec une musique plus
          douce. Derrière la vitrine « napoléonienne », un couple est en
          train de danser.
                         
          Patricia entre dans la pièce avec une assiette à la main. Elle se
          dirige vers Antoine, qui semble un peu rêveur.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Tu boudes ?
                         
          Antoine répond d'une voix douce, presque en chuchotant
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Bouder moi, tu plaisantes... N'empêche que je commence à en
           avoir assez, moi, des amours clandestines. S'embrasser par
           téléphone... même deux fois par jour, c'est bien mignon,
           mais je suis un homme, moi, tu comprends ? Tout ça à cause
           de ton oncle. Écoute, c'est vraiment trop bête, on dirait
           que vous avez tous peur de lui. Mais je vais aller lui
           parler, moi.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Tu vas lui parler de quoi ?
                         
          Antoine embrasse tendrement Patricia sur la bouche.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Je vais lui parler de notre mariage, de toi, de moi, de
           nous.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Répète un peu ce que tu viens de dire !
                         
          Antoine lui dépose un petit bécot sur les lèvres.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           De toi, de moi.
                          PATRICIA
           Oh non, juste le premier mot. C'était le meilleur.

          Fernand vide le fond de la bouteille dans le verre de Jean. Tout
          le monde est maintenant en chemise, sauf Paul et Jean. Folace
          parle d'une voix visiblement très embuée par l'alcool.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           D'accord, d'accord, je dis pas qu'à la fin de sa vie, Jo le
           Trembleur, il avait pas un peu baissé. Mais n'empêche que,
           pendant les années terribles, sous l'occup', il butait à
           tout va. Il a quand même décimé toute une division de
           panzers. Ah !
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Il était dans les chars ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Non, dans la limonade...
          Il frappe sur l'épaule de Raoul.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Sois à ce qu'on te dit !
                         
          Raoul se met à pleurnicher.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Mais j'ai plus ma tête...
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Il avait son secret, le Jo.
                         
          Il essaie de remettre ses lunettes, mais n'y arrive pas et se
          plante les branches dans les yeux. D'un seul coup, Raoul
          écarquille les yeux. Il se lève lentement, très raide.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           C'est où ?
                         
          Jean se lève avec difficulté de sa chaise.
                         
                          JEAN
           A droite, au fond du couloir.
                         
          Raoul sort précipitamment de la cuisine et referme la porte
          derrière lui. Folace a fini par arriver à remettre ses lunettes.
          Jean se rassoit.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Et... Et... Et... cinquante kilos de patates, un sac de

          Il frappe violemment de la main sur la table et hausse le ton.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Et c'est pour ça que je permets d'intimer l'ordre à

          Fernand se racle la gorge.
                         
          Folace essaie, avec beaucoup de difficulté, d'introduire une
          cigarette dans son fume-cigarette. Paul le regarde, les yeux dans
          le vague.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Vous avez beau dire, y a pas seulement que de la pomme, y a
           autre chose, ce serait pas des fois de la betterave ?
           Hein ?
                         
          Fernand dodeline de la tête.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Si, y en a aussi.

          Debout et appuyé des deux mains sur la table, Raoul, toujours bien
          éméché, fait les yeux doux à Patricia.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           On vous apprend quoi, à l'école, mon petit chat ? Les

           je le vois, votre avenir ? Vous voulez le savoir ?
                         
          Raoul lâche la table, mais a du mal à tenir debout. Il fait
          quelques pas vers Patricia, qui s'écarte en riant.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Non, non, non, non, non, non...
                         
          Il se raccroche à la table en affichant un sourire niais.

           Ben, je vais vous le dire quand même...
                         
          Patricia l'écoute, bouche ouverte, ayant du mal à retenir son
          hilarité.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Je vois une carrière internationale, des voyages, ouais,
           l'Égypte par exemple, c'est pas commun ça, l'Égypte ? Et
           puis, ce qui a de bien c'est que, là-bas, l'artiste est
           toujours gâtée.
                         
          Patricia met la main devant sa bouche pour masquer son fou-rire.
          Elle regarde vers Antoine, qui vient d'entrer dans la pièce.
                         
           ANTOINE DELAFOY (voix off)
           Patricia ?...
                         
          En voyant entrer un « rival », Raoul affiche maintenant un petit
          air pincé, avec les yeux outrageusement plissés.
          Antoine, lui, contrairement à Patricia, ne semble pas trouver la
          scène très drôle, et c'est d'une voix sèche qu'il s'adresse à
          Raoul.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Monsieur désire un... renseignement ?
                         
          Patricia lui répond sur un ton badin.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Non, monsieur me proposait une tournée en Égypte.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Hein ?
                         
          Raoul se sent soudain un peu décontenancé devant l'allure
          autoritaire d'Antoine.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Non, je disais l'Égypte... comme ça ! J'aurais aussi bien
           pu dire... le Liban.
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Je vois, Monsieur dirige sans doute une agence de voyage ?
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Mais non, voyons, chéri, Monsieur fait la traite des
           blanches, mais tu sais que c'est courant. Allez, viens !
                         
          Antoine semble soudain très en colère, et Patricia l'entraine hors
          de la pièce.
                         
          Raoul soupire d'un air désabusé. Il frappe des mains l'une contre
          l'autre.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - CUISINE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Folace ronfle, affalé sur la table. Devant lui, la bouteille vide
          de whisky frelaté. Une main pose une autre bouteille, légèrement
          entamée, du même whisky frelaté à côté de la première.
                         
          Fernand attrape un morceau de pain de mie, dans une assiette, et
          le regarde avec des yeux vagues.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Je reprendrais bien quelque chose de consistant, moi !
                         
          Il mord dans le morceau de pain.
                         
          En face de lui, Paul mâchouille, lui aussi, un morceau de pain.
          Assis à côté de Fernand, Jean est, lui aussi, en train de manger.
          Raoul entre dans la cuisine, d'un pas titubant, referme la porte,
          et s'approche de la table. Sa présence réveille Folace.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Dis donc... elle est maquée à un jaloux, ta nièce ? Hein ?
           Je lui faisais un brin de causette, le genre réservé, tu me
           connais, mousse et pampre, voilà tout d'un coup qu'un petit
           cave est venu me chercher, les gros mots et tout !
          Fernand se lève lentement. Il a, comme Raoul, du mal à tenir
          debout.
                         
          Raoul est soudain un peu effrayé par le regard menaçant de
          Fernand, qu'il pense lui être adressé.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Quoi ? Monsieur Antoine !
                         
          Fernand fait le tour de la table, un sourire narquois aux lèvres.
          Folace se lève et le suit.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Il s'agit pas de lui faire franchir les portes, il faut
           peut-être le faire passer à travers.
                         
          Il ouvre brusquement la porte de la cuisine, et sort, suivi par
          Folace.
                         
          Raoul regarde Jean d'un air interrogateur.
          Jean termine tranquillement son verre
                         
                          JEAN
           Je serais pas étonné qu'on ferme !
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - SALON - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Fernand attrape Antoine par le bras et le pousse vers le
          vestibule.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Dehors tout le monde ! Allez les petites filles, au dodo !
           Dehors !...
                         
          Antoine se dirige vers le vestibule, suivi par Fernand et Folace.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et les familles françaises, ça se respecte, monsieur. Les
           foyers c'est pas des putes, hein !
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Une seule excuse, monsieur, à cet excès de familiarité,
           c'est l'excès de boisson.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oh ! Mais...
                         
          Il se tourne vers Folace.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qui qu'a bu ? Hein ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Oh ! Du jus de pommes.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Le tact, moi, monsieur Antoine et à toute la bande... Allez
           hop.
          Il pousse Antoine à travers le vestibule, sous les regards médusés
          des autres invités. Folace revient vers l'intérieur de la pièce.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Allez, allez dehors, on ferme.

          Fernand pousse Antoine à travers tout le vestibule jusqu'à la
          porte d'entrée, que Jean vient obligeamment d'ouvrir.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Allez, allez, allez, allez...
                         
          Il le pousse dehors. Les autres invités, choqués, commentent
          l'évènement, mais, avec le bruit et la musique, on ne comprend pas
          leurs paroles.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - SALON - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Folace pousse tous les occupants du salon vers le vestibule.
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Allez, allez, allez, allez, allez...

          Folace continue à pousser les invités vers la porte d'entrée.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           La sortie c'est par là. Allez oust.
                         
          Un invité essaie de résister à la poussée de Folace en
          s'accrochant à un meuble.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           On retire sa main de là. Allez, allez.

          Raoul, l'oeil égrillard, pousse les jeunes gens vers la sortie, et
          en profite pour tripoter les filles au passage. Plusieurs filles
          crient.
                         
           MAITRE FOLACE (voix off)
           Barrez-vous, je vous dis. Barrez-vous.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - VESTIBULE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Devant la porte d'entrée, Fernand et Folace pousse les invités
          dehors.
                         
          Au fond du vestibule, derrière l'escalier, Paul pousse les
          retardataires.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Allez au lit, au lit tout ça.
                         
          Devant la porte d'entrée, Raoul s'est joint à Fernand et Folace
          pour pousser les invités dehors. Ils ne se rendent pas compte que,
          pris par leur élan, ils poussent aussi Paul dehors. Fernand et
          Jean referment la porte sur le dernier invité. Fernand, Raoul et
          Folace éclatent de rire. Jean les regarde, l'oeil vague, mais sans
          rire. A travers la vitre de la porte, on aperçoit le visage de
          Paul. Il ouvre lentement la porte. En le voyant, les trois hommes
          redoublent de rire. Fernand est même obligé de s'asseoir. Mais
          Jean, lui, ne rit toujours pas. Il fait signe à Fernand de
          regarder vers l'escalier.
                         
          Fernand s'arrête de rire et regarde vers l'escalier. Raoul et
          Folace, debout à côté de lui, s'arrêtent aussi de rire, et
          regardent vers l'escalier.
                         
          A mi-chemin de la première volée de marches, Patricia les regarde
          avec une grande tristesse dans le regard.
                         
          Fernand se lève et regarde vers l'escalier. Il titube un peu et se
          masse le visage. Il regarde Jean, puis s'avance vers l'escalier.
                         
          Folace et Raoul regardent Patricia, visiblement mal à leur aise.
          Raoul a trouvé un verre à moitié plein, qu'il tient à la main.
          Fernand, les mains derrière le dos, se tourne vers ses amis, puis
          continue à avancer vers l'escalier.
                         
          Patricia est maintenant en larmes. Elle se retourne et finit de
          monter l'escalier quatre à quatre.
                         
          Fernand se tourne vers Raoul et Folace.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND

          Folace se met à ricaner d'un rire d'ivrogne, qui devient un fou-
          rire. Les autres le regardent.
                         
          Fondu au noir.

          Fernand est allongé sur le ventre, en pyjama. Folace, lui aussi en
          pyjama, le secoue.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Hé... Hé oh !... Oh ! Réveillez-vous ! Réveillez-vous !
                         
          Fernand se redresse lentement sur son lit, mais il perd
          l'équilibre et retombe à plat ventre, presque en dehors du lit.
          Folace l'aide à se relever. Fernand regarde Folace avec des petits
          yeux, et la bouche visiblement pâteuse.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Mais qu'est ce que vous faîtes là, vous ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           J'ai le regret de vous faire savoir que Mademoiselle
           Patricia ne s'est pas rendue à son cours ce matin.
                         
          Fernand se masse le visage.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Quoi ?
                         
          Folace se penche sur lui et hausse le ton.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Patricia... n'est pas allée aux cours ce matin.
           L'institution vient de téléphoner.
                         
          Fernand se lève du lit... avec une certaine difficulté.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bien, je vous garantis qu'elle va y aller, à son cours.
           Elle va même y aller tout de suite, hein !
                         
          Il finit de se lever et enfile sa robe de chambre, aidé par
          Folace.

          Fernand traverse le palier, suivi par Folace, qui continue à
          l'aider à mettre sa robe de chambre. Jean, toujours aussi
          imperturbable dans sa veste blanche, les regarde passer. Fernand
          et Folace entrent dans la chambre de Patricia.

          Il finit par s'asseoir sur le lit.

                          MONSIEUR FERNAND

           Monsieur ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Dites donc, euh... Vous avez vu partir la petite, vous, ce
           matin ?
                         
                          JEAN
           Oui, Monsieur, comme d'habitude, à huit heures.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et vous avez rien remarqué ?
                          JEAN
           Si Monsieur, les valises.
                         
          Fernand se tourne vers Folace, l'air ahuri.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Non mais !...
                         
          Il se lève.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Comment, c'est maintenant qu'y me dit ça.
                         
          Il se met à marcher de long en large dans la pièce.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bon dieu, c'est pas vrai, non mais c'est pas vrai.
           Comment ? Une môme qui s'en va soit disant à l'école avec
           ses valoches et vous, vous trouvez ça naturel, vous ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Go on, go on, go on, and he'll break your dirty face.
           (Traduction : Continue, continue, continue, et il va te
           casser ta sale gueule.)
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah, on peut dire que je suis comblé.
                         
          Il noue la ceinture de sa robe de chambre.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Merci Messieurs, merci ! Ah oui !
                         
          Jean sourit à Folace, et sort un petit papier de la poche
          pectorale de sa veste.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ?
          Jean a ouvert le papier sur lequel est écrit : « POR 89 89 » et
          en-dessous : « 5532 NA 75 ».
                         
          (NOTE - Jusqu'en 1963, année de la sortie du film, à Paris, les
          indicatifs téléphoniques n'étaient, non pas des chiffres, mais des
          lettres correspondant aux trois premières lettres du nom du
          central auquel ils étaient rattachés. POR correspond donc à Port-
          Royal. Quant à ce qui est écrit sous ce numéro de téléphone, il
          s'agit du numéro d'immatriculation du taxi, tel que les
          immatriculations étaient en vigueur jusqu'en octobre 2009. Les
          deux derniers chiffres, 75, signifient que le taxi est immatriculé
                         À PARIS)
                         
                          JEAN
           C'est le numéro du radio-taxi qu'elle a pris.
                         
          Folace sourit. Jean se tourne vers lui, et lui dit, sur un ton un
                         PEU SEC :
                         
                          JEAN
           Yes sir !
           (Traduction : Oui, monsieur !)
                         
          Le sourire de Folace s'efface de son visage. Jean, lui, sourit
          béatement.
                         
          PARIS - UNE PETITE RUE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Gros plan sur le logo « Radio-Taxi » collé sur le côté de la
          Peugeot 404 noire.
                         
          Le taxi se gare dans une petite ruelle, presque une impasse.
                         
          A travers le pare-brise, on voit le chauffeur du taxi, et assis
          derrière lui, Fernand, portant un costume sombre. Il pointe du
          doigt quelque chose devant la voiture.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Vous êtes sûr que c'est là ?
                         
           CHAUFFEUR DU TAXI
           Un peu, j'ai coltiné les bagages à la troisième baraque.
                         
          Du doigt, il désigne l'immeuble.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Non mais, elle est folle ?
                         
          Il ouvre la porte et sort du taxi.
                         
           CHAUFFEUR DU TAXI
           C'est ce qu'on a toujours tendance à croire chaque fois
           qu'elles nous font la malle.

          Plan pris de l'intérieur du taxi, comme si la caméra était posé
          sur le siège passager avant.
          Fernand se penche par la vitre ouverte du chauffeur.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Attendez-moi, j'en ai pour cinq minutes.
                         
           CHAUFFEUR DU TAXI
           Ah, j'aimerais mieux que vous appeliez un collègue.
                         
          PARIS - UNE PETITE RUE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan rapproché du chauffeur, vu par sa vitre ouverte.
                         
           CHAUFFEUR DU TAXI
           Si la petite dame me voit, j'aurais le vilain rôle.
           Comprenez... cafarder, c'est pas beau.
                         
          Il jette un oeil sur le compteur.
                         
           CHAUFFEUR DU TAXI
           Six cinquante... Et puis nous, dans le métier, les
           ruptures, les retrouvailles, toutes les fluctuations de la
           fesse, on préfère pas s'en mêler.
          Fernand sort une liasse de billets, et en extrait un qu'il donne
          au chauffeur, qui le met dans la poche pectorale de sa veste.
                         
           CHAUFFEUR DU TAXI
           Moi j'ai un collègue comme ça, transporteur de cocus, y
           s'est retrouvé criblé en plein jour, rue Godeau, par une
           maladroite.
                         
          Fernand tapote nerveusement sur le rebord de la vitre baissée. Le
          chauffeur sort de la monnaie de sa poche et tend une pièce à
          Fernand.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oui, bon ben, ça va, ça va !
                         
           CHAUFFEUR DU TAXI
           Voilà, monsieur, merci bien...
                         
          Fernand lui met une grosse poignée de pièces dans la main, et
          s'éloigne.
                         
           CHAUFFEUR DU TAXI
           Merci... Hé !...
                         
          Fernand qui avait commencé à remonter la ruelle, se retourne vers
          le taxi.
                         
          Le chauffeur lui adresse un gentil sourire.
                         
           CHAUFFEUR DU TAXI
           Soyez quand même pas trop dur...
                         
          IMMEUBLE D'ANTOINE - PALIER - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Gros plan sur la porte de l'appartement d'Antoine Delafoy. Un
          porte-carte est vissé sur la porte, porte-carte dans lequel est
          glissé une carte de visite, sur laquelle est inscrit : « Antoine
          Delafoy », et en-dessous : « Compositeur ».
                         
          On entend deux coups frappés sur la porte, puis le gros plan se
          déplace de la carte de visite vers la poignée de la porte. La main
          de Fernand tourne la poignée et la porte s'ouvre. On voit la
          silhouette de Fernand entrer dans l'appartement.
                         
          APPARTEMENT D'ANTOINE - COULOIR - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Bruit de percussions « musicales ».
                         
          Fernand entre dans le couloir d'entrée de l'appartement, qui est
          situé sous les toits de l'immeuble. La partie haute du mur, côté
          toit, est inclinée. Et les fenêtres sont des lucarnes. Fernand
          referme la porte derrière lui. Il avance dans le couloir, se
          dirigeant vers le son des percussions.
                         
          APPARTEMENT D'ANTOINE - SÉJOUR - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          La salle de séjour de l'appartement est une grande pièce, sur les
          murs desquels sont accrochés plusieurs instruments de musique
          conventionnels. Du plafond pendent des cordes sur lesquelles sont
          accrochés des tubes de verre. Dans un angle, un grand canapé de
          forme arrondie. Plusieurs fauteuils sont disséminés dans la pièce
                         
          Devant Fernand, une structure métallique supporte divers
          instruments de percussions, certains reconnaissables, comme une
          cymbale, d'autres inventés par le « compositeur », par exemple des
          pièces métalliques qui tournent sur un axe vertical.
                         
          Travelling le long de la structure métallique. Des balles de ping-
          pong tombent sur la cymbale, sur laquelle elles rebondissent. A
          côté de la cymbale, un bocal de verre contient d'autres balles de
          ping-pong, puis on découvre divers récipients de chimiste, puis
          des robinets. Les deux derniers robinets semblent un peu antiques.
          Ces robinets laissent tous couler des filets d'eau, d'importance
          variable d'un robinet à l'autre. Des micros sur pied sont posés
          devant la structure métallique. Le travelling se termine sur
          Antoine assis devant une table installée devant une grande baie
          vitrée. Sur cette table, sont posés trois magnétophones. Des
          ventilateurs et une girouette tournent à côté d'Antoine. De l'eau
          glou-gloute dans un bocal.
                         
          Antoine, sentant une présence, se retourne, et découvre Fernand,
          debout, les poings sur les hanches.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Ah Nom de Dieu de Nom de Dieu, mais où faut-il s'expatrier,
           mon Dieu, pour avoir la paix ? Au Groenland, à la Terre de
           Feu ? J'allais toucher l'anti-accord absolu, vous
           entendez ?... Absolu. La musique des sphères... Mais
           qu'est-ce que j'essaie de vous faire comprendre, homme-
           singe !
                         
          Le discours d'Antoine a été débité sur un ton assez passionné, qui
          ne semble pas impressionner Fernand. Surtout, il ne semble pas
          beaucoup apprécier les robinets.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Vous permettez ?
          Il tourne la manette d'un robinet pour l'arrêter. Antoine pose sa
          main sur la sienne.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Ah non !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Monsieur Delafoy, quand vous en aurez terminé avec vos
           instruments de ménage...
                         
          Il ferme tous les robinets un par un.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Oh, j'attendais ça...
                         
          La voix un peu stridente d'Antoine semble indisposer Fernand, qui
          ressent encore les effets de sa cuite de la veille.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           ... mes instruments de ménage ? L'ironie du primate,
           l'humour Louis-Philippard, le sarcasme Prudhommesque.
          Il se déplace de long en large dans la pièce.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Monsieur Naudin, vous faites sans doute autorité en matière
           de Bulldozer, tracteur et Caterpillar, mais vos opinions
           sur la musique moderne et sur l'art en général, je vous
           conseille de ne les utiliser qu'en suppositoires. Voilà !
           Et encore, pour enfant. J'ajouterais qu'ayant dormi à la
           porte de chez vous, je comprends mal...
                         
          Il s'avance vers sa table de travail et arrête ses magnétophones.
          Fernand se masse les yeux. Les balles de ping-pong, elles,
          continuent de rebondir sur la cymbale.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Où est Patricia ?
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Je comprends mal, disais-je, votre présence chez moi !
                         
          Fernand, très énervé maintenant, hausse la voix.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Où est Patricia ?
                         
           PATRICIA (voix off)
           Ici, mon oncle...
                         
          Patricia vient d'apparaître à la porte de la cuisine, portant un
          petit tablier de soubrette sur sa robe. Fernand s'avance vers
          elle.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Bonjour !
                         
          On entend toujours, en fond sonore, la musique « moderne »
          d'Antoine.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Mais enfin... Comment Patricia, mais... qu'est-ce que tu
           fais là ? Qu'est ce que ça veut dire, tout ça ?
                         
          Patricia, de la main, lui désigne l'intérieur de la cuisine.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Tu vois, je civette, je bain-marise, je ragougnasse. Bref,
           je donne à Antoine tout apaisement dans l'avenir. Logique
           non ? Il doit passer sa vie avec moi.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Passer sa vie ?
                         
          Patricia s'avance vers Fernand.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Naturellement, tu restes déjeuner avec nous ? Chéri !
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Oui ?
                          PATRICIA
           Tu devrais descendre chez l'Italien, je crois que nous
           allons manquer de vin.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Oncle Fernand préfère le Bordeaux ou le Bourgogne ?
                         
          Fernand se masse les tempes, et Antoine préfère ne pas insister.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Hein ?... Ben, on prendra les deux.
                         
          Il s'éloigne pour se préparer à sortir. Fernand continue à se
          masser les tempes. Patricia s'en aperçoit et le regarde avec
          inquiétude.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Ça ne va pas, qu'est-ce que tu as ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Rien... Je deviens louf, c'est tout !
                         
           PATRICIA (voix off)
           Oh, mon civet qui brûle !
                         
          APPARTEMENT D'ANTOINE - CUISINE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Dans la cuisine, Patricia soulève le couvercle d'une cocotte,
          souffle dans la cocotte et touille sa cuisine avec une cuiller en
          bois. Par la porte ouverte, on aperçoit Fernand, toujours debout
          au milieu du séjour.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Tu peux venir, tu sais.
                         
          Elle tourne la tête vers Fernand, qui s'avance lentement vers
          elle.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Écoute Patricia... Qu'est ce qui t'a pris de partir comme
           ça ? Hein ? Tu nous a fais faire un mauvais sang du diable,
           quoi !
                         
          Patricia lui met sa cuiller en bois dans la bouche.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Qu'est ce qui t'a pris de mettre Antoine à la porte ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu veux mon avis ?
                         
                          PATRICIA
           C'est bien pour ça que je te le fais goûter.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et bien, il manque du sel.
                         
          Fernand s'énerve un peu.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Non, mais c'est pas de ça qu'il s'agit, c'est de mon avis
           sur ton Antoine.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Mon Antoine, tu ne crois pas si bien dire...
                         
          Elle ouvre le freezer de son réfrigérateur
                         
                          PATRICIA
           ... il m'épouse.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Non, non, non, Patricia, attention, ne nous emballons pas,
           hein ! D'abord est-ce que tu l'aimes ? Ben... Est-ce que tu
           l'aimes assez pour l'épouser ?
                         
          Elle a sorti un bac à glaçons du réfrigérateur et le referme.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Oh, presque trop, c'est du gâchis. Ça méritait une liaison
           malheureuse, tragique, quelque chose d'Espagnol, même de
           Russe.
                         
          Elle démoule les glaçons dans un petit seau en verre.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Allez, viens donc boire un petit Scotch, va, ça te fera
           oublier ceux d'hier.
                         
          Elle s'approche de Fernand.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Hier, j'ai rien bu. Alors, pas ça !
                         
          Il joint le geste à la parole en mettant l'ongle de son pouce sur
          ses incisives supérieures.
          Elle sort de la cuisine.
                         
          APPARTEMENT D'ANTOINE - SÉJOUR - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Patricia s'approche de la table sur laquelle sont disposés les
          apéritifs.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Alors, pourquoi tu déambulais toute la nuit ? Tu as même
           fait couler deux bains.
                         
          Fernand entre lentement dans la salle de séjour. Il semble un peu
          mal à son aise.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Les nerfs !...
                         
          Il passe derrière elle en se frottant un peu nerveusement les
          mains.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Dis moi, tu comptes rentrer pas trop tard.
          Il s'assoit dans un fauteuil.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oui, il faudrait pas que la future belle-famille aille
           s'imaginer que... que nous menons une vie de bohème, quand
           même.
                         
          Patricia donne un verre à Fernand.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Parce que ton Antoine, il est bien gentil avec ses airs...
           là... Mais tu vas voir qu'il va nous faire surgir une
           famille, comme tout le monde.
                         
          Fondu enchaîné.
                         
          Un peu plus tard.
                         
          Antoine marche de long en large dans la pièce, circulant entre les
          nombreux objets de verre qui pendent du plafond. Derrière lui,
          Patricia débarrasse la table.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Bref, seul rescapé d'une famille ébranlée par les guerres
           coloniales, les divorces et les accidents de la route,
           papa, Adolphe Amédée Delafoy dit « Le Président », un
           personnage... Il collectionne les pendules et les
           contraventions, les déceptions sentimentales et les
           décorations. Il les a toutes sauf la médaille de sauvetage,
           la plus belle selon lui, mais la plus difficile à décrocher
           quand on est pas breton.
                         
          Fernand l'écoute, affalé dans un fauteuil, en chemise et un cigare
          au bec. Du pied, il fait sonner l'un des objets de percussion en
          verre qui pendent du plafond.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Un homme curieux, dîtes-donc !
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Un père... Adolphe-Amédée témoigne en matière d'art de
           perversion assez voisine des vôtres, défenseur de Puvis de
           Chavannes et de Reynaldo Hahn...
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Connais pas.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Lui, si ! A part ça, ce qu'il est convenu d'appeler un
           grand honnête homme. Porté sur la morale et les soubrettes,
           la religion et les jetons de présence... Vous connaissez sa
           dernière ? Il vient de se faire bombarder vice-président du
           Fond Monétaire International.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oh ?
                         
          Fernand semble soudain très intéressé. Il se met à téter son
          cigare d'un air pensif. Derrière lui, Patricia, toujours occupé à
          débarrasser la table, le regarde avec attention.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           A quoi penses-tu ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Fond Monétaire...
                         
          Il fait un clin d'oeil à Patricia.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           ... pas bête, ça, tu sais !
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Dans le parc du manoir, Théo est debout près d'un petit kiosque en
          bois.
                         
          Un peu plus loin, son ami, caché par un arbre, observe le manoir,
          et plus particulièrement la chambre de Fernand.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - CHAMBRE DE FERNAND - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Jean ouvre les rideaux et laisse entrer la lumière dans la pièce.
          Puis il tourne la poignée de la fenêtre.
                         
           JEAN, MAÎTRE FOLACE ET PATRICIA (voix off)
           Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you...
                         
          Fernand, allongé en pyjama dans son lit, ouvre les yeux, et
          regarde ce qui se passe au pied de son lit.
                         
          Debout devant le pied du lit, Folace, en robe de chambre sombre,
          tient un petit paquet à la main. A côté de lui, Patricia, déjà
          habillée d'une robe claire, avec un collier de perles autour du
          cou, tient un paquet plus grand derrière son dos. Jean revient de
          la fenêtre, qu'il vient d'ouvrir, et se positionne à côté de
          Patricia. Lui aussi est déjà habillé en veste blanche, et tient un
          petit paquet à la main. Ils chantent tous trois, avec beaucoup de
          conviction... mais un peu faux !
                         
           JEAN, MAÎTRE FOLACE ET PATRICIA
           ... happy birthday, Fernand... happy birthday to you !
                         
          Patricia s'approche du lit.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Bon anniversaire, mon Oncle !
                         
          Elle l'embrasse sur les deux joues et pose son paquet sur le lit.
                         
          Maître tend son petit paquet vers le lit avec un grand sourire.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Joyeux anniversaire, mon cher.
                         
          Quelqu'un, que l'on ne voit pas (peut-être Patricia) lui prend le
          paquet des mains.
                         
          Fernand ouvre le paquet et en sort un stylo.
          Jean, à son tour, offre son cadeau à Fernand.
                         
                          JEAN
           Good health and happiness, Sir !... Santé et prospérité,
           Sir !
           (Traduction exacte : Bonne santé et bonheur, monsieur)
                         
          Gros plan sur le cadeau de Jean : une pipe. Fernand la retourne
          dans sa main.
                         
          Il la porte à sa bouche, et aspire un peu pour vérifier le tirage.
          Il sourit.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           C'est vraiment trop gentil.
                         
          Patricia ramasse un autre paquet, posé sur la table à côté du
          plateau du petit-déjeuner.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           On m'a apporté celui-là tout à l'heure.
                         
          Elle s'approche du lit, tout en lisant ce qui est écrit sur le
          paquet.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Expéditeur : Volfoni frères.
                         
          Fernand tourne vers lui le paquet, que Patricia tient toujours
          dans ses mains. A son tour, il lit ce qui est écrit sur le paquet.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           On a beau avoir fait la paix, ça fait quand même quelque
           chose.
                         
          Il regarde Folace, dont on ne voit pas le visage, mais qui doit
          sembler dubitatif, car Fernand ajoute :
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oh si... Je dois dire que le geste est délicat.
                         
          Patricia porte le paquet à son oreille.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           C'est sûrement une pendule, écoute !
                         
          On entend un tic-tac provenant du paquet.
                         
          Patricia met le paquet contre l'oreille de Fernand. D'un seul
          coup, le visage de Fernand s'assombrit. Il arrache le paquet des
          mains de Patricia, puis il se redresse vivement sur son lit, et
          lance le paquet sur la pelouse par la fenêtre ouverte.
                         
          Par la fenêtre, on voit le paquet qui explose sur la pelouse,
          envoyant valdinguer les chaises de jardin, dont certaines se
          cassent en plusieurs morceaux.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
          L'ami de Fernand s'éloigne de sa cachette, revenant vers Théo.
          Derrière lui, près du manoir, on voit la fumée de l'explosion qui
          se dissipe lentement.
                         
          Fondu enchaîné.
                         
          PÉNICHE - BUREAU - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan rapproché sur le verrou de la porte, qui est ouvert. On
          frappe, puis on ouvre la porte. Fernand est debout dans
          l'encadrement, le visage menaçant. Derrière lui, on voit le bar de
          la salle de jeu, et devant le bar, un homme qui nettoie le tapis
          de jeu. Fernand chante, les dents serrées.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Happy birthday to you...
                         
          Raoul regarde Fernand d'un oeil surpris et interrogateur.
                         
           MONSIEUR FERNAND (voix off)
           ... Happy birthday to you...
                         
          Retour sur Fernand qui continue à chanter.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           ... Happy birthday to you-ou-ou, Happy birthday to you...
                         
          Le poing de Fernand se détend, et frappe Raoul.
                         
          Raoul part à reculons en titubant, et s'écroule contre le mur d'en
          face.
                         
          Paul, assis au bureau, ferme précipitamment le coffre-fort. Puis
          il regarde son frère assis par terre. Il se lève, et marche
          lentement vers lui. Il regarde par la porte, qui est restée
          ouverte, la ferme rapidement et tourne le verrou. Il revient
          ensuite vers son frère, toujours assis par terre contre le mur.
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Il est parti.
                         
          Raoul ouvre les yeux et regarde son frère.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Non mais, t'a déjà vu ça ? En pleine paix, il chante, et
           puis crac ! un bourre-pif ! Mais il est complètement fou,
           ce mec.
                         
          Il se lève. Paul se précipite pour l'aider.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Mais moi, les dingues, je les soigne.
                         
          Il se dirige vers un secrétaire, suivi par Paul, qui le soutient.
          Il relève la porte du secrétaire, et la coulisse dans la partie
          supérieur du meuble pour la maintenir ouverte.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Je vais lui faire une ordonnance... et une sévère...
          Il s'assoit sur une chaise, et du secrétaire, il sort un paquet de
          bâtons de dynamite liés ensembles. Sur les bâtons de dynamite, est
          fixé une grenade.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Je vais lui montrer qui c'est Raoul.
                         
          Il prend un tournevis dans le secrétaire.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Aux quatre coins de Paris qu'on va le retrouver, éparpillé
           par petits bouts, façon puzzle.
                         
          Il visse plusieurs vis sur la bombe.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Moi, quand on m'en fait trop, je « correctionne » plus, je
           dynamite, je disperse, je ventile.
                         
          Il jette le tournevis à l'intérieur du secrétaire. Il prend deux
          fils électrique qui sortent de la bombe pour les relier ensemble.
          Une étincelle jaillit. Raoul se recule précipitamment dans les
          bras de son frère
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - CHAMBRE DE FERNAND - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Gros plan sur la porte de l'armoire, que la main de Fernand est en
          train d'ouvrir. Les mains de Fernand fouille dans une pile de
          linge, et en sortent un revolver.
                         
          Fernand est en robe de chambre sombre. Il referme lentement la
          porte de son armoire, et, tout aussi lentement, se dirige vers la
          porte ouverte de sa chambre, le revolver en main. Avant de sortir,
          il s'arrête et écoute longuement. Il met le revolver dans la poche
          de sa robe de chambre, puis sort de la pièce.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
          Façade arrière de la maison. Une petite terrasse étroite court le
          long de la façade. L'éclairage extérieur s'allume.
                         
          Fernand sort lentement par une porte-fenêtre, puis il marche le
          long de la terrasse. Au bout de la terrasse, un petit escalier de
          quelques marches descend vers le parc.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - GARAGE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Par la baie vitrée du garage, on voit Fernand qui marche le long
          de la terrasse.
                         
          Devant la baie vitrée, une étagère encombrée d'objets aussi divers
          qu'hétéroclites, comme on en trouve dans ce genre de local
          (bouteilles de produits d'entretien, outils, etc.)
                         
          Paul, en pardessus, et casquette sur la tête, est caché dans un
          coin sombre. Par la baie vitrée, on voit Fernand rentrer dans la
          maison et fermer la porte-fenêtre. La lumière extérieure du manoir
          s'éteint. Paul se tourne vers son frère. Il soupire, puis
                         CHUCHOTE :
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           On n'aurait pas dû venir.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ta gueule !...
                         
          Derrière Paul, dans la pénombre, Raoul prépare son matériel. Il
          prend une grosse lampe électrique, la pose sur une table et
          l'allume. Il chuchote :
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Assure-toi qu'il s'est recouché !...
                         
          Paul hausse les sourcils, et se dirige vers la porte d'accès
          piétons du garage, qu'il ouvre pour sortir.
                         
          Le capot de la 404 de Fernand est ouvert, et Raoul, penché sur le
          moteur, a sorti sa bombe d'une sacoche en cuir. Il pose la sacoche
          par terre et commence à positionner la bombe dans le moteur. On
          entend un chat qui miaule. Raoul se méprend sur le bruit et pense
          que c'est son frère qui revient.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Alors, y dort, le gros con ? Ben y dormira encore mieux
           quand il aura pris ça dans la gueule !
                         
          Le chat continue à miauler. Appuyé sur les étagères, Fernand
          écoute Raoul tout en se tapotant nerveusement le bras.
                         
           RAOUL VOLFONI (voix off)
           Il entendra chanter les anges, le gugus de Montauban. Je
           vais le renvoyer tout droit à la maison mère, au terminus
           des prétentieux...
                         
          CLINIQUE DUGOINEAU - CHAMBRE DE RAOUL - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Raoul est allongé, en pyjama, sur un lit d'hôpital. Il a un
          pansement sur le nez, une mèche dans une narine, et un coquard sur
          l'oeil. Il maintient en place un linge humide sur son front. Il
          sent une présence dans la pièce et tourne la tête.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Fumier va !
                         
          Paul, en costume gris, est debout près de la fenêtre, un petit
          paquet de gâteaux de pâtissier à la main. Il semble un peu mal à
          son aise.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Ben...
                         
          Il sourit niaisement.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - SALON - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Gros plan sur un journal. En titre de première page : « Énigme
          dans l'affaire du camion incendié ». Et en dessous : « Parmi les
          bouteilles de pastis clandestin, transportées par les fraudeurs,
          certaines contenaient de l'essence » Et en-dessous, une photo du
          camion en train de flamber. A côté de la photo, on voit une partie
          d'un autre titre : « Ben Bella, maître absolu en Algérie », titre
          qui rappelle l'époque au cours de laquelle se déroule le film.
                         
           MONSIEUR FERNAND (lisant le journal en voix off)
           « Énigme dans l'affaire du camion incendié. Parmi les
           bouteilles de pastis clandestin transportées par les
           fraudeurs, certaines contenaient de l'essence ».
                         
          Fernand, en robe de chambre de couleur claire, une cigarette à la
          main, est assis derrière un bureau. Il replie le journal, et le
          pose sur le bureau.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Évidemment, ça brûle mieux.
                         
          Pascal est assis, en face de lui, sur le bord du bureau, et
          Bastien est debout à côté de Pascal.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Oui, mais... Monsieur Fernand, ce que vous avez fait aux
           Volfoni, c'est pas bien !
                         
                          BASTIEN
           C'est surtout pas juste !
                         
          Fernand croise les bras.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Elle est bien belle, celle-là ! Comment ? Ils me flinguent
           à vue, ils me butent Henri...
                         
                          PASCAL
           Justement pas !
                         
          Il fait signe à Bastien de s'expliquer.
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Euh...
          Il ne trouve visiblement pas ses mots, et se tourne vers Pascal.
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Ah ! Tiens, explique, toi !
                         
                          PASCAL
           Monsieur Fernand... Si les Volfoni vous avaient seringué,
           vous et Henri, qui aurait été aux commandes, hein ?
                         
          D'un doigt autoritaire, il désigne Bastien.
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Moi, première gâchette !
                         
          Fernand semble songeur.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et c'était pas toi !...
                         
          Il pose les mains à plat sur le bureau.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Dites-donc...
                         
          Il se lève et contourne le bureau.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Théo, l'ami Fritz là, question mentalité, quelle cote vous
           lui donnez ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Ben, c'est pas du blanc-bleu.
                         
          Fernand marche de long en large dans la pièce.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ça vous ennuierait de faire une petite commission pour
           moi ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Nous, si les Volfoni sont plus dans le tourbillon !
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Présenté comme ça, la chose peut nous séduire !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et ben alors, vous pourriez peut être passer voir Théo à sa
           campagne. Il a sans doute besoin de parler... de causer...
           et à vous qu'il connaît bien, il se confierait peut
           être ?... Hmm ?...
                         
          Fernand est revenu derrière le bureau, sur lequel il récupère sa
          grande tasse de café.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Je ne vois pas de raisons pour qu'il nous fasse des
           cachotteries.
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Je vois pas non plus...
                         
                          PASCAL
           Ou alors, ce serait vraiment le goût de taquiner !

          Pascal et Bastien sont, tous les deux, dans une cabine
          téléphonique, devant un « Taxiphone » à l'ancienne, fonctionnant
          avec des jetons. C'est Pascal qui tient le combiné.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Alors voilà, Monsieur Fernand, on est passé à la
           distillerie. Théo était pas là, on est tombé sur Tomate...
           curieux non ?
                         
           MONSIEUR FERNAND (voix off dans le téléphone)
           Qu'est ce qu'il faisait là ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Mais détendez-vous, Monsieur Fernand, il nous l'a dit ce
           qu'il faisait là.
                         
          Pascal et Bastien éclatent de rire.

          Devant le gros alambic industriel, entouré de vapeur, Tomate est
          allongé par terre.
                         
           THÉO (voix off)
           Pauvre Tomate ! Je le voyais pas s'en aller si vite.
                         
          Théo et son ami sont debout au milieu des étagères de bouteilles
          vides. Ils regardent le cadavre de Tomate.
                         
           L'AMI DE THÉO
           Comme ça, on aura pas à le faire, puisque c'est par lui
           qu'on devait clôturer.
                         
          Théo saisit brutalement son ami par le col de sa veste et le
          secoue.
                         
                          THÉO
           C'est tout ce que t'as trouvé ? Tu comprends que si Tomate
           est descendu, c'est que l'autre branque a compris et que ça
           sera bientôt notre tour.
                         
          Il repousse violemment son ami, qui percute une étagère à
          bouteilles. Les bouteilles tombent et éclatent par terre.
                         
          Théo réfléchit un peu et dit, d'une voix plus calme :
                         
                          THÉO
           Seulement maintenant, on a le droit pour nous.
           L'AMI DE THÉO
           Le droit ?
                         
          Théo sourit.

          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Folace est debout derrière une porte fenêtre. Il regarde dans le
          parc.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Mon cher, nous avons de la visite !
                         
          Fernand, debout derrière lui, sort de la pièce. Folace lève le
          pistolet, qu'il tenait à la main, et tire dans le parc.
                         
          Dans le parc, Freddy, qui était visé par Folace, court se cacher.
          Il tient aussi un pistolet à la main.
                         
          Il rejoint Théo, caché derrière un arbre.
                         
                          FREDDY
           Comme effet de surprise, c'est réussi ! Voilà qu'on se fait
           flinguer...
                         
          Deux coups de feu retentissent. Freddy s'accroupit. Théo lève son
          arme, un pistolet avec un canon très long. Il tire en direction du
          manoir.
                         
          Folace est caché derrière une fenêtre, en train de visser un
          silencieux sur son pistolet. La balle, tirée par Théo, troue l'un
          des carreaux de la fenêtre.
                         
          Dans le parc, Théo tire de nouveau.
                         
          Folace, derrière la fenêtre, tire en direction du parc. Son
          pistolet, maintenant muni d'un silencieux, fait le « plop »

          Caché derrière un arbre, Théo ajuste son tire en reposant le canon
          de son arme sur son avant-bras.
                         
          Folace se cache derrière la fenêtre pour éviter la balle de Théo.

          Une statue sur un socle vole en éclats.
                         
          La statue était posé sur un coffre-fort.
                         
          Jean est accroupi devant le coffre-fort, dont il tourne les
          boutons de combinaison.
                         
          A côté de lui, Fernand brosse, de la main, les débris de plâtre
          sur son veston.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Je te demande pas si tu sais les ouvrir !
                         
          Jean ouvre le coffre. On y voit des liasses de billets de banque
          sur l'étagère supérieure, mais aussi, sur l'étagère centrale, deux
          pistolets. Jean en tend un à Fernand.
                         
                          JEAN
           Je ne demande pas à Monsieur si Monsieur sait s'en servir !
                         
          Pendant que Fernand arme son pistolet, Jean en sort un autre du
          coffre.

          Toutes les armes, sauf celle de Théo, étant munies de silencieux,
          elles font toutes le « plop » caractéristique.
                         
          Toujours derrière sa fenêtre, Folace tire dans le parc.
                         
          Jean entr'ouvre la porte d'entrée, et inspecte le parc.
          Folace, derrière sa fenêtre, tire à nouveau.
                         
          Jean tire depuis la porte d'entrée.
                         
          Caché derrière un arbre, à côté du petit kiosque en bois, Théo
          tire en direction du manoir
                         
          Caché derrière le kiosque, l'ami de Théo tire lui aussi.
                         
          Caché derrière un buisson, Freddy tire deux fois.
                         
          Théo, derrière son arbre, tire à nouveau. Il se retourne, et
          semble très surpris par ce qu'il voit. Il cache son arme derrière
          son dos.
                         
          Marchand calmement dans une allée du parc, canne à la main, Amédée
          Delafoy, le père d'Antoine, se dirige vers le manoir.
                         
          Théo l'observe derrière son arbre.
                         
          Amédée le voit, et lève son chapeau pour le saluer. Il est très
          élégamment vêtu en sombre, avec noeud papillon.
                         
          Théo s'incline vers Amédée en souriant.
                         
          Amédée remet son chapeau et reprend sa marche.
                         
          Théo hausse les épaules, ne comprenant visiblement pas qui peut
          être cet étrange personnage.
                         
          Amédée arrive près du manoir.
                         
          Jean, derrière une fenêtre, le regarde avec surprise.
                         
                          JEAN
           Monsieur attendait quelqu'un ?
          Derrière une autre fenêtre, Fernand regarde aussi Amédée avec
          surprise.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Non...
                         
          Derrière une autre fenêtre, au carreau brisé, Folace aussi observe
          l'arrivant.

          Amédée monte l'escalier qui mène au perron du manoir. Arrivé à la
          porte d'entrée, il appuie sur le bouton de la sonnette.

          Plan rapproché sur la boîte métallique cylindrique, qui sert de
          porte-parapluie. Jean y dépose deux pistolets.
                         
          Jean va vers la porte d'entrée, qu'il ouvre. Il pousse Amédée vers
          l'intérieur du manoir, puis claque la porte. Amédée donne sa canne
          à Jean, et commence à enlever son manteau..
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Voulez-vous m'annoncer auprès de Monsieur Fernand Naudin,
           je vous prie.
                         
                          JEAN
           De la part de qui ?...
                         
          Jean, comprenant que Amédée doit être sourd, hausse la voix.
                         
                          JEAN
           De la part de qui, monsieur ?
                         
          Amédée donne son manteau à Jean.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Quoi, qu'est ce qu'il y a mon ami ? Articulez !
                         
          C'est presque en hurlant que Jean lui demande :
                         
                          JEAN
           De la part de qui, monsieur ?
                         
          Amédée enlève ses gants.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Ah !... De la part du président Delafoy, le père d'Antoine
           Delafoy.
                         
          Il donne son chapeau à Jean, qui sort rapidement du vestibule.
          Amédée, les gants à la main, reste là à contempler le décor, qui
          semble lui plaire.

          Jean entre dans la pièce, portant toujours le manteau, le chapeau
          et la canne d'Amédée. Il entend un coup de feu, et se dirige vers
          la fenêtre.

          Freddy court dans le parc, jusqu'à un piédestal portant une
          vasque, et derrière lequel il se cache.

          Jean fait un signe de tête vers le vestibule.
                         
                          JEAN
           Le président Delafoy !
                         
          Puis il regarde de nouveau par la fenêtre. Derrière lui, Amédée
          entre dans la pièce.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Puisqu'on ne m'annonce pas, je le fais moi-même...
                         
          Il s'avance dans la pièce, la main tendue. Les coups de feu, qu'il
          n'entend visiblement pas, continuent à retentir.
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Président Delafoy...
                         
          Fernand saisit Amédée à bras le corps et l'entraîne dans un coin
          de la pièce. Jean sort de la pièce. Un vase, posé sur une commode,
          éclate sous l'impact d'une balle.
                         
          Fernand et Amédée sont maintenant dans un coin de la pièce près de
          la fenêtre. Fernand tape amicalement sur le bras d'Amédée.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Moi aussi, je suis... je suis absolument ravi de faire
           votre connaissance...
                         
          Fernand le pousse à travers la pièce en lui baissant la tête. Des
          balles traversent le carreau de la fenêtre devant laquelle ils
          viennent de passer.
                         
          Ils arrivent dans un autre coin de la pièce. Fernand éclate d'un
          rire un peu forcé.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Je vois que vous êtes habitué à mener les choses rondement.
           Ce n'est pas pour me déplaire d'ailleurs, j'aime l'action,
           l'initiative. Quand j'étais jeune, je jouais au hockey sur
           gazon...
                         
          Alors qu'Amédée n'entend aucun des coups de feu qui retentissent
          autour de lui, il entend sonner une horloge !
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Ohhh !... Grand Dieu...
                         
          Il s'approche de l'horloge ancienne, posée sur le marbre d'un
          meuble. Il l'examine et la caresse, pendant que, derrière lui,
          Jean est entré dans la pièce et tire par la fenêtre.
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Fin XVIII°, de Ferdinand Berthoud.
                         
          Fernand s'approche doucement de lui. On entend les « plop » du
          pistolet de Jean.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           A moins que ma future belle-fille n'y tienne vraiment, je
           l'échangerais bien contre autre chose. Ohhh !...
                         
          Fernand le prend par les épaules pour l'éloigner de la zone
          dangereuse.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Hein ?...
                         
          Ils arrivent dans un autre coin de la pièce, plus éloigné de la
          fenêtre, d'où retentissent toujours les coups de feu.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Oui... oui, pardonnez-moi, j'anticipe.
          Dans la glace située à côté d'eux, on voit Folace, qui, à son
          tour, tire par la fenêtre. Amédée, lui, a remis ses gants pour
          faire sa demande officielle.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Et bien, Monsieur, j'ai l'honneur de vous demander la main
           de votre nièce Patricia pour mon fils Antoine...
                         
          Il s'incline profondément. Dans la glace, on voit Folace qui fait
          signe à Fernand de se cacher. Fernand fait « oui » de la tête.
          Amédée, qui relève la tête à ce moment-là, prend ce signe comme un
          acquiescement à sa requête.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Ah !... Ce oui est un cri du coeur, je n'en attendais pas
           moins.
                         
          Il prend Fernand dans ses bras. Ils s'éloignent tous les deux,
          serrés l'un contre l'autre, donnant presque l'impression qu'ils
          sont en train de danser ensemble !
                         
          Ils ont atteint un coin apparemment un peu plus tranquille. Amédée
          semble d'humeur joyeuse et Fernand lui sourit.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY

          Jean en fait autant à partir de la porte d'entrée entr'ouverte.
                         
          Théo tire, caché derrière son arbre.
                         
          Son ami tire aussi, caché derrière le kiosque.
          Freddy tire aussi, caché dans un buisson. Il s'aperçoit qu'il n'a
          plus de munition et s'accroupit derrière le buisson pour recharger
          son arme.

          Il s'approche d'une haute plante verte en pot.

          Fernand bafouille un peu.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oui, c'est... c'est le jardinier qui... tue les taupes !...
           Jean !
                         
          Jean apparaît à la porte.
                         
                          JEAN
           Monsieur ?...
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Euh... Voulez-vous lui dire de faire un peu moins de bruit
           s'il vous plaît ?
                         
                          JEAN
           Je vais essayer de lui faire comprendre, Monsieur.
                         
          Jean ressort.
                         
          Amédée regarde quelque chose situé juste derrière Fernand.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Dîtes moi que c'est un héritage, un cadeau, un objet de
           famille, mais ne me dites pas que vous l'avez trouvée à
           Paris, vous me tueriez !
                         
          Fernand, qui n'a pas vu la direction du regard d'Amédée, affiche
          un air un peu ahuri.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Quoi ?
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Ça !...
                         
          Il montre un étrange vase monté sur un trépied.
                         
          Une balle heurte le plafond et fait tomber une partie du plâtre de
          la moulure.
                         
          Amédée reçoit une pluie de plâtre sur la tête.
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Ouh !
                         
          Amédée regarde, avec surprise, son costume sombre couvert de
          plâtre.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Oh ! Mais qu'est-ce que c'est ?
                         
          Fernand et lui lèvent tous les deux les yeux vers le plafond.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Des termites.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Hein ?
                         
          Fernand lui parle, d'une voix forte, directement dans l'oreille,
          tout en lui brossant la veste de la main.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Des termites ! Ça bouffe tout, les termites ! L'ennui de
           ces vieilles demeures où nous avons joué enfants.
                         
          D'autres balles heurtent le plafond.
                         
          Fernand et Amédée se trouvent couverts par un déluge de plâtre.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Ouh !
                         
          Fernand lève les yeux vers le plafond, puis les baisse et regarde
          Amédée avec un sourire un peu crispé.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Sales bêtes !
                         
          Il se passe la main dans les cheveux.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Une voiture se gare devant le perron du manoir. Bastien sort du
          côté conducteur, et Pascal du côté passager. Ils se dirigent vers
          le perron.
                         
          Théo sort de sa cachette derrière son arbre et court vers le
          kiosque.
                         
          Pascal et Bastien escalade l'escalier du perron d'un pas souple et
          rapide. Ils sonnent à la porte.
                         
          Théo contourne le kiosque en courant. Il se cache derrière Freddy.
                         
                          FREDDY
           Les horribles !
                         
          Il se tourne vers Théo.
                         
                          FREDDY
           Séparément, ils sont déjà pas drôles, je suis pas pressé de
           connaître leur numéro de siamois.
                         
          Théo ricane.
                         
          Son ami est toujours caché derrière un arbre, le pistolet à la
          main.
                         
          Théo siffle dans ses doigts.
                         
          Bastien et Pascal, qui sont toujours devant la porte du manoir,
          entendent le sifflet de Théo, et glissent immédiatement la main à
          l'intérieur de leurs vestes.
                         
          L'ami de Théo court vers le kiosque.
                         
          Pascal et Bastien regardent dans la direction d'où venaient le
          sifflet, et retirent lentement leurs mains de l'intérieur de leurs
          vestes. Ils réajustent ensemble leurs cravates, et entrent dans le
          manoir.
                         
          Théo regarde Freddy.
                          THÉO
           Il faut bien admettre qu'exceptionnellement, Dieu n'est pas
           avec nous ! Mais il ne sera pas dit que nous avons sorti le
           matériel pour rien...
                         
          CLINIQUE DUGOINEAU - ENTRÉE PRINCIPALE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Gros plan sur une pancarte au-dessus de la porte de la clinique.
          Il y est écrit : « Clinique Dugoineau ».
                         
          Raoul et Paul sortent de la clinique, manteau sur le bras.
                         
          Une Citroën DS s'approche d'eux. A l'arrière, par la vitre
          ouverte, Théo tire sur eux à la mitraillette. La voiture
          s'éloigne.
                         
          VOITURE DE THÉO - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Freddy est au volant de la DS.
                         
           THÉO (voix off venant du siège arrière)
           Je te dis pas que c'est pas injuste...
                         
          Freddy tourne, en souriant, la tête vers l'arrière du véhicule,
          puis reporte son regard vers la route. L'ami de Théo, assis sur le
          siège passager avant, garde la tête tournée vers l'arrière.
                         
          Théo s'est enfoncé dans son siège. Il semble satisfait de ce qu'il
          vient de faire.
                         
                          THÉO
           ... je t'ai dis que ça soulage !
                         
          CLINIQUE DUGOINEAU - CHAMBRE DE PAUL ET RAOUL - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Raoul et Paul sont allongés sur deux lits voisins, couverts de
          bandages. Raoul a une jambe plâtrée, maintenu en position élevée
          par une poulie fixée au plafond. Paul, lui, a une sorte de tente
          au-dessus du corps, pour éviter tout frottement avec les draps.
                         
          Gros plan sur le visage de Raoul, qui regarde son frère d'un oeil
          mauvais.
                         
          Paul, un thermomètre dans la bouche fait un signe d'impuissance.
          Il retire le thermomètre et s'essuie le nez. Puis il remet le
          thermomètre dans sa bouche.
                         
          Fondu au noir.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - SALON - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Fernand est en grand habit de cérémonie, prêt à assumer son rôle
          de « père de la mariée ». Il porte un col cassé, un gilet gris et
          une cravate lavallière gris clair avec une perle piquée dedans. Le
          tailleur tourne autour de lui.
                         
                          LE TAILLEUR
           Ah parfait, absolument parfait, et pourtant, une jaquette
           c'est difficile à porter !
          Il réajuste la veste sur les épaules de Fernand.
                         
                          LE TAILLEUR
           Et Monsieur la porte à ravir. Monsieur a une morphologie de
           diplomate.
                         
          Le tailleur continue à ajuster la veste sur Fernand, qui semble un
          peu agacé par tous ces tripotages.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Très bien, très bien... soyez assez gentil de m'envoyer
           votre facture le plus vite possible, parce que moi, je
           repars en province après-demain... hein ?
                         
          Il sort du salon, suivi par le tailleur, qui lui brosse la veste
          de la main.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - UN AUTRE SALON - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Antoine, aussi élégant que Fernand, avec en plus un oeillet à la
          boutonnière et une paire de gants à la main, prend la pose à côté
          de Patricia, portant une superbe robe de mariée. Devant eux, un
          petit garçon et une petite fille, eux aussi habillés pour la
          circonstance.
                         
          Le photographe introduit une nouvelle plaque dans un appareil à
          soufflet posé sur un trépied.
                         
                          LE PHOTOGRAPHE
           S'il vous plait... Ne bougeons plus !
                         
          Un flash de lumière jaillit. Le photographe met une autre plaque
          dans son appareil.
                         
                          LE PHOTOGRAPHE
           C'est fini.
          Patricia relève sa robe et se précipite vers Fernand, qui vient
          d'entrer dans la pièce.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Mon oncle, c'est merveilleux...
                         
          Fernand, toujours en habit, est en train de regarder Jean qui
          dispose les cadeaux sur une table.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           ... je n'aurais jamais pensé que nous avions autant d'amis.
                         
          Elle l'embrasse. Fernand sourit.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et nous en avons encore beaucoup plus que tu ne le penses !
                         
          Le photographe vient chercher Patricia.
                         
                          LE PHOTOGRAPHE
           Mademoiselle... S'il vous plait.
          Le photographe entraîne Patricia pour d'autres photos d'elle
          seule, et Antoine rejoint Fernand.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Vous avez l'air exceptionnellement détendu, Oncle Fernand,
           heureux de vivre !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah oui, ça, vous pouvez le dire. Et puis, maintenant que ma
           mission de tuteur est terminée, et croyez moi...
                         
          Il secoue la main pour expliquer sa pensée, puis il entraîne
          Antoine à marcher de long en large dans la pièce. Dans le fond de
          la pièce, on voit Patricia avec les deux enfants, et derrière
          Antoine, le photographe qui la cadre.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et puis... quant aux diverses affaires constituant la dot
           de notre petite Patricia, votre cher papa a accepté de les
           prendre en charge.
                         
          Fernand hésite un peu avant de poursuivre. On le sent sur un sujet
          plutôt épineux.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Elles sont sans doute un petit peu... particulières, mais
           enfin... avec un vice-président du fond monétaire à leurs
           têtes, et ben moi, je pense que tout ira bien !
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Oui, surtout avec papa, il ne comprend rien au passé, rien
           au présent, rien à l'avenir, enfin, rien à la France, rien
           à l'Europe, enfin rien à rien. Mais il comprendrait
           l'incompréhensible... dés qu'il s'agit d'argent.
                         
          Ils rient tous deux de cette boutade.
                         
          Folace, en chemise, la veste à la main, entre dans la pièce, l'air
          soucieux, puis ressort.
                         
          Jean est en train d'examiner les cadeaux de mariage à la loupe.
          Fernand se penche sur lui. Puis il lui donne un coup d'épaule.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           C'est pas du toc,non ?
                         
                          JEAN
           Monsieur Fernand... du vieux Paris.
                         
          Il semble rassuré par cet avis d'un « expert » !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah !...
                         
          On entend la voix de Pascal qui chuchote :
                         
           PASCAL (voix off)
           Monsieur Fernand...
                         
          Jean et Fernand relève la tête.
          Pascal vient d'apparaître derrière la porte de la pièce. Il fait
          signe à Fernand de venir, tout en chuchotant :
                         
                          PASCAL
           Monsieur Fernand.
                         
          Folace, toujours en chemise, apparaît derrière lui. Il pousse
          Pascal hors de la pièce.
                         
          Jean et Fernand se regardent. Fernand se dirige vers la porte.
                         
          Il sort après un dernier regard à Jean.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - VESTIBULE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Fernand sort du salon, et referme la porte derrière lui. Il
          regarde Folace et Pascal, qui ont le regard soucieux.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qu'est-ce qu'y a ?...
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Y a du nouveau : Théo est réapparu, il est à la distillerie
           avec tout son petit monde.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Quoi ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Ils démontent le matériel. On dirait qu'ils vont se faire
           la malle.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et t'es là ?
                         
          Il se dirige vers la porte du salon, qu'il ouvre.
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - UN SALON - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Fernand passe la tête derrière la porte.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Jean ?
                         
          Il lui fait signe de venir.
                         
          Jean a, lui aussi, le regard soucieux. Il se dirige vers la porte.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - VESTIBULE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Fernand s'approche de Pascal.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah bravo !
                         
                          PASCAL
           Mais Bastien monte la garde.
                         
          Fernand lui fait signe de baisser la voix.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Chhht !...
                         
          Il jette un rapide regard vers le salon.
                         
                          PASCAL
           On aurait pu les flinguer sans douleur...
                         
          Jean les rejoint.
                         
                          PASCAL
           ... mais on a pensé que Théo vous revenait de droit. On a
           déjà vu des patrons se vexer.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bon ben... Jean ! Dîtes à mademoiselle que j'ai une course
           urgente à faire et que... et que je rejoindrai le... le
           cortège à l'église... Voilà ! Hein ! Voilà !
                         
                          JEAN
           Pour ce genre de courses, je conseille à Monsieur, si
           Monsieur me permet, de ne pas partir la musette vide.
                         
          Pascal s'énerve un peu.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Oh dis donc, tu m'as déjà vu pas emporter ce qu'il faut, où
           il faut et quand il faut ?
                         
                          JEAN
           Oh excusez-moi, Monsieur Pascal, mais des jours comme
           aujourd'hui, on a plus sa tête.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bon, bon, bon, bon...
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           On y va, allez !...
                         
          Il se dirige vers la porte d'entrée, mais Fernand le retient.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Non, non, non, non. Vous !... vous, à l'église ! Hein ?
           Là !
                         
          Il repousse Folace vers le centre de la pièce, prend ses gants et
          met son haut-de-forme gris sur sa tête. Il ouvre la porte et sort,
          suivi de Pascal. Il claque la porte derrière lui. Folace les
          regarde partir, visiblement très déçu de ne pas participer à cette
          « petite fête » ! Il hausse les épaules.
                         
          Fondu enchaîné.

          Bastien explique la situation à ses complices.
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Ils sont là, j'en ai déjà repéré trois ! Y en a peut-être
           d'autres ?
                         
          Le coffre de la 404 de Fernand est ouvert, et Pascal, un pied sur
          le pare-choc, est en train de préparer les armes. Fernand enlève
                         SA VESTE
                         
                          PASCAL
           Qu'est ce qu'on fait, monsieur Fernand ? On attend qu'ils
           sortent ? On fait un fermé ou un rabat ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           J'ai pas le temps d'attendre, moi, je suis de cérémonie à
           dix heures !
                         
          Il dépose délicatement sa veste sur le siège arrière de la
          voiture, et commence à déboutonner son gilet.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Allez, allons y. Allez.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Bon !
                         
          Il prend un pistolet et se dirige vers les bâtiments. Derrière
          lui, Fernand enlève son gilet, le brosse et le pose sur la
          banquette arrière.
                         
          DISTILLERIE - PREMIER ÉTAGE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Dans la partie du premier étage transformée en « salon », Théo
          étudie des papiers étalés sur un secrétaire, Freddy d'autres
          papiers sur une table. L'ami de Théo entre en courant.
                         
           L'AMI DE THÉO
           Ils arrivent, ils arrivent !
                         
          Théo lui fait signe d'y aller. Puis il fait le même signe à
          Freddy, qui prend un fusil posé sur la table. Théo remplit une
          sacoche de papiers, la ferme, la met sous son bras, prend une
          mitraillette sur un fauteuil et sort du « salon ». Il court vers
          l'escalier, qu'il descend rapidement.
                         
          DISTILLERIE - COUR - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Fernand, qui a toujours son chapeau haut-de-forme sur la tête,
          choisit une arme dans le coffre de la voiture.
                         
           PASCAL (voix off)
           Qu'est ce que je vois là ?
                         
          Bastien a une mitraillette, d'un modèle assez ancien, à la main,
          ce qui n'a pas l'air de plaire à Pascal, qui pointe le doigt sur
          l'arme.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Ça ?
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Hé !... Je l'avais pris en cas qu'il aurait fallu tirer en
           rafale, des fois qu'ils seraient tous sortis d'un coup,
           tatatatata... Hop !
                         
          Il fait mine de mitrailler un groupe de personnes. Pascal lui
          tapote sur la nuque
                         
                          PASCAL
           C'est marrant que t'aies gardé ce côté maquisard...
                         
          Fernand vient de se choisir une arme. Il se tourne vers ses deux
          complices. Il a toujours son chapeau sur la tête.
                         
           PASCAL (voix off)
           ... t'es pas en âge d'arrêter tes momeries ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bon alors, c'est fini, oui ? Puisque je vous dis que je
           suis pressé ! Hein !
                         
          Il va pour s'éloigner, mais il s'aperçoit - enfin ! - qu'il a
          toujours son chapeau sur la tête. Il l'enlève et le pose dans le
          coffre de la voiture.

          L'ami de Théo se faufile entre les casiers à bouteilles, l'arme au
          poing et l'oeil aux aguets. Un coup de feu retentit et une
          bouteille vole en éclats. L'ami de Théo se cache sous une voûte.
          D'autres coups de feu cassent d'autres bouteilles.
                         
          L'ami de Théo se cache dans un couloir voûté.
                         
          Bastien se faufile entre les rangées de bouteilles vides, la
          mitraillette à la main.
                         
          Dans le couloir voûté, l'ami de Théo continue à progresser avec
          précaution.
                         
          Bastien montre, du doigt, à ses complices, où se trouve l'ami de
          Théo.
                         
          L'ami de Théo est accroupi dans le couloir voûté. Il se cache dans
          un coin.
                         
          Caché dans un recoin, Bastien passe la tête dans le couloir voûté.
                         IL CHUCHOTE :
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Pascal ! Hé !
                         
          La tête de Pascal apparaît par une autre ouverture dans le
          couloir. Il tire.
                         
          L'ami de Théo se cache derrière un casier à bouteilles.
                         
          Pascal regarde où il vient de tirer.
                         
          Il a percé un jerrycan d'essence, juste au-dessus de la tête de
          l'ami de Théo. L'essence jaillit par les deux trous percés par les
          impacts de balle.
          Pascal fait signe à Bastien.
                         
          Bastien lance sa cigarette allumée vers l'ami de Théo, puis il se
          cache rapidement.
                         
          Des gerbes de flammes apparaissent dans le couloir, juste à
          l'endroit où était caché l'ami de Théo.
                         
          DISTILLERIE - PREMIER ÉTAGE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Freddy, positionné dans une galerie située au-dessus de la cour,
          tire au fusil par les fenêtres de la galerie, alternativement d'un
          côté puis de l'autre de la galerie. Lorsqu'une balle lui siffle
          aux oreilles, il sort de la galerie, et se met à courir. D'un seul
          coup, il s'arrête net.
                         
          Fernand vient d'apparaitre en haut d'un escalier.
                         
          Freddy lance son fusil en direction de Fernand.
                         
          Fernand se penche pour éviter le projectile.
                         
          Freddy se précipite sur Fernand. Les deux hommes commencent à se
          battre. Freddy donne un violent coup de poing à Fernand, qui
          titube un peu. Freddy attrape Fernand par la chemise, qui se
          déchire dans le dos, puis il essaie de lui enfoncer les doigts
          dans les yeux. Fernand envoie un violent coup de poing dans la
          figure de Freddy, qui titube et s'écroule sur une cloison de
          planches ajourées, qui cède sous son poids. Il tombe, et se relève
          immédiatement, mais Fernand l'attrape, et lui colle un autre coup
          de poing. Freddy titube le long de la galerie, et finit par faire
          voler en éclats la cloison située à l'autre extrémité de la
          galerie. Il tombe par terre.
                         
          Fernand se précipite à sa poursuite dans la galerie, mais
          lorsqu'il arrive dans la pièce où Freddy est tombé, celui-ci
          l'accueille d'un coup de poing. Fernand titube un peu. Freddy va
          pour lui mettre un autre coup de poing, mais Fernand est plus
          rapide, et lui assène un coup de poing très puissant, qui envoie
          Freddy valdinguer contre une cloison de brique qui bouche une
          ancienne ouverture dans le mur de la bâtisse. La cloison cède sous
          le poids de Freddy.
                         
          DISTILLERIE - COUR - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          On voit la cloison qui explose au premier étage, Freddy qui passe
          à travers, puis qui tombe en contrebas. Fernand se penche par
          l'ouverture béante.
                         
          Plus loin, Théo court le long d'une rampe, couvrant sa fuite de
          coups de mitraillette. Il tient toujours sa sacoche sous le bras.
          Il saute de la rampe et se cache derrière un mur. Il pose sa
          sacoche par terre et ramasse une brique. Il lance la brique loin
          de lui.
                         
          Bastien tire à la mitraillette dans la direction de la chute de la
          brique.
                         
          Théo, qui a ramassé sa sacoche, profite de la diversion pour se
          précipiter vers sa DS.
          Pascal apparaît à côté de la rampe et tire au pistolet.
                         
          La DS démarre en trombe.
                         
          Bastien tire à la mitraillette sur la DS, mais la rate.
                         
          Fernand descend le long de la rampe, et saute pour rejoindre
          Pascal. Il semble prêt à courir après Théo, mais Pascal l'arrête.
          Il vient de sortir sa montre-gousset de sa poche, et il la montre
          à Fernand.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Patron !
                         
          Fernand regarde la montre.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oh ! Merde !
                         
          Fernand jette un dernier coup d'oeil vers la DS qui s'éloigne, puis
          commence à brosser son pantalon avec la main. Dans son dos, Pascal
          essaie de camoufler la déchirure de la chemise avec les bretelles.
          Bastien s'approche d'eux.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Avec la jaquette, ça ira.
                         
          Bastien réajuste la cravate de Fernand, qui les regarde tous les
          deux.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ça va ?
                         
          Pascal, de la main, fait signe que tout est parfait.
                         
          EGLISE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
          Sur le perron de l'église, les deux petits enfants, qui avaient
          pris des photos avec Patricia, sont assis sur une marche, et
          rigolent entre eux.
                         
          Antoine est appuyé sur une balustrade et sourit à Patricia, qui
          lui rend son sourire.
                         
          Folace, entouré des frères Volfoni, regarde sa montre.
                         
          Plan d'ensemble du parvis de l'église. Tous les invités discutent
          en attendant patiemment l'oncle de la mariée.
                         
          Jean, pour la première fois sans sa veste blanche, mais en costume
          gris, scrute l'horizon, et semble satisfait.
                         
          La 404 de Fernand arrive devant l'église.
                         
          Jean se détache d'Amédée Delafoy, avec qui il était en grande
          conversation, et se dirige vers la voiture.
                         
          Folace et les Volfoni regardent la voiture. Les cloches sonnent.
          Les trois hommes se dirigent vers l'église.
          Fernand, de nouveau déguisé en « père de la mariée » descend du
          siège passager avant de la voiture. Pascal est au volant, et
          Bastien à l'arrière. Il met son chapeau et rejoint Jean, qui
          venait à sa rencontre. Il lui tape sur l'épaule.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           J'ai eu chaud.
                         
          Sur le chemin de l'église, Fernand croise « le Monocle »,
          autrement dit l'acteur Paul Meurisse, héros d'une célèbre trilogie
          de Georges Lautner, le réalisateur du présent film. Meurisse
          ajuste son monocle et s'incline devant Fernand. Puis il le salue
          et s'éloigne.
                         
          Fernand porte la main à son chapeau pour lui rendre son salut. Il
          se tourne vers Jean, qui, comme lui, semble ne pas comprendre. Les
          deux hommes se dirigent vers l'église.
                         
          La 404 de Fernand, avec Pascal au volant, s'éloigne du parvis de
          l'église.
                         
          EGLISE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Musique d'orgue.
                         
          Deux enfants de choeur entrent dans l'église, suivi d'un prêtre,
          puis de Paticia, qui tient le bras de Fernand. Derrière, les deux
          enfants portent la traîne de la robe de Patricia. Derrière eux,
          tous les invités de la noce, avec en tête, Antoine, qui donne le
          bras à une dame de sa famille.
                         
          Le cortège remonte la nef de l'église.
                         
          Dans le cortège, derrière Amédée Delafoy, viennent Folace à côté
          de Jean, et derrière eux, les frères Volfoni.
                         
          Les deux mariés s'agenouillent sur les prie-dieu qui leurs sont
          réservés.
                         
          EGLISE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          La DS de Théo arrive devant l'église et s'arrête.
                         
          A l'intérieur de la DS, Théo s'installe sur le siège passager
          avant, et prend sa mitraillette en main. Il ouvre la boîte à
          gants, et prend un chargeur neuf qu'il met dans l'arme. Il
          enclenche la première balle dans la chambre de tir.
                         
          EGLISE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Gros plan sur le visage de Patricia, perdue dans ses pensées. Une
          cantatrice commence à chanter un « Gloria ».
                         
          Au premier rang de l'église, agenouillés sur leurs prie-dieu, de
          gauche à droite, Fernand, Folace, Jean, Raoul et Paul. D'un seul
          coup retentit une explosion. Les cinq hommes sursautent. Toute
          l'assemblée des invités de la noce se tourne vers la porte de
          l'église restée ouverte.
          Par cette porte ouverte, on voit Pascal et Bastien courir vers
          l'église. Une deuxième explosion retentit. On aperçoit de la fumée
          près du trottoir du parvis de l'église. En entrant dans l'église,
          les deux hommes ralentissent le pas. Pascal met une pochette
          blanche dans sa poche pectorale, puis il prend de l'eau bénite
          dans la vasque fixée sur le mur de l'église. Il touche la main de
          Bastien pour lui donner de l'eau bénite. Les deux hommes font le
          signe de la croix, puis ils restent respectueusement debout au
          fond de l'église.
                         
          Les cinq « tontons flingueurs » reprennent une contenance sur
          leurs prie-dieu.
                         
          EGLISE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Devant le parvis de l'église, la voiture de Théo est enveloppée de
          flammes. Elle finit de brûler lentement après l'explosion qui l'a
          détruite... avec Théo à l'intérieur !
                         
          La caméra remonte vers le clocher de l'église, où les cloches
          sonnent à toute volée. On entend la sirène des pompiers.
                         
          Le générique de fin commence à défiler en lettres blanche sur le
          clocher de l'église, devant lequel monte la fumée noire de la
          voiture en flammes.
                         
          Fondu au noir. Le générique se poursuit sur un écran noir.

 Revised :
April 30, 1975

PLEASE NOTE THE CRYSTAL WILL BE USED IN THE 
LEFT HAND OF ALL CHARACTERS.








FADE IN:
BEFORE AND DURING  TITLES

1		EXT. - SKY NIGHT											

The moon and stars are visible, but as CAMERA looks down, the SCREEN
fills with dark, billowing clouds. CAMERA moves into the clouds and
just  as they blank out the SCREEN, a distant shimmer of light
becomes visible.  Moving toward it, the shimmer becomes

2		EXT. - DOME OF GLASS - NIGHT

A glowing but not transparent structure stretching off into the
clouds  that press it. CAMERA continues to move in until the
detailed structural  webbing of the dome fills the SCREEN and then
CAMERA MOVES THROUGH IT and  we see

3		EXT. - THE CITY - DAY	

Shining below the dome (which we now see as a series of dome-like
structures standing off without end) -a marvelous crystalline city
of  great openness, building clusters, green plazas, fountains...
multi-leveled  but human scale, crisscrossed by the flickering clear
tubes of the MAZE- CARS.

4		CLOSER ANGLE - ROOFTOPS

As a MAZE-CAR slides softly to a stop.

5		ROOFTOP - THE RUNNER	

The hatch opens and a MAN in a hurry leaves the maze-car and runs
swiftly  along the rooftop and disappears into an open elevator
which instantly  starts to descend.
 
6		INT - RESIDENCE PLAZA - THE ELEVATOR	

From a busy courtyard below we watch the elevator slide down from a
great  height.  As it reaches the courtyard the RUNNER darts out,
pushes into  the crowd.

7 		OUT

8		WITH THE RUNNER

As he reappears around a corner, skirts a brimming pool and makes
for a  kind of broad corridor which seems to lead out of the
courtyard. He is  moving even faster now, glancing back as if he
fears pursuit.

9		ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR						

Above, at the railing of an oval light well, dressed in black and
silver,   a figure holding an odd looking weapon lazily in one hand
-- and watching.  It is FRANCIS.

10		WITH THE RUNNER			

Moving rapidly down the corridor, he suddenly stops as if feeling
the  presence above. He looks up, sees the SANDMAN and his face
breaks in  terror. He wheels, frantic, screaming, runs back into the
hall.

11		THE SANDMAN (FRANCIS)								

Vaulting the rail, dropping lightly to ground level, weapon poised.

12		P.O.V.		

The crowd melting, parting to reveal the Runner backed against the
pool.  People are YELLING, shaking their fists, terribly excited and
fearful.

13		THE SANDMAN			

Emotionless. Aims. Fires.

14		THE RUNNER - CLOSE			

Seeming to burst aflame in the LENS, then slipping BELOW FRAME to
reveal  Francis sauntering forward, holstering his weapon. The crowd
closing in  behind him, applauding, congratulating him.

15		THE SANDMAN		

Arriving at the pool where the body lies, half immersed. He leans
over,  lifts the right hand from the water, revealing a palm with a
black  flowercrystal shape in it. He lets the hand fall back now as
the crowd   CHEERS and APPLAUDS him.

16		EXTREME CLOSE UP - HAND - IN THE WATER - (INSERT)	

Closing in until the crystal fills the SCREEN.

MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

(TITLES END)

17		CLOSE UP - CRYSTAL - (INSERT)		

Clear, sparkling, flower-like. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal


18		INT. - NURSERY CORRIDOR		

The crystal is in the hand of a sleeping INFANT who is behind glass
in  one of many cubicles. Standing outside, looking in, LOGAN, dimly
lit in   the soft glow of the cubicle where the sleeping infant
lies, swaddled and  coccooned in the rosy auto-tender which caters
to the baby's every need.  Faint MUSIC bubbles like distant
laughter.

19		OUT

19X1		LOGAN 			

Logan is twenty-five, strong, virile (yet sensitive) with a kind of
austere grace.

He is somewhat manic...proud...as he peers through the nursery
window  into a kind of foam cocoon which cradles THREE SLEEPING
INFANTS. Logan is  KNOCKING on the soundless glass.

						LOGAN
			Wake up...come on, Logan-6.

19X2		FRANCIS

entering .

						FRANCIS  (shaking	
    					his head in  mild, mocking
	    				disbelief)	
			You are here. I  couldn't 
			believe it when they told me.  
			What are you doing?
	
						LOGAN (still knocking  
	    				on the soundless glass)  
			Turn this way. 
	    				(as one of the infants 
	   				stirs, smiles, bubbles) 
			No,  no...not you...YOU!
	
Francis tries to pull Logan away from the  window, but Logan is
intent on waking one of  the infants.

						FRANCIS               
			You should've seen me take my  
			last Runner...perfect. 
	    				(Logan  continues to pound the  
	     			soundless glass) 
			I backed him  up against a residence 
			pool and  when he terminated...his  
			hand... 
	    				(breaks off as Logan
	    				is paying  no attention)
			So now you've seen him...what's
			the difference awake or asleep?

						LOGAN (to infant)   
			Open your eyes once, idiot.  
					(to Francis) 
			It's not every  day that a Sandman 
			son is  born. I'm telling you, 
			Francis  - that's him!

						FRANCIS    
			Maybe,  maybe not. What's the  
			difference? Come on,  Logan, 
			let's get out of  here before 
			everybody  finds out.

But Logan isn't moving. Francis gets an  idea.

						FRANCIS 
			Okay...you really want to wake 
			him up?

Francis starts to pry at the Panel...knowing it  will sound an
ALARM.

						LOGAN 
			Hey, cut that out !

Too late: There is a SOUND OF ALARM CHIMES. The area in which they
stand  is bathed in a violet glow. Logan grabs Francis firmly and
stops him from  prying at the panel:
 
						LOGAN
			Now you've done it...

The CHIMES STOP...but the glow continues, a metallic VOICE is heard:

						VOICE 
			Break-in scanners report intrusion, 
			identify.

						LOGAN 
			Logan-5...Francis-7, authorized duty
			quadrant. Intrusion accidental.

						VOICE
			Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.

The violet light goes off.


						FRANCIS (with affection:
					to Logan) 
			Had enough?

						LOGAN (looking at the infant)
			Even the alarm didn't wake him.

As Francis starts out:

						LOGAN (one last look; 
					joining Francis)
			All right, Francis...I'm with you.

They move off down the corridor...the lights behind them DIMMING as
they  pass cubicles suffused with soft pink light, CHILDREN
automatically  tended.

CHIMES...soft. A lullaby and a soothing impersonal VOICE.

						VOICE
			Sleep time...go to sleep.
			Sleeping time, little ones.

As they exit Nursery...Logan stops and takes one final look
backward.

						FRANCIS
			You need a lift. Let's go 
			to Arcade and celebrate...
					(teasing tone)
			your alert successor...Logan-6.
 
						LOGAN 
			Has anyone ever broken in to 
			where the babies are?

						FRANCIS 
					(putting a card key into a door 
					which opens soundlessly) 
			Not in my time...

They move through the door which closes.

20		EXT. - MAZE STATION - NIGHT

They are now on a kind of enclosed platform with widely spaced
doorways,  each glowing faintly. They pause, waiting.




						FRANCIS (peering 
					at Logan curiously)
			Why?

						LOGAN 
			just wondered...what happens?

						FRANCIS (shrugs) 
			Dunno...flameout maybe. Whatever 
			happens, you can bet it's final. 
			But who would want to find out?

One of the doorways brightens and the word ARCADE _ appears on it.
The  two men move to the spot as a maze-car stops. They enter it
through the  doorway which dims behind them as the maze-car WHOOSHES
softly off into a  kind of twilight.

21		INT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND FRANCIS

The door slides shut. They sink into seat forms which yield to them.
They   move off.
 
22		EXT. - MAZE- CAR

Moving through the city at terrific speed. Giving us glimpses of the
city  as it goes. slowing finally as we see:

23		THE CITY - FEATURING ARCADE

Brightly lit, garish. We get only a glimpse as the maze-car
disappears  into a tunnel.

24		MAZE-CAR STATION - ARCADE

As the maze-car stops, opens and Logan and Francis exit into   a
gathering  CROWD.

25		FULL SHOT - ARCADE

Glittering, crowded. Throngs of people moving on many levels, some
walking, some on moving platforms. It's The Great White Way, Luna
Park --  you name it. Gaudy booths and entrances, featuring every
delight -- too  much to take in at a glance.

26		WITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS

As they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it
notices them, across halls and up moving platforms, the good-natured
argument continuing...

						LOGAN 
			but you don't know, you Just 
			say what everyone says.  One for 
			one. One for one."

						FRANCIS 
			Well, why no!? That's exactly how
			everything works. How else could 
			the city stay in balance -You have
			a better idea?
 

						LOGAN (laughs)
			No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- 
			instead of doing that "one for one" song 		
			of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher 
			With a stuck tape.

						FRANCIS
			Well the minute you get a better
			idea you can stop wondering.
					(beat)
			You know, Logan -- you wonder 
			a lot. Too much for a Sandman

They are passing the facade of a Relive Shop The signs urging people
to:  RELIVE YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MEMORIES. DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!
REFRESH AND  RENEW ANYTIME!!
 
As they cross the entrance, two men come out, grinning broadly,
falling  into step just ahead of Logan and Francis. Then one of the
men stops  abruptly, almost colliding with them. He mumbles an
apology and starts  back to RELIVE.

As he disappears into the RELIVE SHOP, his friend shrugs cheerfully
to  Logan and Francis and moves on.

27		ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEW YOU

They are moving past a shop called NEW YOU #483 when a man comes
cannonading out, thrilled and excited. He rushes over to a pretty
young  woman who has been eying Logan and Francis, plants himself in
front of  her with his hands framing his face.

						MAN
			Well? How do you like it?

						WOMAN (critically) 
			I don't know. The cheeks maybe...
			look a little -

						MAN 
			Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, 
			you think?

						WOMAN 
			Too little.

						MAN 
			Too little?
					(gestures)
			Too little. Okay, wait for me.

And he darts back into NEW YOU #483. The woman shrugs, glances
around,  smiles and goes off with a passer-by.

28		ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOVE SHOP

Signs promising LOVE, FULFILLMENT, RARE DELIGHTS. People streaming
in and  out. A woman comes out looking glazed, breathing
"yes...yes..." As she  passes CAMERA Logan and Francis emerge from
the crowd and CAMERA moves  with them.

						LOGAN
			Did you ever see Francis-8?

						FRANCIS (shaking his head) 
			I never even visited Nursery before 
			tonight. 
					(beat) 
			When you wonder, it slows you up --
			you know?

They are now passing the facade of HALLUCIMILL where the signs
promise:  LIFT OFF, CRAZY LIFT, SUPER LIFT...here the people going
in are simply  excited but the ones coming out are clearly stoned
out of their minds...

						FRANCIS 
			I don't know what makes you so curious. 
			You have any idea who his seed-mother was?

						LOGAN (quickly) 
			Of course not! I m curious, not sick.
					(laughs)

The crowd is growing denser, funneling into a kind of passageway.
Logan  and Francis are swallowed up in the group.

29		FULL SHOT - ARCADE GREAT HALL

An immense room into which the streams of people coming from the
entertainment area are mingling. There is a general air of
anticipation  stirring the crowd as CAMERA singles out Logan and
Francis entering,  waving to friends. CAMERA closes in on them just
as they reach a  beautiful woman who is obviously pleased to see
Francis. They embrace,  and as they break:

						FRANCIS
			and that's my friend, Logan. 
					(as she acknowledges 
					the introduction)
			We're celebrating his next in line.
			Carousel - Arcade - who knows? 
			Want to come along?

						WOMAN (smiles, shakes her head)
			Only if I make it to the top of
			Carousel.
					(she holds up her hand)
			Thirty -- and the big spin.

In her palm the crystal blinks, red, black. Francis nods, gives her
a  half-squeeze.

						FRANCIS 
			You're thirty -- already? I always 
			thought I was older than you - 
					(beat)
			Well, give it a good try.

						WOMAN (pleasantly) 
			You know I always have.

Another beautiful WOMAN joins them.

						2ND WOMAN (to the first) 
			Sorry I won't be at Carousel tonight. 
			It¹s  my Love-Shop turn.

						WOMAN
			That's all right. Happy turn.

						2ND WOMAN
			You'll renew. I've got a feeling.

 						WOMAN (smiles) 
			So do I...but if I don't at least I'll 
			have the ultimate thrill. I'd almost 
			rather have that than renew.

						2ND WOMAN 
			I feel the same way. Sometimes I think 
			I'm not even going to try and renew when 
			my time comes. But -- that's three years away.
			So long.

The 2nd Woman walks away.

						FRANCIS (after a beat; 
					to first Woman) 
 			It's been nice.

						WOMAN
			Um-huh.

They look briefly and then she turns away. Francis takes Logan's arm
and  they move off.
 
						FRANCIS
			I guess you never had her?

Logan shakes his head.

						FRANCIS
			You missed something special.

						LOGAN
			Well...you can't have them all.

						LOGAN AND FRANCIS 
					(together, it's an old joke)
 			But you can try.

They laugh, but the laughter is broken as a trio of youngsters,
moving  with erratic speed of lightning, smashes between them,
almost knocking  Francis over. He reels, Logan catches him and they
recover in time to see   the trio rip wildly through the crowd,
knocking people down, screaming  with shrill joy as they disappear.

						FRANCIS 
			The damned Yellows are getting out 
			of hand. Those three ought to be in 
			Cathedral. No business scrambling in 
			Arcade...

						LOGAN (laughs 
					cuffs Francis' arm)
			What an old, old man you're getting 
			to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a 
			Yellow? I bet you were even wilder 
			than -
					(he breaks off as the lights 
					in the Great Hall dim) 
			-- come on, Sandman.

The two of them start to move to the far end of the Great Hall.
 
30		FULL SHOT - GREAT HALL

As everyone begins to move to the far end, where great  curtains
have parted to reveal

31		ARCADE GREAT HALL - CAROUSEL ENTRANCE

AC the far end of the hall, where the throng is a huge crystal
design ornaments an entrance  The crystal is red and pulsing
rhythmically to the accompaniment of a deep and thrilling  TONE. As
we move toward it with Logan and Francis, the TONE  deepens, the
great pulse takes on a hypnotic quality...

32		WITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS

In the crowd they overtake a fellow Sandman,  DANIEL, and fall in
step with him. When they  speak now, their voices are hushed.
	
						LOGAN 
			You should have been with us in Nursery,  
			Daniel. I'm positive I  recognized him -

						FRANCIS (hustling
					Logan)
			Come on. I don't want to miss the
			filing-in. There'll be some I know
			tonight, I think...

						DANIEL (glances at his
					own red crystal, nods)
			Yes. Me, too. You know we're
			both on Monitor tonight.
	
						FRANCIS
			Damn! That's right. Just when I
			feel like an ALL OUT BLAST in
			Arcade .
	
						LOGAN
			Want me to take your shift? I'm
			feeling restless anyway
		
Francis glances at him, exchanges a look with Daniel. They vanish
into the throng passing under the great crystal, turn the corner and
we see

33		FULL SHOT - CAROUSEL

framed in a huge corridor we see a steep-sided  arena dropping down
to a shadowy center, which  even now pulsates and flickers in
changing  dimensions, but always maintaining the jewel- flower
shape. There is one entrance into the center -- a kind of ramp from
below the seats, leading directly into the mysterious bowl --	
Just now the seat's are filling, and the sense of expectation builds
People sit and immediately crane their necks, waiting...

34.		ANOTHER ANGLE

Featuring Logan and Francis as they find places in the arena. Like
the others, they crane upward. As they do, Logan gestures at a
number of pretty girls who are just being seated.

						LOGAN 
			Now there's a few who could have been 
			his seed-mother.
	
						FRANCIS 
			Only a few? You're just not trying.

35-36	    OUT

37		PANNING THE CROWD

As the seats fill, the excitement builds. Suddenly the lights begin
to dim and dim...

SOUND: A kind of collective sigh, breathing in unison...

38 		OUT

38X1		ANGLE THE TIER BELOW THE SEATS

Suddenly visible, the LASTDAY GROUP. Their arms are upraised and in
each palm the crystal blinks red-black, red-black.

39		THE CROWD	

Transfixed, gripped with a religious fervor.

40		LASTDAY GROUP	

Hands still raised, filing slowly into the mysterious well of
Carousel.

41		CROWD

Tense, beginning nervous APPLAUSE here and there.

42		CAROUSEL

As the last one enters, beginning to glow and, as it does, the bowl
slowly puts out leaves like some great plant, enfolding and hiding
the people within a series of translucent petals. As the Last one
enfolds them the Light intensifies, the exterior surfaces seeming to
shift as if a kind of motion was beginning inside it...

43		CROWD

Visible in the growing Light from Carousel -gripped with passion and
excitement, APPLAUDING, gesturing as they see

44		CAROUSEL

Moving, bands of light seeming to spiral upward Like a contained
aurora as the Carousel picks up speed.

45		LOGAN

Caught up in it Like the rest.

46		CAROUSEL

Beginning to blur with its own speed. Through the shifting,
spiraling curtain of light we see bodies moving in a kind of
weightlessness, always struggling to move higher.

Follow a shadowy form as it moves, twists through other writhing
shadows -- upward, upward. Suddenly the form is spread-eagled, and
in a moment it is sharply outlined against the swirling canopy and
then -- a searing flash. And it is gone.
		
SOUND: Crowd in a frenzy -- SCREAMING.

47		FULL ANGLE - THE BLEACHER CROWD - FAVORING LOGAN

Standing. SCREAMING their cheers as:

48		FULL SHOT - UP AT CAROUSEL

High, reaching downward out of the shadows beneath the dome,
fringing, intersecting rainbow bands appear, looping the swirling
upper Carousel like Saturn's rings. Now we see figures reaching
outward toward them...reaching and missing and falling -downward
against the curtain and the flash of extinction.

49		MEDIUM ANGLE - A MAN		

At the highest level...straining for the rainbow...

50		SWEEPING PAN SHOT - THE BLEACHER CROWD	

Hysterical...starting to chant...

						CROWD 
			Renew!

The man continues to strain:

						CROWD 
			Renew!

51		CLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN		

Almost a blur...but still straining:
		
						CROWD'S CHANT
			Renew!

52		CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS

						LOGAN AND FRANCIS
					(chanting with the rest) 
			Renew!

53		CLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN		

The blur...but still there...straining with all his might for the
rainbow...

						CROWD'S CHANT 
			Re...

Suddenly, the man...topples into the whirling blackness
below...where he is instantly incinerated.

54		WIDE ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL	

Whirling - whirling - the rainbows shining.

55		WIDE ANGLE - THE BLEACHERS		

Orgiastic pleasure -- a Spanish crowd at a perfect killing --
SCREAMING, fulfilled.

56 		OUT

57		FULL ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL
Other figures move to the topmost level...straining for the rainbow
bands.

58		CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS			

As the SCREAMING goes on in the b.g. of the SHUT... we hear a
BUZZING noise. Logan reaches into a pocket and takes out a small,
dark plastic box.

Logan looks at the box. On it we see:

			MAN: RELIVE STORE 14		
			
					 	LOGAN 
					(to Francis)	
			Looks like I'm working.
		
Francis stands.
		
						LOGAN
			Who invited you?

						FRANCIS
			I'm in my party mood.
		
Logan smiles . . . and the CAMERA PANS them rushing out of the
bleachers.

They make their way into the hall.

Logan takes out the small plastic box. We can tell from his face
that he is disappointed...until a faint BEEPING SOUND emanates from
the box.

Francis watches as Logan wheels in one direction... the beeping
stops. He turns in another direction... again, there is no beeping.

As Logan turns in a third direction...the BEEPING commences.
Logan and Francis move swiftly in that direction and the BEEPING
GROWS LOUDER...AND LOUDER...until Logan and Francis see:

59-
59X11	    WIDE ANGLE - A MAN 		

running.

CHASE: INTER CUT between Logan and Francis following the running man
in the great hall...empty. We can HEAR the CROWD SCREAMING in
Carousel offstage.

A. Logan and Francis separate...to encircle the running man.

B. The running man turns a corner and for a moment Logan cannot see
him.

C. As Logan turns the corner...Francis is on the other side and
FIRES at the running man...JUST MISSING HIM.

D.Francis winks at Logan as he pursues the running man up a ramp
and Logan gets it:  A little cat and mouse is in order.	

(NOTE: THE CHASE WILL BE THE DIRECTOR'S OPTION.)

E. Logan FIRES... just missing the man...Francis FIRES again. . .
just missing, too.

F. The man is in a panic as he continues up the ramp...to various
levels and areas.

G. Both barrels (of Logan and Francis' respective guns) glow again
as they FIRE...with both just missing the running man once more.

H. The man's face is crazed...and sweating...the mouse is going
berserk as he has been chased to a high level.

I. He stands frozen, petrified, driven to the edge of a high balcony
by the shots--teetering now. He is in full sight of Logan, Francis
is across the hall.

J. The Runner¹s face. He looks at death twenty feet away--Logan
aims.

K. Francis, watching, smiling at the perfect moment.

L. Logan's face. A shadow of thought, a hesitation.

M. The Runner lunges. Logan fires, misses.

N. Francis fires a salvo, drives the Runner back to the rail where
he teeters again, throws his hands in front of his face and plunges.
The SCREAMING in Carousel reaches a peak.

59X12-
63X1		    OUT

63X2		WITH LOGAN	

As he arrives at the dead body of the Runner, bends over him, turns
the man's left hand up. We see the flower crystal. Black.
Logan takes out his transceiver.

63X3		INSERT TRANSCEIVER			

A man's face visible. Logan checks it against the face of the dead
man. They are not the same.
	
63X4		ANOTHER ANGLE	

As Francis comes up, waits. Logan moves the transceiver to the dead
man's face, rests it on his forehead.

63X5		INSERT TRANSCEIVER READOUT:

The words appear: IDENT. AFFIRM....NEW YOU #483 ALTERATION

63X6		LOGAN

Scowls for a moment, then shrugs. He takes out a small flat pouch
and methodically strips from the body its few personal things,
stuffs them into the pouch. Then his eye is caught by the man's
right hand, clenched. Logan opens it. A metal ankh on a bit of
chain. It means nothing to Logan who stuffs it into the pouch and
closes it. Now again he fiddles with the transceiver, speaks into it
softly.

						LOGAN
			Runner terminated 0:31
					(a beat)
			Ready for cleanup.

Done with his job, he rises to face Francis.

						LOGAN 
					(smiling)
			That was a great shot you made.
	
						FRANCIS
			Yes.
					(beat)
			But you look a little rusty to me --
			what were you doing, wondering?

Logan shrugs. He's not sure himself. Together they walk off down the
hall, passing CAMERA
	
63X7		ANOTHER ANGLE

We see in the distance, a pair of Stickmen descending into the hall,
riding through the air on their odd vehicles, passing overhead then
descending. One hovers not far away as the other comes down, hangs a
few feet over the body.

63X8		1ST STICKMAN AND BODY	

The driver makes sure he's in position, then presses a button on one
of the arms of the vehicle. There is a broad spray of vapor from the
bottom which covers the corpse.	
					
63X9		CORPSE (INSERT)

It turns to crystals which sag away from the human form, as a sand
sculpture erodes when it's dry.

63X10		1ST STICKMAN CLOSE ON HEAP OF CRYSTALS

Satisfied, he revs his machine and it rises smoothly out of the
SHOT. As it leaves, the second machine moves down and into its
place.
		
63X11		2ND STICKMAN

Glances at the crystals, maneuvers into position, presses his
buttons.
			
63X12		CLOSER ANGLE - THE CRYSTALS, STICKMAN

Sucked up into the machine as it hovers. As the floor is once again
bare, the 2nd Stickman revs slightly and his machine pulls up and
away.
			
63X13		ANOTHER ANGLE	

As the Stickmen move up and out, we see the exhilarated crowd
beginning to pour out of Carousel.

63X14		LOGAN AND FRANCIS - ARCADE

Descending from the top level -- not much of a crowd. Francis is
gesturing toward the Hallucimill.

						FRANCIS 
			...Well I think you're getting stale. 
			You need old Lucey--Go on. Gee the whole 
			burn--try the new psycho-lift-they tell 
			me it turns you inside out...

He shoves Logan in that direction and continues on down.

						FRANCIS 
					(calling after him)
			I'll look for you here when I'm off--

And he is gone.
	
63X15		LOGAN

waves, smiling, then turns to the Hallucimill.

63X16		POV - HALLUCIMILL EXT.

Crazy, man.

63X17		BACK TO LOGAN	

Hesitates, as a COUPLE push past him gleefully on their way. He
looks and we see:
		
63X18		POV - ARCADE, UPPER LEVELS	

The people from Carousel starting to pour in, loud, happy, ready for
more fun.

63X19		LOGAN		
Not with it. He turns and starts making his way downwards towards
the exit.

63X20		LOGAN'S APARTMENT	

As he enters. Idle, restless. He crosses to a sideboard--makes
himself a drink, sips, doesn't like it. Gets rid of it, makes
another. He fiddles with things, a game--sits, gets up. Now he is
beginning to feel the drink. Takes another belt, smiles. Now he goes
over to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials.

63X21		AT THE WALL RECESS		

As Logan dials, blurred and smoky images appear in the recess--a
slow protoplasmic eddying in many colors. He tunes it in and the
figure of a smiling young man appears--bejeweled, lustrous, willing.

63X22		LOGAN AT THE CONSOLE	

Bored as Mastroianni turns the dial again and the young man
dissolves. He dials again and now a beautiful young woman takes
shape. It is Jessica.
		
63X23		JESSICA AND LOGAN

Still in the recess, she makes no gesture of interest, no smile.
Around her neck, from a collar, a dangling ankh. It catches Logan's
eye. He smiles, clicks another dial and she becomes real. He reaches
out a hand and leads her out into the room.

64		LOGAN AND JESSICA

As Jessica turns to him, Logan moves in strongly and embraces her-
but, to his surprise, she resists. Logan, still holding her loosely,
is amused and surprised.

						LOGAN
			What's wrong, Available?

						JESSICA 
					(breaking away gently) 
			Please . . .No.

She backs away, almost apologetically. Logan follows, smiling.

						LOGAN
			Please . . . no ?
					(noting that she looks trapped,
					he understands)
			You mean "not here"--that's it?
			You're a private Available but
			particular,
					(he is moving in on her
					as he speaks, she retreating, 
					which amuses him)
			Don't worry. There's no one here but me. 
			And you.

						JESSICA 
			No. 
					(that stops him) 
			Just no.

						LOGAN 
			You prefer women?

						JESSICA 
			No.

						LOGAN
			Well then...?

						JESSICA
			Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself
			on the circuit. It was a mistake.

						LOGAN 
			Sad? What made you sad?
	
						JESSICA 		
			A friend of mine went on Carousel		
			tonight. Now he's gone.	
		
						LOGAN 
					(after a beat)
			Yes...probably he was renewed?

						JESSICA 
					(flatly)
			He was killed

						LOGAN
			Killed? Why do you use that word?

						JESSICA
			Isn't it right? Isn't that what
			you do? Kill.

						LOGAN
			I never 'killed' anybody in my life.
			Sandmen terminate  Runners
					(a beat)
			Who brought you?

						JESSICA 
			Nobody. I felt sad. .. I put myself
			on the circuit.

						LOGAN
			You felt sad. What's your name?

						JESSICA
			Jessica.

						LOGAN 
					(matter-of-fact)
			You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
	
						JESSICA
			No.
		
						LOGAN
			Later.

						JESSICA
			No.	

						LOGAN
			But you put yourself on the circuit!

						JESSICA
			I thought I had to do something.
		
						LOGAN			
			And?				

						JESSICA
			I changed my mind

						LOGAN
			And now?
	
						JESSICA
			Curious.

						LOGAN
			About what?
							
						JESSICA
			How a Sandman lives.

Logan smiles, takes off gunbelt, etc.

						LOGAN
			Let's have sex.
					(as Jessica shakes her head)
			I thought you were curious.
						
						JESSICA
			Not about that.

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat)
			I'm listening.

						JESSICA
			I'm afraid to tell you.

						LOGAN 
					(smiling)
			I'm not armed.
					(a beat)
			Well?

						JESSICA
			Why is it wrong to run?				

						LOGAN
			You shouldn't even think such things...
					(smiles)
			And you picked a strange person to
			say them to - 
		
						JESSICA
			I suppose. But what if you want
			to live?

						LOGAN
			So? Do what everyone does. Try
			like hell for renewal.

Logan stretches out his right hand. We see a red flower crystal
embedded and centered in his right palm. It is exactly the same
shape that we have seen in black in the palm of the dead runner.

						LOGAN
			When this turns black...that's it.
					(laughs) 
			If for any reason you want to be 31...
			you have the same chance as everyone 
			else...Carrousel.

Logan takes his gun and points it at her.

						LOGAN 		(playfully) 
			But if you're one of the misfits... 
			that's where I come in.

						JESSICA (somewhat
					frightened)
			I didn't say that I would run...
			I Just...

						LOGAN (interrupting;
					turning over her palm)
			Are you a 5 or a 6?
					(we see a green crystal)

						JESSICA
			Six. I go red next year.

						LOGAN
			You're years away . . . I don't know
			why you're thinking of these things,
			much less talking about them.
					(offering Jessica the gun) 
			Want to try?

Jessica shakes her head. Logan looks at Jessica carefully...in an
admiring sexual way...from her toes to her head...briefly noticing
(in the process) chat she is wearing an identical piece of jewelry
that he has taken off the dead runner...around her neck.

						LOGAN
			What Quad do you live in?

						JESSICA 
			K.

						LOGAN (softly)
			You're sure you don't want to try?

Jessica nods.

						LOGAN 	
			It's nice to know you can nod.	

Jessica smiles.

						LOGAN
			It's nice co know you can do that,
			too.
	
Suddenly Francis and two dishevel led young WOMEN burst in and come
laughing toward Logan and Jessica Stoned, hilarious, they crowd
around Logan one of them embracing him. In the wild hilarity,
Jessica slips away and Logan, seeing her go, makes a vain effort
after her. Francis notices, laughs. Amid the noise he shouts to
Logan:
	
						FRANCIS
			These are for me -- you've got your
			own.
					(looking after Jessica)
			She must have been something--?
	
At Logan's expression he roars with laughter Francis picks up an
atomizer and hurls it at the ceiling where it shatters and a great
pink cloud settles over them all.

64X1		EXT. - SAND MAN H.Q.

A frowning structure of dark stone and mirrored copper, fronted by
broad steps. Logan and Francis are climbing the steps as a SANDMAN
is coming out... His uniform is in tatters. They greet one another...then:

						LOGAN
			What happened to you?

						SANDMAN (embarrassed)
			I lost a Runner in Cathedral.

						LOGAN
			How come?

						SANDMAN
			Ran into some Cubs I couldn't manage. 
					(as they stare)
			One of them cut me bad... 
					(extends his arm and moves 
					a finger from his shoulder to 
					his wrist)
			all the way down.
					
						FRANCIS
					(with anger)	
			CUBS!	
		
						SANDMAN (shrug)
			On my way to the New You for repairs.

						LOGAN 
			Get yourself a new face while you're 
			at it They know you now.

They wave. Logan and Francis continue.

64AX1-
64BX1	    OUT
		
64CX1		INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. LOBBY (VOICE OVER)

As Logan and Francis cross, turn into a corridor.
		
						LOGAN
			I just might look in on New You 483
			myself.

						FRANCIS 
			You? Why? You're already beautiful.

						LOGAN 
			No -- it's that last Runner -- someone 
			in 483 was trying to help him.

64X2		INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - READY ROOM

As Logan and Francis cross the room, Logan nods to other Sandmen,
who are monitoring areas of the Megalopolis on video consoles. One
of these Sand-men speaks to Francis who hasn't greeted them

					SANDMAN (Monitor)
			What's with you, Francis?
	
					FRANCIS (touching his
				head; grimacing)
			Last night
		
The other Sandmen, including Logan, smile as Logan and Francis
continue to:

65-68	OUT

69		INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - DEBRIEFING AREA

Black door opens revealing Logan and Francis who now enter a mammoth
room. As they walk. . . they pass FOUR GIANT LIFECLOCKS...WHITE,
YELLOW GREEN AND RED.
 	  
Each LIFECLOCK pulses out the moments of every person alive in the
city, governing everyone's crystal changes automatically shifting to
the next LIFECLOCK when the time comes.

There are no humans.

Francis walks over to a circular table at the end of the room....
above which is a circular overhang. There is a groove...the shape of
a palm crystal on one part of the circular table.

Francis takes out the plastic bag which contains the contents of the
dead Runner's pockets and starts putting the contents on the table.
(These contents are the ones from the Runner Francis has killed at
the beginning of the film.)

The moment the first item touches the table...it activates a scanner
on the overhang above.	
			
Francis stands alongside the table...his attitude is very matter-of
fact. He has been through this procedure many, many times.
He touches his head...(the hangover)...and Logan smiles. Moments
later...the scanner stops...the word:
	|	
			IDENTIFY

appears on a SCREEN. Francis places his palm into the groove. . .
and the words:
	
			CLEAR
			FRANCIS-7

appear on the SCREEN.

						FRANCIS
			See you in the hydrotoner!
		
Logan nods.

Francis exits as Logan places the contents of a plastic bag with the
items he has taken off the Runner who jumped to his death. Among
them is the odd-shaped piece of jewelry.

Logan is standing nonchalantly...as the scanner moves over the
items...waiting to be quickly identified and cleared as Francis was
earlier.

The scanner continues scanning.

Logan starts becoming impatient...but the scanning goes on and on
and on.

Now...Logan is clearly puzzled...it has never...ever taken anything
remotely resembling this length of time.

Suddenly, directly before him...on the SCREEN... the word:

		PROBABILITY

blinks on and off...on and off...catching Logan's attention. As
Logan turns toward the SCREEN...the scanner stops moving. The word
PROBABILITY blinks off and is replaced by the word:
	
		APPROACH

We can tell from Logan's expression as he walks to the corner. . .
that he has never seen this before.
		
Logan sits in a chair in the area facing the SCREEN. There is a
stellar groove (that we have seen on the Table) the shape of a palm
crystal....glowing on an arm of the chair.

The word on the SCREEN is now:

		IDENTIFY

Logan places his right palm with the flower crystal into the groove.
We hear a HUMMING NOISE....then: The piece of jade Jewelry appears
on the SCREEN and below the piece of jewelry the following words
appear on the SCREEN:

		OBJECT OCCURS IN NONRANDOM 
		PATTERN AND FREQUENCY. LINKED 
		WITH OBSOLETE WORD: SANCTUARY. 
		PROBABLE EXISTENCE ESTABLISHED. 
		QUESTION: IDENTIFY OBJECT?

						LOGAN
			Negative. Question: What is it?
	
Words on SCREEN now read:

		PREMILLENNIAL SYMBOL.
		NAME: ANKH. QUESTION:
		IDENTIFY CONCEPT SANCTUARY?

						LOGAN
			Negative.

Words on SCREEN now read:

		SANCTUARY: CODE WORD PREMILL-
		ENNIAL RELIGIONS DENOTING 
		PLACE OF IMMUNITY.

						LOGAN
			I don't understand?

Words on SCREEN now read:

		SANCTUARY NOW MATHEMATICALLY 
		RELATED TO UNACCOUNTED 
		CITIZENS NUMBERING 1056.
			
						LOGAN
			Question:

Word on SCREEN now reads:	

		HOLD
	
It disappears and words on SCREEN now read:

		OBJECT ANKH ASSOCIATED 
		WITH UNACCOUNTED CITIZENS 1056. 
		CONCLUSION SANCTUARY EXISTENT.... 
		RUNNER GOAL.

						LOGAN 
			1056 unaccounted for?!

Word on SCREEN reads:

		CORRECT

						LOGAN
			Impossible!
					(Rising tone) 
			Question: Maybe they weren't all Runners. 
			Maybe most of them reached Life Renewal 
			on Carousel.

Words on SCREEN read:

		NEGATIVE...UNACCOUNTED
		CITIZENS 1056...

						LOGAN 
			Question: None of them reached renewal?

Word on SCREEN reads:

		ZERO

						LOGAN
			But everyone believes that some....

Words on SCREEN read:

		ANSWER: ZERO
		UNACCOUNTED CITIZENS
		NUMBER 1056....LOGAN-
		5 ASSIGNED TO LOCATE
		SANCTUARY AND REPORT....

						LOGAN 
			Question: You mean nobody's ever 
			been renewed?

Words on SCREEN read:

		- - QUESTION ANSWERED....
		ZERO....ECOLOGICAL-NEGATIVE...

As Logan reacts the new words which appear read:	
			
		AUTHORIZATION TO	
		PENETRATE CITY SEALS...

						LOGAN (startled)
			The Seal......
					(Breaks off)
			Question: The Seals? Go outside?!
			But there's nothing outside!

The words on the SCREEN read:

		SANCTUARY DESTRUCT...
		FIND		
		DESTROY

						LOGAN
			I will.
	
The words on the SCREEN read:

		ASSIGNMENT SECRET.

						LOGAN
			Question:
					(a beat)
			What if I need help from another
			Sandman?

The words on the SCREEN read:

		NEGATIVE. REPEAT: ASSIGNMENT 
		SECRET. LOGAN-5 TRANSFER TO 
		RUNNER SEEKING SANCTUARY.
		
Logan takes a breath.

						LOGAN
			Question: I am six Red...how can
			I pretend to be approaching Lastday?

The words on the SCREEN read:

		LIFECLOCK--ALTER

						LOGAN
			My Lifeclock...
					(slightest beat)
			Question: My Life-- 

Before the startled Logan can finish...he feels a shock of pain and
his hand is immobile. Logan stares at the back of his hand as if it
wasn't his. His forehead shines with sweat.

Now the entire area, including the chair and the screen begins to
glow bright red. The glowing becomes so bright that Logan is forced
to close his eyes.

As the glow subsides...Logan looks at his right hand. The red flower
crystal in his palm is blinking. He stares at it, fascinated,
fearful.
			
						LOGAN
			Question:
					(urgent tone)
			Am I still six Red?
			
The words on the SCREEN read:

		LIFECLOCK-ALTER

						LOGAN (standing)
			I know that but I had four more years
				(extending the blinking palm)
			This means ten days to Lastday.
			Of course I will get the four years
			back, won't I?

The words on the SCREEN read:

		TAKE OBJECT WITH YOU

						LOGAN (very urgent) 
			Question: Do I get my four years back?

Too late. The SCREEN is BLANK. For a moment his lips part as if to
say something more but he changes his mind, turns away.

Now Logan walks over to the table and removes the ankh. Almost
automatically, he starts moving his hand toward the groove...but the
SCREEN already has the words:

		CLEAR LOGAN-5

Logan looks at it - then:

The CAMERA PANS Logan out of the mammoth room.... past the GIANT
LIFECLOCKS....where he pauses.... glances at his BLINKING
CRYSTAL....and continues out into:

69X1		INT. - HYDROTONER - DAY	

Spectacularly 23rd century. Logan enters. He looks around and spots
Francis.... in a whirlpool bath....trying to recover from has
incredible hangover.

In the b.g. of the SHOT we can see some Sandmen doing calisthenics.
Logan walks over to Francis....hiding his blinking crystal by
holding his hand against his leg.
						
						FRANCIS
			What the hell took you so long?

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat) 
			Did you ever see anybody renew?

						FRANCIS 
			I think you've been skulling out too 
			much. First Nursery and now stupid 
			questions.

						LOGAN 
			Did you?

						FRANCIS 
			Of course.

						LOGAN 
			Anybody we know?

						FRANCIS 
			Look....why don't you get into the 
			water....you need it....more than I do.

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat) 
			I'm fine....
					(walking away)
			See you....

						FRANCIS 
			At Carousel tonight?

Logan nods, exits. The CAMERA REMAINS on a slightly puzzled FRANCIS
for a moment then FOLLOW Logan out to:

70		EXT. - SANDMAN BUILDING	

Logan is on the steps, irresolute. He looks at his blinking
crystal...moves as if to reenter, changes his mind. Now takes out
the black box, dials.

						LOGAN 
					(into box)
			Location...female Green Six...
			name Jessica...living in Quad K.

71-73 	OUT

73X1		INT. - LOGAN'S APARTMENT	

Logan opens the door to see Jessica. Behind her a young SANDMAN who
has obviously escorted her there.

						YOUNG SANDMAN (smiling)
			She says she's been here before...

						LOGAN
			She has.

Jessica half turns and shrugs a 'see?'. The young Sandman's smile
widens, he waves to Logan and shoves off.

						JESSICA
			You could have called me yourself.

						LOGAN
			But I wasn't sure you'd come.

						JESSICA 
					(the game has started)
			Here I am. 
					(beat)
			Shall I come in?

Logan gestures, leading her inside to the living area.

						LOGAN
			I couldn't get you out of my mind.

						JESSICA
			I'm the most beautiful woman you've
			ever seen, I suppose?

						LOGAN
			Maybe...sure....

						JESSICA
			Thanks...but I have the choice.
				
						LOGAN	
			Of course.		
						
						JESSICA	
			Then it's still no.

Logan laughs.

						JESSICA	
			You can have any woman in the city.				
			What do you really want?				

						LOGAN
			You know

						JESSICA
			I don't believe you. There has to
			be more.

						LOGAN
			All right.

Logan extends his right hand. He turns his right palm so that.
Jessica can see it blinking red.

Jessica gasps for a moment...then:

						JESSICA
			Why show me?

						LOGAN
			I'm going to run.

						JESSICA (after
					reacting)
			Why tell me?

						LOGAN
			You know something.
	
						JESSICA
			About running, dying what?

						LOGAN
			Both...running's what I'm interested
			in.

						JESSICA
			I know what everyone knows. Try
			like hell for Renewal. You have
			the same chance everyone else has.

						LOGAN
			It's different now. Help me.

						JESSICA
			How can I?

Logan takes out the ankh.

						JESSICA
			Where did you get that?

						LOGAN
			A Runner gave it to me.

						JESSICA 	
			And then you killed him, right?				

						LOGAN
			I let him go...believe me.

						JESSICA
			I don't..

						LOGAN (a beat)
			Speak to your friends for me, Jessica...
			please...

						JESSICA
			Please? What friends?

						LOGAN 
				(clutching the ankh, looking 
				at Jessica's; then:)
			I don't have much time.

						JESSICA
			I never heard of a Sandman running
			. . . ever. . .

						LOGAN (putting the
			ankh in his pocket;
			dropping the bombshell)
			And I never heard of Sanctuary.

Jessica reacts. She is about to speak. . .doesn't..

Logan reaches out and touches her hand.

						LOGAN
			What can I do to make you believe me?

Jessica draws her hand away quickly from his touch.

Logan stands and starts out...as Jessica watches him..

74-81	OUT 

82		EXT. - A SLEEK, OUTDOOR RESTAURANT - NIGHT

There are three men and a woman seated at a table. Jessica reaches
the table and sits down.

83		CLOSE ON - LOGAN	

A distance away...watching.

84-85 	OUT	 

86		EXT. - RESTAURANT - FULL ANGLE - THE THREE MEN,
		WOMAN AND JESSICA

Eating without enthusiasm...obviously more interested in their
conversation.

						SECOND MAN 
			He's blinking...so what? Sandmen get 
			old, too.

						FIRST MAN
			But what if he's telling the truth?

						THIRD MAN
			I say no. It's not worth the risk.

						WOMAN
			I absolutely agree. He's killed Runners 
			for a decade. He has no feelings.

						JESSICA
			He was born a Sandman. He had no
			choice.

						WOMAN 
			Neither do we.

87-88 	OUT

88X1		SANDMAN READY ROOM	

Four Sandmen at the consoles. They look up as Francis enters. He 
goes to one of the men who stretches, yawns, gets up.
		
						1ST SANDMAN
			Thanks, Francis.
		
						FRANCIS (taking his
					place at the console)
			Just don't be forever about it like last 
			time.

						1ST SANDMAN
			Ah-h you love it. You're afraid
			you'll miss a really good Run.		

They all laugh. Francis takes up his watch as the other exits.

89 OUT

89X1		EXT - RESTAURANT - THREE MEN A WOMAN AND JESSICA

Leaning together talking in an undertone
			
						SECOND MAN (urgently)	
			If he believes you, he'll come.	
			
						JESSICA	
			Why Arcade Station?
			
						SECOND MAN (impatiently)
			Why? It's our only chance--kill him
			and get away in the crowd heading
			for the evening slaughter --
				
						JESSICA
			Right at the station itself?

						MAN
			No - just there - on the first level.
					(beat)
			Don't look for us. We'll see you.

						WOMAN (cutting in)
			You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.
					(beat)
			Can you do it? Will you?

Slowly, Jessica nods.

						THIRD MAN
			Tonight?

						JESSICA (stalling)
			Y-yes...if I can find him.

						WOMAN
			I think you can. Don't you?

Jessica faces her squarely, nods. The woman looks deeply into her
eyes, relaxes.

						WOMAN  
			I'm sorry. We all are. But he has heard 
			about Sanctuary -- and that makes him 
			dangerous to all of us.

After murmurs of agreement:

						SECOND MAN 
					(staring at Jessica) 
			We're counting on you.

Jessica exits. They look at each other in dismay.. After a moment,
one of the men follows her. They don't trust her.

90-92	OUT

93-94 	OUT

94A1		READY ROOM - FRANCIS	

Obviously enjoying the work, watching--tracking a Runner's progress,
the assignment of a Sandman, the kill.
	
94X1		WITH JESSICA		

Making her way through the strolling crowd, her face thoughtful.

94X2		ANOTHER ANGLE

The man from the restaurant, following.

94X3		GALLERY, SANDMAN RESIDENCE -- JESSICA

Walking slowly up to a door, she hesitates, KNOCKS.

Logan opens the door, reacts.

						LOGAN
			Are you here to help me?
	
						JESSICA
			What do you need?

A moment, then Logan moves toward her hungrily, pulling her in to
him as the door closes.

94X4 	OUT

DISSOLVE TO:
		
94X5		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

Walking along a handsomely landscaped stream. Laughing together,
stopping to admire the beautiful fish (koi).

						JESSICA
			What're you going to do?

						LOGAN
			That's tomorrow.

						JESSICA 
					(turning away slightly)
			I wish I could help you.

						LOGAN 
					(turning her gently back)
			Maybe you'll chink of something...

						JESSICA 
					(hating herself)		
			I wish I knew what you think I know.		

Logan smiles at her, both knowing what's false, but drawn to each
other anyhow. They commence walking again.
		
94X6		ANOTHER ANGLE		

The followers, ahead now, watching, trying to make up their minds as
to whether Jessica is bringing Logan to the ambush. As they argue,
Logan and Jessica approach.

94X7		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA	

						LOGAN
			If you did know, you'd tell me.
					
						JESSICA
			Of course--

						LOGAN (overriding)
			If you trusted me, you'd know.
				
						JESSICA (evading it)
			We're coming to Arcade.
					(beat)	-
			Shall we Relive together?
	
94X8		CLOSE ANGLE

As they pass, Jessica looks full in the face of one of the
followers, looks away. Logan does not notice. The followers are
partly reassured. One of the men is now holding a garrote made from
his necklace. The man who first followed gestures and the others go
off purposefully. He continues after Logan and Jessica as they exit
round a corner.

94X9 	OUT

94AX9	READY ROOM	

As 1st Sandman returns, still cheerfully chewing. Francis is
reluctant to give up his place and when he does, he remains standing
there, watching. He loves the work--they all do.

94X10	ARCADE - LOWER LEVEL	

Logan and Jessica entering. Logan is aware of Jessica's increasing
tension. He pretends unconcern, but he is wary.

94X11	ANOTHER ANGLE

Behind them, visible through the crowd--two of the men we saw
before. The Follower and the man with the garrote. They are moving
so as to intersect with Logan and Jessica where the crowd is
thickest, streams coming together to move to a higher level.

94X12	FEATURING JESSICA	

As they move, fearful--torn between her promise and her feeling for
Logan. Catching a glimpse of the followers, she makes a small sound,
hesitates, pretends to have stumbled.

94X13	THE AMBUSHERS	

Closer now, closing in -- the wire garrote gleaming between the
man's hands.
	
94X14	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Suddenly she stops. He comes round facing as people eddy by them.
Logan looks at her searchingly.

						LOGAN 
			Tell me, Jessica.

Behind him the two men move in. The man with the garrote raises his
hands. One more step... Logan senses something, half-turns just as
we hear a familiar urgent SOUND--the sound of his transceiver.
Behind him the man hesitates, drops his hands. Logan takes the
transceiver from his belt and moves out of the crowd to the side,
Jessica with him. Now he bends to read the message and Jessica
cranes her head to see too.
	
94X15	READY ROOM - FRANCIS AND SANDMEN

As the Runner alarm pulses and the readout flashes its message: 

		RUNNER FEMALE: CATHEDRAL Q-2
		...LOGAN-5

The Sandman at the console turns and says:		

						1ST SANDMAN
			Hey, Logan's got a mean one tonight--
			why don't you--

But Francis is already at the door. A wave and he's gone. The others
ad lib interest-- "watch out in there--they can cut you before you
see them" etc.

95-105 	OUT

105X1	ARCADE STATION - THE AMBUSH	

The two watching, muscles taut -- wondering.

106-
106X1	OUT

106X2	ARCADE - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA	

As he speaks he leads her into the maze-car station and punches out
his destination on the car caller.

						LOGAN
			A Runner...Cathedral. A woman.

106X3	MAZE-CAR STATION ARCADE	

						JESSICA
			You're not going, are you?
		
						LOGAN (a beat)
			Why not? Maybe she'll help me.
			You won't. You'd better stay here.

The maze-car arrives and they move to it.
	
						JESSICA (touching his
					arm)
			I'd rather be with you.
	
						LOGAN (knowing she is
					lying through her teeth)
			That's nice.
		
They enter the car which instantly moves off. As it passes, the men
in ambush come forward and read the destination. They ring for
another car which pulls in immediately.

107-
109X1 	OUT
		
109X2	ANOTHER ANGLE	

As the two jam into the maze-car which rockets off in pursuit...

110-
120 		OUT

121		INT - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND JESSICA - MOVING SHOT

						LOGAN
			Have you ever been through Cathedral?

Jessica shakes her head.

						LOGAN
			They're like beasts. Wild.
	
						JESSICA		
			Maybe they're angry because they're
			grown in meccano-breeders.

						LOGAN (interrupting,
					grimacing) 
			Instead of what? Nine months inside a 
			woman:
					(ugh) 
			We're all raised the same but most of 
			us don't become cubs in Cathedral.

						JESSICA 
			Some people say children need human 
			mothering.

						LOGAN 
			Insane. Nurseries are better than any 
			mother could be.

						JESSICA 
			I'm only telling you what I've heard...
					(slightest beat) 
			Haven't you ever wondered what your 
			seed-mother was Like...?

						LOGAN 
			Uh-uh.

						JESSICA 
			I have.

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat) 
			When did you begin to question Lastday?

						JESSICA 
			I don't remember exactly...except I was 
			a Green.
					(another beat) 
			What would you like to relive, Logan?

						LOGAN (smiling)
			Let's see - how long has it been?

As Jessica turns her head...looking somewhat guilty, the maze-car
slides to a stop.

A warning light pulses on the car's console and a RECORDED VOICE
speaks before the hatch opens.

						VOICE			
			Attention passengers. Cathedral		
			Station is a personal risk area.	
			Persons with business are warned
			to be careful.

121X1	EXT. - MAZE-CAR - CATHEDRAL STATION	

Now the hatch opens. They step out, Logan first, Jessica timidly,
looking around. Behind them the hatch closes, the maze-car sighs
away into the distance.

						JESSICA
			I've never been in this quadrant.
					(looks off)
			Is that Arcade off there?
		
There are standing on the maze-car platform -- a high overlook like
an "elevated" station.
		
121X2	POV - THE CITY BEYOND THE WALLS OF CATHEDRAL

Arcade shining like distant fireworks.

122		EXT. - MAZE-CAR M PLATFORM - CATHEDRAL

Below them a narrow, sharply angled concrete canyon, buttressed
walls rising featureless. The look of an old fortress, blank, dim
and cool. Still visible over an opening the chiseled legend
"Cathedral Plaza--2025 A.D.--Skidmore, Rosenfelt, Hennesy
architects."

Jessica shivers, looking around her. Logan takes her arm and they
descend into the canyon, move toward the wall. Their footsteps the
only SOUND.

						LOGAN 
			Let me go first. Sometimes they're 
			waiting just inside there--to rush 
			you when it opens...

						LOGAN
			Quickly now--

He helps her through the narrow opening--the portal's walls are very
thick.. They turn abruptly and see:

123		INT. - WALL - DAZZLE CHAMBER

A room of angled, reflecting surfaces. At one end a jagged corridor,
also mirrored, leads away. The zigzag, angled effect creates an
absolute confusion of images. but Logan leads her unhesitatingly
across the chamber to the corridor. Jessica hangs back, momentarily
certain she's about to smash into something.

						LOGAN (guiding her) 
			Just follow--no matter how it seems...

						JESSICA (doing her
					best)
			But what is this--why?
	
						LOGAN (as they enter	
					the corridor)	
			The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle 
			there's  no way to catch up. Without the 
			dazzle, they'd just go past us--
					(gesture)
			too fast

						JESSICA
			Muscle? I don't know that one.
	
Logan is leading her down the zigzag corridor. It's stop and go--a
fun house in which you can get hurt.
	
						LOGAN
			It's unauthorized. No good for any-
			one over thirteen anyhow--shakes you
			to pieces--speeds everything up to a
			blur--
					(he is amused)
			you can see what happens when some
			flying Cub tries to go through this
			on muscle--splat!
	
Jessica reacts...to what Logan has said...then:  A moment later:
	
124		ANOTHER ANGLE	

As they approach the end of the corridor, a small FIGURE in a
tattered garment approaches them. She stops SINGING as she sees
Logan and Jessica.

						JESSICA (gently)
			Don't be afraid.

We see that it is a little GIRL of seven. Her face is grimy and hair
is tangled.

						JESSICA
			What's your name?

						MARY
			I'm Mary 2.

						JESSICA
			Where do you live, Mary?

						MARY
			Here.

						JESSICA			
			Why aren't you in Nursery?			

						MARY
			I'm very smart.

						JESSICA
			When do you go up?

						MARY
			I never go upstairs. You're a
			nice old lady.

As soon as she finishes her last sentence, Mary grabs at Jessica's
clothing...tearing a pin (piece of Jewelry) off...and running away
swiftly.

As Jessica instinctively starts after her...Logan... holds her back.

						LOGAN 
					(shaking his head)
			Not here. Might be a decoy.

Cautiously, Logan and Jessica exit from the wall, stepping out into-

125		EXT. - CATHEDRAL ITSELF

An area of rubble and dilapidated buildings.

Logan crouches, holding the transceiver and fanning the area,
listening...

SOUND: a soft beeping which abruptly grows louder and holds steady.

Logan gestures to Jessica to follow him, and moves carefully in the
direction of the BEEPING, quartering occasionally like a hunting
dog. Coming up to an angle of wall, he stops, flicks the sound off,
puts the machine back onto his belt. He gestures to Jessica to stand
still then he straightens, steps out, calls:

						LOGAN
			Runner!

Silence. Jessica involuntarily moves to him and as she does, the
Runner moves from behind an upright and stands.- The figure is
shadowed, the arms out, palms facing in a kind of gesture of
surrender. In the Runner's left hand, the tiny red crystal pulses on
and off. The Runner is a woman!

There is an instant of frozen confrontation and then suddenly
Jessica gasps, grasping at him.	
		
As Logan whirls:	
		
125X1		ANOTHER ANGLE	

Suddenly, from everywhere out of the shadows, a pack of snarling
Cubs materializes--moving with blinding speed. At their appearance
the Runner whirls and races off into the dark shadows. Logan makes a
futile gesture after her, then turns to face the Cubs.

A strutting, feral-faced fourteen or fifteen year old heads the
pack, dressed in fierce-looking tatters and hung with rip-off
trophies. He gestures to one of his followers to stand still.

						BILLY 
					(speaking of the Runner) 
			Don't worry about her. We'll have that 
			one later. Right now I think we've got 
			a Runner and his pairup. And what a Runner!

The CAMERA PANS the other Cubs...mean, filthy.

						A VOICE 
			We're going to have ourselves a time, 
			we are. Right, Billy?!

There is a chilling laughter of agreement from the rest.

						LOGAN		
			I'm a Sandman!		

						BILLY
			I cut up a Sandman yesterday.  They
			said I'd never get him...but I cut
			him up good, I did.

						LOGAN (firm tone)
			I feel sorry for you, boy!

Some murmuring as the pack watches their leader.

						BILLY
			For me? Better feel sorry for your-
			self, Sandman!

						LOGAN
			No, for you! How old are you, Billy?

Billy is silent.

						LOGAN 
			Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running 
			out. How long can you last? A year. Six 
			months?
					(he points to the yellow
					flower in Billy's palm)
			What happens when you're sixteen and
			you go green?

						BILLY (lashing out) 
			Nothing will happen! I make the
			rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say!
			Always have! Always will! I got
			Cathedral and I'll never let go!

						LOGAN 
			No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever 
			heard of a cub with a green flower? 
			You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, 
			when you're on green, because they 
			won't let a green stay here.
					(slightest beat) 
			If you try to stay the young ones will 
			gut-rip you apart!

						BILLY
			Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!

Logan falls back into a fighting crouch...but before he can strike a
blow..he is grabbed and slammed against the wall of an abandoned
building.

						ANOTHER VOICE	
			Let him suck Muscle! That'll shut	
			his mouth! Let's watch him shake		
			himself to death!!
		
We see the Cubs take out drugpads. They squeeze the pads and inhale
the "Muscle." At once their movements become blurringly rapid. They
take menacing positions - some leaping overhead.
			
						A VOICE
			Give him some Muscle!!
		
Like lightning they change positions and flash around Logan and
Jessica
			
126		CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

Watching..terrified.

127		CLOSE ON - LOGAN
	
Being held against the wall by Cubs as:
				
						ANOTHER VOICE
			Shake him to death!!

						A VOICE 
			Kill him!

128		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BILLY
	
moving a drugpad against Logan's face.

Logan is holding his breath...desperately trying not to breathe the
"Muscle" directly from the pad into his system.

						BILLY (chilling laugh) 
			He's trying to hold his breath...

As Billy presses the pad tighter against Logan's face:

With all his might, Logan wrenches his arms loose... drops to the
ground and pulls out his gun.

He fires and fire girdles a pillar...and they start to back away.

						BILLY		
			We can rush him...we can take 	
			can take him	again, we can!!	

The pack hesitates...stops backing away.

						LOGAN 
					(moving the gun slowly 
					back and forth)
			All right! How many of you want this to 
			be Lastday?!

The pack moves back again...and  disperses, leaving Billy facing
Logan alone.

						LOGAN
			Come on, Billy...come on...you cut
			a Sandman, didn't you?!

Logan tucks the gun back into his waist.

						LOGAN
			Come on, Billy...cut me...Come on

After a beat, Billy turns and runs away.

Logan comforts the shivering Jessica for a moment then takes out the
small box from his pocket and turns it...until it starts BEEPING.

The CAMERA PANS Logan and Jessica...following the SOUND.

They move over the rubble...and cautiously around abandoned
buildings.

We HEAR A SCREAM...and HEAR the Cubs who've only obviously found and
attacked someone. The SOUND is coming from a different direction
than where the beeping is coming from.

						LOGAN 
					(shaking his head) 
			They've got someone else! Why would 
			anybody come here?

Jessica shudders as the scream dies abruptly.

The BEEPING is now very loud.

Logan homes in on an abandoned building, enters, crosses swiftly to
a door inside and kicks it down.

We SEE the Runner. The WOMAN cringing, expecting death.

129		FULL SHOT - LOGAN AND THE WOMAN	

frozen for a moment. In f.g. a figure stirs, moves and we see it is
Francis. His weapon is drawn and aimed, but as he watches, he lowers
the barrel and smiles. The is Logan's job.

130		CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

watching

131		LOGAN AND THE WOMAN

						WOMAN (nearing
					hysteria)
			There's been a terrible error! My
			Lifeclock must have broken in some way!
					(rising tone)
			I'm nowhere near thirty...look at
			me...I'm twenty-two. I should be
			green! Did you hear me?
					(shouting)
			Green!

						LOGAN (quietly)
			Don't be afraid--	

Before Logan can continue...the Woman...who is now wild-eyed and
hysterical lunges at Logan...and starts grappling with him.
	
						WOMAN
			I'll kill you!! I'll kill you!!

After Logan pushes her away...and she falls down:

						LOGAN (breathing hard) 
			I'm not going to hurt you.

Slowly, she rises.

Logan takes out the ankh.

						LOGAN 
			Sanctuary? Anything?

Logan reaches into his pocket and takes out a small round
object...the size of a large marble.

						LOGAN	
			If they find you throw this hard	
			enough to break it. Then hold your	
			breath till you get away...It's
			blind gas.

Her reaction is blank, then, with desperate ferocity she attacks
Logan again.

During the course of the struggle, Logan subdues her again.

Jessica enters, bends over the near-crazed Runner as Logan holds
her. Eyeing him, the woman stands and takes the small round
object...she appears somewhat bewildered as Logan and Jessica move
off.
		
132		EXT. - THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ABANDONED BUILDING - 
		MED. ANGLE - FRANCIS WATCHING

He is shocked, unbelieving.
	
133		CLOSE ON FRANCIS

Stunned and uncertain, Francis aims his gun toward Logan and
Jessica...but he wavers...watching them disappear into the rubble... 

134		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

shivering like a wet dog. He turns toward open window.
		
						FRANCIS (in a firm, cold
					tone)
			Runner!
		
The woman turns, staring insanely. Her mouth opens like a fish as:
Francis FIRES his gun. A moment later, as the burning body topples
to the floor;

134X1		MAZE-CAR PLATFORM - THE MEN	

hearing the unmistakable SCREAMING sound of the kill, they exchange
a look.

135		LOGAN AND JESSICA 	

At the flash of FIRE from Francis' gun, they turn.
Logan and Francis' eyes meet. A beat, then Logan grabs Jessica and
pulls her away.

136		FRANCIS 

After a long, long hesitation, takes out his small plastic box and
starts to speak into it:

						FRANCIS (quietly)
			Runner terminated at G.16
			Ready for cleanup at Cathedral
			Quadrant 39.
			
137		ANOTHER ANGLE - OVERLOOKING CATHEDRAL ENTRANCE 

The Second and Third Men...very close to the maze-car platform...
peering into the darkness and seeing Logan and Jessica emerge onto
the maze-car platform. We can tell from the way the two men look at
one another that they believe Logan has fired the shot they have
heard.

They hide from the approaching Logan and Jessica.

						SECOND MAN
			I almost believed her.

They move off soundlessly. Behind them, a maze-car has arrived.

138		MED. - ANGLE - FRANCIS 

Gun in hand...running through Cathedral toward the maze-car
platform.

139		INT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND JESSICA - MOVING SHOT 	

				 		JESSICA
			I'm ashamed. I was bringing you
			to be killed.

						LOGAN
			Where? Sanctuary? Can you take
			me there?	

						JESSICA 
			Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. 
			But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.

						LOGAN (a beat) 
			All right. But why? I didn't kill the 
			Runner.

						JESSICA (interrupting) 
			Yes, but they won't know that...or care. 
			They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, 
			now...

						LOGAN (wry laugh) 
			That's nothing...there's a Sandman
			behind us, too and there'll be
			more soon. Take me to them.

						JESSICA (torn) 
			I - I can't.

						LOGAN
			Then - why don't you leave me - go
			to them - explain

						JESSICA 
			No. Not that either.

Logan considers her. A long BEAT. Thinking, then:

						LOGAN
			All right. New You 483. I'll find
			out myself.

139X1		INT. - SANDMAN READY ROOM - FRANCIS

Distracted...ignoring the greetings of Sandmen who are monitoring
the city.

139X2		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

Walking past the GIANT LIFECLOCKS into the debriefing area.

The scanners begin moving.

Moments later the scanner stops...the word:

		IDENTIFY	

appears on a SCREEN Francis pauses a moment and places his palm into
the groove.

Now he takes out the items of the dead woman Runner and places them
on the scanning table.

An ALARM SOUNDS and the word:

		REJECT

flashes on and off on the SCREEN.

Sandmen come running into the Area.

						SANDMAN
			What happened?!

Francis hesitates....then....quickly, as if changing his mind,
taking the items off the table:	
		
						FRANCIS
			Can you beat it....I've got the damn
			wrong bag.

						SANDMAN 
			You ought to put yourself on reliefcall, 
			Francis.

						FRANCIS (starting out) 
			Yeah....

140		EXT. - NEW YOU #483 - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA	

as they enter NEW YOU #483 they are being watched by:

141		MED. ANGLE - THE SECOND AND THIRD MEN

A safe distance behind.

142		INT. - NEW YOU #483

The waiting room has many mirrors...where customers ...male and
female...are checking their faces (and bodies).

There are also various photographs on the walls... suggestions for
changes to foreheads, eyes, cheeks, lips, etcetera. The chatty
informality is very much like people in a beauty parlor or barber
shop.

There is a RECEPTIONIST seated behind a desk in a corner.

Logan and Jessica walk up to the desk.

The receptionist looks at Logan...ignoring Jessica.

						RECEPTIONIST 
			Hello, Sandman.

						LOGAN 
			Hello.

						RECEPTIONIST 
			Do you want to see Doc?

Logan nods, impatient - he knows someone's watching.

						RECEPTIONIST	
			We don't get many Sandmen. I think
			we've only had one other since I've
			been here.

						LOGAN (brusquely) 
			A Sandman can get as sick of his face 
			as anyone else. Where's the doctor?

						RECEPTIONIST (smiling) 
			I like your face. Would you mind if Doc 
			took a picture? I'd Like him to give 
			your face to somebody else.

						LOGAN
			It's all right with me. Is he here?

						RECEPTIONIST
			My name's Holly...Holly 13. In
			ancient times they said my number
			was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?

						LOGAN
			No - Look, I'm in a hurry.

						HOLLY
			Doc'll be with you soon, Sandman.

Logan and Jessica walk to one of the chairs in the waiting area and
sit down next to an attractive WOMAN.

						WOMAN CUSTOMER 
			Is this your first time?

Logan and Jessica nod.

						WOMAN CUSTOMER (smiling) 
			This is my third...
					(a beat) 
			... I did it when I turned yellow ...
			and green.
					(showing her palm) 
			I turned red yesterday.

						LOGAN (looking) 
			Beautiful work. This man do them all?

						WOMAN CUSTOMER 
			No. But I hear he's terrific. Have you 
			seen any of his work?

						LOGAN	
			Just one. 
		
						HOLLY
			Doc's ready, Sandman.
	
Logan and Jessica stand. They follow Holly into a large, shining,
stainless steel room where we see:
	
143		MED. ANGLE - DOC

who looks about twenty-one years old, exchanges a pointed look with
Jessica. 
	
						DOC
			It's a real privilege, Sandman.

						LOGAN
			Thanks.
					(slightest beat)
			I thought you'd be older. I ex-
			pected a Red.

						DOC (showing his palm;
					the flower crystal is Red)
			I am.

						LOGAN
			Your own work?

						DOC (with pride)
			And I did it myself right on there.

144		FULL - ANGLE - THE SURGICAL APPARATUS

Aesculaptor Mark III -- the latest in servo-surgical designs.
Completely self-contained -- tilt-bed, cryojector services embedded
in the platform. The Mark III's laser heads are integrated into the
whole cocoon, swiveled and gimbaled so as to be able to focus any of
the surgical beams in microscopic delicacy or wide-bladed scraping.

The machine vaguely resembles an enormously complicated x-ray table
on an angle -- the great slotted laser heads overhanging it and
Integral with it. From the cryonic receptor base there is a steady
exhalation of cold -- the vapor seeping steadily downwards, blurring
the endlessly looped and tangled tubes and wires and containers
Which join in solid state circuitry so that any random or
involuntary twitch of a patient will be instantly compensated by an
equivalent move of the laser head -- keeping the focus precise.

At one end -- where the halves of the Mark III join, is n console of
switches and dials -- lights nod servo-recorders which control the	
operation from the first injection of cold to the final healing
vacuum drafts and scar burnishing. With the air of a magician
demonstrating, Doc goes to the console and flips switches. Instantly
the table responds -- the platform tilting, the crab-like laser arms
descending flexing -- small vapor jets oozing as the beams slash
harmlessly across the table. Beaming, Doc turns it off and the whole
apparatus subsides.
	
						DOC
			I designed it myself.
					(slightest beat)
			What'll it be ...a face job or
			a full-body job?

						LOGAN 
			Just the face.

						DOC 
			Fine....Holly will get you ready. 
			You're in good hands, believe me.

Holly comes forward and unbuttons the collar on Logan's tunic.

As Holly brushes her fingertips lightly down Logan's arms:

						DOC 
			Holly works here because she gets a 
			lift out of watching the Table...
					(smiles)
			and other things. I'll be back in a 
			minute.

						HOLLY
			He's going to sterilize himself.

						LOGAN  
			Do I have to undress?

						HOLLY 
			Not for your face.

Logan follows Holly to the Table. (Jessica remains behind with Doc
who speaks to her with soft urgency).

						DOC	
			You shouldn't have brought him here.	

						JESSICA;
			I didn't bring him -- what's
			the difference. He's blinking.
			He wants to run.
		
						DOC
			Run!? He's a Sandman.

						JESSICA
			I tell you he's running. I know.
		
						DOC
			Maybe...Maybe. But I wish he'd
			gone somewhere else.
					(a beat, a shrug)
			All right. He gets a face.
		
144X1		THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN AND HOLLY

Logan lies down.

The Table ripples...accepting his weight prisoning and positioning
him.

						HOLLY
					(leaning - close to 
					Logan) 
			I like dark hair. Have him give you 
			dark hair.

						DOC'S VOICE		
			All set?			
			
						HOLLY
			Um huh. Would you take a picture
			of him, Doc? I'd like you to give
			his face to somebody else.

						DOC 
			Why not?

Doc pushes a button...there is a tiny FLASH.

						DOC
			Do you have anything special in mind?

						LOGAN
			I don't care...Just get it over
			with.

						DOC (smiling) 
			Hurry...hurry...hurry.

						HOLLY (whispering) 
			Dark hair.

						LOGAN
			Holly'd like dark hair.
			
						DOC
			Holly'd like a lot of things.
					(studying Logan's face)
			We can start by narrowing the
			cheekbones.
			
Doc presses buttons on the control board. Jessica, who is standing
next to Doc, is slightly startled as the Table begins to HUM...as a
pair of laser beams separate themselves from the overhead cluster
and extend toward Logan, forming inner cones as they approach.

CryoJector needles start to close in on them, nearing their faces
and shoulders slowly...the visible cold streaming off the points.

A vibrobeam begins to KEEN.

SOUND: An insistent chiming.

Doc hears the sound and turns with the martyred air of a man who's
been called to the phone too many times. He turns to a phone-like
apparatus nearby, shifting the table into neutral as he turns. The
table and the laser heads stop moving.		
					
						DOC 
					(as if speaking on a phone)
			Hello
					(listening)
			Yes
					(listening)
			Yes, they are.
					(listening; his expression
					changing)
			Done.

Doc turns back to the console, pausing to stare intently at Logan,
then up at the brightly smiling Holly. Something in his look
registers, and Holly's smile fades. Now Doc engages the machine
again...

						DOC
			Pay attention, Sandman. I'm
			proud of this machine.

As he speaks he presses and an arm sweeps downward and into position
near Logan's face. It pauses as

						DOC
			With this one there's no waiting
			for scar burnishing. It's all in
			one...watch now...

The laser arm sweeps across Logan's forehead and cheeks, leaving a
bright trail of blood as

						DOC 
			But here's the improvement. Instant 
			healing---before you feel a thing. 
			Watch now...

Doc pushes a special button and the arm sweeps back along the track,
spraying healing fluid. Magically the blood vanishes and the skin is
moist and whole.

144X2		THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN 	

His face tense--he knows something's wrong. Over him Holly's bright
face with its rapt look. She's not sure, but she enjoys whatever's
happening.

144X3		BACK TO DOC 

who is playing the console as he speaks.

						DOC			
			Perfect depth adjustment on this			
			one, Sandman. The beam will cut	
			through that uniform and just
			exactly through the skin beneath--
			absolute precision. Watch now
	
And the machine does its stuff, slashing through Logan's tunic--a
seam of blood following the rip.

						DOC
			Of course, it doesn't mend uniforms,
			Sandman, but otherwise it does
			everything, doesn't it? Just
			imagine what would happen to you
			if the healing stopped functioning.
		
And the arm moves back again, spraying the healing fluid into
Logan's new wound. Again the blood disappears.
		
Suddenly Doc's look is ferocious. He turns off the healing switch
and punches buttons fiercely. The laser arms begin to move wildly
and the SOUNDS become shrill. Holly looks alarmed.

						HOLLY
			No! You're scrambling the table.
			He'll be cut to pieces, Doc.
	
						DOC
			Damn right! It was a trap. They
			know!
	
						LOGAN
			No - I'm Running!

Machine begins to WHINE LOUDLY.

Jessica tries to turn the machine off...Doc starts to wrestle with
her as:

145-145X4		INTERCUT: CLOSE ANGLES - THE CLUSTER ABOVE LOGAN 

Moving.

HOLLY

Watching two stun beams lower.

Doc knocks Jessica down. She is groggy on the floor as

The stun beams lance into Logan's cheeks.

The Table holds him, biting into his right leg below the knee.

146-148		QUICK CUTS OF DOC AND HOLLY	

Watching intently as:
	
149-150		CLOSE ANGLES - LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As surgical beams slit his shirt from the shoulder to the waist
leaving two threads of blood.  A vacu-head dips to suck the blood
away neatly.

151		ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN

As Logan desperately sucks in his belly....trying to flatten himself
into the Table.

152-153	CLOSE ANGLES - LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As laser blades cut into his face....followed by a spray of healing
liquid on the cuts.
	
154		CLOSE - ON HOLLY

Excited....flushed....as:

155		CLOSE - ON LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As two wide blades of light sweep downward....and hover three inches
above his neck....and keep lowering ....HUMMING loudly....and one
inadvertently frees Logan's right arm.

156		CLOSE ON - DOC

Shocked as Logan reaches for his gun.

157		CLOSE - ON LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM.

As dozens of laser beams slash toward Logan....he twists away....and
breaks off....jumping off the Table.

Doc rushes Logan holding what appears to he a frozen police billy.	

In an instant he has knocked Logan's gun away....and as Logan looks
down at it....we see it lying on the floor completely frozen.

Slowly, Doc moves toward Logan the short smoke-colored stick
menacing in his hand.

						LOGAN (out-of-breath)
			What I told you is the....

Abruptly, Doc lunges toward Logan...missing him as Logan ducks away.

As Doc turns to attack....Logan smashes his elbows into Doc's chest
and Doc falls back onto the Table.

157X1	CLOSE ON - HOLLY

SCREAMING, as Doc is slashed by the machine amid showers of sparks
and gouts of steam as the metal twists and wires short out and
various fluids boil and spill onto hot surfaces. Holly tries to
fight her way into the mess to help Doc, but Jessica, recovering,
pulls her down and the two struggle.

157X2	CLOSE ON - DOC

In terror as the laser beams begin to slash him to ribbons.

157X3	LOGAN

Making an effort to stop the machine, pulling levers and pushing
buttons in vain. He sees what's happening, pulls Jessica away from
Holly and, grabbing up his gun and tunic, heads for the entrance.
Crossing the waiting room they are stopped by the sight of:

158-
162XI 	OUT

163		FRANCIS

Entering...gun in hand.

164		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

As they face Francis.

165		FULL ANGLE - FRANCIS LOGAN AND JESSICA

						FRANCIS (frowning)
			What's going on, Logan?!

						LOGAN
			It has nothing to do with you.

						FRANCIS 
					(choking but still loyal)
			What are you talking about?! I saw you 
			let a Runner go? 
					(up a notch)
			I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!

Suddenly the machine behind them erupts into a great burst of smoke
and noise, momentarily drawing Francis' attention. Instantly Logan
jumps him, grabs and throws him sprawling. Without a look back, he
and Jessica run out.

166 		OUT

166X1		FRANCIS

Enraged, finds his gun on the floor and, before rising, gets off a
shot at them as they disappear. Then leaping to his feet, dashing
off in pursuit.

167		ARCADE TRACKING	

Logan and Jessica running through Arcade.
	
167X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Suddenly she pulls him in another direction.

						JESSICA
			Follow me, Logan. Stay close.

As they run into Hallucimill...Francis...never too far behind...
spots them and follows.

168-
173 		OUT

174		EXT. - HALLUCIMILL - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Exiting from the other side...and running through the crowd toward
and into a Love Shop...followed by Francis coming out of the
Hallucimill, too... and running toward the Love Shop.

175		INT. - LOVE SHOP - LOGAN AND JESSICA
	
As they enter the hot darkness. The Love Shop is throbbing with
sexuality. In it, the darkness breaks at Irregular intervals -- when
booths and cubicles flare into brilliance, each time revealing an
orgiastic tableau. The Love Shop is multi-leveled and the random
flashes may appear from any direction at any time, blinding and
stunning the viewer. Logan and Jessica pause to get their bearings
and as they do, a beautiful WANTON grabs Logan, pulling and
laughing:

						WANTON
			I have an empty one, Sandman

Logan tries to pull away, looks around for Jessica just in time to
see a man almost carrying her off.  Then the light is gone again and
Jessica with it.

176		LOGAN AND THE WANTON	

As she tears at his clothing, wrapping herself around him, trying to
pull him down. Then, as the light flares again she suddenly lets go
and grabs another man...Logan is, freed, starts looking for Jessica.

177-
179		SERIES OF SHOTS

Logan hunting through the Love Shop, fighting them off.

INTERCUT SHOTS of the suddenly-illuminated tableaus. Sex, manifold
and multiform -- everybody doing it.

180		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

Entering, starting to look around -- grabbed by one of the laughing
Wantons.

181-182	LOGAN, JESSICA

Brief glimpses of them looking for each other.

183		FRANCIS

Hunting both.

184		WITH LOGAN

As he suddenly collides with a woman -- shoves her away and sees
it's Jessica. Now together they make for an archway where multiple
mirrors enclose them.

Suddenly they are in darkness. Then a heavy door slides open and
Jessica leads Logan through the opening. Behind them the door slides
shut again.
			
185		FRANCIS

Desperately trying to get rid of a woman, sees a flash of Logan and
Jessica far across the room -sees them leave. Then he's pulled down
again as the orgy continues.

186-
186X1 	OUT

186X2	INT. - AN IMMENSE METAL STAIRWAY	

After a moment, Jessica takes Logan's hand and they start down in
the darkness. The SOUNDS of Love Shop still heard from behind the
wall.

						LOGAN
			Are you taking me to them?

						JESSICA 
			Yes.
					(beat)
			I don't know what else to do -- with
			him following us.
					(she hesitates) 
			Why do you keep running from your--

						LOGAN
			Because he's my friend -
					(a beat) 
			and I don't want to be killed by him - 
			or anyone.

						JESSICA 
			He's good, isn't he?

						LOGAN
			Will he find us and kill us?
			Yes...or one of the others.
					(a beat) 
			You know there's only one place 
			to go now...

						 JESSICA (hopelessly) 
			They won't believe us.

						LOGAN	
					(beat)		
			I'd rather take my chances with
			them...than with Francis.

						JESSICA
			They won¹t listen.
			
						LOGAN (interrupting)
			You think Sandmen will?
					(before she can answer)
			There's no other way for me,

						JESSICA 
			We'll convince them.

They pause. He puts his hand over hers. Jessica is silent. Then she
turns his hand over. The crystal blinks red -- on, off.

						JESSICA 
			Yes, Logan.
					(turning to him blindly)
			I'm glad they didn't change your
			face.
	
Logan embraces her, but his look is strange and remote. They
continue down into the darkness.
	
Behind them the SOUNDS of Love Shop die away and only their
footsteps are heard.

187 		OUT
		
187X1	FRANCIS
	
At the mirrored archway, looking around carefully, testing. He knows
they went through somehow. Hands claw at him - he brushes them away
as he searches.

188-200 	OUT

200X1	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA	

They have come to the foot of the stair. Here the flooring shines
wetly in the darkness.

						JESSICA (softly) 
			Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.
					(they walk) 
			Now to the right. It's narrow here, 
			you'll have to get behind me.

						LOGAN (whispering) 
			How will they know we're coming?

						JESSICA (whispering)	
			They're watching us now. They'll	
			let us in when they're sure.	

200X2	CLOSE-UP - LOGAN'S HAND (INSERT)
			
As he fumbles the transceiver switches at his belt, punching out a
signal.

200X3	INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. READY ROOM

As the Sandmen monitoring SEE THE SIGNAL FLASH and move smoothly
into action.

200X4	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Close together, he behind, waiting--alert as a VOICE is suddenly
heard:

						VOICE (scratchy, 
					filtered) 
			Sandman, put your hands on your head. 
					(he does)
			Clasp your fingers together. Now turn 
			your hands over. Palms up. 
					(beat) 
			In a moment a light will shine in your 
			eyes. Walk into it--Jessica first, 
			then you, Sandman. You will have to 
			stoop--but don't unclasp your hands. 
			Do you agree?

Logan nods.

Jessica glances back at him but their faces are unreadable in the
dark. Then suddenly--in front of her--a blindingly bright, narrow
rectangle of light illuminating them fiercely. Jessica moves
forward. Even she has to stoop. Logan is close behind. As he bends
awkwardly into the opening, the light goes out.

201		LOGAN, JESSICA -- SANCTUARY HQ

As he pushes her through the opening then moves instantly to the
side, pulling her with him.. The move fails. Both are pinned
helplessly in the blinding glare of the spotlight and the sudden
appearance of glass-silver spear points pressed against them. Logan
is unable to draw his gun.

						VOICE
			Hold still, Sandman, or die where
			you are.

						2ND VOICE
			Is she the one?
	
						OTHER VOICES (like angry
					stage whispers)
			She betrayed us. Kill him. Kill them both.
			Jessica you sold us. Sandman butcher.
			Sandman murderer.

Logan and Jessica stand rigid against the spear points, only their
heads turning to the echoing sibilants.. The spotlight goes off.

202-204 	OUT

205		INT. - SANCTUARY HQ. - LOGAN, JESSICA - CLOSE	

In the darkness we see the glass-silver spear points are glowing all
around them, the long shafts falling away into darkness, the points,
steaming gently when they touch--making an instant, wincing burn.
Logan moves--a spear point presses--he flinches.

						LOGAN 
			I'm a runner. She brought me here because 
			I begged her to help me.

He turns his palm. The red crystal blinks impressively in the
darkness.

At the sight, a BABBLE of SOUNDS. Argument.

						VOICE
			He's lying. No Sandman ever ran.

						2ND VOICE
			You don't run. You kill runners.
			You have killed runners all your life.	-

						LOGAN	
			Yes I have.		
					(beat)	
			Now it's my turn. And I want to
			live.

Another angry murmur of VOICES. Over it Jessica suddenly:

						JESSICA (shouting) 
			What's the matter with you. He's a runner--
			he's blinking. We must help anyone who 
			asks...we must-or we're the same as they 
			are--deciding who lives and dies.

One of the points lifts and touches Jessica's cheek. A quick, fierce
burn. She shrieks--a tiny sound--and is silent.

206		LOGAN	

Reacts fiercely, spinning against the spear points, he is Jabbed and
pierced in a dozen places as he manages to get Jessica closer,
shielding her with his body. But the spear points are too much. He
subsides, as VOICES rise angrily "Kill him now".

Suddenly a RINGING ALARM. All sound stops at once and we hear a
CLATTER of FOOTSTEPS down the iron stair and across the outer floor.
The spotlight bursts on again and a figure staggers into the
chamber, straightening into the light, hair dishevelled, hands in
front against the glare. It's Holly.

						HOLLY 
			Holly. Holly, New You 483... He's dead. 
			Doc's dead and the Sandmen came...

						VOICE (gentle)
			Holly--Holly. Remember the code.
			The code, please Holly...

						HOLLY (hysteria)	
			They smashed everything and I barely
			got away.
					(beat)
			Holly. Station 12, Sanctuary 7.
			Holly. Holly...

She lowers her hands and we see her, tattered, frightened--the
bright smile strange. She comes to herself a bit, looks to the side
and sees Logan and Jessica, pinned against the wall.

She reacts with fear at the sight.	
			
						HOLLY	
			It's him! The first Sandman. He
			killed...Doc.

						JESSICA
			No, Holly--wait! He's running.
			Tell them the rest!
	
						HOLLY (suddenly
					exhausted)
			He's the one. You too. I remember.
			He was in a hurry. Just a face job.
			Dark hair, I said. Then he killed
			Doc and you grabbed me--and the
			machine blew up and I ran...I ran
	
	 					JESSICA
			Holly. Holly! Please...The other
			Sandman. Remember the one who came
			after--

Holly suddenly remembers and the shock makes her lucid.

						HOLLY (pouring 
					it out) 
			That's right. The other one came after. 
			The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!

						JESSICA (coaching
					desperately) 
			...and he was hunting the first one, 
			this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This 
			one was running, the other one was 
			hunting him...

						HOLLY (remembers)
			Yes. Oh yes.
					(to Logan) 
			He was after you. I remember. You're 
			running!

207-208 	OUT

208X1	ANOTHER ANGLE 1

The spear points are withdrawn. Logan and Jessica relieved but
shaken, wary.

						LOGAN 
			May we move?

A long beat. Then--

						VOICE
			I saw we pass them through.			
			Somebody help Holly.	

Other VOICES mumble agreement. Holly moves off into the dark room,
hands reaching out to help her.

						VOICE 
			You two. Just go straight ahead. 
			Follow the corridors with the pipes 
			overhead to the end. Then use the key.

As the voice speaks the spotlight finally goes off and by a dim glow
around the perimeter, we see we're in some kind of large underground
chamber--some part of the vast undercellars of the city. The light
is enough to reveal that there are perhaps twenty people in the
room, reds and greens both--but all are silhouetted, no face seen.
There's a kind of aisle open down the room's center and it's
obviously the way they are to go. Logan and Jessica move off. Logan
pauses.

						LOGAN
			I don't know who you are. I'd
			like to thank someone.

						VOICE 
			It doesn't matter who we are. Follow 
			the tunnel to the end.

						LOGAN
			I Will there be someone to tell us
			where to go from there...?

A murmur of discussion then:

						VOICE 
			Someone will follow. When you come to 
			the lock, he will tell you how Co go 
			on the other side. Jessica may go with 
			you as far as the lock.

						LOGAN 
					(a deep breath) 
			No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back. 
					(suddenly his tone is 
					urgent as he speaks to her) 
			Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.

She is bewildered by the change.

						JESSICA
			Why?- No...no...I'm going with you.

						VOICE1
			Only to the lock. After that 
			there's no way back. 

						JESSICA (small voice) 
			I don't care. I'm going to Sanctuary. 
			With you.

A BABBLE of VOICES. "Impossible"...She ignores, watches Logan.
			
						JESSICA (cont'd)
			Will you take me with you?

						LOGAN
			Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
			
JESSICA shakes her head. She doesn't know why.

Logan puts his arm around her, marveling, trying to understand,
moved. But suddenly he remembers the urgency of the moment. He
wheels, pulling her with him.
			
						LOGAN
			Come on then--they'll be here any
			minute!

Uncomprehending, she starts to run with him. Too late. An EXPLOSION
shakes the chamber--the wall bellies inward and a group of Sandmen,
led by Francis, burst into the room, firing as they come.
			
Panic. Turmoil. PEOPLE running, SCREAMING--the ALARM BELL RINGING,
RINGING as Sandmen methodically slaughter the people in the wreckage
of the room.

209 		OUT

209X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA 	

As the brief, one-sided battle rages, echoing SHOTS and SCREAMS in
the dust filled room, Logan pulls her down out of the way. They
watch, helplessly. Suddenly the figure of a Sandman looms before
them. He stares at Logan, unsure. Logan reacts, draws, fires. The
Sandman is smashed away, burning.

209X2	LOGAN 

Suddenly aware that he has killed a Sandman. Jessica pulls him down
again into the shadow. Neither realizes chat the soft pulsing of his
crystal can be seen from the room.

210		ANOTHER ANGLE

Francis, quartering the room like a hound, searching, searching,
stopping as he sees

211		FRANCIS P.O.V.
	
The crystal blinking red, eerie in the darkness.

						FRANCIS 
					(believing the	
					blinking crystal is Jessica's)	
			Logan. I know you're in here. 
 			What've you done...gone crazy over a 
			Runner?
					(whispering) 
			Nobody knows except me. You know I 
			won't say anything. I should have 
			turned you in but I couldn't. Leave 
			her. Come on out with me. It'll look 
			like you're part of the group that 
			hit this nest.
					(pleading) 
			Logan...you're a Sandman!
					(slightest beat)
			Logan...now...now...Logan...

After the slightest beat, Logan FIRES and Francis falls, a great
chunk of the cave roof falling between him and Logan -- all vision
obscured while EXPLOSIONS and SCREAMS continue.

212		LOGAN AND JESSICA

As he pulls her shakily to her feet. She nods, she's okay. He leads
her off down the tunnel.

213		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - TUNNEL

following the tracks. The way leads down, curves, recurves, but
always down.

214		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOCK
	
As Logan and Jessica rush toward it. The corridor has widened into a
kind of chamber which ends in a great metal door like an immense
submarine hatch.

The tracks run straight to it and beneath it. The base of the door 
tands in a couple of inches of water.
	
With great urgency, Logan and Jessica examine the huge door. Logan
gives the wheel a tug...nothing.

SOUND: A WHIRRING like clockwork...A METALLIC BELL SOUND and then a
RECORDED VOICE.

						VOICE	
			Runner, this is the last gate. Use			
			your key now. When the Bell sounds			
			again...use your key. Good luck,
			Runner. May you find Sanctuary.

SILENCE. Then the BELL CHIME SOUND and a light illumines the center
of the wheel where there's a kind of keyhole. The WHIRRING continues
for about ten seconds. Then it stops	and the light goes out.

214X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Hearing a SOUND they turn and see:
	
214X2	ANOTHER ANGLE - P.O.V.

Far behind them, in the wet glisten of the tunnel, a bobbing light
and shadow -- the SOUND of RUNNING

215-216	CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND JESSICA

As Jessica takes the ankh from her neck - fumbling with the chain.

						JESSICA (breathlessly) 
			Every key only works once...and only 
			a Lastday key must open this door.... 
			They said it would fit - but....

She tries to fit the ankh into the glowing one, but her hand shakes.
Logan tries to steady her - and in helping, she drops it into the
dark pool of water. They fall to their knees, searching desperately.
Then Logan remembers.

						LOGAN 
			Wait - I have the one I took from 
			the Runner.

SOUND: The same as before as Logan searches his pockets for the
Runner's ankh.

Logan finds it just as the WHIRRING SOUND has STOPPED again...and
the light has gone out again in the center of the wheel.

As Logan and Jessica wait for the sound, etcetera to repeat again
another TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION is heard rocking everything.  In the
distance, Jessica can see the shadow of a FIGURE approaching.

As the SOUND, etcetera, repeat-s once more...Logan pushes the ankh
into the lighted center of the wheel. The ankh fuses and the lighted
center becomes brighter as the door opens.

There is a hesitation...in which Logan turning his head back...
realizes what he has done and is shaken.

As the shadowed FIGURE looms LARGER:

						JESSICA
			There's no turning back, is there?

Logan turns and pushes Jessica through the door... following her...
as the door closes and they are:

217		ON THE OTHER SIDE	

now, they can still hear the SOUND, etcetera for the last time.

Beyond the lock is the ruins of a vast undersea complex in which
food was raised and harvested. What we see is an endless shadowy
labyrinth of breeding pens which stretch off into the green darkness
-- a kind of mammoth aquarium with catwalks and ramps intersecting
the huge tanks. The levels are multiple and everything is slimed,
rusted, rotted and wet.

In the tanks themselves are shoals of fish, gardens of seaweed, etc.
The machinery for harvesting and winnowing has long since gone to
rust -- and visible in the great tanks are the wrecks of vessels and
gear -- the kind of stuff Cousteau and Co. are using now.

Footing is dangerous -- a slip from any catwalk means a plunge into
water and some of the walkways are well under water anyhow. From an
invisible ceiling comes a steady dripping and everything is crusted
and smells of salt and decay and life in the darkness.

217X1	WITH FRANCIS	

As he arrives at the door, the ankh glowing as before.

But Francis has a light. He examines the door with it, and as it
lights the pool of water on the ground, it picks out Jessica's ankh.
FRANCIS stoops, gets it and looks from it to the one glowing
	
128		LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Bewildered -- uncertain, as their eyes adjust to the dim light.
Finally, Logan gestures ''this way" and sets out.

(NOTE: The action of the sequence is the action of people groping
through a labyrinth. They go along, gripping a rail where possible,
sometimes sinking deep into water, sometimes rising above it. They
run into blind endings and retrace to the last junction -- always
trying for what looks driest and seems to stretch farthest along the
great wall...)

219-224	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - SERIES OF CUTS	

A. Making their way along the walkway side by side.

B. Stopping as the walkway disappears under water. Logan wading in
while she waits -- until he re-emerges. She follows.	

C. Choosing between diverging ramps. Having to return.

						JESSICA
			How do we know this is the right
			way?

						LOGAN
			It's the only way.
			
D. POV an alley way full of machinery. Logan gives a wheel a half
turn -- great rusty net-combs start to winnow the water.

E. Helping Jessica, Logan slips...falls into darkness. Jessica's
fear until he emerges, hand over slimy hand. The water is cold.

F. POV ancient signs - PROTOPLANK...DEPOT NO #11 DO NOT DECANT...
HABITAT MARITIME...ETC.

They speculate.

						JESSICA
			What do you suppose this was...?

						LOGAN
			Some kind of breeding pens...I
			suppose...They say people used
			to breed animal s, fish, anything
					(at her disbelieving look)
			To eat, of course.
			
						JESSICA
			Ycch.
					(shudders)
			To kill things and then eat them.
			It must have been a savage world.
			
Logan shrugs, but the idea makes him queasy, too.
			
G. They stop, tired. Peer through at the wreckage of a small
inspection vessel and suddenly hear:

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS, coming, halting, WATER sloshing. Steps again.

225		POV - THROUGH THE MAZE OF TANKS - A LIGHT	

moving, hunting.

						LOGAN (alert)	
			Stay here, while I see what it is.	

Jessica nods, frightened. Logan slips off into the darkness. In a
moment he's back. His face - is grim.

						JESSICA
			It's Francis, isn't it?

He nods.

226		LOGAN AND JESSICA

Trying to move faster now, Logan makes a wrong turning and they must
go back. But as they do so, Francis is ever closer -- a gigantic
distorted SHAPE now visible through the eerie glass -then suddenly
seeming small and distant.

As they emerge from the blind alley once again close to the wall,
suddenly:

227		FRANCIS

looming huge, gun drawn, apparently only a few feet away.

228		LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Logan desperately claws at machinery, succeeds in starting motion,
somewhere what sounds like a GENERATOR begins laboring, ancient
machinery GROANS.
		
They turn and run as they HEAR:
	
						FRANCIS (distorted;
					echo; etcetera)
			LOGAN N N N.
		
229		POV - FRANCIS' LIGHT

is splashing the walls ahead and in it they suddenly see:

THE DOOR -- a waterlock with a wheel. As the light passes, Logan
heaves desperately on it. It starts to give as the light comes back
and they are revealed.

230		CLOSE - ON FRANCIS

aiming at Logan...then slowly moving his hand until Jessica is in
his sights.

231		LOGAN - JESSICA - FRANCIS 

Francis FIRES -- tremendous SOUND, ECHOING and RESOUNDING. One of
the great tanks buckles and a cascade of water erupts over
everything. Through it, Logan manages to get the door open and
pushes a half-drowning Jessica through.

232		INT. - THE SHAFT 	

A sort of ancient freight elevator which commences to move groaning
when the waterlock door closes.
		
Logan slumps to the floor.

233		INT. - SHAFT - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA 

Moving at an extremely high speed...We can see the outside -
flickering - dark, light, - dark, light... and finally to a white
color. They lie slumped, motionless. Finally it stops. The door
opens into a kind of glistening darkness, suffused by a bluish glow.
It is now very cold.

In the silence Logan stirs. Groping, he touches Jessica, who moves
close to him. Logan puts his arm around her and they rise. Slowly,
tentatively, he leads her out into the dark chamber where they stand
for a moment trying to find themselves. What little light there is
seems to come from the left. Arm around Jessica, Logan starts to
move.

						JESSICA (whispering) 
			I'm afraid.

						LOGAN	
			It's brighter there...besides, we
			can't go back.

He starts to move again but Jessica hangs back.

						JESSICA 
			Wait.

He halts.

						JESSICA (cont'd)	
			I don't know what's going to happen	
			to us Logan but --	
					(a beat)
			Are you glad you didn't kill him?

						LOGAN 
			It doesn't make any difference anymore.

						JESSICA 
			You're really one of us now, aren't you?

						LOGAN 
			You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?
					(Jessica nods)
			Why did you stay with me?

						JESSICA (feelingly) 
			I wanted to...
				(Logan puts his arms
				around her) 
			...And you...what made you kill Sandmen?

						LOGAN
			I had to. I did kill...for the
			first time in my life I killed.

						JESSICA 
			Because you felt like a Runner, 
			didn't you.

						LOGAN 
			I guess so...I know I felt something 
			I never felt before...and I didn't 
			like it...not a bit.
					(after another long beat) 
			I'll tell you one thing...Sanctuary 
			better be worth it. That's the last 
			place for me to live now.

						JESSICA 
			For us.

Logan mouths "Us"...a strange word...and why not... in the last
minutes he has done strange things.

234-236 	OUT
		
236x1	INT. - ICE CAVERN

Suddenly they are blinded by a brilliant light coming from the side
and revealing for the first time where they are.

236x2	ANGLE

Before them a vase, dim, ice-shrouded storage area, row upon endless
row of frozen lockers trailing away into darkness, their legends and
contents unreadable in the thick covering of ice and frost. To the
side, a bright light.
		
236x3	LOGAN AND JESSICA

Walk toward the light.

236x4	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

We see a huge, high-domed cavern ringed and ornamented with
extraordinary ice sculptures-They are everywhere: Otters, fish, a
tusked walrus---overhead a flight of birds.

236x5	ANOTHER ANGLE

As they look in wonder:

						VOICE
			Overwhelming, isn't it?

Logan and Jessica turn and see:

237-238	OUT

239		FULL ANGLE - BOX	

Box is half-man...half-metal.

From the midpoint of his sternum to his hips he is coils and cables.
One hand is a cutting tool. His head is half-flesh...half-metal. his
legs are a chrome pedestal.

						BOX		
			Are you too startled? Am I too	
			removed from your ken?	
					(slightest beat)
			I'm neither machine nor man...but
			a perfect fusion of the two...and
			better than either.
					(with great pride)
			No human sculptor could match this
			greatness...don't you agree?

						LOGAN
			All right - what are you?
	
						BOX (laughs)
			Your turn.
	
						JESSICA
			It's incredibly beautiful.

						BOX	
			Ah, but wait for the winds. Then	
			my birds sing. My walrus breathes.	
			My palace chimes and bells. And the
			deep grottoes whisper my name...Box
			Box...Bahhhhxxxxsss...

						LOGAN (after a beat)
			We're hungry	do you have anything
			to eat?
	
						BOX
			Anything to eat?

Box starts to laugh...He is roaring with laughter as:

						JESSICA (quietly)
			We're human and we're hungry.

						BOX (still laughing) 
			I know...I know.

						LOGAN
			This place is a link to Sanctuary,
			isn't it?

Box looks totally confused.

						LOGAN (angrily) 
			How do you think we got here??!!

						BOX
			You walked in. I saw you. Don't
			you remember?

Logan contains his anger.

						LOGAN (beginning 
					again; quietly) 
			Where do you think we came from?

						BOX 
			From? From? From?

						LOGAN	
			We were sent here and you know it.
			Others have been sent here. Where
			are they? Hiding?
	
Box looks around the cavern:
	
						BOX (mischievously)
			Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.

						LOGAN
			Where do we go?!	
					(up a notch)			
			Where do we go from here??!!

We hear a NOISE outside.

						BOX 
			Is that the wind?
					(smiling)
			Not yet...
					(slightest beat) 
			You must hear my birds sing.

						LOGAN 
			You know about Sanctuary! I know 
			you do! You have to help us! You 
			don't have a choice! It isn't your 
			decision!! Tell us.

						BOX
			Never a pair. I have never had a
			pair.

						LOGAN
			Where do you send them?

						BOX
			You're a beautiful pair.

						JESSICA 
			Please.

						BOX 
			I've never seen humans whom I thought 
			worthy of being here...
					(a beat) 
			I'd like to sculpt you.
					(looking around) 
			Where would I put you?
					(smiling) 
			I know...you'd be the base of the 
			column. You'd hold up my world!

						LOGAN (exasperated) 
			Answer the question!

						BOX 
			Do you know how long all this will 
			last? Not thirty years...or thirty 
			thousand years...but thirty thousand 
			thousand years...and you'll be part 
			of it. Ages will roll...Ages. And 
			you'll be here...the two of you... 
			eternally frozen...frozen...beautiful.

						LOGAN (to Jessica)	
			There must be somebody else up here.	
			I can't believe that he's--	

						BOX (interrupting;
					his voice tone changing;
					very lucid)
			Let me sculpt you and I will show
			you where the others have gone.
	
						LOGAN
			That's better.
					(slightest beat)
			How do you want us?

						BOX
			Nude. Imagine, a pair.

						LOGAN (starting to 
					take off his clothes; 
					as Jessica hesitates, 
					Logan smiles)
			It'll be all right...

240-241	JESSICA 

Undresses.

Box motions to a pedestal covered with deep white furs.

						BOX
			Up there.

Logan helps Jessica up to the pedestal. As they stand there:

						LOGAN
			How do you want us?

						BOX (beat)
			Up there.

Logan looks at Jessica. Her beauty is glowing in the lamplight.

Logan takes Jessica into his arms.

						BOX
			Enchanting. Is that what humans do?

By this time, Logan and Jessica are no longer listening to
Box...their arms are enveloping one another...with strong feelings.

						BOX'S VOICE	
			Superb!	

242		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX

As his metal hand begins to BUZZ...he brings it to the base of the
huge column supporting the cavern.

As he works furiously...at Incredible speed:


243		LOGAN AND JESSICA

...oblivious to Box...their feelings intensifying as they continue
to hold one another.

244-245	OUT

246		CLOSE - ON BOX

						BOX (stepping back) 
			Done...behold...!

247		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Before they turn to view the sculpture they kiss long and
passionately.

Their mood is broken by:

						BOX'S VOICE
			Done...Done...Done...

Logan and Jessica break. They turn and see:

248		FULL ANGLE - THE ICE SCULPTURE

Box has captured them perfectly...shimmering with life...filled with
emotion.

249		WIDE ANGLE - INCLUDING LOGAN, JESSICA AND BOX

There are tears in Jessica's eyes as she reacts to the sculpture.

						JESSICA (squeezing	
					Logan's hand)	
			It's glorious 

Logan helps Jessica off the pedestal and they both start to dress.

						LOGAN
			All right. Now you keep your
			bargain.

						BOX (rapt by his
					work) 
			Wait for the wind! Wait and hear
			the birds sing over you!

						LOGAN (only interested
					in getting out)
			We're ready.

Box mumbles as he leads Logan and Jessica toward the rear of the Ice
Cavern.

250		INT. - ICE ROOM

As Box enters followed by Logan and Jessica.

This room has a fairly low ceiling and it is not too wide.

It stretches back as far as the eye can see.

The ice along the left wall is frosted...but the ice along the right
wall is perfectly clear.

And embedded in the ice along the perfectly clear right wall are:

251		WIDE ANGLE - MEN AND WOMEN

Standing in erect positions.

At first it appears that they might be more of Box's perfect works
of sculpture.

But as Logan and Jessica examine them closely through the clear
ice...it is soon apparent that they are real people...who have been
frozen.

252		CLOSE ON LOGAN AND JESSICA

Horrified as they move slowly along the wall.

253		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING THE MEN AND WOMEN FROZEN	
		IN THE WALL

We can see that each of them has a black crystal flower in the palm
of their right hands.
	
Logan walks to the end of this wall. Each frozen body has a number
above it. The final body's number is 1056...That number which the
voice in Sandman's headquarters revealed as the number of missing
Runners.

The CAMERA PANS Logan back to Box.

254		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX

As Logan turns toward him.

						LOGAN (stupefied) 
			How did they get in here?

						BOX
			Regular storage procedure...the
			same as the other food... The
			other food stopped coming and they
			started.
	
						LOGAN
			What other food?

						BOX
			Fish and plankton, sea greens and
			protein from the sea.
					(pointing to the frosted
					ice wall)
			It's all here - ready - fresh as
			harvest day. Fish and plankton,			
			sea greens and protein from the
			sea...And then it stopped coming
			and they (gesture) came instead.
			So I store them here. I'm ready.
			And you're ready. It's my Job -
			protein, plankton, grass from the
			sea

Logan pulls out his gun.

						LOGAN	
			Tell us how to get out...or I¹ll	
			destroy you..I'll kill you!

Box laughs...The same LOUD, ROARING LAUGH we HEARD earlier.  Then:

						BOX (calmly)
			Such a beautiful pair. I'll stand
			you facing one another.
		
Box starts his saw hand BUZZING.  He turns all the flesh parts of
his body away from Logan and starts advancing toward him and Jessica
who is now standing behind Logan.

Box is now like an armed vehicle.

Logan FIRES...the fire reflecting harmlessly off Box's metal frame.

						BOX (advancing)
			Resign yourself.

255		MED. ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Retreating...as Logan FIRES again and again...to no avail.

As Logan and Jessica retreat further and further toward the rear of
this room and:

256		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Advancing

We can SEE PERSON AFTER PERSON...embedded in the clear wall of ice.
A strange mute audience to this to-the-death drama.

257		TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Finally reaching the rear wall of this room as:

258		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Relentlessly moving toward them.

259		TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Seemingly pinned back against the rear wall.

Logan is FIRING his gun futilely with his right hand...while moving
his empty hand against the rear wall...trying to find a knob or
button which might open it.

The entire time he never takes his eyes off:

260		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Getting closer. The saw is BUZZING LOUDLY.

						BOX (chilling tone) 
			I make such a small, quick incision ...
			you can hardly feel it.

261		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Against the rear wall...We can SEE...but they cannot...that above
them...on the ceiling...there are a number of exposed cables.

262		FULL ANGLE - LOGAN, JESSICA AND BOX
	
Box is practically upon them.  As he lunges forward with his
WHIRRING saw hand Logan pushes Jessica to the floor and drops down
alongside her.

Box cannot stop his forward thrust and cuts a sizable chunk of ice
out of the rear wall as:

Logan SHOOTS at Box from the floor Level...upwards ...trying to
penetrate some part of his seemingly impregnable body. He misses but
hits the exposed cables on the ceiling.

There is an EXPLOSION.

						BOX (looking up; 
					screaming) 
			No! The coils!

Box rushes past Logan and Jessica toward the huge ice cavern
containing his sculptures.

						BOX (still screaming)	
			All my work!' All my work!!	

As Logan and Jessica stand:

263-270	OUT
			
270x1	ANGLE - THE REFRIGERANT COILS

Bursting open, discharging great streams of gases.

270x2	LOGAN

Seeing the effect, shooting again and again at the ceiling and
walls.

270x3	ANOTHER ANGLE	
		
Coils bursting everywhere, vapor billowing into the cavern.
			
270x4	ANOTHER ANGLE	
	
Huge slabs of ice instantly loosening, crashing over.
			
270x5	FULL SHOT	

AS the effect multiplies--Ln the hissing vapor-sculptures crashing
over and enormous chunks of ice loosened and crashing.

270x6	BOX

Careening around wildly in the growing ruin, as the lights dim and
flicker out.

270X7	ANGLE

The ceiling full of birds loosening, crashing down upon Box. Again
and again like great spears and wedges 

270X8	BOX
	
Buried in his work, still feebly moving, then still as the roaring
ice crashes down, in the terrible darkness.
	
270X9	LOGAN AND JESSICA
 
Cowering in the crashing maelstrom of ice blocks--saved only by
Being in an angle of the cave.

270X10	FULL SHOT	
	
The SCREEN blotted out by the cave-in, going out of focus. Silence.
Then:

SOUND: Ice melting, water running.

270X11	LOGAN AND JESSICA

Stir in the dimness, amazed to be alive.

SOUND: A heavy crash and splash as another huge ice block falls into
the water.

As it falls, the cave is suddenly illuminated again. They look and
see the light is coming from a great fissure in the wall--opened by
the last ice fall. Water rains across the opening.

Logan and Jessica make their way to it, step out.

271-272	OUT

273		EXT. - HIGH LEDGE

Water is pouring down in a waterfall from the icemelt.

They are blinded by:

274		SUNSHINE: A HUGE RISING SUN	

As Logan and Jessica shield their eyes...then realizing that the
dazzling light will not go away:

Standing together...in fear of the sunrise.

						JESSICA 		
			Is there something on fire!!	 

Logan shakes his head...he doesn't know.

As Logan looks up at the sun.
			
						LOGAN
			It seems to be moving away.
			Come on...

274X1	ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

clambering cautiously down from the barren ledge.

274X2	LOWER - AN AREA OF BOULDERS	

Suddenly, a FAIRLY STRONG WIND starts blowing.

						JESSICA (frightened) 
			What's that?

						LOGAN 
			It feels like breath. It makes 
			everything move. Your hair is moving.

						JESSICA (smiling) 
			And yours.

They reach the level below and pause, look around.

						LOGAN
			Jessica -- we must be outside!

She looks at him, uncertainly, he puts an arm around her and they
set out again.

275-276	OUT

276X1	INT. - CAVE - CLOSE ON FRANCIS

Picking his way through the ruined cave, puzzled.

277-287X1	
OUT

288		EXT . - FOREST AREA

As Logan and Jessica reach it.

They are startled by the SOUND of BIRDS SINGING for a moment...then
continue through some high grass and thorned bushes being scratched,
etcetera.

A swarm of insects attack...Logan and Jessica fight them off:

						JESSICA (starting to panic)
			I hate outside! I hate it!

						LOGAN (holding her; 
					comforting tone)
			We'll be all right...
					(a beat)
			We will...

The sun is starting to go down...as they see a rabbit dart away in
the grass...startling them for a moment.
		
288XA1	FRANCIS
Coming out through the fissure in the rock, squinting at the
unexpected light from the sky, then setting out as Logan and Jessica
did.
		
288XB1	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - A BUSHY AREA

They come upon bushes of berries. Logan picks a few, looks at them
and smells them. As he is about to put them in his mouth...Jesslca
grabs hold of his hand.

						JESSICA
			Don't!

						LOGAN
			Sooner or later, we'll have to try
			something

Logan eats the berries...as Jessica watches intently.

After a beat

						LOGAN
			They're good.

Logan and Jessica pick berries and eat. When they are finished: 

						JESSICA
			It's getting dark and cold.	
			I'm tired.		

						LOGAN 
			Why don't we rest here? We know we can 
			eat these.

They sit on the ground.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

288X1	TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA - NIGHT	

Sitting on the ground.

Jessica is shivering. Logan has his arms around her trying to keep
her warm. 

						JESSICA 
			Where do you think that heat-ball went?

Logan shrugs.

						JESSICA
			Do you think everything's going to
			turn to ice?

						LOGAN
 			I doubt it.
	
						JESSICA
			Don't ever let go.

						LOGAN
			I won't.
	
After a long beat:

						LOGAN
			It all seemed to make sense until
			Box.

						JESSICA
			Do you think he was telling the
			Truth?

Logan shrugs.

						JESSICA (trying to 
					convince herself) 
			Maybe we're the first ones to get 
			through... 
					(hopeful tone) 
			Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... 
			another protected place. It couldn't 
			be outside.

						LOGAN (grunts) 
			How would anyone know? Even if we find 
			it -- we can never go back.

At her stricken look...Logan touches her in a caring way.

						LOGAN
			You're right...it must be near
			now. We'll find it.

						JESSICA (yawning;		
					closing her eyes; resting	
					on his shoulder)	
			Thirty thousand years didn't last
			very long, did they?
	
288X2	EXT. - BARREN TERRAIN - NIGHT - FRANCIS
	
Looking frightened as he looks up at the moon and the stars his gun
drawn.

Suddenly, a rabbit darts by.

Francis jumps up in great fear and starts FIRING his gun...blasting
the rabbit to smithereens.

He is breathing hard (fear)...and looking around...gun in hand.

288X3	EXT. - FOREST AREA - DAY - LOGAN AND JESSICA

walking in the hot sun...grimy...thirsty.

288X4	EXT. - FOREST AREA - FRANCIS

His face still betrays a wild, frightened look as he moves very
cautiously.

He reaches the bushes of berries and sees some of them on the
ground.

He picks a few off the bush...is ravenous...but finally...too
frightened that they might be some kind of poison to eat any.

As he angrily crushes the berries in his hand... then wipes his hand
on his trousers:

288X5	EXT. - FOREST AREA - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Seeing shimmering in the distance. They walk toward it.

288X6-
288X8	TRACKING SHOTS WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

Reaching...

289		FULL ANGLE - A BROOK

They rush to it...drink...then undress...swim...and as they embrace
in the water:

						JESSICA
			Logan!!!Look!!
					(Logan turns around)
			No...your palm...look!!! 	

Logan looks at his palm...the blinking crystal is clear.

He grabs Jessica's hand and looks at her palm... the same.

						JESSICA (quietly)
			What does it mean?
	
						LOGAN (trying to
					assimilate its meaning
					himself)
			The Lifeclocks have no power outside. 

Jessica takes Logan's palm and kisses it.

						JESSICA (with laughter)
			You can have any woman in the city.
			What do you really want?

						LOGAN (straight)
			You know, Jessica.

						JESSICA. (a beat)
			...But I still have the choice...?

						LOGAN
			Of course.

						JESSICA
			Then the answer's Yes...

They embrace there in the water...

						LOGAN 
			I have never seen a face like that 
			before. It must be the look of great 
			age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.

						JESSICA (beat) 
			Yes, do you think that's why he looks

Logan shrugs. They turn, start to EXIT from memorial.

						LOGAN
			They all have names and numbers

						JESSICA
			"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife".
			What can all that mean?
		
Just then their attention is focused by a distant SOUND as of
SHOUTING -- a man's voice. Jessica stops.
		
						JESSICA
			Francis?
		
Logan shakes his head. They EXIT cemetery toward capitol.
		
301X17	LONG SHOT - CAPITOL (MATTE COMPOSITE)

There are HUNDREDS OF CATS...and THOUSANDS OF BOOKS all over the
place.

						JESSICA (frowning; 
					whispering)
			Look at his face...and his hair... 
					(grimacing)
			Is that what it is to grow old?

						LOGAN (still stunned)
			It could be...

There are a COUPLE OF CATS on the man's lap as he turns and faces
Logan and Jessica...when he HEARS them move closer.

The man is stroking the cats calmly...unperturbed by the appearance
of Logan and Jessica.

						LOGAN
			How old are you?		

						MAN
			As old as I am I suppose...who
			knows ?

						LOGAN 
			Your hair is white.

						MAN		
			It wasn't always. I remember when		
			it wasn't. But it wasn't your	
			color either.
					(looking at Jessica) 
			...or yours. I have my color somewhere.

						JESSICA
			Those cracks in your face...do they hurt?

						MAN 
			Oh, no...

						JESSICA 
			Could I touch them?

						MAN
			Oh, my...please try.

Jessica walks up to the man and touches his face.

						JESSICA 
			What's your name?

						MAN
			I've forgotten. It's been so
			long since I've used it.
	
Logan and Jessica exchange a quick glance...feeling they have come
upon a nutsy, fruitsy cupcake.
	
						MAN
			But all of my cats have names.
	
						LOGAN
			Is that what they're called--
			cats?

						OLD MAN
			Yes, cats, of course. What else
			could they be? Cats. Of course
			each one has his own name too.
	
						JESSICA
			But there are so many of them.
			Do you know each one separately.
		
						OLD MAN
			Yes indeed, everyone. Actually,
			they all have three.
					(reciting)
			"The naming of cats is a difficult
			matter. It isn't just one of your
			holiday games. You may think at	
			first I'm mad as a hatter when I	
			tell you a cat must have THREE
			DIFFERENT NAMES."
					(a beat)
			An ordinary name and a fancy name.
			That's two. Do you want to guess
			what the third one is?
		
Logan and Jessica are silent.

						OLD MAN (reciting again)	
			"But above and beyond there's	
			still one name left over,	
			And that is the name that you
			never will guess;
			The name that no human research
			can discover -- -
			But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and
			will never confess."
					(reaching down and
					stroking another cat)
			Will you, my pet?
		
One of the cats jumps off his lap.

						OLD MAN (reciting)
			"Why did you go little fourpaws?
			You forgot to shut your big eyes."
					(the man closes his
					eyes for a moment; then:)
			"I have a Gumble Cat in mind!"
		
As the man opens his eyes:
	
						LOGAN
			How long have you been living
			here?
	
						OLD MAN
			For as long as I can remember.
	
						LOGAN
			What kind of place is this?
	
						OLD MAN
			Just a place, I suppose...who
			knows?

The man looks puzzled.

						LOGAN
			How did you get here?

						OLD MAN
			I have always been here...

						LOGAN			
			Are there any other humans?	
	
						OLD MAN
			Gracious...no.

						LOGAN 
			Have any other people ever passed 
			through?

The man shakes his head...then:

						OLD MAN 
			But there may be a few around somewhere.

						LOGAN 
			What makes you think so?

						OLD MAN 
			My parents thought so. Mother and 
			Father. You know?

						LOGAN (astonished) 
			Mother and -- ? You knew your mother 
			and father?

The man nods.

						JESSICA 
			And...and how were you grown? Inside
			your mother?

						OLD MAN
			Yes...

						JESSICA 
			Are you sure?

						OLD MAN 
			Mother and Father said so... you know?

						LOGAN 
			Where are they?

						OLD MAN
			Dead...they're dead...and buried.

						JESSICA (not knowing
					what it is)
			Buried???

Logan wheels...as he HEARS THE NOISE OF A DOOR SQUEAKING
SLIGHTLY...as it opens a bit wider:

302		CLOSE ON A CAT

Coming through the opening - did he push it?

303		CLOSE ON THE MAN

						OLD MAN (pleased; 
					reciting) 
			"Gus is the cat at the theatre door. 
			His name, as I ought to have told 
			you before, Is really Asparagus. 
			That's such a fuss To pronounce, 
			that we usually call him just Gus."

306		WIDER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOGAN AND JESSICA	

						OLD MAN
			May I see your hand again?

Logan and Jessica extend their left hands. The Old Man takes them,
looks from one to another with delight.
		
						OLD MAN
			They're beautiful. May I have
			one too please?
		
						LOGAN
			No--I'm sorry. It's not possible.
			
						OLD MAN (offended)
			It isn't fair. I'll give you one
			of my favorite cats...a Jellicle
			cat.
					(reciting)
			"Jellicle cats have cheerful faces,
			Jellicle cats have bright black eyes;
			They like to practice their airs and graces
			And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."


						LOGAN	
			I'm sorry but I don't have anything to 
			give you.	
		
As the man continues to look petulant:

						JESSICA (simply; 
					sincerely)
			That's the truth.

Jessica takes off a ring and hands it to the man.

						JESSICA
			Here you can have this.

The man seems pleased.
	
						OLD MAN
			What kind of jewel is this?

						JESSICA
			I don't know.
	
						OLD MAN
			You're both full of secrets like
			Macavity.	
					(looking at the ring)
			Did you steal this?
	
						JESSICA
			No.
		
						OLD MAN 
					(reciting)
			"Macavity, Macavity, there's no
			one like Macavity,
			There never was a cat of such
			deceitfulness and suavity."
	
						LOGAN
			What's beyond this place - do you
			know?
	
						OLD MAN
			No, no, no
		
						LOGAN
			Did your Mother or Father ever
			mention another place?
	
						OLD MAN
			Never, never, ever. Nothing.

After a pause:

						LOGAN	
			May we stay here for a while?	
			We'd like to rest.	

						OLD MAN
			Of course you can stay. This
			belongs to the people.

						JESSICA
			What belongs to the people?

						OLD MAN
			All this. All of it.
		
						JESSICA
			What people?
			
						OLD MAN
			I don't know...but it does.

The man stands...and starts walking toward a door to an adjoining
room.

						OLD MAN
			I'll be right back.
					(stopping)
			Oh, yes...about the cats...
			one rule is true:
					(reciting)
			"Don't speak till you are spoken to."
			
The man smiles and leaves.
		
305		LOGAN AND JESSICA 	

Logan clears two chairs of cats and they sit down.

Jessica picks up a book and starts leafing through it.

Logan is deep in thought.

Jessica looks up from the book.

						JESSICA (quietly)
			How curious people used to be --
			All these books...

Silence...until:

						LOGAN
			That sweet madman -- how could he
			Come to exist?
	
						JESSICA	
			He had a mother and father --	
			and he knew them.	

						LOGAN
			One in a million, I suppose

						LOGAN AND JESSICA (together; 
					smiling) 
			...Who knows? 

						JESSICA (after a beat) 
			We're going on, aren't we?

						LOGAN 
					(shaking his head) 
			There's nothing to go on to, Jessica.

Logan continues to shake his head through Jessica's following line:

						JESSICA 
			There's a Sanctuary...there is!

						LOGAN
			You want there to be one...that
			Doesn't...

						JESSICA (interrupting; 
					urgent tone) 
			There has to be! I know it exists! It 
			has to!!

						LOGAN (gently) 
			No, there doesn't. Not really --just so 
			many want it to exist...so many who 
			don't want to die...want it so much 
			that a place called Sanctuary becomes 
			"real". But it doesn't exist. It never 
			existed. Just the hope.

						JESSICA (becoming	
					hysterical)
			You're wrong!! It has to be!!
			It Just has to be!!

As Logan takes her in his arms...comforting her:

306		FULL ANGLE - INCLUDING THE MAN

The man returns with a portrait in hand.

						OLD MAN	
			Oh, my don't cry.

The man proudly shows them the portrait....which is a portrait of
himself in his twenties. He sort of brushes the hair...which is rich
auburn.

						OLD MAN (gesturing) 
			There are larger pictures of other 
			people over there. I don't know who 
			they are. Perhaps they're family.

She man leads Logan across the chamber to a far corner.

307		CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

Remaining near the podium. She is dejected. Logan's argument that
there is no Sanctuary has sunk in and taken hold.

308 		OUT

308x1	THE CORNER - LOGAN AND THE OLD MAN

We see portraits of Presidents of the United States.

We can recognize all of them...with the exception of the dozen or so
that come after Ford.

As Logan looks at the portraits he recognizes Lincoln.

						LOGAN 
			That's the same fellow who's outside. 
			If he was so important - why isn't he 
			first?

The old man shakes his head.

309		INT - SENATE CHAMBER - CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

As Francis suddenly appears alongside her.

Jessica is terrified...speechless. Francis glances across the
chamber, sees Logan. When he speaks, it is softly but urgently.

						FRANCIS 
			What did you do to him?

Jessica is silent. Francis' tone becomes increasingly sexual.

						FRANCIS	
			Why? Why you?	
					(grabbing her)	
			Do you know you ruined him? Do
			you know that? Can you tell me
			why? Why you?
					(a beat)
			And now you've killed him, you
			know...

Francis starts to tear off her clothes...obviously to rape...but his
expression remains cold and without passion.

						JESSICA (screaming) 
			Logan!!!

As she screams, Francis clamps a hand over her mouth and drags her
O.S.

310 		OUT

310x1	LOGAN

hears the scream, wheels -- sees nothing for a moment.

311		INT. - SENATE CHAMBER

						FRANCIS' VOICE 
			Here!!!!

Logan looks up...and we see Francis crouched behind the railing of
the first row of the gallery...with his gun pointing down at Logan,
holding the terrified Jessica with his other arm.

						OLD MAN (cheerfully) 
			How nice...more company...

						FRANCIS (emotional; 
					disjointed thoughts) 
			We had such good times together... 
			I let you go! 
					(frenzied) 
			You didn't terminate a Runner and 
			I let you go!!
					(a beat)
			She did this to us! How could you
			let her?! An ordinary available??!!
					(with this he flings
					Jessica down and away.
					She lies there...stunned)
			And what about Logan-6 and Francis-8? 
					(a tear in his eye)
			....Why didn't you chink about them?!
					(up a notch)
			There's over two hundred years of
			Sandmen's blood in you, Logan....
			and now you'll spill it for a
			stinking Runner!!

312		CLOSE ON - LOGAN

Holding up his right palm.

						LOGAN 
			Look at your palm, Francis.... 
			look! It's clear. Clear!

313		REVERSE ANGLE - FRANCIS

Looking at his palm....shocked...dropping his gun. It falls on the
CHAMBER FLOOR.

						FRANCIS 
			Why did you do that??!!

						LOGAN
			I didn't do anything, Francis!
			They've made us believe that....

						FRANCIS (interrupting; 
					wild) 
			Why did you do that???!!!

Francis leaps from the gallery and falls on Logan.

314		WIDE ANGLE - CATS

Scattering in all directions as:

315-319	CLOSE ACTION SHOTS - FRANCIS AND LOGAN

In hand to hand combat punching...Kicking...wrestling

320		INTERCUT WITH: JESSICA AND THE MAN REACTING

Jessica deeply disturbed...The man enjoying himself as if Logan and
Francis were putting on a show for him.

321-331	THE FIGHT- SERIES OF SHOTS

A. Francis manages to pick up a chair and smashes it down on Logan.

B. As Logan slumps to the floor and Francis cries to follow through
his advantage by crushing Logan's face with his foot:

C. Logan grabs Francis' foot and twists it...sending Francis reeling
backward.

D. Standing, Logan grabs a table and hurls it at Francis...who
ducks.

E. Francis sees a steel flagpole (with an American flag that has
sixty-one stars) and takes hold of it.

F. Francis moves toward Logan...with the menacing steel flagpole in
front of him.

G. Logan is wary...watching every movement of the steel pole.

H. Francis swings the steel pole twice...We can HEAR the WHISH-WHISH
as it cuts through the air...with Logan avoiding the blows.

I. On the third swing...Logan grabs hold of the steel pole and
swings around on it...kicking Francis in the chest.

J. Francis lets go of the steel pole as he staggers backward.
Francis and Logan look at one another for a brief anguished moment
as Logan crashes the steel pole (which he is now holding) down on
Francis' head.

K. Francis crumbles to the floor. Feebly, he raises a hand toward
Logan...

Logan touches Francis' hand and Francis grasps his wrist, holding
death off with the strong grip.

						FRANCIS (delirious)	
			That was the right shot--Look out	
			there, he's trying to break free		
			Watch it, Logan, steady, now!......

His eyes focus briefly and he sees Logan's palm-the crystal shining
clear and white. Francis is suddenly radiant.

						FRANCIS 
			Logan! You renewed!

And he is dead.	DIRECT CUT TO:
	
332		JESSICA AND THE MAN

The man walks over to Francis and bends down.

						OLD MAN
			Oh, my...he died...

333		CLOSE ON - LOGAN

Rubbing his face with the palms of his hands...clearly upset.

334		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING JESSICA AND THE MAN

						OLD MAN
			We¹ll have to bury him.

						JESSICA
			What¹s that?

						OLD MAN
			They¹re put into the ground so
			they can be visited by the living...

Logan¹s eyes are glistening with tears.  The man starts out.

						OLD MAN
			I¹ll make the arrangements.

						JESSICA (softly)
			At least it¹s over...

Jessica¹s words don¹t help as Logan shakes his head...then:

						OLD MAN
			Are you ready to put him in?
	
						LOGAN
			Not yet.

						OLD MAN
			All right.

The man sits down.

Gently, Logan lifts Francis¹ body...trying to straighten him out
from the slightly twisted position he assumed when he fell to the
floor.

After resting Francis¹ body on the floor again.  He cradles Francis¹
head in his arms.

DISSOLVE TO:

335-338	OUT

339		EXT. - HIGH ANGLE - CEMETERY - NIGHT - SHOOTING DOWN 

						OLD MAN'S VOICE 
			"Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there 
			in the fragrant silent night."

339X1	CLOSER ANGLE - CEMETERY

As they look down at Francis' body...in the open grave.

Jessica watches as Logan and the man start shoveling dirt into the
grave...starting to fill it.

339X2	JESSICA

quietly watching:

DISSOLVE TO:
		
339X3	INT. - SENATE - NEXT MORNING

On Logan sleeping - Jessica and Old Man in a spirited but soft
conversation in a far corner.

As Logan wakes he hears:

						OLD MAN
			Of course...that's settled then.
			But just you remember your promise...

						JESSICA 
			We'll remember. But that's a long time 
			off...

She sees Logan awake and listening, crosses to him, smiling. Logan
rises to her.

						LOGAN 
			What are we promising him? What can we 
			possibly give him?

						JESSICA 
			He asked if we would bury him when his 
			time comes.

						 LOGAN (beat)
			We can't. We're going back.

						JESSICA 
			To what?

						LOGAN		
			I'm going to try and tell people what 
			we've seen and--

						JESSICA (interrupting) 
			You're lying! You'll never have the 
			chance to tell anybody anything! 
			You'll be killed the moment you're seen!

						LOGAN 
			Do you expect me to let things go on 
			without trying to change them?!

						JESSICA 
			Things won't change...you know that! 
			We can live here together, Logan...
			have a life as long as his... together!

						LOGAN (showing his palm) 
			Things change!

						JESSICA
			You want to go back to kill, is that it?! 
			Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! kill 
			Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!!

Logan shakes Jessica who is becoming hysterical.

						LOGAN (softly) 
			Jessica...listen to me...listen to me...
					(as she quiets down)
			The Lifeclocks made me kill
			Francis. They make people die or
			be killed every day. If I didn't
			try and destroy that...I couldn't
			live here or anywhere. Do you
			understand?

						JESSICA
			I want to be alive and with you,
			that's all I want.

Logan puts his arms around her.

						LOGAN 
			I know...I know...

The Old Man comes to them, wondering.

						LOGAN 
			We're leaving.

						 OLD MAN		
			What a pity. I was hoping you'd	
			be here to bury me.	

						JESSICA 
			Come with us.

						OLD MAN 
			Where are you going?

						LOGAN 
			To a city with thousands and thousands 
			of people.

						OLD MAN 
			Alive?

Logan nods.

						OLD MAN 
			Thousands and thousands...as many as 
			my cats?

						LOGAN 
			More...many more.

						OLD MAN 
			And all alive you say?

Logan nods.

						OLD MAN
			Yes, I would like to see that. Is it 
			a long journey?

Again, Logan nods.

						OLD MAN (mumbling) 
			Thousands and thousands alive... oh, my...

340-349	OUT

350		HIGH ANGLE - GREENBELT AREA - SHOOTING DOWN - DAY

Logan, Jessica and the Old MAN are walking...with the Capitol
Building blurred by overgrown foliage receding in the b.g. of the
SHOT.	

351-361 	OUT

361X1	EXT. - FOREST AREA - AFTERNOON

The Old Man has picked Some wild vegetables...and hands a piece to
Logan and a piece to Jessica.

As they hesitate...the Old Man bites into it... heartily. 

As Logan and Jessica start eating it, too:

						OLD MAN (marveling tone) 
			Never see the sun or the moon... 
			I hope we get there soon...

361X1A	NIGHT - WOODED AREA - CLOSE	

On Logan, Jessica and the Old Man as they emerge from a small grove
of trees and stand looking O.S. past CAMERA Behind, a flicker of
firelight.

						OLD MAN (weary but
					enthusiastic)
			Is that really it? It doesn't
			seem very far. Will we be there
			soon?

						LOGAN
			I promise. We '11 go on as soon
			as it's light.

						JESSICA (gently, 
					turning O.M. away) 
			But now I'm tired. Let's go back to 
			the fire...

They turn, the Old Man still marveling at the sight.

P.O.V. WHAT THEY SEE (TO BE INTERCUT)

NIGHT (Matte) view of the domed city seen through a fringe of trees and beyond distance hills.

361X1B	EXT. - WOODED AREA - NIGHT

As the three return to where a small fire is burning on the ground.

						OLD MAN 
			That's better than gold when it's cold.

						LOGAN		
			Thank you.			
					(turning to Old Man)	
			Tell me - what do those words mean?
			"Beloved husband²...²Beloved son"...
			"Beloved wife"'...

						OLD MAN
			My father was the husband and my
			mother was the wife. "Beloved" is	
			a word they used - to stay together.

						LOGAN 
			Stay? They lived together all their years?

						OLD MAN 
			Oh, yes...I think...

						JESSICA (reading; 
					moved) 
			³Beloved son²... 
					(a beat) 
			So people stayed together for that 
			feeling of love... They would live and 
			raise children together and be remembered. 
					(another beat) 
			I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we 
			be that way?

						LOGAN (facing Jessica) 
			Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
					(a beat)

						JESSICA		
			And Sanctuary?		

						LOGAN 
			Sanctuary is the right to live.... 
			nothing more. But nothing less, either....

There is a long beat...then Jessica snuggles up to Logan...she is
ready for sleep.

						JESSICA (whispering)
			Beloved husband...

						LOGAN (kissing her)
			Beloved wife...

As they walk the great glowing dome is visible in the distance.

The Old Man marvels at what he sees...they walk on.

362		LONG, LONG ANGLE - LOGAN JESSICA AND THE OLD MAN - DAY

Walking up the beach toward the domed city. We get an idea of the
scale. They appear as ants in front of redwood trees.

363 		OUT

364		LOGAN, JESSICA AND THE OLD MAN

Approaching. The wave power inlet in f.g. They

HEAR: THE ROAR OF THE WATER

As they approach cautiously...they see:

365		WAVE POWER INLET

Waves pounding over ACRES OF STRANGE STEPPED CONSTRUCTION...
DESCENDING TO A VORTEX.

						JESSICA
			What does that water do?

						LOGAN
			It's part of the hydrogalvanic
			system. The ocean tides are changed
			into energy somehow.

						JESSICA
			Is it inside the city?

						LOGAN
			Of course.
					(a beat)
			I don't know where...
					(frowning)
			I Just took them for granted. 
					(Logan takes Jessica's hand)
			It's our only chance.

The CAMERA PANS LOGAN, JESSICA and the OLD MAN down the STRANGE
STEPPED CONSTRUCTION until they reach:

366		FULL ANGLE - A POOL OF WATER

At the CENTER of this IMMENSE WATER FLOWING CONSTRUCTION OF STEPS.

After a beat Jessica looks at the Old Man:
		
						LOGAN (softly)	
			I know...
					(after a beat; to the
					Old Man)
			We're going to try and get in this
			way. I don't think you can make it.

						OLD MAN (sadly)
			Oh...I did so look forward to seeing
			all those people.

						LOGAN
			I'm sorry.

						OLD MAN
			Yes...

						LOGAN
			Can you make it back?

						OLD MAN
			Oh my...I'll try. 

						JESSICA (kissing the Old Man)
			Goodbye.

						OLD MAN
			Oh, my...

The Old Man watches Logan and Jessica dive into the POOL and
disappear.

367		THE OLD MAN

he bends and plays with the water in the POOL for a moment...like a
young child at a pond or lake.

368		INT. - POWER CENTER OF THE CITY - LOGAN AND JESSICA 

Emerging from the water.

It is a labyrinth of humming turbines, automonitored cables and
impulse collectors.

Logan leads her swiftly through the humming maze toward an exit.

369-
369Xl 	OUT

369AX2	GREAT HALL - AT CAROUSEL ENTRANCE

As the CROWD is pouring in:

						LOGAN'S VOICE
			No!! Don't go in there !!

The CROWD turns and looks up at:

369X2	LOGAN

On a high balcony in the Great Hall.

Looking down at them.

						LOGAN 
			You don't have to die!! No one has 
			to die at thirty!!! You don't have 
			to blink out on Lastday. There's no 
			renewal on Carrousel! You can live 
			longer and grow old... I've seen it.
			She's seen it!! Believe me!!

There is an angry murmur in the CROWD as Logan continues:

						LOGAN (holding up
					his palm)
			See... it's' clear. The Lifeclocks
			are a lie - Carousel is a lie!!

369X3	WIDEN ANGLE - INCLUDING SANDMEN

Trying to grab Logan. There is a struggle. Some Sandmen are knocked
over the railing.

But remaining Sandmen fire a gas tranquilizer which subdues Logan
and Jessica.

The CROWD cheers...and continues into Carousel as:

370		INT. - SANDMAN DEBRIEFING AREA

It is the same area where Logan received the original assignment to
find and destroy Sanctuary.

In the rear...with the panel open...the sign reading:
	
		PROBABILITY	
				
blinks on and off.		

Logan is dragged in by a number of SANDMEN.

We see Jessica , too, still groggy, being held by SANDMEN in the
b.g. of the SHOT.

Logan is placed on the chair in which his CRYSTAL was altered.

371		CLOSE ANGLE - LOGAN IN THE CHAIR

A shaft of light glows on and he stiffens - bound by it.

372 		OUT

372X1-
372X3	FULL SHOT - LOGAN AND THE SCREEN

As around him in the air, a series of spectral greenish HEADS appear
-- one after the other -in response to questions. Each of these
heads is Logan. Each revolves slowly on its axis as it responds.

As the real Logan (in the chair) is questioned, each of the heads
answers in turn. They are each a part of his persona and his brain.

373-378 	OUT

378X1-
378X18	INTERCUT WITH CLOSER SHOTS OF LOGAN HIMSELF WRITHING IN
		AGONY AS THE IMPASSIVE HEADS SPEAK.

ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN AND HEADS

A. 						FIRST HEAD SPEAKS
					(Logan's voice)
			A Jewelry store. 

B. Logan himself - twisting in pain.

C. The word NEGATIVE appears on the SCREEN.

D.						A SECOND HEAD
					(Logan's voice)
			A creature called Box - all frozen, 
			all frozen.

E. Logan writhes in the chair.		
			
F. Again the word NEGATIVE appears on the SCREEN.	

G. 						A THIRD IDENTICAL HEAD
					(Logan's Voice)
			No...There is no Sanctuary.

H. The SCREEN seems to shimmer. It blinks.

I. A third time the word negative appears on the SCREEN.

J. 						A FOURTH HEAD 
					(Logan's voice)
			There is no Sanctuary

K. The SCREEN'S glow increases...to an almost blinding light...
starting to frighten the Sandmen present.

L. At the same time, we see JESSICA coming out of her tranquilized
daze...fearful...still in the Sandmen's custody.

M.						A FIFTH HEAD
					(Logan's voice)
			An old man without a crystal...But
			there is no Sanctuary.

N. Now the SCREEN is starting to spark. Behind it we SEE the
intermittent glow of overheated electronic components.

O. And we see the word negative...once more on the SCREEN -- but
broken now.

P. 						A SIXTH HEAD 
					(Logan's voice)
			There is no Sanctuary.

Q. Now the noise and the light from the SCREEN are peaking...and we
can see the increasing fear of the Sandmen.

R. On the SCREEN the word negative is beginning to shake...as the
SCREEN begins to shake.

379		FULL ANGLE - THE SIX HEADS

						LOGAN'S VOICE (emanating
					 from all of them)
			There is no Sanctuary. There is
			no Sanctuary.

The sign PROBABILITY bursts...the SIX HEADS of Logan go out.	 

The noise and the light coming out of the screen Increase, as it
begins to burst into showers of sparks and flame.

380-410 	OUT

410X1	ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN

Straining twisting, as the light above him bursts, goes out in a
puff of smoke -- releasing him. Logan staggers to his feet in time
to meet:

410X2	SANDMEN

Rushing in from the Ready Room to join the others who have closed in
on Logan One holding Jessica.

410X3	LOGAN AND SANDMEN
	
Manages to get one of the Sandmen's guns, instantly blasting him
with it. In the noise and confusion, the fight becomes general. A
Sandman fires back at Logan, misses -- the shot hits one of the
Lifeclocks which flares electrically, ribboning out a great arc.
Instantly Logan gets off a couple of shots at the other Lifeclocks
which similarly flare and burst into violent electrical fire and
discharges.

410X4	THE BATTLE

The electrical discharges, smoke and noise making great confusion.
Sandmen hampered by their own numbers and by trying to miss the
machinery. Logan firing methodically at the Lifeclocks, moving.
Stumbles over Jessica, prone in the smoke. Helps her to her feet.
Crouched, they make for the exit.

410X5	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE. SCREEN	

Sputtering its life out in strange predictive words....PROBABILITY
flashing on and off.... EQUILIBRIUM...DESTRUCT...EQUIL...NO
BALANCE...NO BALANCE...FAMINE... INACCEPTABLE ...NO BALANCE...etc.,
flashing vainly through the eddying smoke and the fierce discharges
which fill the great room.

410X6	SANDMEN

The battle is lost -- the smoke and noise overwhelming. They pick up
their wounded and get out as best they can.

410X7	INT. SANDMAN H.Q. LOBBY

Sandmen rushing out through the gathering smoke and the flare of
fire behind them.

410X8	EXT. SANDMAN H.Q.

Sandmen pouting out through smoke and fire effects. Pushing through
passers-by herding everyone away from the scene.

People getting the hell out of there.

Ad Libs: Get away from here. The whole thing's going.

410X9	INT. LIFECLOCK ROOM

Through the smoke, etc. The Lifeclocks EXPLODE.

410X10	EXT. SANDMAN H.Q.

The building EXPLODES -- great geyser of flame shooting upward.

410X11	GREAT HALL

The sound of the explosion creates panic. Lights begin to flicker.
The great red crystal lights fitfully on and off. People are
panicking, running in different directions. Some pressing into
Carrousel for safety.

410X12	CAROUSEL

As people run in there, the red crystal glowing and sputtering, the
petals moving spasmodically. As people look, the white crystal comes
on, begins spinning wildly, bursting into strange, lancing lights. A
great roaring commences and the whole arena starts to rock with the
crystals. Now the white crystal explodes and the whole room is
crisscrossed with deadly arcing discharges. People flee the scene of
destruction.

410X13	GREAT HALL

The panic is-full, people getting the hell out of there.

410X14	ARCADE

People are stampeding like cattle, all heading down and for the
exits, trampling  each other in their fright.

410X15-
X21		PANIC MONTAGE SERIES OF CUTS

A. EXT. The City under the dome -- fitfully lit as the dome itself
seems to be cracking strange electrical discharges emanating from it
as from a gigantic line storm.

B. The lights in Arcade flicker and go dim.

C. The chandeliers in Arcade swaying, a couple falling onto the
screaming panicky people.

D. Maze-Car Station. People fighting to cram into cars. Car lights
go out. People turn and bolt in another direction.

E. Love Shop -- pandemonium as the drugged bodies clamber over each
other in fear, struggling to get away.

F. Great Hall emptying -- the signs of panic everywhere.

G. The great crystal -- a wildly spluttering electrical fire
wrecking it.


410X22	EXT. - DOMED CITY - FIRE FX AND CRACKING 

INTERCUT with above:

410X23	LOGAN AND JESSICA

Making their way through Cathedral -- out the dazzle chamber,
running O.S. past Maze Car Station.

410X24	LOGAN AND JESSICA
		
Running past Power Center.

411	EXT. - CITY - FULL SHOT

The dome of the city torn. Lightning effects playing on the stunned
people...who look up and see the starry heavens, too, as they
stumble forward into the darkness.

A wind begins to blow...where air had never stirred anything. There
is a sense of wonder. Hysteria is lessening...as the people find
themselves moving through the crack...as they discover the fact that
the crystals have disappeared from their palms.

Some are joyful...others frightened...others puzzled...as they
emerge from the crack in the dome at:

412		FULL ANGLE - THE ACRES OF STRANGE STEPPED CONSTRUCTION
	
We can still see the fires in the b.g. of the SHOT as Logan holds on
to Jessica...(like Gable onto Jeanette MacDonald at the end of SAN
FRANCISCO)...full of happiness and hope for the future.

AS people continue to mill all over the acres of strange stepped
construction...we see the Old Man WALKING INTO THE SHOT.

Logan and Jessica run to him. He looks around. People start to
gather...they have never seen a white-haired Old Man in their lives.

As people continue to gather around the Old Man... who couldn't be
more delighted...Logan and Jessica are smiling...inviting people to
touch him...and some do.

Yes, he is an old man...Yes, they will all live again to be old men
and old women...Yes, this is the world renewing itself once again.

LEFT HAND OF ALL CHARACTERS.








FADE IN:
BEFORE AND DURING  TITLES

1		EXT. - SKY NIGHT											

The moon and stars are visible, but as CAMERA looks down, the SCREEN
fills with dark, billowing clouds. CAMERA moves into the clouds and
just  as they blank out the SCREEN, a distant shimmer of light
becomes visible.  Moving toward it, the shimmer becomes

2		EXT. - DOME OF GLASS - NIGHT

A glowing but not transparent structure stretching off into the
clouds  that press it. CAMERA continues to move in until the
detailed structural  webbing of the dome fills the SCREEN and then
CAMERA MOVES THROUGH IT and  we see

3		EXT. - THE CITY - DAY	

Shining below the dome (which we now see as a series of dome-like
structures standing off without end) -a marvelous crystalline city
of  great openness, building clusters, green plazas, fountains...
multi-leveled  but human scale, crisscrossed by the flickering clear
tubes of the MAZE- CARS.

4		CLOSER ANGLE - ROOFTOPS

As a MAZE-CAR slides softly to a stop.

5		ROOFTOP - THE RUNNER	

The hatch opens and a MAN in a hurry leaves the maze-car and runs
swiftly  along the rooftop and disappears into an open elevator
which instantly  starts to descend.
 
6		INT - RESIDENCE PLAZA - THE ELEVATOR	

From a busy courtyard below we watch the elevator slide down from a
great  height.  As it reaches the courtyard the RUNNER darts out,
pushes into  the crowd.

7 		OUT

8		WITH THE RUNNER

As he reappears around a corner, skirts a brimming pool and makes
for a  kind of broad corridor which seems to lead out of the
courtyard. He is  moving even faster now, glancing back as if he
fears pursuit.

9		ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR						

Above, at the railing of an oval light well, dressed in black and
silver,   a figure holding an odd looking weapon lazily in one hand
-- and watching.  It is FRANCIS.

10		WITH THE RUNNER			

Moving rapidly down the corridor, he suddenly stops as if feeling
the  presence above. He looks up, sees the SANDMAN and his face
breaks in  terror. He wheels, frantic, screaming, runs back into the
hall.

11		THE SANDMAN (FRANCIS)								

Vaulting the rail, dropping lightly to ground level, weapon poised.

12		P.O.V.		

The crowd melting, parting to reveal the Runner backed against the
pool.  People are YELLING, shaking their fists, terribly excited and
fearful.

13		THE SANDMAN			

Emotionless. Aims. Fires.

14		THE RUNNER - CLOSE			

Seeming to burst aflame in the LENS, then slipping BELOW FRAME to
reveal  Francis sauntering forward, holstering his weapon. The crowd
closing in  behind him, applauding, congratulating him.

15		THE SANDMAN		

Arriving at the pool where the body lies, half immersed. He leans
over,  lifts the right hand from the water, revealing a palm with a
black  flowercrystal shape in it. He lets the hand fall back now as
the crowd   CHEERS and APPLAUDS him.

16		EXTREME CLOSE UP - HAND - IN THE WATER - (INSERT)	

Closing in until the crystal fills the SCREEN.

MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

(TITLES END)

17		CLOSE UP - CRYSTAL - (INSERT)		

Clear, sparkling, flower-like. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal


18		INT. - NURSERY CORRIDOR		

The crystal is in the hand of a sleeping INFANT who is behind glass
in  one of many cubicles. Standing outside, looking in, LOGAN, dimly
lit in   the soft glow of the cubicle where the sleeping infant
lies, swaddled and  coccooned in the rosy auto-tender which caters
to the baby's every need.  Faint MUSIC bubbles like distant
laughter.

19		OUT

19X1		LOGAN 			

Logan is twenty-five, strong, virile (yet sensitive) with a kind of
austere grace.

He is somewhat manic...proud...as he peers through the nursery
window  into a kind of foam cocoon which cradles THREE SLEEPING
INFANTS. Logan is  KNOCKING on the soundless glass.

						LOGAN
			Wake up...come on, Logan-6.

19X2		FRANCIS

entering .

						FRANCIS  (shaking	
    					his head in  mild, mocking
	    				disbelief)	
			You are here. I  couldn't 
			believe it when they told me.  
			What are you doing?
	
						LOGAN (still knocking  
	    				on the soundless glass)  
			Turn this way. 
	    				(as one of the infants 
	   				stirs, smiles, bubbles) 
			No,  no...not you...YOU!
	
Francis tries to pull Logan away from the  window, but Logan is
intent on waking one of  the infants.

						FRANCIS               
			You should've seen me take my  
			last Runner...perfect. 
	    				(Logan  continues to pound the  
	     			soundless glass) 
			I backed him  up against a residence 
			pool and  when he terminated...his  
			hand... 
	    				(breaks off as Logan
	    				is paying  no attention)
			So now you've seen him...what's
			the difference awake or asleep?

						LOGAN (to infant)   
			Open your eyes once, idiot.  
					(to Francis) 
			It's not every  day that a Sandman 
			son is  born. I'm telling you, 
			Francis  - that's him!

						FRANCIS    
			Maybe,  maybe not. What's the  
			difference? Come on,  Logan, 
			let's get out of  here before 
			everybody  finds out.

But Logan isn't moving. Francis gets an  idea.

						FRANCIS 
			Okay...you really want to wake 
			him up?

Francis starts to pry at the Panel...knowing it  will sound an
ALARM.

						LOGAN 
			Hey, cut that out !

Too late: There is a SOUND OF ALARM CHIMES. The area in which they
stand  is bathed in a violet glow. Logan grabs Francis firmly and
stops him from  prying at the panel:
 
						LOGAN
			Now you've done it...

The CHIMES STOP...but the glow continues, a metallic VOICE is heard:

						VOICE 
			Break-in scanners report intrusion, 
			identify.

						LOGAN 
			Logan-5...Francis-7, authorized duty
			quadrant. Intrusion accidental.

						VOICE
			Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.

The violet light goes off.


						FRANCIS (with affection:
					to Logan) 
			Had enough?

						LOGAN (looking at the infant)
			Even the alarm didn't wake him.

As Francis starts out:

						LOGAN (one last look; 
					joining Francis)
			All right, Francis...I'm with you.

They move off down the corridor...the lights behind them DIMMING as
they  pass cubicles suffused with soft pink light, CHILDREN
automatically  tended.

CHIMES...soft. A lullaby and a soothing impersonal VOICE.

						VOICE
			Sleep time...go to sleep.
			Sleeping time, little ones.

As they exit Nursery...Logan stops and takes one final look
backward.

						FRANCIS
			You need a lift. Let's go 
			to Arcade and celebrate...
					(teasing tone)
			your alert successor...Logan-6.
 
						LOGAN 
			Has anyone ever broken in to 
			where the babies are?

						FRANCIS 
					(putting a card key into a door 
					which opens soundlessly) 
			Not in my time...

They move through the door which closes.

20		EXT. - MAZE STATION - NIGHT

They are now on a kind of enclosed platform with widely spaced
doorways,  each glowing faintly. They pause, waiting.




						FRANCIS (peering 
					at Logan curiously)
			Why?

						LOGAN 
			just wondered...what happens?

						FRANCIS (shrugs) 
			Dunno...flameout maybe. Whatever 
			happens, you can bet it's final. 
			But who would want to find out?

One of the doorways brightens and the word ARCADE _ appears on it.
The  two men move to the spot as a maze-car stops. They enter it
through the  doorway which dims behind them as the maze-car WHOOSHES
softly off into a  kind of twilight.

21		INT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND FRANCIS

The door slides shut. They sink into seat forms which yield to them.
They   move off.
 
22		EXT. - MAZE- CAR

Moving through the city at terrific speed. Giving us glimpses of the
city  as it goes. slowing finally as we see:

23		THE CITY - FEATURING ARCADE

Brightly lit, garish. We get only a glimpse as the maze-car
disappears  into a tunnel.

24		MAZE-CAR STATION - ARCADE

As the maze-car stops, opens and Logan and Francis exit into   a
gathering  CROWD.

25		FULL SHOT - ARCADE

Glittering, crowded. Throngs of people moving on many levels, some
walking, some on moving platforms. It's The Great White Way, Luna
Park --  you name it. Gaudy booths and entrances, featuring every
delight -- too  much to take in at a glance.

26		WITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS

As they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it
notices them, across halls and up moving platforms, the good-natured
argument continuing...

						LOGAN 
			but you don't know, you Just 
			say what everyone says.  One for 
			one. One for one."

						FRANCIS 
			Well, why no!? That's exactly how
			everything works. How else could 
			the city stay in balance -You have
			a better idea?
 

						LOGAN (laughs)
			No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- 
			instead of doing that "one for one" song 		
			of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher 
			With a stuck tape.

						FRANCIS
			Well the minute you get a better
			idea you can stop wondering.
					(beat)
			You know, Logan -- you wonder 
			a lot. Too much for a Sandman

They are passing the facade of a Relive Shop The signs urging people
to:  RELIVE YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MEMORIES. DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!
REFRESH AND  RENEW ANYTIME!!
 
As they cross the entrance, two men come out, grinning broadly,
falling  into step just ahead of Logan and Francis. Then one of the
men stops  abruptly, almost colliding with them. He mumbles an
apology and starts  back to RELIVE.

As he disappears into the RELIVE SHOP, his friend shrugs cheerfully
to  Logan and Francis and moves on.

27		ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEW YOU

They are moving past a shop called NEW YOU #483 when a man comes
cannonading out, thrilled and excited. He rushes over to a pretty
young  woman who has been eying Logan and Francis, plants himself in
front of  her with his hands framing his face.

						MAN
			Well? How do you like it?

						WOMAN (critically) 
			I don't know. The cheeks maybe...
			look a little -

						MAN 
			Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, 
			you think?

						WOMAN 
			Too little.

						MAN 
			Too little?
					(gestures)
			Too little. Okay, wait for me.

And he darts back into NEW YOU #483. The woman shrugs, glances
around,  smiles and goes off with a passer-by.

28		ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOVE SHOP

Signs promising LOVE, FULFILLMENT, RARE DELIGHTS. People streaming
in and  out. A woman comes out looking glazed, breathing
"yes...yes..." As she  passes CAMERA Logan and Francis emerge from
the crowd and CAMERA moves  with them.

						LOGAN
			Did you ever see Francis-8?

						FRANCIS (shaking his head) 
			I never even visited Nursery before 
			tonight. 
					(beat) 
			When you wonder, it slows you up --
			you know?

They are now passing the facade of HALLUCIMILL where the signs
promise:  LIFT OFF, CRAZY LIFT, SUPER LIFT...here the people going
in are simply  excited but the ones coming out are clearly stoned
out of their minds...

						FRANCIS 
			I don't know what makes you so curious. 
			You have any idea who his seed-mother was?

						LOGAN (quickly) 
			Of course not! I m curious, not sick.
					(laughs)

The crowd is growing denser, funneling into a kind of passageway.
Logan  and Francis are swallowed up in the group.

29		FULL SHOT - ARCADE GREAT HALL

An immense room into which the streams of people coming from the
entertainment area are mingling. There is a general air of
anticipation  stirring the crowd as CAMERA singles out Logan and
Francis entering,  waving to friends. CAMERA closes in on them just
as they reach a  beautiful woman who is obviously pleased to see
Francis. They embrace,  and as they break:

						FRANCIS
			and that's my friend, Logan. 
					(as she acknowledges 
					the introduction)
			We're celebrating his next in line.
			Carousel - Arcade - who knows? 
			Want to come along?

						WOMAN (smiles, shakes her head)
			Only if I make it to the top of
			Carousel.
					(she holds up her hand)
			Thirty -- and the big spin.

In her palm the crystal blinks, red, black. Francis nods, gives her
a  half-squeeze.

						FRANCIS 
			You're thirty -- already? I always 
			thought I was older than you - 
					(beat)
			Well, give it a good try.

						WOMAN (pleasantly) 
			You know I always have.

Another beautiful WOMAN joins them.

						2ND WOMAN (to the first) 
			Sorry I won't be at Carousel tonight. 
			It¹s  my Love-Shop turn.

						WOMAN
			That's all right. Happy turn.

						2ND WOMAN
			You'll renew. I've got a feeling.

 						WOMAN (smiles) 
			So do I...but if I don't at least I'll 
			have the ultimate thrill. I'd almost 
			rather have that than renew.

						2ND WOMAN 
			I feel the same way. Sometimes I think 
			I'm not even going to try and renew when 
			my time comes. But -- that's three years away.
			So long.

The 2nd Woman walks away.

						FRANCIS (after a beat; 
					to first Woman) 
 			It's been nice.

						WOMAN
			Um-huh.

They look briefly and then she turns away. Francis takes Logan's arm
and  they move off.
 
						FRANCIS
			I guess you never had her?

Logan shakes his head.

						FRANCIS
			You missed something special.

						LOGAN
			Well...you can't have them all.

						LOGAN AND FRANCIS 
					(together, it's an old joke)
 			But you can try.

They laugh, but the laughter is broken as a trio of youngsters,
moving  with erratic speed of lightning, smashes between them,
almost knocking  Francis over. He reels, Logan catches him and they
recover in time to see   the trio rip wildly through the crowd,
knocking people down, screaming  with shrill joy as they disappear.

						FRANCIS 
			The damned Yellows are getting out 
			of hand. Those three ought to be in 
			Cathedral. No business scrambling in 
			Arcade...

						LOGAN (laughs 
					cuffs Francis' arm)
			What an old, old man you're getting 
			to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a 
			Yellow? I bet you were even wilder 
			than -
					(he breaks off as the lights 
					in the Great Hall dim) 
			-- come on, Sandman.

The two of them start to move to the far end of the Great Hall.
 
30		FULL SHOT - GREAT HALL

As everyone begins to move to the far end, where great  curtains
have parted to reveal

31		ARCADE GREAT HALL - CAROUSEL ENTRANCE

AC the far end of the hall, where the throng is a huge crystal
design ornaments an entrance  The crystal is red and pulsing
rhythmically to the accompaniment of a deep and thrilling  TONE. As
we move toward it with Logan and Francis, the TONE  deepens, the
great pulse takes on a hypnotic quality...

32		WITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS

In the crowd they overtake a fellow Sandman,  DANIEL, and fall in
step with him. When they  speak now, their voices are hushed.
	
						LOGAN 
			You should have been with us in Nursery,  
			Daniel. I'm positive I  recognized him -

						FRANCIS (hustling
					Logan)
			Come on. I don't want to miss the
			filing-in. There'll be some I know
			tonight, I think...

						DANIEL (glances at his
					own red crystal, nods)
			Yes. Me, too. You know we're
			both on Monitor tonight.
	
						FRANCIS
			Damn! That's right. Just when I
			feel like an ALL OUT BLAST in
			Arcade .
	
						LOGAN
			Want me to take your shift? I'm
			feeling restless anyway
		
Francis glances at him, exchanges a look with Daniel. They vanish
into the throng passing under the great crystal, turn the corner and
we see

33		FULL SHOT - CAROUSEL

framed in a huge corridor we see a steep-sided  arena dropping down
to a shadowy center, which  even now pulsates and flickers in
changing  dimensions, but always maintaining the jewel- flower
shape. There is one entrance into the center -- a kind of ramp from
below the seats, leading directly into the mysterious bowl --	
Just now the seat's are filling, and the sense of expectation builds
People sit and immediately crane their necks, waiting...

34.		ANOTHER ANGLE

Featuring Logan and Francis as they find places in the arena. Like
the others, they crane upward. As they do, Logan gestures at a
number of pretty girls who are just being seated.

						LOGAN 
			Now there's a few who could have been 
			his seed-mother.
	
						FRANCIS 
			Only a few? You're just not trying.

35-36	    OUT

37		PANNING THE CROWD

As the seats fill, the excitement builds. Suddenly the lights begin
to dim and dim...

SOUND: A kind of collective sigh, breathing in unison...

38 		OUT

38X1		ANGLE THE TIER BELOW THE SEATS

Suddenly visible, the LASTDAY GROUP. Their arms are upraised and in
each palm the crystal blinks red-black, red-black.

39		THE CROWD	

Transfixed, gripped with a religious fervor.

40		LASTDAY GROUP	

Hands still raised, filing slowly into the mysterious well of
Carousel.

41		CROWD

Tense, beginning nervous APPLAUSE here and there.

42		CAROUSEL

As the last one enters, beginning to glow and, as it does, the bowl
slowly puts out leaves like some great plant, enfolding and hiding
the people within a series of translucent petals. As the Last one
enfolds them the Light intensifies, the exterior surfaces seeming to
shift as if a kind of motion was beginning inside it...

43		CROWD

Visible in the growing Light from Carousel -gripped with passion and
excitement, APPLAUDING, gesturing as they see

44		CAROUSEL

Moving, bands of light seeming to spiral upward Like a contained
aurora as the Carousel picks up speed.

45		LOGAN

Caught up in it Like the rest.

46		CAROUSEL

Beginning to blur with its own speed. Through the shifting,
spiraling curtain of light we see bodies moving in a kind of
weightlessness, always struggling to move higher.

Follow a shadowy form as it moves, twists through other writhing
shadows -- upward, upward. Suddenly the form is spread-eagled, and
in a moment it is sharply outlined against the swirling canopy and
then -- a searing flash. And it is gone.
		
SOUND: Crowd in a frenzy -- SCREAMING.

47		FULL ANGLE - THE BLEACHER CROWD - FAVORING LOGAN

Standing. SCREAMING their cheers as:

48		FULL SHOT - UP AT CAROUSEL

High, reaching downward out of the shadows beneath the dome,
fringing, intersecting rainbow bands appear, looping the swirling
upper Carousel like Saturn's rings. Now we see figures reaching
outward toward them...reaching and missing and falling -downward
against the curtain and the flash of extinction.

49		MEDIUM ANGLE - A MAN		

At the highest level...straining for the rainbow...

50		SWEEPING PAN SHOT - THE BLEACHER CROWD	

Hysterical...starting to chant...

						CROWD 
			Renew!

The man continues to strain:

						CROWD 
			Renew!

51		CLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN		

Almost a blur...but still straining:
		
						CROWD'S CHANT
			Renew!

52		CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS

						LOGAN AND FRANCIS
					(chanting with the rest) 
			Renew!

53		CLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN		

The blur...but still there...straining with all his might for the
rainbow...

						CROWD'S CHANT 
			Re...

Suddenly, the man...topples into the whirling blackness
below...where he is instantly incinerated.

54		WIDE ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL	

Whirling - whirling - the rainbows shining.

55		WIDE ANGLE - THE BLEACHERS		

Orgiastic pleasure -- a Spanish crowd at a perfect killing --
SCREAMING, fulfilled.

56 		OUT

57		FULL ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL
Other figures move to the topmost level...straining for the rainbow
bands.

58		CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS			

As the SCREAMING goes on in the b.g. of the SHUT... we hear a
BUZZING noise. Logan reaches into a pocket and takes out a small,
dark plastic box.

Logan looks at the box. On it we see:

			MAN: RELIVE STORE 14		
			
					 	LOGAN 
					(to Francis)	
			Looks like I'm working.
		
Francis stands.
		
						LOGAN
			Who invited you?

						FRANCIS
			I'm in my party mood.
		
Logan smiles . . . and the CAMERA PANS them rushing out of the
bleachers.

They make their way into the hall.

Logan takes out the small plastic box. We can tell from his face
that he is disappointed...until a faint BEEPING SOUND emanates from
the box.

Francis watches as Logan wheels in one direction... the beeping
stops. He turns in another direction... again, there is no beeping.

As Logan turns in a third direction...the BEEPING commences.
Logan and Francis move swiftly in that direction and the BEEPING
GROWS LOUDER...AND LOUDER...until Logan and Francis see:

59-
59X11	    WIDE ANGLE - A MAN 		

running.

CHASE: INTER CUT between Logan and Francis following the running man
in the great hall...empty. We can HEAR the CROWD SCREAMING in
Carousel offstage.

A. Logan and Francis separate...to encircle the running man.

B. The running man turns a corner and for a moment Logan cannot see
him.

C. As Logan turns the corner...Francis is on the other side and
FIRES at the running man...JUST MISSING HIM.

D.Francis winks at Logan as he pursues the running man up a ramp
and Logan gets it:  A little cat and mouse is in order.	

(NOTE: THE CHASE WILL BE THE DIRECTOR'S OPTION.)

E. Logan FIRES... just missing the man...Francis FIRES again. . .
just missing, too.

F. The man is in a panic as he continues up the ramp...to various
levels and areas.

G. Both barrels (of Logan and Francis' respective guns) glow again
as they FIRE...with both just missing the running man once more.

H. The man's face is crazed...and sweating...the mouse is going
berserk as he has been chased to a high level.

I. He stands frozen, petrified, driven to the edge of a high balcony
by the shots--teetering now. He is in full sight of Logan, Francis
is across the hall.

J. The Runner¹s face. He looks at death twenty feet away--Logan
aims.

K. Francis, watching, smiling at the perfect moment.

L. Logan's face. A shadow of thought, a hesitation.

M. The Runner lunges. Logan fires, misses.

N. Francis fires a salvo, drives the Runner back to the rail where
he teeters again, throws his hands in front of his face and plunges.
The SCREAMING in Carousel reaches a peak.

59X12-
63X1		    OUT

63X2		WITH LOGAN	

As he arrives at the dead body of the Runner, bends over him, turns
the man's left hand up. We see the flower crystal. Black.
Logan takes out his transceiver.

63X3		INSERT TRANSCEIVER			

A man's face visible. Logan checks it against the face of the dead
man. They are not the same.
	
63X4		ANOTHER ANGLE	

As Francis comes up, waits. Logan moves the transceiver to the dead
man's face, rests it on his forehead.

63X5		INSERT TRANSCEIVER READOUT:

The words appear: IDENT. AFFIRM....NEW YOU #483 ALTERATION

63X6		LOGAN

Scowls for a moment, then shrugs. He takes out a small flat pouch
and methodically strips from the body its few personal things,
stuffs them into the pouch. Then his eye is caught by the man's
right hand, clenched. Logan opens it. A metal ankh on a bit of
chain. It means nothing to Logan who stuffs it into the pouch and
closes it. Now again he fiddles with the transceiver, speaks into it
softly.

						LOGAN
			Runner terminated 0:31
					(a beat)
			Ready for cleanup.

Done with his job, he rises to face Francis.

						LOGAN 
					(smiling)
			That was a great shot you made.
	
						FRANCIS
			Yes.
					(beat)
			But you look a little rusty to me --
			what were you doing, wondering?

Logan shrugs. He's not sure himself. Together they walk off down the
hall, passing CAMERA
	
63X7		ANOTHER ANGLE

We see in the distance, a pair of Stickmen descending into the hall,
riding through the air on their odd vehicles, passing overhead then
descending. One hovers not far away as the other comes down, hangs a
few feet over the body.

63X8		1ST STICKMAN AND BODY	

The driver makes sure he's in position, then presses a button on one
of the arms of the vehicle. There is a broad spray of vapor from the
bottom which covers the corpse.	
					
63X9		CORPSE (INSERT)

It turns to crystals which sag away from the human form, as a sand
sculpture erodes when it's dry.

63X10		1ST STICKMAN CLOSE ON HEAP OF CRYSTALS

Satisfied, he revs his machine and it rises smoothly out of the
SHOT. As it leaves, the second machine moves down and into its
place.
		
63X11		2ND STICKMAN

Glances at the crystals, maneuvers into position, presses his
buttons.
			
63X12		CLOSER ANGLE - THE CRYSTALS, STICKMAN

Sucked up into the machine as it hovers. As the floor is once again
bare, the 2nd Stickman revs slightly and his machine pulls up and
away.
			
63X13		ANOTHER ANGLE	

As the Stickmen move up and out, we see the exhilarated crowd
beginning to pour out of Carousel.

63X14		LOGAN AND FRANCIS - ARCADE

Descending from the top level -- not much of a crowd. Francis is
gesturing toward the Hallucimill.

						FRANCIS 
			...Well I think you're getting stale. 
			You need old Lucey--Go on. Gee the whole 
			burn--try the new psycho-lift-they tell 
			me it turns you inside out...

He shoves Logan in that direction and continues on down.

						FRANCIS 
					(calling after him)
			I'll look for you here when I'm off--

And he is gone.
	
63X15		LOGAN

waves, smiling, then turns to the Hallucimill.

63X16		POV - HALLUCIMILL EXT.

Crazy, man.

63X17		BACK TO LOGAN	

Hesitates, as a COUPLE push past him gleefully on their way. He
looks and we see:
		
63X18		POV - ARCADE, UPPER LEVELS	

The people from Carousel starting to pour in, loud, happy, ready for
more fun.

63X19		LOGAN		
Not with it. He turns and starts making his way downwards towards
the exit.

63X20		LOGAN'S APARTMENT	

As he enters. Idle, restless. He crosses to a sideboard--makes
himself a drink, sips, doesn't like it. Gets rid of it, makes
another. He fiddles with things, a game--sits, gets up. Now he is
beginning to feel the drink. Takes another belt, smiles. Now he goes
over to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials.

63X21		AT THE WALL RECESS		

As Logan dials, blurred and smoky images appear in the recess--a
slow protoplasmic eddying in many colors. He tunes it in and the
figure of a smiling young man appears--bejeweled, lustrous, willing.

63X22		LOGAN AT THE CONSOLE	

Bored as Mastroianni turns the dial again and the young man
dissolves. He dials again and now a beautiful young woman takes
shape. It is Jessica.
		
63X23		JESSICA AND LOGAN

Still in the recess, she makes no gesture of interest, no smile.
Around her neck, from a collar, a dangling ankh. It catches Logan's
eye. He smiles, clicks another dial and she becomes real. He reaches
out a hand and leads her out into the room.

64		LOGAN AND JESSICA

As Jessica turns to him, Logan moves in strongly and embraces her-
but, to his surprise, she resists. Logan, still holding her loosely,
is amused and surprised.

						LOGAN
			What's wrong, Available?

						JESSICA 
					(breaking away gently) 
			Please . . .No.

She backs away, almost apologetically. Logan follows, smiling.

						LOGAN
			Please . . . no ?
					(noting that she looks trapped,
					he understands)
			You mean "not here"--that's it?
			You're a private Available but
			particular,
					(he is moving in on her
					as he speaks, she retreating, 
					which amuses him)
			Don't worry. There's no one here but me. 
			And you.

						JESSICA 
			No. 
					(that stops him) 
			Just no.

						LOGAN 
			You prefer women?

						JESSICA 
			No.

						LOGAN
			Well then...?

						JESSICA
			Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself
			on the circuit. It was a mistake.

						LOGAN 
			Sad? What made you sad?
	
						JESSICA 		
			A friend of mine went on Carousel		
			tonight. Now he's gone.	
		
						LOGAN 
					(after a beat)
			Yes...probably he was renewed?

						JESSICA 
					(flatly)
			He was killed

						LOGAN
			Killed? Why do you use that word?

						JESSICA
			Isn't it right? Isn't that what
			you do? Kill.

						LOGAN
			I never 'killed' anybody in my life.
			Sandmen terminate  Runners
					(a beat)
			Who brought you?

						JESSICA 
			Nobody. I felt sad. .. I put myself
			on the circuit.

						LOGAN
			You felt sad. What's your name?

						JESSICA
			Jessica.

						LOGAN 
					(matter-of-fact)
			You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
	
						JESSICA
			No.
		
						LOGAN
			Later.

						JESSICA
			No.	

						LOGAN
			But you put yourself on the circuit!

						JESSICA
			I thought I had to do something.
		
						LOGAN			
			And?				

						JESSICA
			I changed my mind

						LOGAN
			And now?
	
						JESSICA
			Curious.

						LOGAN
			About what?
							
						JESSICA
			How a Sandman lives.

Logan smiles, takes off gunbelt, etc.

						LOGAN
			Let's have sex.
					(as Jessica shakes her head)
			I thought you were curious.
						
						JESSICA
			Not about that.

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat)
			I'm listening.

						JESSICA
			I'm afraid to tell you.

						LOGAN 
					(smiling)
			I'm not armed.
					(a beat)
			Well?

						JESSICA
			Why is it wrong to run?				

						LOGAN
			You shouldn't even think such things...
					(smiles)
			And you picked a strange person to
			say them to - 
		
						JESSICA
			I suppose. But what if you want
			to live?

						LOGAN
			So? Do what everyone does. Try
			like hell for renewal.

Logan stretches out his right hand. We see a red flower crystal
embedded and centered in his right palm. It is exactly the same
shape that we have seen in black in the palm of the dead runner.

						LOGAN
			When this turns black...that's it.
					(laughs) 
			If for any reason you want to be 31...
			you have the same chance as everyone 
			else...Carrousel.

Logan takes his gun and points it at her.

						LOGAN 		(playfully) 
			But if you're one of the misfits... 
			that's where I come in.

						JESSICA (somewhat
					frightened)
			I didn't say that I would run...
			I Just...

						LOGAN (interrupting;
					turning over her palm)
			Are you a 5 or a 6?
					(we see a green crystal)

						JESSICA
			Six. I go red next year.

						LOGAN
			You're years away . . . I don't know
			why you're thinking of these things,
			much less talking about them.
					(offering Jessica the gun) 
			Want to try?

Jessica shakes her head. Logan looks at Jessica carefully...in an
admiring sexual way...from her toes to her head...briefly noticing
(in the process) chat she is wearing an identical piece of jewelry
that he has taken off the dead runner...around her neck.

						LOGAN
			What Quad do you live in?

						JESSICA 
			K.

						LOGAN (softly)
			You're sure you don't want to try?

Jessica nods.

						LOGAN 	
			It's nice to know you can nod.	

Jessica smiles.

						LOGAN
			It's nice co know you can do that,
			too.
	
Suddenly Francis and two dishevel led young WOMEN burst in and come
laughing toward Logan and Jessica Stoned, hilarious, they crowd
around Logan one of them embracing him. In the wild hilarity,
Jessica slips away and Logan, seeing her go, makes a vain effort
after her. Francis notices, laughs. Amid the noise he shouts to
Logan:
	
						FRANCIS
			These are for me -- you've got your
			own.
					(looking after Jessica)
			She must have been something--?
	
At Logan's expression he roars with laughter Francis picks up an
atomizer and hurls it at the ceiling where it shatters and a great
pink cloud settles over them all.

64X1		EXT. - SAND MAN H.Q.

A frowning structure of dark stone and mirrored copper, fronted by
broad steps. Logan and Francis are climbing the steps as a SANDMAN
is coming out... His uniform is in tatters. They greet one another...then:

						LOGAN
			What happened to you?

						SANDMAN (embarrassed)
			I lost a Runner in Cathedral.

						LOGAN
			How come?

						SANDMAN
			Ran into some Cubs I couldn't manage. 
					(as they stare)
			One of them cut me bad... 
					(extends his arm and moves 
					a finger from his shoulder to 
					his wrist)
			all the way down.
					
						FRANCIS
					(with anger)	
			CUBS!	
		
						SANDMAN (shrug)
			On my way to the New You for repairs.

						LOGAN 
			Get yourself a new face while you're 
			at it They know you now.

They wave. Logan and Francis continue.

64AX1-
64BX1	    OUT
		
64CX1		INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. LOBBY (VOICE OVER)

As Logan and Francis cross, turn into a corridor.
		
						LOGAN
			I just might look in on New You 483
			myself.

						FRANCIS 
			You? Why? You're already beautiful.

						LOGAN 
			No -- it's that last Runner -- someone 
			in 483 was trying to help him.

64X2		INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - READY ROOM

As Logan and Francis cross the room, Logan nods to other Sandmen,
who are monitoring areas of the Megalopolis on video consoles. One
of these Sand-men speaks to Francis who hasn't greeted them

					SANDMAN (Monitor)
			What's with you, Francis?
	
					FRANCIS (touching his
				head; grimacing)
			Last night
		
The other Sandmen, including Logan, smile as Logan and Francis
continue to:

65-68	OUT

69		INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - DEBRIEFING AREA

Black door opens revealing Logan and Francis who now enter a mammoth
room. As they walk. . . they pass FOUR GIANT LIFECLOCKS...WHITE,
YELLOW GREEN AND RED.
 	  
Each LIFECLOCK pulses out the moments of every person alive in the
city, governing everyone's crystal changes automatically shifting to
the next LIFECLOCK when the time comes.

There are no humans.

Francis walks over to a circular table at the end of the room....
above which is a circular overhang. There is a groove...the shape of
a palm crystal on one part of the circular table.

Francis takes out the plastic bag which contains the contents of the
dead Runner's pockets and starts putting the contents on the table.
(These contents are the ones from the Runner Francis has killed at
the beginning of the film.)

The moment the first item touches the table...it activates a scanner
on the overhang above.	
			
Francis stands alongside the table...his attitude is very matter-of
fact. He has been through this procedure many, many times.
He touches his head...(the hangover)...and Logan smiles. Moments
later...the scanner stops...the word:
	|	
			IDENTIFY

appears on a SCREEN. Francis places his palm into the groove. . .
and the words:
	
			CLEAR
			FRANCIS-7

appear on the SCREEN.

						FRANCIS
			See you in the hydrotoner!
		
Logan nods.

Francis exits as Logan places the contents of a plastic bag with the
items he has taken off the Runner who jumped to his death. Among
them is the odd-shaped piece of jewelry.

Logan is standing nonchalantly...as the scanner moves over the
items...waiting to be quickly identified and cleared as Francis was
earlier.

The scanner continues scanning.

Logan starts becoming impatient...but the scanning goes on and on
and on.

Now...Logan is clearly puzzled...it has never...ever taken anything
remotely resembling this length of time.

Suddenly, directly before him...on the SCREEN... the word:

		PROBABILITY

blinks on and off...on and off...catching Logan's attention. As
Logan turns toward the SCREEN...the scanner stops moving. The word
PROBABILITY blinks off and is replaced by the word:
	
		APPROACH

We can tell from Logan's expression as he walks to the corner. . .
that he has never seen this before.
		
Logan sits in a chair in the area facing the SCREEN. There is a
stellar groove (that we have seen on the Table) the shape of a palm
crystal....glowing on an arm of the chair.

The word on the SCREEN is now:

		IDENTIFY

Logan places his right palm with the flower crystal into the groove.
We hear a HUMMING NOISE....then: The piece of jade Jewelry appears
on the SCREEN and below the piece of jewelry the following words
appear on the SCREEN:

		OBJECT OCCURS IN NONRANDOM 
		PATTERN AND FREQUENCY. LINKED 
		WITH OBSOLETE WORD: SANCTUARY. 
		PROBABLE EXISTENCE ESTABLISHED. 
		QUESTION: IDENTIFY OBJECT?

						LOGAN
			Negative. Question: What is it?
	
Words on SCREEN now read:

		PREMILLENNIAL SYMBOL.
		NAME: ANKH. QUESTION:
		IDENTIFY CONCEPT SANCTUARY?

						LOGAN
			Negative.

Words on SCREEN now read:

		SANCTUARY: CODE WORD PREMILL-
		ENNIAL RELIGIONS DENOTING 
		PLACE OF IMMUNITY.

						LOGAN
			I don't understand?

Words on SCREEN now read:

		SANCTUARY NOW MATHEMATICALLY 
		RELATED TO UNACCOUNTED 
		CITIZENS NUMBERING 1056.
			
						LOGAN
			Question:

Word on SCREEN now reads:	

		HOLD
	
It disappears and words on SCREEN now read:

		OBJECT ANKH ASSOCIATED 
		WITH UNACCOUNTED CITIZENS 1056. 
		CONCLUSION SANCTUARY EXISTENT.... 
		RUNNER GOAL.

						LOGAN 
			1056 unaccounted for?!

Word on SCREEN reads:

		CORRECT

						LOGAN
			Impossible!
					(Rising tone) 
			Question: Maybe they weren't all Runners. 
			Maybe most of them reached Life Renewal 
			on Carousel.

Words on SCREEN read:

		NEGATIVE...UNACCOUNTED
		CITIZENS 1056...

						LOGAN 
			Question: None of them reached renewal?

Word on SCREEN reads:

		ZERO

						LOGAN
			But everyone believes that some....

Words on SCREEN read:

		ANSWER: ZERO
		UNACCOUNTED CITIZENS
		NUMBER 1056....LOGAN-
		5 ASSIGNED TO LOCATE
		SANCTUARY AND REPORT....

						LOGAN 
			Question: You mean nobody's ever 
			been renewed?

Words on SCREEN read:

		- - QUESTION ANSWERED....
		ZERO....ECOLOGICAL-NEGATIVE...

As Logan reacts the new words which appear read:	
			
		AUTHORIZATION TO	
		PENETRATE CITY SEALS...

						LOGAN (startled)
			The Seal......
					(Breaks off)
			Question: The Seals? Go outside?!
			But there's nothing outside!

The words on the SCREEN read:

		SANCTUARY DESTRUCT...
		FIND		
		DESTROY

						LOGAN
			I will.
	
The words on the SCREEN read:

		ASSIGNMENT SECRET.

						LOGAN
			Question:
					(a beat)
			What if I need help from another
			Sandman?

The words on the SCREEN read:

		NEGATIVE. REPEAT: ASSIGNMENT 
		SECRET. LOGAN-5 TRANSFER TO 
		RUNNER SEEKING SANCTUARY.
		
Logan takes a breath.

						LOGAN
			Question: I am six Red...how can
			I pretend to be approaching Lastday?

The words on the SCREEN read:

		LIFECLOCK--ALTER

						LOGAN
			My Lifeclock...
					(slightest beat)
			Question: My Life-- 

Before the startled Logan can finish...he feels a shock of pain and
his hand is immobile. Logan stares at the back of his hand as if it
wasn't his. His forehead shines with sweat.

Now the entire area, including the chair and the screen begins to
glow bright red. The glowing becomes so bright that Logan is forced
to close his eyes.

As the glow subsides...Logan looks at his right hand. The red flower
crystal in his palm is blinking. He stares at it, fascinated,
fearful.
			
						LOGAN
			Question:
					(urgent tone)
			Am I still six Red?
			
The words on the SCREEN read:

		LIFECLOCK-ALTER

						LOGAN (standing)
			I know that but I had four more years
				(extending the blinking palm)
			This means ten days to Lastday.
			Of course I will get the four years
			back, won't I?

The words on the SCREEN read:

		TAKE OBJECT WITH YOU

						LOGAN (very urgent) 
			Question: Do I get my four years back?

Too late. The SCREEN is BLANK. For a moment his lips part as if to
say something more but he changes his mind, turns away.

Now Logan walks over to the table and removes the ankh. Almost
automatically, he starts moving his hand toward the groove...but the
SCREEN already has the words:

		CLEAR LOGAN-5

Logan looks at it - then:

The CAMERA PANS Logan out of the mammoth room.... past the GIANT
LIFECLOCKS....where he pauses.... glances at his BLINKING
CRYSTAL....and continues out into:

69X1		INT. - HYDROTONER - DAY	

Spectacularly 23rd century. Logan enters. He looks around and spots
Francis.... in a whirlpool bath....trying to recover from has
incredible hangover.

In the b.g. of the SHOT we can see some Sandmen doing calisthenics.
Logan walks over to Francis....hiding his blinking crystal by
holding his hand against his leg.
						
						FRANCIS
			What the hell took you so long?

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat) 
			Did you ever see anybody renew?

						FRANCIS 
			I think you've been skulling out too 
			much. First Nursery and now stupid 
			questions.

						LOGAN 
			Did you?

						FRANCIS 
			Of course.

						LOGAN 
			Anybody we know?

						FRANCIS 
			Look....why don't you get into the 
			water....you need it....more than I do.

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat) 
			I'm fine....
					(walking away)
			See you....

						FRANCIS 
			At Carousel tonight?

Logan nods, exits. The CAMERA REMAINS on a slightly puzzled FRANCIS
for a moment then FOLLOW Logan out to:

70		EXT. - SANDMAN BUILDING	

Logan is on the steps, irresolute. He looks at his blinking
crystal...moves as if to reenter, changes his mind. Now takes out
the black box, dials.

						LOGAN 
					(into box)
			Location...female Green Six...
			name Jessica...living in Quad K.

71-73 	OUT

73X1		INT. - LOGAN'S APARTMENT	

Logan opens the door to see Jessica. Behind her a young SANDMAN who
has obviously escorted her there.

						YOUNG SANDMAN (smiling)
			She says she's been here before...

						LOGAN
			She has.

Jessica half turns and shrugs a 'see?'. The young Sandman's smile
widens, he waves to Logan and shoves off.

						JESSICA
			You could have called me yourself.

						LOGAN
			But I wasn't sure you'd come.

						JESSICA 
					(the game has started)
			Here I am. 
					(beat)
			Shall I come in?

Logan gestures, leading her inside to the living area.

						LOGAN
			I couldn't get you out of my mind.

						JESSICA
			I'm the most beautiful woman you've
			ever seen, I suppose?

						LOGAN
			Maybe...sure....

						JESSICA
			Thanks...but I have the choice.
				
						LOGAN	
			Of course.		
						
						JESSICA	
			Then it's still no.

Logan laughs.

						JESSICA	
			You can have any woman in the city.				
			What do you really want?				

						LOGAN
			You know

						JESSICA
			I don't believe you. There has to
			be more.

						LOGAN
			All right.

Logan extends his right hand. He turns his right palm so that.
Jessica can see it blinking red.

Jessica gasps for a moment...then:

						JESSICA
			Why show me?

						LOGAN
			I'm going to run.

						JESSICA (after
					reacting)
			Why tell me?

						LOGAN
			You know something.
	
						JESSICA
			About running, dying what?

						LOGAN
			Both...running's what I'm interested
			in.

						JESSICA
			I know what everyone knows. Try
			like hell for Renewal. You have
			the same chance everyone else has.

						LOGAN
			It's different now. Help me.

						JESSICA
			How can I?

Logan takes out the ankh.

						JESSICA
			Where did you get that?

						LOGAN
			A Runner gave it to me.

						JESSICA 	
			And then you killed him, right?				

						LOGAN
			I let him go...believe me.

						JESSICA
			I don't..

						LOGAN (a beat)
			Speak to your friends for me, Jessica...
			please...

						JESSICA
			Please? What friends?

						LOGAN 
				(clutching the ankh, looking 
				at Jessica's; then:)
			I don't have much time.

						JESSICA
			I never heard of a Sandman running
			. . . ever. . .

						LOGAN (putting the
			ankh in his pocket;
			dropping the bombshell)
			And I never heard of Sanctuary.

Jessica reacts. She is about to speak. . .doesn't..

Logan reaches out and touches her hand.

						LOGAN
			What can I do to make you believe me?

Jessica draws her hand away quickly from his touch.

Logan stands and starts out...as Jessica watches him..

74-81	OUT 

82		EXT. - A SLEEK, OUTDOOR RESTAURANT - NIGHT

There are three men and a woman seated at a table. Jessica reaches
the table and sits down.

83		CLOSE ON - LOGAN	

A distance away...watching.

84-85 	OUT	 

86		EXT. - RESTAURANT - FULL ANGLE - THE THREE MEN,
		WOMAN AND JESSICA

Eating without enthusiasm...obviously more interested in their
conversation.

						SECOND MAN 
			He's blinking...so what? Sandmen get 
			old, too.

						FIRST MAN
			But what if he's telling the truth?

						THIRD MAN
			I say no. It's not worth the risk.

						WOMAN
			I absolutely agree. He's killed Runners 
			for a decade. He has no feelings.

						JESSICA
			He was born a Sandman. He had no
			choice.

						WOMAN 
			Neither do we.

87-88 	OUT

88X1		SANDMAN READY ROOM	

Four Sandmen at the consoles. They look up as Francis enters. He 
goes to one of the men who stretches, yawns, gets up.
		
						1ST SANDMAN
			Thanks, Francis.
		
						FRANCIS (taking his
					place at the console)
			Just don't be forever about it like last 
			time.

						1ST SANDMAN
			Ah-h you love it. You're afraid
			you'll miss a really good Run.		

They all laugh. Francis takes up his watch as the other exits.

89 OUT

89X1		EXT - RESTAURANT - THREE MEN A WOMAN AND JESSICA

Leaning together talking in an undertone
			
						SECOND MAN (urgently)	
			If he believes you, he'll come.	
			
						JESSICA	
			Why Arcade Station?
			
						SECOND MAN (impatiently)
			Why? It's our only chance--kill him
			and get away in the crowd heading
			for the evening slaughter --
				
						JESSICA
			Right at the station itself?

						MAN
			No - just there - on the first level.
					(beat)
			Don't look for us. We'll see you.

						WOMAN (cutting in)
			You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.
					(beat)
			Can you do it? Will you?

Slowly, Jessica nods.

						THIRD MAN
			Tonight?

						JESSICA (stalling)
			Y-yes...if I can find him.

						WOMAN
			I think you can. Don't you?

Jessica faces her squarely, nods. The woman looks deeply into her
eyes, relaxes.

						WOMAN  
			I'm sorry. We all are. But he has heard 
			about Sanctuary -- and that makes him 
			dangerous to all of us.

After murmurs of agreement:

						SECOND MAN 
					(staring at Jessica) 
			We're counting on you.

Jessica exits. They look at each other in dismay.. After a moment,
one of the men follows her. They don't trust her.

90-92	OUT

93-94 	OUT

94A1		READY ROOM - FRANCIS	

Obviously enjoying the work, watching--tracking a Runner's progress,
the assignment of a Sandman, the kill.
	
94X1		WITH JESSICA		

Making her way through the strolling crowd, her face thoughtful.

94X2		ANOTHER ANGLE

The man from the restaurant, following.

94X3		GALLERY, SANDMAN RESIDENCE -- JESSICA

Walking slowly up to a door, she hesitates, KNOCKS.

Logan opens the door, reacts.

						LOGAN
			Are you here to help me?
	
						JESSICA
			What do you need?

A moment, then Logan moves toward her hungrily, pulling her in to
him as the door closes.

94X4 	OUT

DISSOLVE TO:
		
94X5		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

Walking along a handsomely landscaped stream. Laughing together,
stopping to admire the beautiful fish (koi).

						JESSICA
			What're you going to do?

						LOGAN
			That's tomorrow.

						JESSICA 
					(turning away slightly)
			I wish I could help you.

						LOGAN 
					(turning her gently back)
			Maybe you'll chink of something...

						JESSICA 
					(hating herself)		
			I wish I knew what you think I know.		

Logan smiles at her, both knowing what's false, but drawn to each
other anyhow. They commence walking again.
		
94X6		ANOTHER ANGLE		

The followers, ahead now, watching, trying to make up their minds as
to whether Jessica is bringing Logan to the ambush. As they argue,
Logan and Jessica approach.

94X7		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA	

						LOGAN
			If you did know, you'd tell me.
					
						JESSICA
			Of course--

						LOGAN (overriding)
			If you trusted me, you'd know.
				
						JESSICA (evading it)
			We're coming to Arcade.
					(beat)	-
			Shall we Relive together?
	
94X8		CLOSE ANGLE

As they pass, Jessica looks full in the face of one of the
followers, looks away. Logan does not notice. The followers are
partly reassured. One of the men is now holding a garrote made from
his necklace. The man who first followed gestures and the others go
off purposefully. He continues after Logan and Jessica as they exit
round a corner.

94X9 	OUT

94AX9	READY ROOM	

As 1st Sandman returns, still cheerfully chewing. Francis is
reluctant to give up his place and when he does, he remains standing
there, watching. He loves the work--they all do.

94X10	ARCADE - LOWER LEVEL	

Logan and Jessica entering. Logan is aware of Jessica's increasing
tension. He pretends unconcern, but he is wary.

94X11	ANOTHER ANGLE

Behind them, visible through the crowd--two of the men we saw
before. The Follower and the man with the garrote. They are moving
so as to intersect with Logan and Jessica where the crowd is
thickest, streams coming together to move to a higher level.

94X12	FEATURING JESSICA	

As they move, fearful--torn between her promise and her feeling for
Logan. Catching a glimpse of the followers, she makes a small sound,
hesitates, pretends to have stumbled.

94X13	THE AMBUSHERS	

Closer now, closing in -- the wire garrote gleaming between the
man's hands.
	
94X14	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Suddenly she stops. He comes round facing as people eddy by them.
Logan looks at her searchingly.

						LOGAN 
			Tell me, Jessica.

Behind him the two men move in. The man with the garrote raises his
hands. One more step... Logan senses something, half-turns just as
we hear a familiar urgent SOUND--the sound of his transceiver.
Behind him the man hesitates, drops his hands. Logan takes the
transceiver from his belt and moves out of the crowd to the side,
Jessica with him. Now he bends to read the message and Jessica
cranes her head to see too.
	
94X15	READY ROOM - FRANCIS AND SANDMEN

As the Runner alarm pulses and the readout flashes its message: 

		RUNNER FEMALE: CATHEDRAL Q-2
		...LOGAN-5

The Sandman at the console turns and says:		

						1ST SANDMAN
			Hey, Logan's got a mean one tonight--
			why don't you--

But Francis is already at the door. A wave and he's gone. The others
ad lib interest-- "watch out in there--they can cut you before you
see them" etc.

95-105 	OUT

105X1	ARCADE STATION - THE AMBUSH	

The two watching, muscles taut -- wondering.

106-
106X1	OUT

106X2	ARCADE - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA	

As he speaks he leads her into the maze-car station and punches out
his destination on the car caller.

						LOGAN
			A Runner...Cathedral. A woman.

106X3	MAZE-CAR STATION ARCADE	

						JESSICA
			You're not going, are you?
		
						LOGAN (a beat)
			Why not? Maybe she'll help me.
			You won't. You'd better stay here.

The maze-car arrives and they move to it.
	
						JESSICA (touching his
					arm)
			I'd rather be with you.
	
						LOGAN (knowing she is
					lying through her teeth)
			That's nice.
		
They enter the car which instantly moves off. As it passes, the men
in ambush come forward and read the destination. They ring for
another car which pulls in immediately.

107-
109X1 	OUT
		
109X2	ANOTHER ANGLE	

As the two jam into the maze-car which rockets off in pursuit...

110-
120 		OUT

121		INT - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND JESSICA - MOVING SHOT

						LOGAN
			Have you ever been through Cathedral?

Jessica shakes her head.

						LOGAN
			They're like beasts. Wild.
	
						JESSICA		
			Maybe they're angry because they're
			grown in meccano-breeders.

						LOGAN (interrupting,
					grimacing) 
			Instead of what? Nine months inside a 
			woman:
					(ugh) 
			We're all raised the same but most of 
			us don't become cubs in Cathedral.

						JESSICA 
			Some people say children need human 
			mothering.

						LOGAN 
			Insane. Nurseries are better than any 
			mother could be.

						JESSICA 
			I'm only telling you what I've heard...
					(slightest beat) 
			Haven't you ever wondered what your 
			seed-mother was Like...?

						LOGAN 
			Uh-uh.

						JESSICA 
			I have.

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat) 
			When did you begin to question Lastday?

						JESSICA 
			I don't remember exactly...except I was 
			a Green.
					(another beat) 
			What would you like to relive, Logan?

						LOGAN (smiling)
			Let's see - how long has it been?

As Jessica turns her head...looking somewhat guilty, the maze-car
slides to a stop.

A warning light pulses on the car's console and a RECORDED VOICE
speaks before the hatch opens.

						VOICE			
			Attention passengers. Cathedral		
			Station is a personal risk area.	
			Persons with business are warned
			to be careful.

121X1	EXT. - MAZE-CAR - CATHEDRAL STATION	

Now the hatch opens. They step out, Logan first, Jessica timidly,
looking around. Behind them the hatch closes, the maze-car sighs
away into the distance.

						JESSICA
			I've never been in this quadrant.
					(looks off)
			Is that Arcade off there?
		
There are standing on the maze-car platform -- a high overlook like
an "elevated" station.
		
121X2	POV - THE CITY BEYOND THE WALLS OF CATHEDRAL

Arcade shining like distant fireworks.

122		EXT. - MAZE-CAR M PLATFORM - CATHEDRAL

Below them a narrow, sharply angled concrete canyon, buttressed
walls rising featureless. The look of an old fortress, blank, dim
and cool. Still visible over an opening the chiseled legend
"Cathedral Plaza--2025 A.D.--Skidmore, Rosenfelt, Hennesy
architects."

Jessica shivers, looking around her. Logan takes her arm and they
descend into the canyon, move toward the wall. Their footsteps the
only SOUND.

						LOGAN 
			Let me go first. Sometimes they're 
			waiting just inside there--to rush 
			you when it opens...

						LOGAN
			Quickly now--

He helps her through the narrow opening--the portal's walls are very
thick.. They turn abruptly and see:

123		INT. - WALL - DAZZLE CHAMBER

A room of angled, reflecting surfaces. At one end a jagged corridor,
also mirrored, leads away. The zigzag, angled effect creates an
absolute confusion of images. but Logan leads her unhesitatingly
across the chamber to the corridor. Jessica hangs back, momentarily
certain she's about to smash into something.

						LOGAN (guiding her) 
			Just follow--no matter how it seems...

						JESSICA (doing her
					best)
			But what is this--why?
	
						LOGAN (as they enter	
					the corridor)	
			The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle 
			there's  no way to catch up. Without the 
			dazzle, they'd just go past us--
					(gesture)
			too fast

						JESSICA
			Muscle? I don't know that one.
	
Logan is leading her down the zigzag corridor. It's stop and go--a
fun house in which you can get hurt.
	
						LOGAN
			It's unauthorized. No good for any-
			one over thirteen anyhow--shakes you
			to pieces--speeds everything up to a
			blur--
					(he is amused)
			you can see what happens when some
			flying Cub tries to go through this
			on muscle--splat!
	
Jessica reacts...to what Logan has said...then:  A moment later:
	
124		ANOTHER ANGLE	

As they approach the end of the corridor, a small FIGURE in a
tattered garment approaches them. She stops SINGING as she sees
Logan and Jessica.

						JESSICA (gently)
			Don't be afraid.

We see that it is a little GIRL of seven. Her face is grimy and hair
is tangled.

						JESSICA
			What's your name?

						MARY
			I'm Mary 2.

						JESSICA
			Where do you live, Mary?

						MARY
			Here.

						JESSICA			
			Why aren't you in Nursery?			

						MARY
			I'm very smart.

						JESSICA
			When do you go up?

						MARY
			I never go upstairs. You're a
			nice old lady.

As soon as she finishes her last sentence, Mary grabs at Jessica's
clothing...tearing a pin (piece of Jewelry) off...and running away
swiftly.

As Jessica instinctively starts after her...Logan... holds her back.

						LOGAN 
					(shaking his head)
			Not here. Might be a decoy.

Cautiously, Logan and Jessica exit from the wall, stepping out into-

125		EXT. - CATHEDRAL ITSELF

An area of rubble and dilapidated buildings.

Logan crouches, holding the transceiver and fanning the area,
listening...

SOUND: a soft beeping which abruptly grows louder and holds steady.

Logan gestures to Jessica to follow him, and moves carefully in the
direction of the BEEPING, quartering occasionally like a hunting
dog. Coming up to an angle of wall, he stops, flicks the sound off,
puts the machine back onto his belt. He gestures to Jessica to stand
still then he straightens, steps out, calls:

						LOGAN
			Runner!

Silence. Jessica involuntarily moves to him and as she does, the
Runner moves from behind an upright and stands.- The figure is
shadowed, the arms out, palms facing in a kind of gesture of
surrender. In the Runner's left hand, the tiny red crystal pulses on
and off. The Runner is a woman!

There is an instant of frozen confrontation and then suddenly
Jessica gasps, grasping at him.	
		
As Logan whirls:	
		
125X1		ANOTHER ANGLE	

Suddenly, from everywhere out of the shadows, a pack of snarling
Cubs materializes--moving with blinding speed. At their appearance
the Runner whirls and races off into the dark shadows. Logan makes a
futile gesture after her, then turns to face the Cubs.

A strutting, feral-faced fourteen or fifteen year old heads the
pack, dressed in fierce-looking tatters and hung with rip-off
trophies. He gestures to one of his followers to stand still.

						BILLY 
					(speaking of the Runner) 
			Don't worry about her. We'll have that 
			one later. Right now I think we've got 
			a Runner and his pairup. And what a Runner!

The CAMERA PANS the other Cubs...mean, filthy.

						A VOICE 
			We're going to have ourselves a time, 
			we are. Right, Billy?!

There is a chilling laughter of agreement from the rest.

						LOGAN		
			I'm a Sandman!		

						BILLY
			I cut up a Sandman yesterday.  They
			said I'd never get him...but I cut
			him up good, I did.

						LOGAN (firm tone)
			I feel sorry for you, boy!

Some murmuring as the pack watches their leader.

						BILLY
			For me? Better feel sorry for your-
			self, Sandman!

						LOGAN
			No, for you! How old are you, Billy?

Billy is silent.

						LOGAN 
			Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running 
			out. How long can you last? A year. Six 
			months?
					(he points to the yellow
					flower in Billy's palm)
			What happens when you're sixteen and
			you go green?

						BILLY (lashing out) 
			Nothing will happen! I make the
			rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say!
			Always have! Always will! I got
			Cathedral and I'll never let go!

						LOGAN 
			No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever 
			heard of a cub with a green flower? 
			You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, 
			when you're on green, because they 
			won't let a green stay here.
					(slightest beat) 
			If you try to stay the young ones will 
			gut-rip you apart!

						BILLY
			Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!

Logan falls back into a fighting crouch...but before he can strike a
blow..he is grabbed and slammed against the wall of an abandoned
building.

						ANOTHER VOICE	
			Let him suck Muscle! That'll shut	
			his mouth! Let's watch him shake		
			himself to death!!
		
We see the Cubs take out drugpads. They squeeze the pads and inhale
the "Muscle." At once their movements become blurringly rapid. They
take menacing positions - some leaping overhead.
			
						A VOICE
			Give him some Muscle!!
		
Like lightning they change positions and flash around Logan and
Jessica
			
126		CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

Watching..terrified.

127		CLOSE ON - LOGAN
	
Being held against the wall by Cubs as:
				
						ANOTHER VOICE
			Shake him to death!!

						A VOICE 
			Kill him!

128		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BILLY
	
moving a drugpad against Logan's face.

Logan is holding his breath...desperately trying not to breathe the
"Muscle" directly from the pad into his system.

						BILLY (chilling laugh) 
			He's trying to hold his breath...

As Billy presses the pad tighter against Logan's face:

With all his might, Logan wrenches his arms loose... drops to the
ground and pulls out his gun.

He fires and fire girdles a pillar...and they start to back away.

						BILLY		
			We can rush him...we can take 	
			can take him	again, we can!!	

The pack hesitates...stops backing away.

						LOGAN 
					(moving the gun slowly 
					back and forth)
			All right! How many of you want this to 
			be Lastday?!

The pack moves back again...and  disperses, leaving Billy facing
Logan alone.

						LOGAN
			Come on, Billy...come on...you cut
			a Sandman, didn't you?!

Logan tucks the gun back into his waist.

						LOGAN
			Come on, Billy...cut me...Come on

After a beat, Billy turns and runs away.

Logan comforts the shivering Jessica for a moment then takes out the
small box from his pocket and turns it...until it starts BEEPING.

The CAMERA PANS Logan and Jessica...following the SOUND.

They move over the rubble...and cautiously around abandoned
buildings.

We HEAR A SCREAM...and HEAR the Cubs who've only obviously found and
attacked someone. The SOUND is coming from a different direction
than where the beeping is coming from.

						LOGAN 
					(shaking his head) 
			They've got someone else! Why would 
			anybody come here?

Jessica shudders as the scream dies abruptly.

The BEEPING is now very loud.

Logan homes in on an abandoned building, enters, crosses swiftly to
a door inside and kicks it down.

We SEE the Runner. The WOMAN cringing, expecting death.

129		FULL SHOT - LOGAN AND THE WOMAN	

frozen for a moment. In f.g. a figure stirs, moves and we see it is
Francis. His weapon is drawn and aimed, but as he watches, he lowers
the barrel and smiles. The is Logan's job.

130		CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

watching

131		LOGAN AND THE WOMAN

						WOMAN (nearing
					hysteria)
			There's been a terrible error! My
			Lifeclock must have broken in some way!
					(rising tone)
			I'm nowhere near thirty...look at
			me...I'm twenty-two. I should be
			green! Did you hear me?
					(shouting)
			Green!

						LOGAN (quietly)
			Don't be afraid--	

Before Logan can continue...the Woman...who is now wild-eyed and
hysterical lunges at Logan...and starts grappling with him.
	
						WOMAN
			I'll kill you!! I'll kill you!!

After Logan pushes her away...and she falls down:

						LOGAN (breathing hard) 
			I'm not going to hurt you.

Slowly, she rises.

Logan takes out the ankh.

						LOGAN 
			Sanctuary? Anything?

Logan reaches into his pocket and takes out a small round
object...the size of a large marble.

						LOGAN	
			If they find you throw this hard	
			enough to break it. Then hold your	
			breath till you get away...It's
			blind gas.

Her reaction is blank, then, with desperate ferocity she attacks
Logan again.

During the course of the struggle, Logan subdues her again.

Jessica enters, bends over the near-crazed Runner as Logan holds
her. Eyeing him, the woman stands and takes the small round
object...she appears somewhat bewildered as Logan and Jessica move
off.
		
132		EXT. - THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ABANDONED BUILDING - 
		MED. ANGLE - FRANCIS WATCHING

He is shocked, unbelieving.
	
133		CLOSE ON FRANCIS

Stunned and uncertain, Francis aims his gun toward Logan and
Jessica...but he wavers...watching them disappear into the rubble... 

134		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

shivering like a wet dog. He turns toward open window.
		
						FRANCIS (in a firm, cold
					tone)
			Runner!
		
The woman turns, staring insanely. Her mouth opens like a fish as:
Francis FIRES his gun. A moment later, as the burning body topples
to the floor;

134X1		MAZE-CAR PLATFORM - THE MEN	

hearing the unmistakable SCREAMING sound of the kill, they exchange
a look.

135		LOGAN AND JESSICA 	

At the flash of FIRE from Francis' gun, they turn.
Logan and Francis' eyes meet. A beat, then Logan grabs Jessica and
pulls her away.

136		FRANCIS 

After a long, long hesitation, takes out his small plastic box and
starts to speak into it:

						FRANCIS (quietly)
			Runner terminated at G.16
			Ready for cleanup at Cathedral
			Quadrant 39.
			
137		ANOTHER ANGLE - OVERLOOKING CATHEDRAL ENTRANCE 

The Second and Third Men...very close to the maze-car platform...
peering into the darkness and seeing Logan and Jessica emerge onto
the maze-car platform. We can tell from the way the two men look at
one another that they believe Logan has fired the shot they have
heard.

They hide from the approaching Logan and Jessica.

						SECOND MAN
			I almost believed her.

They move off soundlessly. Behind them, a maze-car has arrived.

138		MED. - ANGLE - FRANCIS 

Gun in hand...running through Cathedral toward the maze-car
platform.

139		INT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND JESSICA - MOVING SHOT 	

				 		JESSICA
			I'm ashamed. I was bringing you
			to be killed.

						LOGAN
			Where? Sanctuary? Can you take
			me there?	

						JESSICA 
			Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. 
			But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.

						LOGAN (a beat) 
			All right. But why? I didn't kill the 
			Runner.

						JESSICA (interrupting) 
			Yes, but they won't know that...or care. 
			They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, 
			now...

						LOGAN (wry laugh) 
			That's nothing...there's a Sandman
			behind us, too and there'll be
			more soon. Take me to them.

						JESSICA (torn) 
			I - I can't.

						LOGAN
			Then - why don't you leave me - go
			to them - explain

						JESSICA 
			No. Not that either.

Logan considers her. A long BEAT. Thinking, then:

						LOGAN
			All right. New You 483. I'll find
			out myself.

139X1		INT. - SANDMAN READY ROOM - FRANCIS

Distracted...ignoring the greetings of Sandmen who are monitoring
the city.

139X2		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

Walking past the GIANT LIFECLOCKS into the debriefing area.

The scanners begin moving.

Moments later the scanner stops...the word:

		IDENTIFY	

appears on a SCREEN Francis pauses a moment and places his palm into
the groove.

Now he takes out the items of the dead woman Runner and places them
on the scanning table.

An ALARM SOUNDS and the word:

		REJECT

flashes on and off on the SCREEN.

Sandmen come running into the Area.

						SANDMAN
			What happened?!

Francis hesitates....then....quickly, as if changing his mind,
taking the items off the table:	
		
						FRANCIS
			Can you beat it....I've got the damn
			wrong bag.

						SANDMAN 
			You ought to put yourself on reliefcall, 
			Francis.

						FRANCIS (starting out) 
			Yeah....

140		EXT. - NEW YOU #483 - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA	

as they enter NEW YOU #483 they are being watched by:

141		MED. ANGLE - THE SECOND AND THIRD MEN

A safe distance behind.

142		INT. - NEW YOU #483

The waiting room has many mirrors...where customers ...male and
female...are checking their faces (and bodies).

There are also various photographs on the walls... suggestions for
changes to foreheads, eyes, cheeks, lips, etcetera. The chatty
informality is very much like people in a beauty parlor or barber
shop.

There is a RECEPTIONIST seated behind a desk in a corner.

Logan and Jessica walk up to the desk.

The receptionist looks at Logan...ignoring Jessica.

						RECEPTIONIST 
			Hello, Sandman.

						LOGAN 
			Hello.

						RECEPTIONIST 
			Do you want to see Doc?

Logan nods, impatient - he knows someone's watching.

						RECEPTIONIST	
			We don't get many Sandmen. I think
			we've only had one other since I've
			been here.

						LOGAN (brusquely) 
			A Sandman can get as sick of his face 
			as anyone else. Where's the doctor?

						RECEPTIONIST (smiling) 
			I like your face. Would you mind if Doc 
			took a picture? I'd Like him to give 
			your face to somebody else.

						LOGAN
			It's all right with me. Is he here?

						RECEPTIONIST
			My name's Holly...Holly 13. In
			ancient times they said my number
			was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?

						LOGAN
			No - Look, I'm in a hurry.

						HOLLY
			Doc'll be with you soon, Sandman.

Logan and Jessica walk to one of the chairs in the waiting area and
sit down next to an attractive WOMAN.

						WOMAN CUSTOMER 
			Is this your first time?

Logan and Jessica nod.

						WOMAN CUSTOMER (smiling) 
			This is my third...
					(a beat) 
			... I did it when I turned yellow ...
			and green.
					(showing her palm) 
			I turned red yesterday.

						LOGAN (looking) 
			Beautiful work. This man do them all?

						WOMAN CUSTOMER 
			No. But I hear he's terrific. Have you 
			seen any of his work?

						LOGAN	
			Just one. 
		
						HOLLY
			Doc's ready, Sandman.
	
Logan and Jessica stand. They follow Holly into a large, shining,
stainless steel room where we see:
	
143		MED. ANGLE - DOC

who looks about twenty-one years old, exchanges a pointed look with
Jessica. 
	
						DOC
			It's a real privilege, Sandman.

						LOGAN
			Thanks.
					(slightest beat)
			I thought you'd be older. I ex-
			pected a Red.

						DOC (showing his palm;
					the flower crystal is Red)
			I am.

						LOGAN
			Your own work?

						DOC (with pride)
			And I did it myself right on there.

144		FULL - ANGLE - THE SURGICAL APPARATUS

Aesculaptor Mark III -- the latest in servo-surgical designs.
Completely self-contained -- tilt-bed, cryojector services embedded
in the platform. The Mark III's laser heads are integrated into the
whole cocoon, swiveled and gimbaled so as to be able to focus any of
the surgical beams in microscopic delicacy or wide-bladed scraping.

The machine vaguely resembles an enormously complicated x-ray table
on an angle -- the great slotted laser heads overhanging it and
Integral with it. From the cryonic receptor base there is a steady
exhalation of cold -- the vapor seeping steadily downwards, blurring
the endlessly looped and tangled tubes and wires and containers
Which join in solid state circuitry so that any random or
involuntary twitch of a patient will be instantly compensated by an
equivalent move of the laser head -- keeping the focus precise.

At one end -- where the halves of the Mark III join, is n console of
switches and dials -- lights nod servo-recorders which control the	
operation from the first injection of cold to the final healing
vacuum drafts and scar burnishing. With the air of a magician
demonstrating, Doc goes to the console and flips switches. Instantly
the table responds -- the platform tilting, the crab-like laser arms
descending flexing -- small vapor jets oozing as the beams slash
harmlessly across the table. Beaming, Doc turns it off and the whole
apparatus subsides.
	
						DOC
			I designed it myself.
					(slightest beat)
			What'll it be ...a face job or
			a full-body job?

						LOGAN 
			Just the face.

						DOC 
			Fine....Holly will get you ready. 
			You're in good hands, believe me.

Holly comes forward and unbuttons the collar on Logan's tunic.

As Holly brushes her fingertips lightly down Logan's arms:

						DOC 
			Holly works here because she gets a 
			lift out of watching the Table...
					(smiles)
			and other things. I'll be back in a 
			minute.

						HOLLY
			He's going to sterilize himself.

						LOGAN  
			Do I have to undress?

						HOLLY 
			Not for your face.

Logan follows Holly to the Table. (Jessica remains behind with Doc
who speaks to her with soft urgency).

						DOC	
			You shouldn't have brought him here.	

						JESSICA;
			I didn't bring him -- what's
			the difference. He's blinking.
			He wants to run.
		
						DOC
			Run!? He's a Sandman.

						JESSICA
			I tell you he's running. I know.
		
						DOC
			Maybe...Maybe. But I wish he'd
			gone somewhere else.
					(a beat, a shrug)
			All right. He gets a face.
		
144X1		THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN AND HOLLY

Logan lies down.

The Table ripples...accepting his weight prisoning and positioning
him.

						HOLLY
					(leaning - close to 
					Logan) 
			I like dark hair. Have him give you 
			dark hair.

						DOC'S VOICE		
			All set?			
			
						HOLLY
			Um huh. Would you take a picture
			of him, Doc? I'd like you to give
			his face to somebody else.

						DOC 
			Why not?

Doc pushes a button...there is a tiny FLASH.

						DOC
			Do you have anything special in mind?

						LOGAN
			I don't care...Just get it over
			with.

						DOC (smiling) 
			Hurry...hurry...hurry.

						HOLLY (whispering) 
			Dark hair.

						LOGAN
			Holly'd like dark hair.
			
						DOC
			Holly'd like a lot of things.
					(studying Logan's face)
			We can start by narrowing the
			cheekbones.
			
Doc presses buttons on the control board. Jessica, who is standing
next to Doc, is slightly startled as the Table begins to HUM...as a
pair of laser beams separate themselves from the overhead cluster
and extend toward Logan, forming inner cones as they approach.

CryoJector needles start to close in on them, nearing their faces
and shoulders slowly...the visible cold streaming off the points.

A vibrobeam begins to KEEN.

SOUND: An insistent chiming.

Doc hears the sound and turns with the martyred air of a man who's
been called to the phone too many times. He turns to a phone-like
apparatus nearby, shifting the table into neutral as he turns. The
table and the laser heads stop moving.		
					
						DOC 
					(as if speaking on a phone)
			Hello
					(listening)
			Yes
					(listening)
			Yes, they are.
					(listening; his expression
					changing)
			Done.

Doc turns back to the console, pausing to stare intently at Logan,
then up at the brightly smiling Holly. Something in his look
registers, and Holly's smile fades. Now Doc engages the machine
again...

						DOC
			Pay attention, Sandman. I'm
			proud of this machine.

As he speaks he presses and an arm sweeps downward and into position
near Logan's face. It pauses as

						DOC
			With this one there's no waiting
			for scar burnishing. It's all in
			one...watch now...

The laser arm sweeps across Logan's forehead and cheeks, leaving a
bright trail of blood as

						DOC 
			But here's the improvement. Instant 
			healing---before you feel a thing. 
			Watch now...

Doc pushes a special button and the arm sweeps back along the track,
spraying healing fluid. Magically the blood vanishes and the skin is
moist and whole.

144X2		THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN 	

His face tense--he knows something's wrong. Over him Holly's bright
face with its rapt look. She's not sure, but she enjoys whatever's
happening.

144X3		BACK TO DOC 

who is playing the console as he speaks.

						DOC			
			Perfect depth adjustment on this			
			one, Sandman. The beam will cut	
			through that uniform and just
			exactly through the skin beneath--
			absolute precision. Watch now
	
And the machine does its stuff, slashing through Logan's tunic--a
seam of blood following the rip.

						DOC
			Of course, it doesn't mend uniforms,
			Sandman, but otherwise it does
			everything, doesn't it? Just
			imagine what would happen to you
			if the healing stopped functioning.
		
And the arm moves back again, spraying the healing fluid into
Logan's new wound. Again the blood disappears.
		
Suddenly Doc's look is ferocious. He turns off the healing switch
and punches buttons fiercely. The laser arms begin to move wildly
and the SOUNDS become shrill. Holly looks alarmed.

						HOLLY
			No! You're scrambling the table.
			He'll be cut to pieces, Doc.
	
						DOC
			Damn right! It was a trap. They
			know!
	
						LOGAN
			No - I'm Running!

Machine begins to WHINE LOUDLY.

Jessica tries to turn the machine off...Doc starts to wrestle with
her as:

145-145X4		INTERCUT: CLOSE ANGLES - THE CLUSTER ABOVE LOGAN 

Moving.

HOLLY

Watching two stun beams lower.

Doc knocks Jessica down. She is groggy on the floor as

The stun beams lance into Logan's cheeks.

The Table holds him, biting into his right leg below the knee.

146-148		QUICK CUTS OF DOC AND HOLLY	

Watching intently as:
	
149-150		CLOSE ANGLES - LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As surgical beams slit his shirt from the shoulder to the waist
leaving two threads of blood.  A vacu-head dips to suck the blood
away neatly.

151		ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN

As Logan desperately sucks in his belly....trying to flatten himself
into the Table.

152-153	CLOSE ANGLES - LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As laser blades cut into his face....followed by a spray of healing
liquid on the cuts.
	
154		CLOSE - ON HOLLY

Excited....flushed....as:

155		CLOSE - ON LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As two wide blades of light sweep downward....and hover three inches
above his neck....and keep lowering ....HUMMING loudly....and one
inadvertently frees Logan's right arm.

156		CLOSE ON - DOC

Shocked as Logan reaches for his gun.

157		CLOSE - ON LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM.

As dozens of laser beams slash toward Logan....he twists away....and
breaks off....jumping off the Table.

Doc rushes Logan holding what appears to he a frozen police billy.	

In an instant he has knocked Logan's gun away....and as Logan looks
down at it....we see it lying on the floor completely frozen.

Slowly, Doc moves toward Logan the short smoke-colored stick
menacing in his hand.

						LOGAN (out-of-breath)
			What I told you is the....

Abruptly, Doc lunges toward Logan...missing him as Logan ducks away.

As Doc turns to attack....Logan smashes his elbows into Doc's chest
and Doc falls back onto the Table.

157X1	CLOSE ON - HOLLY

SCREAMING, as Doc is slashed by the machine amid showers of sparks
and gouts of steam as the metal twists and wires short out and
various fluids boil and spill onto hot surfaces. Holly tries to
fight her way into the mess to help Doc, but Jessica, recovering,
pulls her down and the two struggle.

157X2	CLOSE ON - DOC

In terror as the laser beams begin to slash him to ribbons.

157X3	LOGAN

Making an effort to stop the machine, pulling levers and pushing
buttons in vain. He sees what's happening, pulls Jessica away from
Holly and, grabbing up his gun and tunic, heads for the entrance.
Crossing the waiting room they are stopped by the sight of:

158-
162XI 	OUT

163		FRANCIS

Entering...gun in hand.

164		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

As they face Francis.

165		FULL ANGLE - FRANCIS LOGAN AND JESSICA

						FRANCIS (frowning)
			What's going on, Logan?!

						LOGAN
			It has nothing to do with you.

						FRANCIS 
					(choking but still loyal)
			What are you talking about?! I saw you 
			let a Runner go? 
					(up a notch)
			I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!

Suddenly the machine behind them erupts into a great burst of smoke
and noise, momentarily drawing Francis' attention. Instantly Logan
jumps him, grabs and throws him sprawling. Without a look back, he
and Jessica run out.

166 		OUT

166X1		FRANCIS

Enraged, finds his gun on the floor and, before rising, gets off a
shot at them as they disappear. Then leaping to his feet, dashing
off in pursuit.

167		ARCADE TRACKING	

Logan and Jessica running through Arcade.
	
167X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Suddenly she pulls him in another direction.

						JESSICA
			Follow me, Logan. Stay close.

As they run into Hallucimill...Francis...never too far behind...
spots them and follows.

168-
173 		OUT

174		EXT. - HALLUCIMILL - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Exiting from the other side...and running through the crowd toward
and into a Love Shop...followed by Francis coming out of the
Hallucimill, too... and running toward the Love Shop.

175		INT. - LOVE SHOP - LOGAN AND JESSICA
	
As they enter the hot darkness. The Love Shop is throbbing with
sexuality. In it, the darkness breaks at Irregular intervals -- when
booths and cubicles flare into brilliance, each time revealing an
orgiastic tableau. The Love Shop is multi-leveled and the random
flashes may appear from any direction at any time, blinding and
stunning the viewer. Logan and Jessica pause to get their bearings
and as they do, a beautiful WANTON grabs Logan, pulling and
laughing:

						WANTON
			I have an empty one, Sandman

Logan tries to pull away, looks around for Jessica just in time to
see a man almost carrying her off.  Then the light is gone again and
Jessica with it.

176		LOGAN AND THE WANTON	

As she tears at his clothing, wrapping herself around him, trying to
pull him down. Then, as the light flares again she suddenly lets go
and grabs another man...Logan is, freed, starts looking for Jessica.

177-
179		SERIES OF SHOTS

Logan hunting through the Love Shop, fighting them off.

INTERCUT SHOTS of the suddenly-illuminated tableaus. Sex, manifold
and multiform -- everybody doing it.

180		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

Entering, starting to look around -- grabbed by one of the laughing
Wantons.

181-182	LOGAN, JESSICA

Brief glimpses of them looking for each other.

183		FRANCIS

Hunting both.

184		WITH LOGAN

As he suddenly collides with a woman -- shoves her away and sees
it's Jessica. Now together they make for an archway where multiple
mirrors enclose them.

Suddenly they are in darkness. Then a heavy door slides open and
Jessica leads Logan through the opening. Behind them the door slides
shut again.
			
185		FRANCIS

Desperately trying to get rid of a woman, sees a flash of Logan and
Jessica far across the room -sees them leave. Then he's pulled down
again as the orgy continues.

186-
186X1 	OUT

186X2	INT. - AN IMMENSE METAL STAIRWAY	

After a moment, Jessica takes Logan's hand and they start down in
the darkness. The SOUNDS of Love Shop still heard from behind the
wall.

						LOGAN
			Are you taking me to them?

						JESSICA 
			Yes.
					(beat)
			I don't know what else to do -- with
			him following us.
					(she hesitates) 
			Why do you keep running from your--

						LOGAN
			Because he's my friend -
					(a beat) 
			and I don't want to be killed by him - 
			or anyone.

						JESSICA 
			He's good, isn't he?

						LOGAN
			Will he find us and kill us?
			Yes...or one of the others.
					(a beat) 
			You know there's only one place 
			to go now...

						 JESSICA (hopelessly) 
			They won't believe us.

						LOGAN	
					(beat)		
			I'd rather take my chances with
			them...than with Francis.

						JESSICA
			They won¹t listen.
			
						LOGAN (interrupting)
			You think Sandmen will?
					(before she can answer)
			There's no other way for me,

						JESSICA 
			We'll convince them.

They pause. He puts his hand over hers. Jessica is silent. Then she
turns his hand over. The crystal blinks red -- on, off.

						JESSICA 
			Yes, Logan.
					(turning to him blindly)
			I'm glad they didn't change your
			face.
	
Logan embraces her, but his look is strange and remote. They
continue down into the darkness.
	
Behind them the SOUNDS of Love Shop die away and only their
footsteps are heard.

187 		OUT
		
187X1	FRANCIS
	
At the mirrored archway, looking around carefully, testing. He knows
they went through somehow. Hands claw at him - he brushes them away
as he searches.

188-200 	OUT

200X1	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA	

They have come to the foot of the stair. Here the flooring shines
wetly in the darkness.

						JESSICA (softly) 
			Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.
					(they walk) 
			Now to the right. It's narrow here, 
			you'll have to get behind me.

						LOGAN (whispering) 
			How will they know we're coming?

						JESSICA (whispering)	
			They're watching us now. They'll	
			let us in when they're sure.	

200X2	CLOSE-UP - LOGAN'S HAND (INSERT)
			
As he fumbles the transceiver switches at his belt, punching out a
signal.

200X3	INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. READY ROOM

As the Sandmen monitoring SEE THE SIGNAL FLASH and move smoothly
into action.

200X4	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Close together, he behind, waiting--alert as a VOICE is suddenly
heard:

						VOICE (scratchy, 
					filtered) 
			Sandman, put your hands on your head. 
					(he does)
			Clasp your fingers together. Now turn 
			your hands over. Palms up. 
					(beat) 
			In a moment a light will shine in your 
			eyes. Walk into it--Jessica first, 
			then you, Sandman. You will have to 
			stoop--but don't unclasp your hands. 
			Do you agree?

Logan nods.

Jessica glances back at him but their faces are unreadable in the
dark. Then suddenly--in front of her--a blindingly bright, narrow
rectangle of light illuminating them fiercely. Jessica moves
forward. Even she has to stoop. Logan is close behind. As he bends
awkwardly into the opening, the light goes out.

201		LOGAN, JESSICA -- SANCTUARY HQ

As he pushes her through the opening then moves instantly to the
side, pulling her with him.. The move fails. Both are pinned
helplessly in the blinding glare of the spotlight and the sudden
appearance of glass-silver spear points pressed against them. Logan
is unable to draw his gun.

						VOICE
			Hold still, Sandman, or die where
			you are.

						2ND VOICE
			Is she the one?
	
						OTHER VOICES (like angry
					stage whispers)
			She betrayed us. Kill him. Kill them both.
			Jessica you sold us. Sandman butcher.
			Sandman murderer.

Logan and Jessica stand rigid against the spear points, only their
heads turning to the echoing sibilants.. The spotlight goes off.

202-204 	OUT

205		INT. - SANCTUARY HQ. - LOGAN, JESSICA - CLOSE	

In the darkness we see the glass-silver spear points are glowing all
around them, the long shafts falling away into darkness, the points,
steaming gently when they touch--making an instant, wincing burn.
Logan moves--a spear point presses--he flinches.

						LOGAN 
			I'm a runner. She brought me here because 
			I begged her to help me.

He turns his palm. The red crystal blinks impressively in the
darkness.

At the sight, a BABBLE of SOUNDS. Argument.

						VOICE
			He's lying. No Sandman ever ran.

						2ND VOICE
			You don't run. You kill runners.
			You have killed runners all your life.	-

						LOGAN	
			Yes I have.		
					(beat)	
			Now it's my turn. And I want to
			live.

Another angry murmur of VOICES. Over it Jessica suddenly:

						JESSICA (shouting) 
			What's the matter with you. He's a runner--
			he's blinking. We must help anyone who 
			asks...we must-or we're the same as they 
			are--deciding who lives and dies.

One of the points lifts and touches Jessica's cheek. A quick, fierce
burn. She shrieks--a tiny sound--and is silent.

206		LOGAN	

Reacts fiercely, spinning against the spear points, he is Jabbed and
pierced in a dozen places as he manages to get Jessica closer,
shielding her with his body. But the spear points are too much. He
subsides, as VOICES rise angrily "Kill him now".

Suddenly a RINGING ALARM. All sound stops at once and we hear a
CLATTER of FOOTSTEPS down the iron stair and across the outer floor.
The spotlight bursts on again and a figure staggers into the
chamber, straightening into the light, hair dishevelled, hands in
front against the glare. It's Holly.

						HOLLY 
			Holly. Holly, New You 483... He's dead. 
			Doc's dead and the Sandmen came...

						VOICE (gentle)
			Holly--Holly. Remember the code.
			The code, please Holly...

						HOLLY (hysteria)	
			They smashed everything and I barely
			got away.
					(beat)
			Holly. Station 12, Sanctuary 7.
			Holly. Holly...

She lowers her hands and we see her, tattered, frightened--the
bright smile strange. She comes to herself a bit, looks to the side
and sees Logan and Jessica, pinned against the wall.

She reacts with fear at the sight.	
			
						HOLLY	
			It's him! The first Sandman. He
			killed...Doc.

						JESSICA
			No, Holly--wait! He's running.
			Tell them the rest!
	
						HOLLY (suddenly
					exhausted)
			He's the one. You too. I remember.
			He was in a hurry. Just a face job.
			Dark hair, I said. Then he killed
			Doc and you grabbed me--and the
			machine blew up and I ran...I ran
	
	 					JESSICA
			Holly. Holly! Please...The other
			Sandman. Remember the one who came
			after--

Holly suddenly remembers and the shock makes her lucid.

						HOLLY (pouring 
					it out) 
			That's right. The other one came after. 
			The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!

						JESSICA (coaching
					desperately) 
			...and he was hunting the first one, 
			this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This 
			one was running, the other one was 
			hunting him...

						HOLLY (remembers)
			Yes. Oh yes.
					(to Logan) 
			He was after you. I remember. You're 
			running!

207-208 	OUT

208X1	ANOTHER ANGLE 1

The spear points are withdrawn. Logan and Jessica relieved but
shaken, wary.

						LOGAN 
			May we move?

A long beat. Then--

						VOICE
			I saw we pass them through.			
			Somebody help Holly.	

Other VOICES mumble agreement. Holly moves off into the dark room,
hands reaching out to help her.

						VOICE 
			You two. Just go straight ahead. 
			Follow the corridors with the pipes 
			overhead to the end. Then use the key.

As the voice speaks the spotlight finally goes off and by a dim glow
around the perimeter, we see we're in some kind of large underground
chamber--some part of the vast undercellars of the city. The light
is enough to reveal that there are perhaps twenty people in the
room, reds and greens both--but all are silhouetted, no face seen.
There's a kind of aisle open down the room's center and it's
obviously the way they are to go. Logan and Jessica move off. Logan
pauses.

						LOGAN
			I don't know who you are. I'd
			like to thank someone.

						VOICE 
			It doesn't matter who we are. Follow 
			the tunnel to the end.

						LOGAN
			I Will there be someone to tell us
			where to go from there...?

A murmur of discussion then:

						VOICE 
			Someone will follow. When you come to 
			the lock, he will tell you how Co go 
			on the other side. Jessica may go with 
			you as far as the lock.

						LOGAN 
					(a deep breath) 
			No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back. 
					(suddenly his tone is 
					urgent as he speaks to her) 
			Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.

She is bewildered by the change.

						JESSICA
			Why?- No...no...I'm going with you.

						VOICE1
			Only to the lock. After that 
			there's no way back. 

						JESSICA (small voice) 
			I don't care. I'm going to Sanctuary. 
			With you.

A BABBLE of VOICES. "Impossible"...She ignores, watches Logan.
			
						JESSICA (cont'd)
			Will you take me with you?

						LOGAN
			Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
			
JESSICA shakes her head. She doesn't know why.

Logan puts his arm around her, marveling, trying to understand,
moved. But suddenly he remembers the urgency of the moment. He
wheels, pulling her with him.
			
						LOGAN
			Come on then--they'll be here any
			minute!

Uncomprehending, she starts to run with him. Too late. An EXPLOSION
shakes the chamber--the wall bellies inward and a group of Sandmen,
led by Francis, burst into the room, firing as they come.
			
Panic. Turmoil. PEOPLE running, SCREAMING--the ALARM BELL RINGING,
RINGING as Sandmen methodically slaughter the people in the wreckage
of the room.

209 		OUT

209X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA 	

As the brief, one-sided battle rages, echoing SHOTS and SCREAMS in
the dust filled room, Logan pulls her down out of the way. They
watch, helplessly. Suddenly the figure of a Sandman looms before
them. He stares at Logan, unsure. Logan reacts, draws, fires. The
Sandman is smashed away, burning.

209X2	LOGAN 

Suddenly aware that he has killed a Sandman. Jessica pulls him down
again into the shadow. Neither realizes chat the soft pulsing of his
crystal can be seen from the room.

210		ANOTHER ANGLE

Francis, quartering the room like a hound, searching, searching,
stopping as he sees

211		FRANCIS P.O.V.
	
The crystal blinking red, eerie in the darkness.

						FRANCIS 
					(believing the	
					blinking crystal is Jessica's)	
			Logan. I know you're in here. 
 			What've you done...gone crazy over a 
			Runner?
					(whispering) 
			Nobody knows except me. You know I 
			won't say anything. I should have 
			turned you in but I couldn't. Leave 
			her. Come on out with me. It'll look 
			like you're part of the group that 
			hit this nest.
					(pleading) 
			Logan...you're a Sandman!
					(slightest beat)
			Logan...now...now...Logan...

After the slightest beat, Logan FIRES and Francis falls, a great
chunk of the cave roof falling between him and Logan -- all vision
obscured while EXPLOSIONS and SCREAMS continue.

212		LOGAN AND JESSICA

As he pulls her shakily to her feet. She nods, she's okay. He leads
her off down the tunnel.

213		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - TUNNEL

following the tracks. The way leads down, curves, recurves, but
always down.

214		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOCK
	
As Logan and Jessica rush toward it. The corridor has widened into a
kind of chamber which ends in a great metal door like an immense
submarine hatch.

The tracks run straight to it and beneath it. The base of the door 
tands in a couple of inches of water.
	
With great urgency, Logan and Jessica examine the huge door. Logan
gives the wheel a tug...nothing.

SOUND: A WHIRRING like clockwork...A METALLIC BELL SOUND and then a
RECORDED VOICE.

						VOICE	
			Runner, this is the last gate. Use			
			your key now. When the Bell sounds			
			again...use your key. Good luck,
			Runner. May you find Sanctuary.

SILENCE. Then the BELL CHIME SOUND and a light illumines the center
of the wheel where there's a kind of keyhole. The WHIRRING continues
for about ten seconds. Then it stops	and the light goes out.

214X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Hearing a SOUND they turn and see:
	
214X2	ANOTHER ANGLE - P.O.V.

Far behind them, in the wet glisten of the tunnel, a bobbing light
and shadow -- the SOUND of RUNNING

215-216	CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND JESSICA

As Jessica takes the ankh from her neck - fumbling with the chain.

						JESSICA (breathlessly) 
			Every key only works once...and only 
			a Lastday key must open this door.... 
			They said it would fit - but....

She tries to fit the ankh into the glowing one, but her hand shakes.
Logan tries to steady her - and in helping, she drops it into the
dark pool of water. They fall to their knees, searching desperately.
Then Logan remembers.

						LOGAN 
			Wait - I have the one I took from 
			the Runner.

SOUND: The same as before as Logan searches his pockets for the
Runner's ankh.

Logan finds it just as the WHIRRING SOUND has STOPPED again...and
the light has gone out again in the center of the wheel.

As Logan and Jessica wait for the sound, etcetera to repeat again
another TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION is heard rocking everything.  In the
distance, Jessica can see the shadow of a FIGURE approaching.

As the SOUND, etcetera, repeat-s once more...Logan pushes the ankh
into the lighted center of the wheel. The ankh fuses and the lighted
center becomes brighter as the door opens.

There is a hesitation...in which Logan turning his head back...
realizes what he has done and is shaken.

As the shadowed FIGURE looms LARGER:

						JESSICA
			There's no turning back, is there?

Logan turns and pushes Jessica through the door... following her...
as the door closes and they are:

217		ON THE OTHER SIDE	

now, they can still hear the SOUND, etcetera for the last time.

Beyond the lock is the ruins of a vast undersea complex in which
food was raised and harvested. What we see is an endless shadowy
labyrinth of breeding pens which stretch off into the green darkness
-- a kind of mammoth aquarium with catwalks and ramps intersecting
the huge tanks. The levels are multiple and everything is slimed,
rusted, rotted and wet.

In the tanks themselves are shoals of fish, gardens of seaweed, etc.
The machinery for harvesting and winnowing has long since gone to
rust -- and visible in the great tanks are the wrecks of vessels and
gear -- the kind of stuff Cousteau and Co. are using now.

Footing is dangerous -- a slip from any catwalk means a plunge into
water and some of the walkways are well under water anyhow. From an
invisible ceiling comes a steady dripping and everything is crusted
and smells of salt and decay and life in the darkness.

217X1	WITH FRANCIS	

As he arrives at the door, the ankh glowing as before.

But Francis has a light. He examines the door with it, and as it
lights the pool of water on the ground, it picks out Jessica's ankh.
FRANCIS stoops, gets it and looks from it to the one glowing
	
128		LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Bewildered -- uncertain, as their eyes adjust to the dim light.
Finally, Logan gestures ''this way" and sets out.

(NOTE: The action of the sequence is the action of people groping
through a labyrinth. They go along, gripping a rail where possible,
sometimes sinking deep into water, sometimes rising above it. They
run into blind endings and retrace to the last junction -- always
trying for what looks driest and seems to stretch farthest along the
great wall...)

219-224	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - SERIES OF CUTS	

A. Making their way along the walkway side by side.

B. Stopping as the walkway disappears under water. Logan wading in
while she waits -- until he re-emerges. She follows.	

C. Choosing between diverging ramps. Having to return.

						JESSICA
			How do we know this is the right
			way?

						LOGAN
			It's the only way.
			
D. POV an alley way full of machinery. Logan gives a wheel a half
turn -- great rusty net-combs start to winnow the water.

E. Helping Jessica, Logan slips...falls into darkness. Jessica's
fear until he emerges, hand over slimy hand. The water is cold.

F. POV ancient signs - PROTOPLANK...DEPOT NO #11 DO NOT DECANT...
HABITAT MARITIME...ETC.

They speculate.

						JESSICA
			What do you suppose this was...?

						LOGAN
			Some kind of breeding pens...I
			suppose...They say people used
			to breed animal s, fish, anything
					(at her disbelieving look)
			To eat, of course.
			
						JESSICA
			Ycch.
					(shudders)
			To kill things and then eat them.
			It must have been a savage world.
			
Logan shrugs, but the idea makes him queasy, too.
			
G. They stop, tired. Peer through at the wreckage of a small
inspection vessel and suddenly hear:

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS, coming, halting, WATER sloshing. Steps again.

225		POV - THROUGH THE MAZE OF TANKS - A LIGHT	

moving, hunting.

						LOGAN (alert)	
			Stay here, while I see what it is.	

Jessica nods, frightened. Logan slips off into the darkness. In a
moment he's back. His face - is grim.

						JESSICA
			It's Francis, isn't it?

He nods.

226		LOGAN AND JESSICA

Trying to move faster now, Logan makes a wrong turning and they must
go back. But as they do so, Francis is ever closer -- a gigantic
distorted SHAPE now visible through the eerie glass -then suddenly
seeming small and distant.

As they emerge from the blind alley once again close to the wall,
suddenly:

227		FRANCIS

looming huge, gun drawn, apparently only a few feet away.

228		LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Logan desperately claws at machinery, succeeds in starting motion,
somewhere what sounds like a GENERATOR begins laboring, ancient
machinery GROANS.
		
They turn and run as they HEAR:
	
						FRANCIS (distorted;
					echo; etcetera)
			LOGAN N N N.
		
229		POV - FRANCIS' LIGHT

is splashing the walls ahead and in it they suddenly see:

THE DOOR -- a waterlock with a wheel. As the light passes, Logan
heaves desperately on it. It starts to give as the light comes back
and they are revealed.

230		CLOSE - ON FRANCIS

aiming at Logan...then slowly moving his hand until Jessica is in
his sights.

231		LOGAN - JESSICA - FRANCIS 

Francis FIRES -- tremendous SOUND, ECHOING and RESOUNDING. One of
the great tanks buckles and a cascade of water erupts over
everything. Through it, Logan manages to get the door open and
pushes a half-drowning Jessica through.

232		INT. - THE SHAFT 	

A sort of ancient freight elevator which commences to move groaning
when the waterlock door closes.
		
Logan slumps to the floor.

233		INT. - SHAFT - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA 

Moving at an extremely high speed...We can see the outside -
flickering - dark, light, - dark, light... and finally to a white
color. They lie slumped, motionless. Finally it stops. The door
opens into a kind of glistening darkness, suffused by a bluish glow.
It is now very cold.

In the silence Logan stirs. Groping, he touches Jessica, who moves
close to him. Logan puts his arm around her and they rise. Slowly,
tentatively, he leads her out into the dark chamber where they stand
for a moment trying to find themselves. What little light there is
seems to come from the left. Arm around Jessica, Logan starts to
move.

						JESSICA (whispering) 
			I'm afraid.

						LOGAN	
			It's brighter there...besides, we
			can't go back.

He starts to move again but Jessica hangs back.

						JESSICA 
			Wait.

He halts.

						JESSICA (cont'd)	
			I don't know what's going to happen	
			to us Logan but --	
					(a beat)
			Are you glad you didn't kill him?

						LOGAN 
			It doesn't make any difference anymore.

						JESSICA 
			You're really one of us now, aren't you?

						LOGAN 
			You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?
					(Jessica nods)
			Why did you stay with me?

						JESSICA (feelingly) 
			I wanted to...
				(Logan puts his arms
				around her) 
			...And you...what made you kill Sandmen?

						LOGAN
			I had to. I did kill...for the
			first time in my life I killed.

						JESSICA 
			Because you felt like a Runner, 
			didn't you.

						LOGAN 
			I guess so...I know I felt something 
			I never felt before...and I didn't 
			like it...not a bit.
					(after another long beat) 
			I'll tell you one thing...Sanctuary 
			better be worth it. That's the last 
			place for me to live now.

						JESSICA 
			For us.

Logan mouths "Us"...a strange word...and why not... in the last
minutes he has done strange things.

234-236 	OUT
		
236x1	INT. - ICE CAVERN

Suddenly they are blinded by a brilliant light coming from the side
and revealing for the first time where they are.

236x2	ANGLE

Before them a vase, dim, ice-shrouded storage area, row upon endless
row of frozen lockers trailing away into darkness, their legends and
contents unreadable in the thick covering of ice and frost. To the
side, a bright light.
		
236x3	LOGAN AND JESSICA

Walk toward the light.

236x4	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

We see a huge, high-domed cavern ringed and ornamented with
extraordinary ice sculptures-They are everywhere: Otters, fish, a
tusked walrus---overhead a flight of birds.

236x5	ANOTHER ANGLE

As they look in wonder:

						VOICE
			Overwhelming, isn't it?

Logan and Jessica turn and see:

237-238	OUT

239		FULL ANGLE - BOX	

Box is half-man...half-metal.

From the midpoint of his sternum to his hips he is coils and cables.
One hand is a cutting tool. His head is half-flesh...half-metal. his
legs are a chrome pedestal.

						BOX		
			Are you too startled? Am I too	
			removed from your ken?	
					(slightest beat)
			I'm neither machine nor man...but
			a perfect fusion of the two...and
			better than either.
					(with great pride)
			No human sculptor could match this
			greatness...don't you agree?

						LOGAN
			All right - what are you?
	
						BOX (laughs)
			Your turn.
	
						JESSICA
			It's incredibly beautiful.

						BOX	
			Ah, but wait for the winds. Then	
			my birds sing. My walrus breathes.	
			My palace chimes and bells. And the
			deep grottoes whisper my name...Box
			Box...Bahhhhxxxxsss...

						LOGAN (after a beat)
			We're hungry	do you have anything
			to eat?
	
						BOX
			Anything to eat?

Box starts to laugh...He is roaring with laughter as:

						JESSICA (quietly)
			We're human and we're hungry.

						BOX (still laughing) 
			I know...I know.

						LOGAN
			This place is a link to Sanctuary,
			isn't it?

Box looks totally confused.

						LOGAN (angrily) 
			How do you think we got here??!!

						BOX
			You walked in. I saw you. Don't
			you remember?

Logan contains his anger.

						LOGAN (beginning 
					again; quietly) 
			Where do you think we came from?

						BOX 
			From? From? From?

						LOGAN	
			We were sent here and you know it.
			Others have been sent here. Where
			are they? Hiding?
	
Box looks around the cavern:
	
						BOX (mischievously)
			Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.

						LOGAN
			Where do we go?!	
					(up a notch)			
			Where do we go from here??!!

We hear a NOISE outside.

						BOX 
			Is that the wind?
					(smiling)
			Not yet...
					(slightest beat) 
			You must hear my birds sing.

						LOGAN 
			You know about Sanctuary! I know 
			you do! You have to help us! You 
			don't have a choice! It isn't your 
			decision!! Tell us.

						BOX
			Never a pair. I have never had a
			pair.

						LOGAN
			Where do you send them?

						BOX
			You're a beautiful pair.

						JESSICA 
			Please.

						BOX 
			I've never seen humans whom I thought 
			worthy of being here...
					(a beat) 
			I'd like to sculpt you.
					(looking around) 
			Where would I put you?
					(smiling) 
			I know...you'd be the base of the 
			column. You'd hold up my world!

						LOGAN (exasperated) 
			Answer the question!

						BOX 
			Do you know how long all this will 
			last? Not thirty years...or thirty 
			thousand years...but thirty thousand 
			thousand years...and you'll be part 
			of it. Ages will roll...Ages. And 
			you'll be here...the two of you... 
			eternally frozen...frozen...beautiful.

						LOGAN (to Jessica)	
			There must be somebody else up here.	
			I can't believe that he's--	

						BOX (interrupting;
					his voice tone changing;
					very lucid)
			Let me sculpt you and I will show
			you where the others have gone.
	
						LOGAN
			That's better.
					(slightest beat)
			How do you want us?

						BOX
			Nude. Imagine, a pair.

						LOGAN (starting to 
					take off his clothes; 
					as Jessica hesitates, 
					Logan smiles)
			It'll be all right...

240-241	JESSICA 

Undresses.

Box motions to a pedestal covered with deep white furs.

						BOX
			Up there.

Logan helps Jessica up to the pedestal. As they stand there:

						LOGAN
			How do you want us?

						BOX (beat)
			Up there.

Logan looks at Jessica. Her beauty is glowing in the lamplight.

Logan takes Jessica into his arms.

						BOX
			Enchanting. Is that what humans do?

By this time, Logan and Jessica are no longer listening to
Box...their arms are enveloping one another...with strong feelings.

						BOX'S VOICE	
			Superb!	

242		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX

As his metal hand begins to BUZZ...he brings it to the base of the
huge column supporting the cavern.

As he works furiously...at Incredible speed:


243		LOGAN AND JESSICA

...oblivious to Box...their feelings intensifying as they continue
to hold one another.

244-245	OUT

246		CLOSE - ON BOX

						BOX (stepping back) 
			Done...behold...!

247		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Before they turn to view the sculpture they kiss long and
passionately.

Their mood is broken by:

						BOX'S VOICE
			Done...Done...Done...

Logan and Jessica break. They turn and see:

248		FULL ANGLE - THE ICE SCULPTURE

Box has captured them perfectly...shimmering with life...filled with
emotion.

249		WIDE ANGLE - INCLUDING LOGAN, JESSICA AND BOX

There are tears in Jessica's eyes as she reacts to the sculpture.

						JESSICA (squeezing	
					Logan's hand)	
			It's glorious 

Logan helps Jessica off the pedestal and they both start to dress.

						LOGAN
			All right. Now you keep your
			bargain.

						BOX (rapt by his
					work) 
			Wait for the wind! Wait and hear
			the birds sing over you!

						LOGAN (only interested
					in getting out)
			We're ready.

Box mumbles as he leads Logan and Jessica toward the rear of the Ice
Cavern.

250		INT. - ICE ROOM

As Box enters followed by Logan and Jessica.

This room has a fairly low ceiling and it is not too wide.

It stretches back as far as the eye can see.

The ice along the left wall is frosted...but the ice along the right
wall is perfectly clear.

And embedded in the ice along the perfectly clear right wall are:

251		WIDE ANGLE - MEN AND WOMEN

Standing in erect positions.

At first it appears that they might be more of Box's perfect works
of sculpture.

But as Logan and Jessica examine them closely through the clear
ice...it is soon apparent that they are real people...who have been
frozen.

252		CLOSE ON LOGAN AND JESSICA

Horrified as they move slowly along the wall.

253		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING THE MEN AND WOMEN FROZEN	
		IN THE WALL

We can see that each of them has a black crystal flower in the palm
of their right hands.
	
Logan walks to the end of this wall. Each frozen body has a number
above it. The final body's number is 1056...That number which the
voice in Sandman's headquarters revealed as the number of missing
Runners.

The CAMERA PANS Logan back to Box.

254		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX

As Logan turns toward him.

						LOGAN (stupefied) 
			How did they get in here?

						BOX
			Regular storage procedure...the
			same as the other food... The
			other food stopped coming and they
			started.
	
						LOGAN
			What other food?

						BOX
			Fish and plankton, sea greens and
			protein from the sea.
					(pointing to the frosted
					ice wall)
			It's all here - ready - fresh as
			harvest day. Fish and plankton,			
			sea greens and protein from the
			sea...And then it stopped coming
			and they (gesture) came instead.
			So I store them here. I'm ready.
			And you're ready. It's my Job -
			protein, plankton, grass from the
			sea

Logan pulls out his gun.

						LOGAN	
			Tell us how to get out...or I¹ll	
			destroy you..I'll kill you!

Box laughs...The same LOUD, ROARING LAUGH we HEARD earlier.  Then:

						BOX (calmly)
			Such a beautiful pair. I'll stand
			you facing one another.
		
Box starts his saw hand BUZZING.  He turns all the flesh parts of
his body away from Logan and starts advancing toward him and Jessica
who is now standing behind Logan.

Box is now like an armed vehicle.

Logan FIRES...the fire reflecting harmlessly off Box's metal frame.

						BOX (advancing)
			Resign yourself.

255		MED. ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Retreating...as Logan FIRES again and again...to no avail.

As Logan and Jessica retreat further and further toward the rear of
this room and:

256		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Advancing

We can SEE PERSON AFTER PERSON...embedded in the clear wall of ice.
A strange mute audience to this to-the-death drama.

257		TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Finally reaching the rear wall of this room as:

258		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Relentlessly moving toward them.

259		TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Seemingly pinned back against the rear wall.

Logan is FIRING his gun futilely with his right hand...while moving
his empty hand against the rear wall...trying to find a knob or
button which might open it.

The entire time he never takes his eyes off:

260		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Getting closer. The saw is BUZZING LOUDLY.

						BOX (chilling tone) 
			I make such a small, quick incision ...
			you can hardly feel it.

261		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Against the rear wall...We can SEE...but they cannot...that above
them...on the ceiling...there are a number of exposed cables.

262		FULL ANGLE - LOGAN, JESSICA AND BOX
	
Box is practically upon them.  As he lunges forward with his
WHIRRING saw hand Logan pushes Jessica to the floor and drops down
alongside her.

Box cannot stop his forward thrust and cuts a sizable chunk of ice
out of the rear wall as:

Logan SHOOTS at Box from the floor Level...upwards ...trying to
penetrate some part of his seemingly impregnable body. He misses but
hits the exposed cables on the ceiling.

There is an EXPLOSION.

						BOX (looking up; 
					screaming) 
			No! The coils!

Box rushes past Logan and Jessica toward the huge ice cavern
containing his sculptures.

						BOX (still screaming)	
			All my work!' All my work!!	

As Logan and Jessica stand:

263-270	OUT
			
270x1	ANGLE - THE REFRIGERANT COILS

Bursting open, discharging great streams of gases.

270x2	LOGAN

Seeing the effect, shooting again and again at the ceiling and
walls.

270x3	ANOTHER ANGLE	
		
Coils bursting everywhere, vapor billowing into the cavern.
			
270x4	ANOTHER ANGLE	
	
Huge slabs of ice instantly loosening, crashing over.
			
270x5	FULL SHOT	

AS the effect multiplies--Ln the hissing vapor-sculptures crashing
over and enormous chunks of ice loosened and crashing.

270x6	BOX

Careening around wildly in the growing ruin, as the lights dim and
flicker out.

270X7	ANGLE

The ceiling full of birds loosening, crashing down upon Box. Again
and again like great spears and wedges 

270X8	BOX
	
Buried in his work, still feebly moving, then still as the roaring
ice crashes down, in the terrible darkness.
	
270X9	LOGAN AND JESSICA
 
Cowering in the crashing maelstrom of ice blocks--saved only by
Being in an angle of the cave.

270X10	FULL SHOT	
	
The SCREEN blotted out by the cave-in, going out of focus. Silence.
Then:

SOUND: Ice melting, water running.

270X11	LOGAN AND JESSICA

Stir in the dimness, amazed to be alive.

SOUND: A heavy crash and splash as another huge ice block falls into
the water.

As it falls, the cave is suddenly illuminated again. They look and
see the light is coming from a great fissure in the wall--opened by
the last ice fall. Water rains across the opening.

Logan and Jessica make their way to it, step out.

271-272	OUT

273		EXT. - HIGH LEDGE

Water is pouring down in a waterfall from the icemelt.

They are blinded by:

274		SUNSHINE: A HUGE RISING SUN	

As Logan and Jessica shield their eyes...then realizing that the
dazzling light will not go away:

Standing together...in fear of the sunrise.

						JESSICA 		
			Is there something on fire!!	 

Logan shakes his head...he doesn't know.

As Logan looks up at the sun.
			
						LOGAN
			It seems to be moving away.
			Come on...

274X1	ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

clambering cautiously down from the barren ledge.

274X2	LOWER - AN AREA OF BOULDERS	

Suddenly, a FAIRLY STRONG WIND starts blowing.

						JESSICA (frightened) 
			What's that?

						LOGAN 
			It feels like breath. It makes 
			everything move. Your hair is moving.

						JESSICA (smiling) 
			And yours.

They reach the level below and pause, look around.

						LOGAN
			Jessica -- we must be outside!

She looks at him, uncertainly, he puts an arm around her and they
set out again.

275-276	OUT

276X1	INT. - CAVE - CLOSE ON FRANCIS

Picking his way through the ruined cave, puzzled.

277-287X1	
OUT

288		EXT . - FOREST AREA

As Logan and Jessica reach it.

They are startled by the SOUND of BIRDS SINGING for a moment...then
continue through some high grass and thorned bushes being scratched,
etcetera.

A swarm of insects attack...Logan and Jessica fight them off:

						JESSICA (starting to panic)
			I hate outside! I hate it!

						LOGAN (holding her; 
					comforting tone)
			We'll be all right...
					(a beat)
			We will...

The sun is starting to go down...as they see a rabbit dart away in
the grass...startling them for a moment.
		
288XA1	FRANCIS
Coming out through the fissure in the rock, squinting at the
unexpected light from the sky, then setting out as Logan and Jessica
did.
		
288XB1	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - A BUSHY AREA

They come upon bushes of berries. Logan picks a few, looks at them
and smells them. As he is about to put them in his mouth...Jesslca
grabs hold of his hand.

						JESSICA
			Don't!

						LOGAN
			Sooner or later, we'll have to try
			something

Logan eats the berries...as Jessica watches intently.

After a beat

						LOGAN
			They're good.

Logan and Jessica pick berries and eat. When they are finished: 

						JESSICA
			It's getting dark and cold.	
			I'm tired.		

						LOGAN 
			Why don't we rest here? We know we can 
			eat these.

They sit on the ground.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

288X1	TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA - NIGHT	

Sitting on the ground.

Jessica is shivering. Logan has his arms around her trying to keep
her warm. 

						JESSICA 
			Where do you think that heat-ball went?

Logan shrugs.

						JESSICA
			Do you think everything's going to
			turn to ice?

						LOGAN
 			I doubt it.
	
						JESSICA
			Don't ever let go.

						LOGAN
			I won't.
	
After a long beat:

						LOGAN
			It all seemed to make sense until
			Box.

						JESSICA
			Do you think he was telling the
			Truth?

Logan shrugs.

						JESSICA (trying to 
					convince herself) 
			Maybe we're the first ones to get 
			through... 
					(hopeful tone) 
			Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... 
			another protected place. It couldn't 
			be outside.

						LOGAN (grunts) 
			How would anyone know? Even if we find 
			it -- we can never go back.

At her stricken look...Logan touches her in a caring way.

						LOGAN
			You're right...it must be near
			now. We'll find it.

						JESSICA (yawning;		
					closing her eyes; resting	
					on his shoulder)	
			Thirty thousand years didn't last
			very long, did they?
	
288X2	EXT. - BARREN TERRAIN - NIGHT - FRANCIS
	
Looking frightened as he looks up at the moon and the stars his gun
drawn.

Suddenly, a rabbit darts by.

Francis jumps up in great fear and starts FIRING his gun...blasting
the rabbit to smithereens.

He is breathing hard (fear)...and looking around...gun in hand.

288X3	EXT. - FOREST AREA - DAY - LOGAN AND JESSICA

walking in the hot sun...grimy...thirsty.

288X4	EXT. - FOREST AREA - FRANCIS

His face still betrays a wild, frightened look as he moves very
cautiously.

He reaches the bushes of berries and sees some of them on the
ground.

He picks a few off the bush...is ravenous...but finally...too
frightened that they might be some kind of poison to eat any.

As he angrily crushes the berries in his hand... then wipes his hand
on his trousers:

288X5	EXT. - FOREST AREA - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Seeing shimmering in the distance. They walk toward it.

288X6-
288X8	TRACKING SHOTS WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

Reaching...

289		FULL ANGLE - A BROOK

They rush to it...drink...then undress...swim...and as they embrace
in the water:

						JESSICA
			Logan!!!Look!!
					(Logan turns around)
			No...your palm...look!!! 	

Logan looks at his palm...the blinking crystal is clear.

He grabs Jessica's hand and looks at her palm... the same.

						JESSICA (quietly)
			What does it mean?
	
						LOGAN (trying to
					assimilate its meaning
					himself)
			The Lifeclocks have no power outside. 

Jessica takes Logan's palm and kisses it.

						JESSICA (with laughter)
			You can have any woman in the city.
			What do you really want?

						LOGAN (straight)
			You know, Jessica.

						JESSICA. (a beat)
			...But I still have the choice...?

						LOGAN
			Of course.

						JESSICA
			Then the answer's Yes...

They embrace there in the water...
			
290 		OUT

291		HIGH ANGLE - SHOOTING DOWN - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Coming out of the forest...climbing up a green hilly area...reaching
the top and seeing:

292-301	OUT

301X10	CLOSEUP - LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Looking up at statue.

						LOGAN 
			I have never seen a face like that 
			before. It must be the look of great 
			age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.

						JESSICA (beat) 
			Yes, do you think that's why he looks 
			so sad---?

Logan shrugs. They turn, start to EXIT from memorial.

301X11	INT. - MEMORIAL - HIGH ANGLE OVER STATUE'S BACK

As they pass the stones, Logan glances at them.

						LOGAN
			They all have names and numbers
			on them. I wonder what they are?

						JESSICA
			"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife".
			What can all that mean?
		
Just then their attention is focused by a distant SOUND as of
SHOUTING -- a man's voice. Jessica stops.
		
						JESSICA
			Francis?
		
Logan shakes his head. They EXIT cemetery toward capitol.
		
301X17	LONG SHOT - CAPITOL (MATTE COMPOSITE)

Logan and Jessica walking up steps toward building.

301X18	TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Logan and Jessica enter the ancient room. They stop and look around.

301X20	CLOSEUP - LOGAN AND JESSICA

React, then they enter Senate and stop and look.

301X24	INT. - SENATE - OVER LOGAN AND JESSICA'S BACK - A WHITE
		HAIRED MAN OF S SIXTY-PLUS	

There are HUNDREDS OF CATS...and THOUSANDS OF BOOKS all over the
place.

						JESSICA (frowning; 
					whispering)
			Look at his face...and his hair... 
					(grimacing)
			Is that what it is to grow old?

						LOGAN (still stunned)
			It could be...

There are a COUPLE OF CATS on the man's lap as he turns and faces
Logan and Jessica...when he HEARS them move closer.

The man is stroking the cats calmly...unperturbed by the appearance
of Logan and Jessica.

						LOGAN
			How old are you?		

						MAN
			As old as I am I suppose...who
			knows ?

						LOGAN 
			Your hair is white.

						MAN		
			It wasn't always. I remember when		
			it wasn't. But it wasn't your	
			color either.
					(looking at Jessica) 
			...or yours. I have my color somewhere.

						JESSICA
			Those cracks in your face...do they hurt?

						MAN 
			Oh, no...

						JESSICA 
			Could I touch them?

						MAN
			Oh, my...please try.

Jessica walks up to the man and touches his face.

						JESSICA 
			What's your name?

						MAN
			I've forgotten. It's been so
			long since I've used it.
	
Logan and Jessica exchange a quick glance...feeling they have come
upon a nutsy, fruitsy cupcake.
	
						MAN
			But all of my cats have names.
	
						LOGAN
			Is that what they're called--
			cats?

						OLD MAN
			Yes, cats, of course. What else
			could they be? Cats. Of course
			each one has his own name too.
	
						JESSICA
			But there are so many of them.
			Do you know each one separately.
		
						OLD MAN
			Yes indeed, everyone. Actually,
			they all have three.
					(reciting)
			"The naming of cats is a difficult
			matter. It isn't just one of your
			holiday games. You may think at	
			first I'm mad as a hatter when I	
			tell you a cat must have THREE
			DIFFERENT NAMES."
					(a beat)
			An ordinary name and a fancy name.
			That's two. Do you want to guess
			what the third one is?
		
Logan and Jessica are silent.

						OLD MAN (reciting again)	
			"But above and beyond there's	
			still one name left over,	
			And that is the name that you
			never will guess;
			The name that no human research
			can discover -- -
			But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and
			will never confess."
					(reaching down and
					stroking another cat)
			Will you, my pet?
		
One of the cats jumps off his lap.

						OLD MAN (reciting)
			"Why did you go little fourpaws?
			You forgot to shut your big eyes."
					(the man closes his
					eyes for a moment; then:)
			"I have a Gumble Cat in mind!"
		
As the man opens his eyes:
	
						LOGAN
			How long have you been living
			here?
	
						OLD MAN
			For as long as I can remember.
	
						LOGAN
			What kind of place is this?
	
						OLD MAN
			Just a place, I suppose...who
			knows?

The man looks puzzled.

						LOGAN
			How did you get here?

						OLD MAN
			I have always been here...

						LOGAN			
			Are there any other humans?	
	
						OLD MAN
			Gracious...no.

						LOGAN 
			Have any other people ever passed 
			through?

The man shakes his head...then:

						OLD MAN 
			But there may be a few around somewhere.

						LOGAN 
			What makes you think so?

						OLD MAN 
			My parents thought so. Mother and 
			Father. You know?

						LOGAN (astonished) 
			Mother and -- ? You knew your mother 
			and father?

The man nods.

						JESSICA 
			And...and how were you grown? Inside
			your mother?

						OLD MAN
			Yes...

						JESSICA 
			Are you sure?

						OLD MAN 
			Mother and Father said so... you know?

						LOGAN 
			Where are they?

						OLD MAN
			Dead...they're dead...and buried.

						JESSICA (not knowing
					what it is)
			Buried???

Logan wheels...as he HEARS THE NOISE OF A DOOR SQUEAKING
SLIGHTLY...as it opens a bit wider:

302		CLOSE ON A CAT

Coming through the opening - did he push it?

303		CLOSE ON THE MAN

						OLD MAN (pleased; 
					reciting) 
			"Gus is the cat at the theatre door. 
			His name, as I ought to have told 
			you before, Is really Asparagus. 
			That's such a fuss To pronounce, 
			that we usually call him just Gus."

306		WIDER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOGAN AND JESSICA	

						OLD MAN
			May I see your hand again?

Logan and Jessica extend their left hands. The Old Man takes them,
looks from one to another with delight.
		
						OLD MAN
			They're beautiful. May I have
			one too please?
		
						LOGAN
			No--I'm sorry. It's not possible.
			
						OLD MAN (offended)
			It isn't fair. I'll give you one
			of my favorite cats...a Jellicle
			cat.
					(reciting)
			"Jellicle cats have cheerful faces,
			Jellicle cats have bright black eyes;
			They like to practice their airs and graces
			And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."


						LOGAN	
			I'm sorry but I don't have anything to 
			give you.	
		
As the man continues to look petulant:

						JESSICA (simply; 
					sincerely)
			That's the truth.

Jessica takes off a ring and hands it to the man.

						JESSICA
			Here you can have this.

The man seems pleased.
	
						OLD MAN
			What kind of jewel is this?

						JESSICA
			I don't know.
	
						OLD MAN
			You're both full of secrets like
			Macavity.	
					(looking at the ring)
			Did you steal this?
	
						JESSICA
			No.
		
						OLD MAN 
					(reciting)
			"Macavity, Macavity, there's no
			one like Macavity,
			There never was a cat of such
			deceitfulness and suavity."
	
						LOGAN
			What's beyond this place - do you
			know?
	
						OLD MAN
			No, no, no
		
						LOGAN
			Did your Mother or Father ever
			mention another place?
	
						OLD MAN
			Never, never, ever. Nothing.

After a pause:

						LOGAN	
			May we stay here for a while?	
			We'd like to rest.	

						OLD MAN
			Of course you can stay. This
			belongs to the people.

						JESSICA
			What belongs to the people?

						OLD MAN
			All this. All of it.
		
						JESSICA
			What people?
			
						OLD MAN
			I don't know...but it does.

The man stands...and starts walking toward a door to an adjoining
room.

						OLD MAN
			I'll be right back.
					(stopping)
			Oh, yes...about the cats...
			one rule is true:
					(reciting)
			"Don't speak till you are spoken to."
			
The man smiles and leaves.
		
305		LOGAN AND JESSICA 	

Logan clears two chairs of cats and they sit down.

Jessica picks up a book and starts leafing through it.

Logan is deep in thought.

Jessica looks up from the book.

						JESSICA (quietly)
			How curious people used to be --
			All these books...

Silence...until:

						LOGAN
			That sweet madman -- how could he
			Come to exist?
	
						JESSICA	
			He had a mother and father --	
			and he knew them.	

						LOGAN
			One in a million, I suppose

						LOGAN AND JESSICA (together; 
					smiling) 
			...Who knows? 

						JESSICA (after a beat) 
			We're going on, aren't we?

						LOGAN 
					(shaking his head) 
			There's nothing to go on to, Jessica.

Logan continues to shake his head through Jessica's following line:

						JESSICA 
			There's a Sanctuary...there is!

						LOGAN
			You want there to be one...that
			Doesn't...

						JESSICA (interrupting; 
					urgent tone) 
			There has to be! I know it exists! It 
			has to!!

						LOGAN (gently) 
			No, there doesn't. Not really --just so 
			many want it to exist...so many who 
			don't want to die...want it so much 
			that a place called Sanctuary becomes 
			"real". But it doesn't exist. It never 
			existed. Just the hope.

						JESSICA (becoming	
					hysterical)
			You're wrong!! It has to be!!
			It Just has to be!!

As Logan takes her in his arms...comforting her:

306		FULL ANGLE - INCLUDING THE MAN

The man returns with a portrait in hand.

						OLD MAN	
			Oh, my don't cry.

The man proudly shows them the portrait....which is a portrait of
himself in his twenties. He sort of brushes the hair...which is rich
auburn.

						OLD MAN (gesturing) 
			There are larger pictures of other 
			people over there. I don't know who 
			they are. Perhaps they're family.

She man leads Logan across the chamber to a far corner.

307		CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

Remaining near the podium. She is dejected. Logan's argument that
there is no Sanctuary has sunk in and taken hold.

308 		OUT

308x1	THE CORNER - LOGAN AND THE OLD MAN

We see portraits of Presidents of the United States.

We can recognize all of them...with the exception of the dozen or so
that come after Ford.

As Logan looks at the portraits he recognizes Lincoln.

						LOGAN 
			That's the same fellow who's outside. 
			If he was so important - why isn't he 
			first?

The old man shakes his head.

309		INT - SENATE CHAMBER - CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

As Francis suddenly appears alongside her.

Jessica is terrified...speechless. Francis glances across the
chamber, sees Logan. When he speaks, it is softly but urgently.

						FRANCIS 
			What did you do to him?

Jessica is silent. Francis' tone becomes increasingly sexual.

						FRANCIS	
			Why? Why you?	
					(grabbing her)	
			Do you know you ruined him? Do
			you know that? Can you tell me
			why? Why you?
					(a beat)
			And now you've killed him, you
			know...

Francis starts to tear off her clothes...obviously to rape...but his
expression remains cold and without passion.

						JESSICA (screaming) 
			Logan!!!

As she screams, Francis clamps a hand over her mouth and drags her
O.S.

310 		OUT

310x1	LOGAN

hears the scream, wheels -- sees nothing for a moment.

311		INT. - SENATE CHAMBER

						FRANCIS' VOICE 
			Here!!!!

Logan looks up...and we see Francis crouched behind the railing of
the first row of the gallery...with his gun pointing down at Logan,
holding the terrified Jessica with his other arm.

						OLD MAN (cheerfully) 
			How nice...more company...

						FRANCIS (emotional; 
					disjointed thoughts) 
			We had such good times together... 
			I let you go! 
					(frenzied) 
			You didn't terminate a Runner and 
			I let you go!!
					(a beat)
			She did this to us! How could you
			let her?! An ordinary available??!!
					(with this he flings
					Jessica down and away.
					She lies there...stunned)
			And what about Logan-6 and Francis-8? 
					(a tear in his eye)
			....Why didn't you chink about them?!
					(up a notch)
			There's over two hundred years of
			Sandmen's blood in you, Logan....
			and now you'll spill it for a
			stinking Runner!!

312		CLOSE ON - LOGAN

Holding up his right palm.

						LOGAN 
			Look at your palm, Francis.... 
			look! It's clear. Clear!

313		REVERSE ANGLE - FRANCIS

Looking at his palm....shocked...dropping his gun. It falls on the
CHAMBER FLOOR.

						FRANCIS 
			Why did you do that??!!

						LOGAN
			I didn't do anything, Francis!
			They've made us believe that....

						FRANCIS (interrupting; 
					wild) 
			Why did you do that???!!!

Francis leaps from the gallery and falls on Logan.

314		WIDE ANGLE - CATS

Scattering in all directions as:

315-319	CLOSE ACTION SHOTS - FRANCIS AND LOGAN

In hand to hand combat punching...Kicking...wrestling

320		INTERCUT WITH: JESSICA AND THE MAN REACTING

Jessica deeply disturbed...The man enjoying himself as if Logan and
Francis were putting on a show for him.

321-331	THE FIGHT- SERIES OF SHOTS

A. Francis manages to pick up a chair and smashes it down on Logan.

B. As Logan slumps to the floor and Francis cries to follow through
his advantage by crushing Logan's face with his foot:

C. Logan grabs Francis' foot and twists it...sending Francis reeling
backward.

D. Standing, Logan grabs a table and hurls it at Francis...who
ducks.

E. Francis sees a steel flagpole (with an American flag that has
sixty-one stars) and takes hold of it.

F. Francis moves toward Logan...with the menacing steel flagpole in
front of him.

G. Logan is wary...watching every movement of the steel pole.

H. Francis swings the steel pole twice...We can HEAR the WHISH-WHISH
as it cuts through the air...with Logan avoiding the blows.

I. On the third swing...Logan grabs hold of the steel pole and
swings around on it...kicking Francis in the chest.

J. Francis lets go of the steel pole as he staggers backward.
Francis and Logan look at one another for a brief anguished moment
as Logan crashes the steel pole (which he is now holding) down on
Francis' head.

K. Francis crumbles to the floor. Feebly, he raises a hand toward
Logan...

Logan touches Francis' hand and Francis grasps his wrist, holding
death off with the strong grip.

						FRANCIS (delirious)	
			That was the right shot--Look out	
			there, he's trying to break free		
			Watch it, Logan, steady, now!......

His eyes focus briefly and he sees Logan's palm-the crystal shining
clear and white. Francis is suddenly radiant.

						FRANCIS 
			Logan! You renewed!

And he is dead.	DIRECT CUT TO:
	
332		JESSICA AND THE MAN

The man walks over to Francis and bends down.

						OLD MAN
			Oh, my...he died...

333		CLOSE ON - LOGAN

Rubbing his face with the palms of his hands...clearly upset.

334		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING JESSICA AND THE MAN

						OLD MAN
			We¹ll have to bury him.

						JESSICA
			What¹s that?

						OLD MAN
			They¹re put into the ground so
			they can be visited by the living...

Logan¹s eyes are glistening with tears.  The man starts out.

						OLD MAN
			I¹ll make the arrangements.

						JESSICA (softly)
			At least it¹s over...

Jessica¹s words don¹t help as Logan shakes his head...then:

						OLD MAN
			Are you ready to put him in?
	
						LOGAN
			Not yet.

						OLD MAN
			All right.

The man sits down.

Gently, Logan lifts Francis¹ body...trying to straighten him out
from the slightly twisted position he assumed when he fell to the
floor.

After resting Francis¹ body on the floor again.  He cradles Francis¹
head in his arms.

DISSOLVE TO:

						OLD MAN'S VOICE 
			"Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there 
			in the fragrant silent night."

339X1	CLOSER ANGLE - CEMETERY

As they look down at Francis' body...in the open grave.

Jessica watches as Logan and the man start shoveling dirt into the
grave...starting to fill it.

339X2	JESSICA

quietly watching:

DISSOLVE TO:
		
339X3	INT. - SENATE - NEXT MORNING

On Logan sleeping - Jessica and Old Man in a spirited but soft
conversation in a far corner.

As Logan wakes he hears:

						OLD MAN
			Of course...that's settled then.
			But just you remember your promise...

						JESSICA 
			We'll remember. But that's a long time 
			off...

She sees Logan awake and listening, crosses to him, smiling. Logan
rises to her.

						LOGAN 
			What are we promising him? What can we 
			possibly give him?

						JESSICA 
			He asked if we would bury him when his 
			time comes.

						 LOGAN (beat)
			We can't. We're going back.

						JESSICA 
			To what?

						LOGAN		
			I'm going to try and tell people what 
			we've seen and--

						JESSICA (interrupting) 
			You're lying! You'll never have the 
			chance to tell anybody anything! 
			You'll be killed the moment you're seen!

						LOGAN 
			Do you expect me to let things go on 
			without trying to change them?!

						JESSICA 
			Things won't change...you know that! 
			We can live here together, Logan...
			have a life as long as his... together!

						LOGAN (showing his palm) 
			Things change!

						JESSICA
			You want to go back to kill, is that it?! 
			Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! kill 
			Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!!

Logan shakes Jessica who is becoming hysterical.

						LOGAN (softly) 
			Jessica...listen to me...listen to me...
					(as she quiets down)
			The Lifeclocks made me kill
			Francis. They make people die or
			be killed every day. If I didn't
			try and destroy that...I couldn't
			live here or anywhere. Do you
			understand?

						JESSICA
			I want to be alive and with you,
			that's all I want.

Logan puts his arms around her.

						LOGAN 
			I know...I know...

The Old Man comes to them, wondering.

						LOGAN 
			We're leaving.

						 OLD MAN		
			What a pity. I was hoping you'd	
			be here to bury me.	

						JESSICA 
			Come with us.

						OLD MAN 
			Where are you going?

						LOGAN 
			To a city with thousands and thousands 
			of people.

						OLD MAN 
			Alive?

Logan nods.

						OLD MAN 
			Thousands and thousands...as many as 
			my cats?

						LOGAN 
			More...many more.

						OLD MAN 
			And all alive you say?

Logan nods.

						OLD MAN
			Yes, I would like to see that. Is it 
			a long journey?

Again, Logan nods.

						OLD MAN (mumbling) 
			Thousands and thousands alive... oh, my...

340-349	OUT

350		HIGH ANGLE - GREENBELT AREA - SHOOTING DOWN - DAY

Logan, Jessica and the Old MAN are walking...with the Capitol
Building blurred by overgrown foliage receding in the b.g. of the
SHOT.	

351-361 	OUT

361X1	EXT. - FOREST AREA - AFTERNOON

The Old Man has picked Some wild vegetables...and hands a piece to
Logan and a piece to Jessica.

As they hesitate...the Old Man bites into it... heartily. 

As Logan and Jessica start eating it, too:

						OLD MAN (marveling tone) 
			Never see the sun or the moon... 
			I hope we get there soon...

361X1A	NIGHT - WOODED AREA - CLOSE	

On Logan, Jessica and the Old Man as they emerge from a small grove
of trees and stand looking O.S. past CAMERA Behind, a flicker of
firelight.

						OLD MAN (weary but
					enthusiastic)
			Is that really it? It doesn't
			seem very far. Will we be there
			soon?

						LOGAN
			I promise. We '11 go on as soon
			as it's light.

						JESSICA (gently, 
					turning O.M. away) 
			But now I'm tired. Let's go back to 
			the fire...

They turn, the Old Man still marveling at the sight.

P.O.V. WHAT THEY SEE (TO BE INTERCUT)

NIGHT (Matte) view of the domed city seen through a fringe of trees and beyond distance hills.

361X1B	EXT. - WOODED AREA - NIGHT

As the three return to where a small fire is burning on the ground.

						OLD MAN 
			That's better than gold when it's cold.

						LOGAN		
			Thank you.			
					(turning to Old Man)	
			Tell me - what do those words mean?
			"Beloved husband²...²Beloved son"...
			"Beloved wife"'...

						OLD MAN
			My father was the husband and my
			mother was the wife. "Beloved" is	
			a word they used - to stay together.

						LOGAN 
			Stay? They lived together all their years?

						OLD MAN 
			Oh, yes...I think...

						JESSICA (reading; 
					moved) 
			³Beloved son²... 
					(a beat) 
			So people stayed together for that 
			feeling of love... They would live and 
			raise children together and be remembered. 
					(another beat) 
			I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we 
			be that way?

						LOGAN (facing Jessica) 
			Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
					(a beat)

						JESSICA		
			And Sanctuary?		

						LOGAN 
			Sanctuary is the right to live.... 
			nothing more. But nothing less, either....

There is a long beat...then Jessica snuggles up to Logan...she is
ready for sleep.

						JESSICA (whispering)
			Beloved husband...

						LOGAN (kissing her)
			Beloved wife...

As they walk the great glowing dome is visible in the distance.

The Old Man marvels at what he sees...they walk on.

362		LONG, LONG ANGLE - LOGAN JESSICA AND THE OLD MAN - DAY

Walking up the beach toward the domed city. We get an idea of the
scale. They appear as ants in front of redwood trees.

363 		OUT

364		LOGAN, JESSICA AND THE OLD MAN

Approaching. The wave power inlet in f.g. They

HEAR: THE ROAR OF THE WATER

As they approach cautiously...they see:

365		WAVE POWER INLET

Waves pounding over ACRES OF STRANGE STEPPED CONSTRUCTION...
DESCENDING TO A VORTEX.

						JESSICA
			What does that water do?

						LOGAN
			It's part of the hydrogalvanic
			system. The ocean tides are changed
			into energy somehow.

						JESSICA
			Is it inside the city?

						LOGAN
			Of course.
					(a beat)
			I don't know where...
					(frowning)
			I Just took them for granted. 
					(Logan takes Jessica's hand)
			It's our only chance.

The CAMERA PANS LOGAN, JESSICA and the OLD MAN down the STRANGE
STEPPED CONSTRUCTION until they reach:

366		FULL ANGLE - A POOL OF WATER

At the CENTER of this IMMENSE WATER FLOWING CONSTRUCTION OF STEPS.

After a beat Jessica looks at the Old Man:
		
						LOGAN (softly)	
			I know...
					(after a beat; to the
					Old Man)
			We're going to try and get in this
			way. I don't think you can make it.

						OLD MAN (sadly)
			Oh...I did so look forward to seeing
			all those people.

						LOGAN
			I'm sorry.

						OLD MAN
			Yes...

						LOGAN
			Can you make it back?

						OLD MAN
			Oh my...I'll try. 

						JESSICA (kissing the Old Man)
			Goodbye.

						OLD MAN
			Oh, my...

The Old Man watches Logan and Jessica dive into the POOL and
disappear.

367		THE OLD MAN

he bends and plays with the water in the POOL for a moment...like a
young child at a pond or lake.

368		INT. - POWER CENTER OF THE CITY - LOGAN AND JESSICA 

Emerging from the water.

It is a labyrinth of humming turbines, automonitored cables and
impulse collectors.

Logan leads her swiftly through the humming maze toward an exit.

369-
369Xl 	OUT

369AX2	GREAT HALL - AT CAROUSEL ENTRANCE

As the CROWD is pouring in:

						LOGAN'S VOICE
			No!! Don't go in there !!

The CROWD turns and looks up at:

369X2	LOGAN

On a high balcony in the Great Hall.

Looking down at them.

						LOGAN 
			You don't have to die!! No one has 
			to die at thirty!!! You don't have 
			to blink out on Lastday. There's no 
			renewal on Carrousel! You can live 
			longer and grow old... I've seen it.
			She's seen it!! Believe me!!

There is an angry murmur in the CROWD as Logan continues:

						LOGAN (holding up
					his palm)
			See... it's' clear. The Lifeclocks
			are a lie - Carousel is a lie!!

369X3	WIDEN ANGLE - INCLUDING SANDMEN

Trying to grab Logan. There is a struggle. Some Sandmen are knocked
over the railing.

But remaining Sandmen fire a gas tranquilizer which subdues Logan
and Jessica.

The CROWD cheers...and continues into Carousel as:

370		INT. - SANDMAN DEBRIEFING AREA

It is the same area where Logan received the original assignment to
find and destroy Sanctuary.

In the rear...with the panel open...the sign reading:
	
		PROBABILITY	
				
blinks on and off.		

Logan is dragged in by a number of SANDMEN.

We see Jessica , too, still groggy, being held by SANDMEN in the
b.g. of the SHOT.

Logan is placed on the chair in which his CRYSTAL was altered.

371		CLOSE ANGLE - LOGAN IN THE CHAIR

A shaft of light glows on and he stiffens - bound by it.

372 		OUT

372X1-
372X3	FULL SHOT - LOGAN AND THE SCREEN

As around him in the air, a series of spectral greenish HEADS appear
-- one after the other -in response to questions. Each of these
heads is Logan. Each revolves slowly on its axis as it responds.

As the real Logan (in the chair) is questioned, each of the heads
answers in turn. They are each a part of his persona and his brain.

373-378 	OUT

378X1-
378X18	INTERCUT WITH CLOSER SHOTS OF LOGAN HIMSELF WRITHING IN
		AGONY AS THE IMPASSIVE HEADS SPEAK.

ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN AND HEADS

A. 						FIRST HEAD SPEAKS

			A Jewelry store. 

B. Logan himself - twisting in pain.

C. The word NEGATIVE appears on the SCREEN.

D.						A SECOND HEAD
					(Logan's voice)
			A creature called Box - all frozen, 
			all frozen.

E. Logan writhes in the chair.		
			
F. Again the word NEGATIVE appears on the SCREEN.	

G. 						A THIRD IDENTICAL HEAD
					(Logan's Voice)
			No...There is no Sanctuary.

H. The SCREEN seems to shimmer. It blinks.

I. A third time the word negative appears on the SCREEN.

J. 						A FOURTH HEAD 
					(Logan's voice)
			There is no Sanctuary

K. The SCREEN'S glow increases...to an almost blinding light...
starting to frighten the Sandmen present.

L. At the same time, we see JESSICA coming out of her tranquilized
daze...fearful...still in the Sandmen's custody.

M.						A FIFTH HEAD
					(Logan's voice)
			An old man without a crystal...But
			there is no Sanctuary.

N. Now the SCREEN is starting to spark. Behind it we SEE the
intermittent glow of overheated electronic components.

O. And we see the word negative...once more on the SCREEN -- but
broken now.

P. 						A SIXTH HEAD 
					(Logan's voice)
			There is no Sanctuary.

Q. Now the noise and the light from the SCREEN are peaking...and we
can see the increasing fear of the Sandmen.

R. On the SCREEN the word negative is beginning to shake...as the
SCREEN begins to shake.

379		FULL ANGLE - THE SIX HEADS

						LOGAN'S VOICE (emanating
					 from all of them)
			There is no Sanctuary. There is

The sign PROBABILITY bursts...the SIX HEADS of Logan go out.	 

The noise and the light coming out of the screen Increase, as it
begins to burst into showers of sparks and flame.

380-410 	OUT

410X1	ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN

Straining twisting, as the light above him bursts, goes out in a
puff of smoke -- releasing him. Logan staggers to his feet in time
to meet:

410X2	SANDMEN

Rushing in from the Ready Room to join the others who have closed in
on Logan One holding Jessica.

410X3	LOGAN AND SANDMEN
	
Manages to get one of the Sandmen's guns, instantly blasting him
with it. In the noise and confusion, the fight becomes general. A
Sandman fires back at Logan, misses -- the shot hits one of the
Lifeclocks which flares electrically, ribboning out a great arc.
Instantly Logan gets off a couple of shots at the other Lifeclocks
which similarly flare and burst into violent electrical fire and
discharges.

410X4	THE BATTLE

The electrical discharges, smoke and noise making great confusion.
Sandmen hampered by their own numbers and by trying to miss the
machinery. Logan firing methodically at the Lifeclocks, moving.
Stumbles over Jessica, prone in the smoke. Helps her to her feet.
Crouched, they make for the exit.

410X5	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE. SCREEN	

Sputtering its life out in strange predictive words....PROBABILITY
flashing on and off.... EQUILIBRIUM...DESTRUCT...EQUIL...NO
BALANCE...NO BALANCE...FAMINE... INACCEPTABLE ...NO BALANCE...etc.,
flashing vainly through the eddying smoke and the fierce discharges
which fill the great room.

410X6	SANDMEN

The battle is lost -- the smoke and noise overwhelming. They pick up
their wounded and get out as best they can.

410X7	INT. SANDMAN H.Q. LOBBY

Sandmen rushing out through the gathering smoke and the flare of
fire behind them.

410X8	EXT. SANDMAN H.Q.

Sandmen pouting out through smoke and fire effects. Pushing through
passers-by herding everyone away from the scene.

People getting the hell out of there.

Ad Libs: Get away from here. The whole thing's going.

410X9	INT. LIFECLOCK ROOM

Through the smoke, etc. The Lifeclocks EXPLODE.

410X10	EXT. SANDMAN H.Q.

The building EXPLODES -- great geyser of flame shooting upward.

410X11	GREAT HALL

The sound of the explosion creates panic. Lights begin to flicker.
The great red crystal lights fitfully on and off. People are
panicking, running in different directions. Some pressing into
Carrousel for safety.

410X12	CAROUSEL

As people run in there, the red crystal glowing and sputtering, the
petals moving spasmodically. As people look, the white crystal comes
on, begins spinning wildly, bursting into strange, lancing lights. A
great roaring commences and the whole arena starts to rock with the
crystals. Now the white crystal explodes and the whole room is
crisscrossed with deadly arcing discharges. People flee the scene of
destruction.

410X13	GREAT HALL

The panic is-full, people getting the hell out of there.

410X14	ARCADE

People are stampeding like cattle, all heading down and for the
exits, trampling  each other in their fright.

410X15-
X21		PANIC MONTAGE SERIES OF CUTS

A. EXT. The City under the dome -- fitfully lit as the dome itself
seems to be cracking strange electrical discharges emanating from it
as from a gigantic line storm.

B. The lights in Arcade flicker and go dim.

C. The chandeliers in Arcade swaying, a couple falling onto the
screaming panicky people.

D. Maze-Car Station. People fighting to cram into cars. Car lights
go out. People turn and bolt in another direction.

E. Love Shop -- pandemonium as the drugged bodies clamber over each
other in fear, struggling to get away.

F. Great Hall emptying -- the signs of panic everywhere.

G. The great crystal -- a wildly spluttering electrical fire
wrecking it.


410X22	EXT. - DOMED CITY - FIRE FX AND CRACKING 

INTERCUT with above:

410X23	LOGAN AND JESSICA

Making their way through Cathedral -- out the dazzle chamber,
running O.S. past Maze Car Station.

410X24	LOGAN AND JESSICA
		
Running past Power Center.

411	EXT. - CITY - FULL SHOT

The dome of the city torn. Lightning effects playing on the stunned
people...who look up and see the starry heavens, too, as they
stumble forward into the darkness.

A wind begins to blow...where air had never stirred anything. There
is a sense of wonder. Hysteria is lessening...as the people find
themselves moving through the crack...as they discover the fact that
the crystals have disappeared from their palms.

Some are joyful...others frightened...others puzzled...as they
emerge from the crack in the dome at:

412		FULL ANGLE - THE ACRES OF STRANGE STEPPED CONSTRUCTION
	
We can still see the fires in the b.g. of the SHOT as Logan holds on
to Jessica...(like Gable onto Jeanette MacDonald at the end of SAN
FRANCISCO)...full of happiness and hope for the future.

AS people continue to mill all over the acres of strange stepped
construction...we see the Old Man WALKING INTO THE SHOT.

Logan and Jessica run to him. He looks around. People start to
gather...they have never seen a white-haired Old Man in their lives.

As people continue to gather around the Old Man... who couldn't be
more delighted...Logan and Jessica are smiling...inviting people to
touch him...and some do.

Yes, he is an old man...Yes, they will all live again to be old men
and old women...Yes, this is the world renewing itself once again.

FADE OUT:

THE END
"THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT"

                                      REVISED DRAFT

                                    February 24, 1995

                

               A WINDOWPANE

               Assaulted from without by SNOWFLAKES. Wind tossed.

               INSIDE, a bed, dappled with moon shadow. A LITTLE GIRL, fast 
               asleep. The wind whistles and sighs outside. She DREAMS... 
               Eyelids closed, eyes roving beneath... then suddenly they 
               SNAP open. A stifled cry. She thrashes for her STUFFED BEAR, 
               as a soft voice says:

                                     VOICE
                         Shhhhh.

               And there's MOM, kneeling beside her. Vague shape in the 
               dimness. The full moon throws light across one sparkling 
               eye.

                                     LITTLE GIRL
                         Mommy, the men on the mountain...!

                                     MOM
                         Shhhh. Gone, all gone now.
                              (strokes her hair)
                         I'm here. Mommy's always here and no 
                         one can ever hurt you. Safe now... 
                         safe and warm... snug as a bug in a 
                         rug.
                              (beat)
                         I'll sit with you, think you can 
                         sleep?

                                     LITTLE GIRL
                         Turn on the nightlight.

               The mother nods. Passes her left hand gently over the girl's 
               forehead.

                                     MOM
                         Close your eyes now. I love you.

               The child subsides, breathing steady. Eyes closed. The mother 
               rises. Regards her through the dimness. Slowly turns, heads 
               for the door. Flicks on a Winnie the Pooh NIGHTLIGHT --

               Her entire right forearm is slicked with blood. More blood 
               on her Czech-made MP-5 machine gun.

               She staggers just a little... barely noticeable. Passes out 
               on the light. Into darkness. Sits beside her daughter's bed. 
               The child sleeps peacefully. Outside snow slithers at the 
               glass.

               FADE OUT. Pause. Blackness.

               FADE IN:

               It's snowing in southwestern Ohio. Before us, nestled in the 
               rolling hills: a postcard slice of suburbia. SUPER the legend:

                                  UPPER SANDUSKY, OHIO.
                                   Three Weeks Earlier.

               Peaceful. Serene. It's the town in the glass bubble, the one 
               God shakes to watch it snow...

               EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

               CHILDREN, dozens of them, bursting from houses. Slapping of 
               screen doors. A HORSE-DRIVEN SLEIGH is rattling down Main 
               Street. Flanked by kids. Christmas carols, droning from 
               loudspeakers.

               HAPPY, LAUGHING SANTA waves howdy, chortling his "Ho's" in 
               groups of three, meanwhile he's really a grizzled old fire 
               marshall named EARL, freezing his nuts off.

               Beside him sits MRS. CLAUS, about whom we notice two things: 
               First, she's the June in this June/December pair -- and 
               second, she's to kill for, an effortlessly beautiful woman. 
               For the record, meet SAMANTHA CAINE.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         How you holdin' up?

                                     EARL
                         Freezing my nuts off.

               Santa produces a bottle of Seagrams. Starts to open it.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         *Put that away*.

               Earl complies, grumbling. Some teenage burnouts howl from a 
               street corner:

                                     BURNOUT
                         Ow! Mrs. Claus is HOT!

               Samantha squirms in her seat, scowling.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         I can't take it, Earl, this dumb 
                         costume is giving me a wedgie. Driving 
                         me crazy, but there's these *kids* 
                         here --

                                     EARL
                         Right, you don't wanna be rootin' --

                                     SAMANTHA
                         In front of little Billy, age four, 
                         yeah. "Look, Mommy, Mrs. Claus chooses 
                         to go butt-mining."

                                     EARL
                         This is little Billy talking?

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Age four, kid's unbelievable.
                              (sighs)
                         I'm too old for this, Earl.

                                     EARL
                         Yeah, yeah. Spare me, I got a prostate 
                         the size of a melon.

               Samantha stares at him.

                                     EARL
                         Seriously, half my life's a doctor's 
                         hand up my ass, I should marry the 
                         fucker.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Say that a little louder, there's a 
                         kid in back didn't catch it.

                                     EARL
                         It's not that fucking little Billy 
                         again, is it?

               SERIES OF SHOTS:

               Throughout the following NARRATION, we watch Sam: 1) Rallying 
               the varsity CHEERLEADERS; 2) Showing off a GERBIL to her 
               seventh graders; 3) Kneeling in church with her HUSBAND, 
               blessing herself; 4) Absently fingering a silver KEY which 
               she wears round her neck; and finally 5) Probing at a tiny 
               ridged SCAR under her hairline.

                                     SAMANTHA (V.O.)
                         Eight years. I keep hiring detectives, 
                         but they never find anything.
                              (beat)
                         I was born 3000 days ago on the beach 
                         in New Jersey. I entered the world 
                         fully grown, wearing clothes I don't 
                         remember buying. Nothing in the 
                         pockets but a single key, filed 
                         smooth.
                              (beat)
                         I'm married now. Nice guy, early 
                         forties. I stand naked in the mirror 
                         and try to guess my age. Thirty-five, 
                         maybe. I have lots of scars.

               EXT. SNOWY SUBURBAN STREET - AFTERNOON

               Samantha walks with her husband HAL. Late thirties. Balding. 
               Coming out of St. Paul's Episcopal Church.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Hal, I gotta tell you, of all the 
                         Christmas pageants I've seen, this 
                         was by far the most recent.

                                     HAL
                         Aw, honey, I had teenage girls playing 
                         the wise men, what'd you expect?

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Teenage boys?

                                     HAL
                         Well, I thought they did fine.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Just fine? Come on, it was ground 
                         breaking stuff. The first Nativity 
                         where Joseph stares at the wise men's 
                         tits all night.

               She hugs him good-naturedly. As they near their house, an 
               eight year-old GIRL drops from a TREEHOUSE and comes running, 
               leaps into Mommy's arms --

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Hey, you!

               The kid leaps into her arms, as we HEAR:

                                     SAMANTHA (V.O.)
                         Her name is Caitlin. She's my daughter 
                         and when I woke up on that long-ago 
                         day, she was two months grown in my 
                         belly. I don't know who put her there. 
                         I may never. I just know she's mine, 
                         and she's about to turn eight.

               The family troops up the driveway to their SUBURBAN HOME. 
               Chipper little A-frame. Christmas lights abound. Behind the 
               house, a vast frozen POND. It is idyllic.

               INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT

               PARTY in progress. Laughter. Mingling. In the corner, CAITLIN 
               puts pipe cleaner antlers on the gerbil. Samantha shepherds 
               her home room class past the punchbowl. She is radiant. EARL 
               surreptitiously nips from a silver flask.

                                     SAMANTHA (V.O.)
                         3000 days. I teach now, fifth grade. 
                         I have the key, I wear it around my 
                         neck for luck. Except for that, and 
                         my name, all traces of my prior life 
                         are lost.
                              (beat)
                         Was I in love ever...? Did someone 
                         look in my eyes, did I say, "Darling, 
                         I'll never forget you...?"
                              (beat)
                         Because fuck me, darling, I managed.

               ACROSS THE ROOM -- Her daughter CAITLIN hangs with two young 
               girls. Shows off a plush TEDDY BEAR, says:

                                     CAITLIN
                         His name is Mr. Perkins, my Mom named 
                         him for me.

               GIRL #1 points, whispers excitedly:

                                     GIRL #1
                         That's her?

               Caitlin nods. Kid #2:

                                     GIRL #2
                         That's who?

                                     GIRL #1
                              (excitedly)
                         Her Mom, she's got amnesia.

                                     GIRL #2
                         Swear?

                                     CAITLIN
                         Swear.

                                     GIRL #2
                         Too weird.

               A voice interrupts their reverie:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Excuse me.

               The girls whirl around, startled -- Samantha is leaning on 
               the desk behind them. Busted. She smiles amiably:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Hello, girls. Caitlin, I'm going to 
                         help Dad with the refreshments.
                              (leans in, whispers)
                         Which one's Dad? I forget.

               The girls look at her like she's grown a tail.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         *Kidding*.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A DOOR KICKED OPEN, WHAM-! Splintered. Lock shattered.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - AKRON, OHIO - NIGHT

               A NUDE COUPLE on the bed. They look up, startled -- as three 
               men burst through the door. The LEADER: a haggard-looking 
               man sporting a soup-stain on his tie, whoops, that's the 
               design, sorry. MITCH HENESSEY, private investigator and con 
               man extraordinaire. He flashes a phony badge:

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         POLICE. DON'T MOVE.

                                     MAN ON BED
                         What the hell is this...?!!

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Don't give me an attitude, sir. You're 
                         assuming I won't shoot your sorry 
                         ass, and everyone knows when you 
                         make an assumption, you make an ass 
                         out of u and mption. I'm Sergeant 
                         Madigan, Vice, and if you cop a 'tude, 
                         jerkoff, I will see to it you spend 
                         the next ten years in prison getting 
                         ass-fucked, and if the case is thrown 
                         out because my arrest is too violent, 
                         then I will personally HIRE men to 
                         ass-fuck you for ten years. So if 
                         you're an ass-fucking fan, go ahead 
                         and mouth off, but meanwhile you're 
                         under arrest for the crime of 
                         prostitution, now shut the fuck up 
                         before I cut out your kneecaps and 
                         use 'em as ashtrays.
                              (beat)
                         Officer Donleavy, read him his rights.

               Donleavy looks pale, pasty. He stutters a few words. Loses 
               interest. Wanders away across the room.

                                     MAN ON BED
                              (a trifle confused)
                         Please, this is my first, I... I've 
                         never done this before, I'll do 
                         anything...!

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Sir, listen to me. I understand you're 
                         not a wealthy man, but in light of 
                         the damage this arrest will cause 
                         you, we might be able to make an 
                         arrangement --

               Donleavy plops in a chair. Belches. Grins foolishly. The man 
               in bed points to him:

                                     MAN IN BED
                         Is he all right...?

               THE REMAINING COP is swaying on his feet. Like a tree in a 
               hurricane. Donleavy pukes all over the floor. We CUT TO:

               INT. BARREN GREY OFFICE - NIGHT

               THERE'S THE GIRL. The one in bed moments ago. She and Henessey 
               are dividing a wad of bills.

                                     GIRL
                         We gotta stop using bums.

                                     MITCH
                              (lights a smoke)
                         Forget it. They looked like cops. We 
                         pulled it off, didn't we?

                                     GIRL
                         It was embarrassing.

                                     MITCH
                         You want I should hire actors, for 
                         Chrissake? These guys are cheap, 
                         they work for food.

                                     GIRL
                         Uh-huh. So, when they puke all over 
                         you is that, like, a refund?

                                     MITCH
                         Trin, I'm pissin' myself over here, 
                         you're so funny. What's this?

               He indicates an envelope earmarked for him. Labeled in magic 
               marker: SAMANTHA CAINE.

                                     TRIN
                         New case, honest to God chick with 
                         amnesia. You want the job?

               Henessey opens the envelope. Extracts a black and white HEAD 
               SHOT of Samantha, says immediately:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Yep. Yep, yep, yep.

               Stares, mesmerized. Trin peers over his shoulder:

                                     TRIN
                         Wasn't there a lady on TV named 
                         Samantha? Had a magic nose or 
                         something.

                                     HENESSEY
                         'Bewitched', yeah. Good show. Chick 
                         lived with a faggy guy, then in the 
                         last season it was a different faggy 
                         guy. Okay. Here's what we do; get on 
                         the horn to amnesia chick, tell her 
                         yes. Then tell her in 1967 she 
                         promised to give me a blow job. Worth 
                         a try, right?

               EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT

               SAMANTHA and HAL bid goodnight to their friends and neighbors. 
               Hal steers her away from a middle-aged teacher.

                                     HAL
                         Christ, guy's all over you like a 
                         cheap suit.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         That's funny, there's a cheap suit 
                         all over him like a cheap suit.

               She notices EARL sitting in the bushes by the side of the 
               building. He is speaking intently to the gerbil.

                                     HAL
                         Oh, boy. Someone's gotta take my 
                         father home. I'm plowed.

               Samantha takes the keys from him. Breathes deeply of the 
               chill night air. Smiling. Surveys the scene... their friends. 
               The neighborhood. Sighs:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         This is all I ever wanted.

               At which point, young Caitlin says:

                         How would you know?

               ESTABLISHING SHOT - STATE PRISON - OHIO - NIGHTTIME

               Switch gears: A grim, grey building. Guarded. Patrolled.

               INT. PRISON - TELEVISION VIEWING ROOM - EVENING

               A tired TV set drones to an audience of one. Let's call him 
               ONE-EYED JACK. In fact, let's give him one eye, the other 
               replaced by a PATCH. He smokes cigarettes, stubs them out on 
               the chair's armrest. Throws offhand glances at the TV screen.

                                     NEWS ANCHOR (ON T.V.)
                         ...So much for the flame-swallowing  
                         Santa of Boone County. Meanwhile, 
                         KTVA news journeyed to Upper Sandusky, 
                         where Santa's own *Mrs*. Kringle 
                         turned out to celebrate her hubby's 
                         worldwide tour. After one look at 
                         her, I'm thinking Santa got what he 
                         wanted this Christmas.

               The happy news chatter continues. Jack isn't listening. Jack 
               isn't talking or breathing either. He's simply STARING at 
               the TV screen, jaw slack...

                                     ONE-EYED JACK
                         Gotta be fuckin' kidding. No. No 
                         way. SHIIIT!!

               He SCREAMS as we CUT TO:

               EXT. WOODLANDS - WITH SAMANTHA - DRIVING

               If you had to pick a night to die horribly, you'd be hard 
               pressed to find a nicer one. A country highway. Bathed in 
               moonlight. Crusted with snow. Pontiac Sunbird, wending its 
               way through the wooded slopes.

               INT. SUNBIRD - SAME TIME

               SAMANTHA drives while Earl (the SANTA we saw earlier) 
               reclines, still drunk.

                                     EARL
                         You're married what now, five 
                         years...?

               He makes a thumb circle. Jabs his finger in and out of it:

                                     EARL
                         You and Hal, how often you two...?

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Stick our fingers in out hands and 
                         pull them out again? Every chance we 
                         get. Shut your piehole.

                                     EARL
                         Don't get all snippy...

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Earl, do me a favor. Every few words 
                         say "hic" and have bubbles come out 
                         your mouth, okay?

                                     EARL
                         Goddamnit, I'm not drunk. Would a 
                         drunk man have this much raw talent?

               He starts playing the Hawaiian nose harp. In Sam's ear, she 
               can't help it, snorts laughter --

               THE ADULT DEER appears perfectly framed in the Sunbird's 
               headlights. Dead ahead. Sam looks up, face etched in sudden 
               TERROR. *No time to think*. SWERVES, no dice...! BROADSIDES 
               the animal --

               And it comes THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. All two hundred and 
               fifteen pounds of it. Fucks up their night altogether. 
               Actually, it only makes it *halfway* through --

               But the damn thing is ALIVE. More than alive. KICKING. 
               Thrashing. Squawling with pain and rage. A FLAILING HOOF 
               takes out Earl. Kills him in less than a second. Collapses 
               his skull.

               Sam rides the wheel, screaming. An antler gouges her chest. 
               Rips. Draws blood. She SWERVES, madly -- Hits the tree doing 
               50.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Sam goes airborne. Explodes through the windshield, outward 
               bound. Shower of glass, spritz of blood... And then she's 
               flying. Slow motion, end over end... We lose all SOUND. 
               Silence as she tumbles. Below and behind her, the Sunbird 
               noiselessly ERUPTS. Fireball, sky high --

               Sam floating. Describes a lazy arc in mid-air... Whoomph-! 
               Disappears into the snow. Swallows her, leaves a silhouette. 
               Around her, trees catch fire. Burn. She lies in her impromptu 
               sarcophagus. Out of sight.

               THE FLAMING DEER totters from the wreck, thrashing. Scene 
               from a nightmare. Nightmare part two: from the snow, from 
               the human-shaped divot -- arises a woman of blood.

               She stumbles from the drift. Toward the wreck. And though 
               it's clearly Sam Caine under all that crimson, there's 
               something wrong about her *eyes*.

               En route to the car, she kneels beside the suffering deer, 
               its flesh scorched and torn -- and KILLS it. Puts it away 
               with a sharp CRACK-!ing blow to the head. Stands, eyes 
               squirming with madness...

               The car's an inferno. Earl is dead. She turns away, wiping 
               blood from her eyes -- Comes face to face with a SNOWMAN.

               A jolly white fellow. Charcoal briquettes for eyes. She 
               watches, fascinated, as he MELTS in the blast furnace heat -- 
               With warning, she *screams*. Crumples to the ground.

               The snowman's eyes fall out. He melts away and away...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - AKRON, OHIO - TWILIGHT

               Elsewhere. Tract housing, late-model cars. MITCH HENESSEY 
               delivers a Christmas gift to his nine year-old son TODD: not 
               just any gift, the *Midtown Saturn Orbiting Precinct*, with 
               action figures. Henessey points to the box, engrossed:

                                     HENESSEY
                         ...and here's the jail here, see...? 
                         Escape chute for the Borian, he's a 
                         dinosaur guy, Moves quick, don't 
                         take no shit neither. See, you can 
                         make him shoot the guard -- ah, hell, 
                         look, I played with it a little 
                         myself, I'm sorry.

               VOICE interrupts them:

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         TODD, TIME FOR DINNER. NOW.

               An awkward pause. Henessey scowls.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Hey, you go ahead, um... hope you 
                         like the present.

                                     TODD
                         It's awesome, Dad. Mom, though, she...
                              (sighs)
                         She gets weird. On my birthday, when 
                         you gave me the Schwinn... she called 
                         bicycle stores to see if there'd 
                         been any robberies.

               Henessey manages to control his face. Says tightly:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Tell her I don't steal them locally.

               He watches, forlorn, as his son vanishes inside the house. 
               Christmas lights, blinking feebly. We HEAR, supered:

                                     HENESSEY (V.O.)
                         Dear Ma: Filled out the child support 
                         stuff last week. Office got pissed, 
                         under ex-spouse I put "Spawn of Satan, 
                         Dweller in Eternal Dark." Just being 
                         honest, Ma, lady wants me to die.

               As he reaches his car, his BEEPER goes off.

               EXT. PHONE BOOTH - MINUTES LATER

               Henessey on the phone. Dials. Waits. We HEAR:

                                     HENESSEY (V.O.)
                         I'd go without a ripple, that's the 
                         truth. Ex-con. Ex-husband. Expired. 
                         Thanks, Ma, for hiding the truth 
                         from me for so long. Or maybe you 
                         believed in me. I miss you. I hope 
                         you believed, even for a day. No one 
                         did, Ma. No one at all. It's cold 
                         here. I'm sorry you're dead. Your 
                         son, Mitch.

               The phone picks up. He says:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Me. What's up?

                                     TRIN (O.S.)
                         Mitch, we got a bite on amnesia 
                         chick's photo. Found a guy remembers 
                         seeing her, fall of '87. He wants 
                         cash, should I grease him?

                                     HENESSEY
                         Hell, no! Use your head, girl. Let 
                         the fucker squeeze the Charmin.

                                     TRIN
                         You kidding? Guy's hideous. I'll do 
                         it, but we're talking time and a 
                         half. Plus a night on the town when 
                         I get back, and *no cockfights this 
                         time*.

               INT. SAMANTHA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - TWO DAYS LATER

               Samantha, having survived. Laid up now in an austere hospital 
               room. Listening to silence. Stares out the window at a sunlit 
               tree. Head bandaged. Frowns:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         I want a cigarette, why do I want a 
                         cigarette...?

               Outside, snow slithers... Her eyelids, slowly closing. Slides 
               off the edge of consciousness...

               IN THE DREAM: She stands on a windswept cliff, before an 
               incongruous FULL-LENGTH MIRROR. Staring at her reflection -- 
               it's bleeding from a scalp wound.

               She probes her head... frowns. Nothing. Nothing but the tiny 
               RIDGED SCAR she's had for as long as she can remember.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         What... what do you want...?

               The reflection eyes her grimly. Haggard. Tired.

                                     REFLECTION
                         I want a cigarette.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         I don't smoke.

                                     REFLECTION
                              (chuckles)
                         You used to.

               Samantha is suddenly holding a cigarette. She raises it to 
               her lips. Her reflection MIRRORS her precisely. Except 
               Samantha COUGHS, chokes on the smoke -- While her bloody 
               reflection takes a long, satisfying drag.

                                     REFLECTION
                         Relax, you can drop the act. Nice 
                         and smooth, take another hit. There 
                         you go. See how easy it comes back?

               They are now in perfect synchronicity. Sam inhales easily.

                                     REFLECTION
                         *I'm* coming back. You know that, 
                         don't you? Name's Charly, by the 
                         way. You're gonna love me.

               The reflection grins. There's blood on its TEETH.

               INT. SAMANTHA'S HOME - DAY

               Back at home, business as usual, pre-Christmas. A COMMOTION 
               has arisen: Gingerly, bones still aching, Samantha moves 
               toward the KITCHEN. HAL and CAITLIN trail behind.

                                     HAL
                         Honey, you can't cook, I'm not wrong 
                         about this.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         I'm *remembering*, Hal. Things are 
                         coming back. Trust me, I'm a chef, I 
                         know it.

                                     CAITLIN
                         Daddy, make her stop!

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Hush. Go to the garage and get me 
                         something, anything. A veggie, go, 
                         man, go! I'm hot to trot.

               INT. KITCHEN/GARAGE - SAME

               Hal worriedly exits to the garage. Plucks a tomato from the 
               fridge, tosses it to Caitlin, who stands in the door.

                                     HAL
                         Tomato.

               Caitlin turns, tosses it to Sam --

                                     CAITLIN
                         Tomato.

               Who catches it, plops it on the cutting board and proceeds 
               to DICE it to SIMTHEREENS. Razor-thin slices. Knife a blur. 
               Missing her fingers by millimeters, never faltering, like a 
               mad mumblety-pegger --

                                     HAL
                         Onion, flying in.

               Sam catches it. Knife flurries. Pieces, flying up.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         More. Faster.

               And it becomes a bucket brigade. Hal heaves veggies to Caitlin 
               who spins and relays to Mom who slices, dices, purees, and 
               even makes curly fries. Veggies, incoming. HAL starts to 
               lose it, starts lobbing them at Caitlin, one after another, 
               she giggles, starts throwing them overhand --

                                     CAITLIN
                         Tomato. Tomato. Tomato.

               And now it's a food fight, PELTING Mom, and the floor is 
               COVERED with food as Hal stumbles in laughing, scoops up 
               Caitlin --

               Samantha shakes her head, grinning, dices to pieces a last, 
               lovely radish. Ends with a flourish, TA-DAH-! Doesn't think: 
               Flips the knife point up on ONE FINGER. Tips it for balance. 
               Lobs a tomato. Slings the knife without looking, pins it to 
               the wall, KA-CHUK--!

               Everyone goes silent. The knife, quivering. Caitlin and Hal 
               turn as one, gaping at her. She shrugs numbly. Blinks.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Uh... chefs do that.

               INT. BOILER ROOM - DAY OR NIGHT, IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL

               Underground. Water GURGLES through overhead pipes. Furnaces 
               hum and tick in the sweaty gloom.

               A SHIRTLESS MAN is tied to a chair. Weeping. Before him, 
               what looks like a young GQ model. Blonde. Gorgeous. Impeccably 
               attired. For the record, TIMOTHY. He looks his captive in 
               the eye as the guy blubbers:

                                     MAN
                         Please, man... I don't know why you 
                         gotta kill me... But use the gun, 
                         not the knife. Please. As a fucking 
                         favor, I'm begging you...

                                     TIMOTHY
                         It'll be over soon.

                                     MAN
                         Jesus, man... I... I'm scared of the 
                         knife... Shit, I can't handle getting 
                         shots at the doctors, man, PLEASE...!

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Last chance. What do you know about 
                         a town called Santa Claus?

                                     MAN
                         What is this, *what the fuck is 
                         this*?? I'm FBI, for Chrissake, you 
                         can't do this to me. I don't know 
                         ANYTHING.

               Timothy stares him full in the face, eyes narrowed... as 
               though seeing into his brain. He nods, satisfied.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         No. You don't.
                              (beat)
                         I can always tell, you know... If 
                         someone's lying to me. A little skill 
                         of mine, something to trot out at 
                         parties.

               He slams home the knife. We don't see it, but we FEEL the 
               impact. The FBI man's face contorts in SHOCK. Twisted. Inches 
               away from Timothy, their eyes lock...

               A CELLULAR PHONE BEEPS. Timothy reacts, annoyed. Plucks it 
               from his belt and flips it open:

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Timothy.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Message from Mr. Daedalus.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         I'm listening.

               He shrugs at his captive. Rolls his eyes. The guy's still 
               dying, still on the KNIFE.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         He says he's sorry, but he needs you 
                         right away. Something's come up.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Nix. I'm just finishing up here. 
                         Then I'm going bunjee jumping.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         He's aware of your weekend plans, 
                         and he apologizes.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         All right, what's so fucking 
                         important?

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Your old colleague, One-Eyed Jack...? 
                         Recently escaped from a high-security 
                         prison, as you're aware. But listen 
                         to this: prior to his escape, seems 
                         he saw something on TV that disturbed 
                         him. So much he had to be sedated.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         I saw it, too. It's called "Empty 
                         Nest." How the fuck is it my business?

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         The man was overheard talking to 
                         himself under sedation.
                              (beat)
                         He said Charly Baltimore's alive, 
                         sir.

               Timothy is silent.

                                     SUIT
                         I know it's incredible, sir, but... 
                         if she were alive, I'm thinking she 
                         might be in contact with the old man 
                         in Pennsylvania. Should I --

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Tap his phone, yes. And tell Daedalus 
                         I'm on my way. Timothy out.

               He clicks off, face troubled. Withdraws the knife. Checks 
               his clothing. Not one speck of blood.

               INT. SUPERMARKET - CHECKOUT STAND - AFTERNOON

               A CARTON OF MARLBORO REDS hits the stack of groceries. HAL 
               looks at his wife, bewildered.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         They were on sale.

               At the next register over, a duo of Canadians throw looks 
               her way. Confer in rapid-fire French, subtitled for us:

                                     CANADIAN #1
                         Ooh, j'aimerais la baiser. (Subtitle: 
                         I'd like to fuck her.)

               The checker looks up, smiles:

                                     CHECKER
                         Don't you love hearing people speak 
                         French?

                                     CANADIAN #2
                         Oui, j'veux etirer celle-la autour 
                         d'une chaise. Comme je le vois, une 
                         femme c'est comme Gumby avec des 
                         seins. (Subtitle: I'll stretch her 
                         over a chair, women are merely Gumbys 
                         with tits.)

                                     HAL
                         Beautiful language.

               He turns to Samantha -- except Sam isn't there. Her arm shoots 
               out-! CLAMPS on one of the men. By the throat. Catches him 
               like a fucking VICE. Her voice a sibilant hiss:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         *Allez, Gumby etiriait le cou, fils 
                         de pute*.

               Subtitle: "Gumby's gonna stretch your neck, motherfucker." 
               Accent flawless. Eyes like steel. The man will go on to start 
               a profitable construction business with the bricks he shits.

                                                               SLAM CUT TO:

               SAMANTHA - ON THE PHONE TO HER SHRINK - INTERCUT

               Jubilant, can't contain herself:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         I speak French.

                         whatever the fuck that means.
                              (chortles)
                         Quand j'étais a l'ecole, Jai eu un 
                         professeur qui s'est fabriqué du 
                         dentifrice!

                                     PSYCHIATRIST
                         You just said when you were in school, 
                         your teacher was made of toothpaste.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Right, he was, you got a problem 
                         with that? Pasty Joe, we called him. 
                         Look, the accent's perfect, so piss 
                         off. I'M A FRENCH CHEF, YA-HOO.

               EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

               Samantha and daughter CAITLIN sing a hearty chorus of "Frere 
               Jaques." Sam giggles , Caitlin looks nervous; astride her 
               new two-wheeler BICYCLE while Sam finishes removing the 
               training wheels. Caitlin points to her stuffed TEDDY BEAR.

                                     CAITLIN
                         Put Perkins in the basket. He's luck.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Mr. Perkins, going in the basket.

                                     CAITLIN
                         Are the training wheels off?

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Just pretend they're still there. 
                         Piece of cake. You can do it.

                                     CAITLIN
                         Wait...! I'm scared.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Shhh. Nothing to be scared of. Pretend 
                         you're one of the X-men, you're tough. 
                         Let's go, now. Three, two, one...

                                     CAITLIN
                         Mom, I can't do it, swear --

               Samantha sets her sailing. Laughs excitedly. The bike weaves, 
               side to side... hits the curb and topples with a CRASH. Spills 
               Caitlin to the pavement. Now's she's CRYING.

                                     CAITLIN
                         Ouch--! I can't do it, it HURTS-!

               Samantha walks over briskly. Face set in determined lines.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Nonsense. You can do it. You don't 
                         want to, but you can.

                                     CAITLIN
                         My arm hurts, please take me home...!

                                     SAMANTHA
                         You can go home, Caitlin. You can 
                         ride there.

               An unpleasant note is edging into her voice. The louder the 
               kid cries, the more Samantha starts to SIMMER.

                                     CAITLIN
                         Mom, no...!

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Look, I know you're afraid, that's 
                         the whole *point*, can you see that? 
                         Now stop being a little baby and get 
                         on the damn bike.

               She hoists her onto the seat. Caitlin cries and hollers.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         You gonna be afraid of things all 
                         your life? Huh? That what you want?

                                     CAITLIN
                         My wrist hurts...!

               *Snap*. Something lets go. Suddenly Samantha's right in her 
               face:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Life is pain. Get used to it. See, 
                         you *will* ride this bike home, 
                         princess. You will ride it and you 
                         will not fall again, *is that 
                         understood*...?

               Eyes cold and lifeless. She is not herself. CUT TO:

               INT. SAMANTHA'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT

               CAITLIN huddles on the steps, itching at her brand new WRIST 
               CAST. Eavesdropping on her parents. In the kitchen a counter-
               top TV is on, the Three Stooges. Samantha is on the phone, 
               saying:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Yes, I'm three blocks past the gas 
                         station... Right. Thank you Mr. 
                         Henessey, I'll see you shortly.

               She hangs up as HAL ENTERS behind her... She doesn't turn 
               around. Samples the topping of a cream pie. Stares at the 
               linoleum floor. He regards her with angry, vindictive eyes:

                                     HAL
                         She rode all the way home. She didn't 
                         fall, not once. She didn't cry.
                              (beat)
                         You're good. You should work with 
                         kids, you know that?

                                     SAMANTHA
                         She said her wrist hurt. I didn't 
                         know it was broken, God. I can't 
                         even remember what I said to her...!

               Hal takes a breath, composes himself.

                                     HAL
                         We can still make six o'clock mass, 
                         you coming?

               Sam surveys her perfect kitchen. Runs her hand over a hanging 
               pot. Looks sadly at her husband. Whispers:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         A private detective's coming by, 
                         he... he's found something.
                              (beat)
                         I may have to go away. For a bit. 
                         Now please leave me alone.

                                     HAL
                         Go away. With a detective. Jesus, 
                         it's the holidays, Sam --

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Are you deaf? I said leave me alone. 
                         Go to church. Drink blood. Drink 
                         some for me.

               They stand in tableau. An electric silence... Broken quite 
               suddenly by the sound of SINGING. CHRISTMAS CAROLERS. Outside 
               the front door. The sweet strains of "God Rest Ye Merry, 
               Gentlemen" wafts in through the window.

               Except the sweet strains ain't so sweet. These carolers are 
               TERRIBLE. Missing by a country octave. Sam and Hal look at 
               each other, what the hell...?

               EXT. THE FRONT PORCH - JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR - NIGHT

               THE CAROLERS continue their interesting rendition. Snowflakes 
               fall. All is quiet. All is bright. Especially bright is the 
               SHOTGUN BARREL pressed to the throat of the lead soprano. HE-
               109. Over and under combo. Shotgun on top. HE cannon on 
               bottom. You'd sing shitty too.

               INT. HOUSE - SAME

               Samantha hurries to the door. Carrying a bowl of festive 
               M&M's. Just as she gets to the door, the singing STOPS. 
               Footfalls running away, that's odd... She opens the door. 
               Carolers, gone. She's eye to eye with ONE-EYED JACK.

                                     ONE-EYED JACK
                         Evening Charly. Long time.

               He swings the big GUN. Slams the barrel into her. Glass 
               shatters, M&M's everywhere. She gapes at him, dumbstruck, 
               unable to THINK... Hurry it up, lady, we need a decision, 
               live or *die* --

               SHE GRABS THE GUN BARREL. Wrenches the gun...! On the steps 
               CAITLIN howls, eyes like saucers --

                                     CAITLIN
                         Mommy...!

                                     SAMANTHA
                         GET OUUTTTTT!!!!

               Sam's cry is a veritable shriek. HAL LAUNCHES himself from 
               the kitchen doorway. Pounces on Jack, snarling -- brave, 
               useless. For his trouble, gets three broken ribs and a trip 
               to the fireplace, airborne. Comes down. Catches fire. ROLLS, 
               over and over on broken ribs --

               JACK kicks Samantha in the gut. She collapses onto the stairs. 
               Splinters the banister. That's when he sees CAITLIN. Top of 
               the stairs, paralyzed.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         NO!!!!

               Jack is already moving forward. SPIN-COCKS the shotgun, draws 
               a bead -- Promptly slips on festive M&M's. Goes down. Gun 
               goes off, WHAM-! A flat concussion. The banister EXPLODES. A 
               storm of wood chips, as SAMANTHA surges up the stairs, toward 
               her daughter --

               JACK. On the ground. Fires, *wham*--! The wall DISAPPEARS 
               three inches from Caitlin's head. Blown to shreds, you can 
               see outdoors. Samantha doesn't miss a beat. Grabs her daughter -- 
               flings her OUTSIDE. Through the hole in the wall. Takes her 
               by the belt and fucking HURLS her out into space...!

               EXT. SIDE OF HOUSE - SAME TIME

               Two stories up. The kid is ejected, flailing. Floats in SLOW 
               MOTION. Across a ten foot gap -- INTO THE TREEHOUSE. Sails 
               head over heels into the place. Hits with a CRASH. Alive and 
               unhurt.

               BACK INSIDE THE HOUSE

               Samantha didn't even look. Didn't need to. Here comes JACK. 
               Up the staircase. Reloading. Samantha launches herself down 
               the stairs. COLLIDES, head on -- Down they go. Jack, rolls 
               to his feet. Propels her into the KITCHEN.

               INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

               She hits, spray of cat food. SKIDS. Across the linoleum, 
               slams to a stop. Hard. Cupboard pops open, out comes the 
               IRONING BOARD. Falls into place, SNAP--!

               A GUN BLAST disintegrates it. Reveals Sam, cowering behind.

                                     ONE-EYED JACK
                         I want my eye back, bitch.

               Samantha struggles to her feet. Dazed. Jack abandons the 
               shotgun. Takes the IRON down from its spot on the shelf -- 
               Slams it against her head.

                                     ONE-EYED JACK
                         Goddamn you. Fight me. What's wrong 
                         with you, *fight* me!

               CLOSE ON TV: Stooge Joe Besser mugs wildly, takes a pie in 
               the face.

               Jack raises his arm for the killing stroke -- Samantha takes 
               Hal's cream pie from the counter and shatters every bone in 
               his face.

               Comes from nowhere. Back foot planted, body twisting, entire 
               organism focused into the outstretched arm, WHACK-! We have 
               never seen anyone move this fast. Samantha RECOILS. Startled 
               by what she's done --

               The glass dish is SPLINTERED into his head. It STICKS there. 
               He topples. Hits the linoleum. She straddles him, breathing 
               hard. Winded.

               The barking dog "Jingle Bells" plays inanely in the 
               background. Samantha stares. Trembling. Pokes the body. 
               Nothing. Pokes it again. Still nothing. She leans forward. 
               Grips the neck and wrenches, CRACK-! Just making sure.

               She out of it. In shock. Glaring at her own hands as if 
               demanding an excuse for their behavior. There is pie filling 
               on her fingers. She kneels beside the corpse, catatonic. 
               Stares. Absent-mindedly licks the bloodied cream.

               HAL is standing in the doorway. Wide-eyed. He has seen 
               Samantha break the man's neck. She looks at him, frowns.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         It took me three seconds. That's... 
                         that's good, huh...?

               He stares, dumbstruck. She blinks. *Snaps out of it*.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Caitlin. We gotta find Caitlin.

               She gets up. We RUN with her to the front door -- she flings 
               it open and collides with MITCHELL HENESSEY. Private dick. 
               Runs right into him.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Hey--! Slow down. The kid's okay, 
                         she's in my car, what the hell is 
                         going on?

               Henessey spins, as FOUR POLICE CRUISERS pull up. Vomit up a 
               bevy of COPS, swarming toward the house. He spins back to 
               Samantha -- As she collapses to the floor.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               Pause. FADE IN. Super the legend: ONE WEEK LATER.

               ESTABLISHING - SAMANTHA'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Early morning quiet. HENESSEY and SAMANTHA are throwing 
               suitcases into the back of his battered Chrysler.

               INT. HOUSE - LATER - EVERYTHING'S PACKED

               Sam's looked better. Kneels beside Caitlin, says softly:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         That man who tried to hurt us...? If 
                         I stay here... other people will 
                         come. I have to leave. Just for a 
                         little while.

               Caitlin looks at the floor. Doesn't respond. Samantha reaches 
               in a cupboard. Produces a box of CANDLES. Lights a match, 
               touches flame to one of them.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         I want you to light a candle and 
                         keep it in the kitchen window. And 
                         never, *ever* let it go out, because 
                         as long as it burns...? It means 
                         you're thinking of me. And if I'm 
                         alone... if it's dark and I'm lost... 
                         It's how I'll find my way home.

               She touches Caitlin's wrist cast. Pain in her features. She 
               grabs a marker pen and writes a TELEPHONE NUMBER on it.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         That's for a portable phone. I keep 
                         it with me, you call me anytime, you 
                         don't worry about the bill. And last 
                         but not least --

               She reaches behind her head. Unhooks the KEY, the one she 
               wears around her neck.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         For luck.

               Slips it over her daughter's head. Looks up at HAL, eyes 
               brimming. He whispers:

                                     HAL
                         No matter what you find, I'm not 
                         scared. Not of you. Not ever...

               SERIES OF SHOTS: EXT. SUBURBAN TOWN

               As it fades behind Henessey's Chrysler. Leaving behind porch-
               bound elders, dimestore clerks. Grinning children, hair like 
               spun straw. All fading... DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. HENESSEY'S PLYMOUTH - THE OPEN ROAD - DAY

               Henessey sings with the radio. Loudly. He's got the lyrics 
               wrong: "I'm not talking 'bout the linen... And I don't wanna 
               change your life..."

               Samantha endures as much as she can. Speaks up:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         "Movin' in."

                                     HENESSEY
                         Hah?

                                     SAMANTHA
                         It's not linen. The song's not about 
                         linen.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Whatever. You cold?

                                     SAMANTHA
                              (shivers)
                         I'm freezing.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Turn on the heater. It doesn't work, 
                         but it makes a very annoying noise 
                         which distracts from the cold.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         I'll pass.
                              (clears her throat)
                         So, you're a former cop. Atlanta, 
                         was it...? Stop me if I'm out of 
                         line, but I'm curious. How did you... 
                         well, succeed? I mean, where six 
                         other detectives failed?

                                     HENESSEY
                         You kidding? Pure luck. Plus my 
                         secretary used her feminine wiles. 
                         She's got two, one wile per side. 
                         Huge. No kidding, you can see 'em 
                         coming around a corner, you got time 
                         to comb your hair. Nice kid, you'd 
                         dig her.
                              (beat)
                         Ah. Here we are.

               EXT. STORAGE RENTAL PLACE - DAY

               As they clamber from the car, Henessey shoves his sunglasses 
               into his sportcoat. SINGS:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Putting my glasses in my cooooat..."

               Samantha looks at him like he's sprouted wings.

                                     HENESSEY
                         I sing what I do so I'll remember 
                         it. "Turning off the downstairs 
                         liiiight..." You know?

               Samantha smiles thinly. The man's a lunatic.

               INT. STORAGE FACILITY - DAY

               An old, walrus-mustached IRISHMAN ushers them down a concrete 
               hallway. The old man hangs back with Henessey. Whispers:

                                     WALRUS MAN
                         The elder Trelawney rented to her in 
                         '87, aye. Ne'er could bring himself 
                         to dispose of her things. I'faith, 
                         she's welcome to whatsoe'er she 
                         wishes, for ne'er has trod these 
                         walls a lass so easy on the eye, 
                         divil take me if I'm lyin'.

               Henessey lights a cigarette, says:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Do me a favor. Say, "Always after me 
                         Lucky Charms."

                                     ANGUS
                         "Always after me Lucky Charms."

                                     HENESSEY
                         Thanks. Just needed to hear that.

               INT. STORAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

               Drab, musty. Filled with disused tables, lamps, farm 
               implements... Jimmy Hoffa watches TV in the corner.

                                     HENESSEY
                         See anything you recognize?

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Yeah, this dirt used to be outside 
                         my window, shut up and let me look.
                              (sighs)
                         I'm sorry, Mr. Henessey, I'm a little 
                         on edge.

               She pauses. Surveys the musty compartment, faraway look in 
               her eye... says softly:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         I can feel her. Like a ghost.
                              (beat)
                         We could walk away, you know. There's 
                         still time, we could just... leave 
                         her dead.

               She hefts a SUITCASE onto a bench. OPENS it -- Draws a sharp 
               breath:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Ay-i-yi!

               Clothes to kill for. Smooth velvet. Creamy silk. The finest, 
               the best. The sexiest. Sam peeks at the tags:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Size four, no way. You know how long 
                         it's been since I could wear a size 
                         four?
                              (beat)
                         Can't be mine. Can they...?

               She checks the case for INITIALS -- C.E.B. Who...?

               Henessey grunts. In his book, well dressed is clean underwear. 
               Holds up a small manila envelope.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Unmailed envelope. Addressed to a 
                         guy.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         What's in it?

                                     HENESSEY
                         Another guy's address. Two addresses, 
                         is basically what I'm saying.

               Meanwhile, her hands, still pawing through the suitcase... A 
               SHAPE. She feels it. At the bottom of the case. Lifts up the 
               mound of fabric -- HKM-40 sniper rifle. Disassembled. Sam 
               looks like she just took a stomach punch.

               Up until now, it could've been adrenaline. She could still 
               be just a schoolteacher. A rifle, that changes everything. 
               She plunks the clothing back in place. Hides it.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Anything else in there?

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Hmm...? Uh, no. Just... more clothes.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Yeah, well take a look at this.

               He holds up the envelope: addresses to one *Nathan Windeman*. 
               Fishes in his coat, brings out Samantha's CHECK. Written to 
               him, earlier that day... identical handwriting. CUT TO:

               INT. COLONIAL STYLE HOME - LATE AFTERNOON

               NATHAN WINDEMAN is in a bad mood. A frail-looking man, mid-
               seventies. Tiredly spooning a bowl of soup. His sister ALICE 
               watches TV nearby. In her lap, a Pomeranian cleans itself. 
               Windeman scowls:

                                     NATHAN
                         Alice, please...?

               Alice stares at him. Uncomprehending.

                                     NATHAN
                         Your dog, Alice. It and my appetite 
                         are mutually exclusive.

                                     ALICE
                         What's wrong with the dog?

                                     NATHAN
                         It's simple. He's been licking his 
                         asshole for three straight hours. I 
                         submit to you that there's nothing 
                         there worth more than an hour's 
                         attention, and I should think whatever 
                         he's attempting to dislodge is either 
                         gone for good or there to stay. 
                         *Wouldn't you agree*?

               Theatrical? Nah. The old bat scoops up her pooch and beats 
               feet for the door. THE PHONE RINGS. Nathan snatches it up:

                                     NATHAN
                         Hello?

               The voice is soft. Controlled:

                                     SAMANTHA (O.S.)
                         Hello, Mr. Windeman, I got this number 
                         from a realtor in Pennsylvania. I'd 
                         like to speak with you.

                                     NATHAN
                         Who... who is this?

                                     SAMANTHA
                         You tell me, Mr. Windeman.

               Nathan pales. Blinks once. Twice. Manages:

                                     NATHAN
                         ...Charly...?

                                     SAMANTHA (O.S.)
                         My full name, please.

                                     NATHAN
                         God, it really is you...!? Chapter, 
                         they think you're dead, *everyone* 
                         thinks --

                                     SAMANTHA
                         *My full name*. Please...!

               A pause. Then:

                                     NATHAN
                         You don't know your name.

               He chews his lower lip, mind racing. Jesus, no joke, this is 
               *her*... He fights to control his voice:

                                     NATHAN
                         Your full name... is Charlene 
                         Elizabeth Baltimore.

               INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - SAME TIME

               A MAN in shirtsleeves flips a switch. Speaks into a headset:

                                     MAN
                         Signal Daedalus. We just got her, 
                         she made contact. Initiating phone 
                         trace.

               INT. HOUSE - BACK WITH NATHAN

                                     NATHAN
                         Charly, don't talk, just listen: We 
                         have to meet, understand? We have to 
                         meet *right away*.

                                     SAMANTHA (O.S.)
                         Meet me off I-79. Highmile exit, 
                         Salt & Pepper Lounge. Eleven a.m.

               She hangs up. Nathan stares, trembling. Turns to ALICE, 
               standing in the doorway. Swallows hard, says:

                                     NATHAN
                         A former student... is in trouble.

               INT. RESTAURANT BATHROOM - WITH CHARLY

               She hangs up the telephone in the ladies' room. Stands, alone 
               in the stillness. Hands to her head, mind churning...

               Turns, checks to make sure the door is locked. Props her 
               SUITCASE on the sink and opens it. Flips back the mound of 
               clothing --

               And there it is. The pieces, disassembled, of an M-40 sniper 
               rifle. Her trembling hands find the parts, seemingly of their 
               own volition... Hefting them. Gauging their feel. And then, 
               slowly... terrifyingly...

               Knowing how they go together. She SNAPS the barrel in place, 
               *click*-! The sound breaks her reverie. She drops the thing 
               like it's alive. Looks down, trembling...

               ALSO in the case: a wicked looking HUNTING KNIFE. She picks 
               it up gingerly. Shiny, brand new. Turns it over in her hand, 
               fascinated by the play of light off the blade...

               Looks up. Her REFLECTION, in the mirror. Staring back. She 
               frowns -- It frowns. She turns away --

               THE REFLECTION DOESN'T. It stays right fucking put, except 
               now it's *smiling*. Malignant. Deadly. Sam feels something 
               wrong. Spins back toward the mirror --

               Her reflected arm comes through the looking glass. Reaches 
               into Sam's world and SLICES FOR HER THROAT.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DRIVING - LATE AFTERNOON

               Samantha JERKS, comes awake in the passenger seat of 
               Henessey's Plymouth. Bad dream. Looks over to see if he 
               noticed -- he's honking his horn at a TRAFFIC JAM. Sea of 
               taillights, dead ahead.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         What's this? What the hell is this...? 
                         We don't have time for this, of all 
                         the cocksucking bullshit --

                                     HENESSEY
                         Whoa. Ms. Class, drive a little truck 
                         on the side, do you?

                                     SAMANTHA
                         What are you, a Mormon?

                                     HENESSEY
                         No, ma'am, it's just that... well, 
                         when we met you're all, "Oh, fooey, 
                         I burned the darn cupcakes." Now, 
                         you go into a bar, ten minutes later 
                         sailors come running out, they can't 
                         take it.

               Just then, THREE POLICE CRUISERS blow by, sirens screaming. 
               Henessey frowns, puzzled.

                                     HENESSEY
                         What the hell...? Lemme check the 
                         scanner.

               He switches on a police band radio. Listens, hears:

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         ...without endangering the hostages, 
                         over... ...Roger that two-niner. PCP 
                         confirmed, he's on a fuse, please 
                         provide backup, over... ...Conneaut, 
                         I'm waiting on Special Weapons, sorry, 
                         over...

               EXT. ROADSIDE DINER - CONNEAUT LAKE, PA. - SAME

               POLICE FLASHERS, spinning. Cop cars, incoming. SLAMMING to a 
               halt. Disgorging uniformed cops. THE DINER is rapidly 
               surrounded. Its a cheery decor, the giant roofbound Santa, 
               all in stark contrast -- To the SCREAMING we hear, dimly, 
               from within.

               INT. DINER - SAME

               Hostage drama, unfolding. The perp's a big ugly meatloaf 
               with his mitts on a waitress. She's sixteen, she's a baby. 
               She's sucking the barrel of his shotgun. His finger on the 
               trigger. From outside, we hear the COPS:

                                     COP VOICE (O.S.)
                         GIVE YOURSELF UP AT ONCE. LEAVE THE 
                         BUILDING, HANDS ON HEAD. DROP THE 
                         WEAPON, REPEAT, DROP THE WEAPON.

               Mr. Shotgun snorts laughter. Does a little dance, yells:

                                     MR. SHOTGUN
                         I'm the man! I'm the man! I elicit 
                         the explicit!

               EXT. DINER - SAME TIME

               The police are just starting to re-route traffic. A highway 
               cop signals to HENESSEY, "Turn around, go back."

               INT. CAR - SAME TIME

               Henessey swears. Swings wide, when suddenly a HAND clutches 
               his arm. He looks over and suppresses a shiver -- Samantha's 
               eyes have gone dead and cold. She lights a cigarette, shakes 
               out the match and says:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Go up this hill.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Why?

                                     SAMANTHA
                         *Drive up the fucking hill*.

               Now Henessey shivers. Cranks the wheel as we CUT TO:

               EXT. HILLTOP - OVERLOOKING TOWN - NIGHT

               SAMANTHA flops on the frozen ground in a stand of pine trees.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Where the shit did you get that?

               No answer. She deftly assembles the SNIPER RIFLE. Rests the 
               rifle barrel on a dead branch. Flicks on the starlight scope.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Sam, Goddammit, you're gonna kill 
                         someone! Hey!

               She ignores him. Focuses through the scope. POV SAMANTHA: 
               Framed in spectral GREEN, the diner's interior. Hostages. 
               Crying mothers. Children, catatonic.

               Through a tiny window -- a limited view of the KITCHEN. He's 
               in there. Girl, eating both barrels. Samantha's jaw tightens.

                                     HENESSEY
                         The diner...? That's half a mile 
                         away, are you fucking crazy?

                                     SAMANTHA
                         HK M-40 assault rifle. At three 
                         hundred yards, vertical drop six 
                         inches.

               Mr. Shotgun leans in. WHISPERS something to the waitress.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Shit. He's gonna do the girl.

                                     HENESSEY
                         How the fuck can you tell?

               She steadies the rifle. Takes aim.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         I read lips.

               She fires. Splintered CRACK-!

               INT. DINER

               Mr. Shotgun dies on his feet. Outgoing matter. Flung. 
               Spattered on the grill where it sizzles along with burnt 
               hamburger. He drops. Screams. Pandemonium.

               EXT. HILLTOP - MOMENTS LATER

               Samantha slams the trunk of the Chrysler. Gets in the 
               passenger side without a word. Henessey pulls away.

               INT. CAR - DRIVING - SAME

               Samantha stares straight ahead. Gives a high, brittle laugh.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         See? Took care of it. Knew I could.

               She laughs again. Henessey favors her with a look reserved 
               for people with major deformities. Suddenly she says:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Pull over.

               He stops the car. She gets out. Stumbles across the shoulder. 
               Kneels. Throws up. Henessey watches. Lights a smoke with 
               trembling hands.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Had to, he... he would've killed 
                         her... Had to... Oh God I took him, 
                         such a good shot... I felt proud of 
                         it, such a shot, Jesus, *how could I 
                         be proud*...?
                              (sobs)
                         I'm scared... I want to go home...

               Henessey kneels beside her awkwardly. She clutches his 
               shoulder. Presses her head to his chest. Cries.

               EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

               Yes, it certainly is. CUT TO:

               INT. SITUATION BRIEFING ROOM - SAME TIME

               Three stories below the White House proper. THE PRESIDENT is 
               seated in his robe and slippers. Before him sits a panel of 
               three: National Security Adviser; Deputy Director of the 
               CIA; and ANOTHER MAN in his sixties, sporting a distinguished 
               mane of silver hair. The President addresses him:

                                     PRESIDENT
                         *Mister Perkins*.
                              (frowns)
                         Please, say it again, I'm a little 
                         slow. Better yet, I'll try it. You 
                         lost an operative, a trained 
                         counterassassin, and you just saw 
                         her on TV in a Christmas parade.

               The silver-haired man appears unperturbed. And no, by the 
               way, it didn't escape us that he shares his surname with 
               Caitlin's TEDDY BEAR, the one Mom named -- He nods, says:

                                     SILVER-HAIRED MAN
                         On TV, that's correct. It's two weeks 
                         old, intelligence just caught it.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         You recruited this woman in the late 
                         seventies?

                                     SILVER-HAIRED MAN
                         For Chapter, yes. I was a friend of 
                         her father's, you see, and... I took 
                         her in.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Well, it looks like she returned the 
                         favor, now doesn't it?
                              (throws up his hands)
                         Unbelievable. You people, you dump 
                         this on me, then next week you're 
                         screaming, "Where's our funding?" 
                         Shit. I'll tell you where it is, can 
                         you say health care?

               The head of the CIA pipes up:

                                     CIA DIRECTOR
                         Mr. President, please calm down. The 
                         CIA bears no responsibility for this 
                         problem.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Thanks for sharing, Kent. How many 
                         double agents you got on the payroll, 
                         last count...?

                                     CIA DIRECTOR
                         Sir! That controversy has been 
                         thoroughly dealt with, and if there 
                         still exists a leak, perhaps this... 
                         woman agent of his --

                                     SILVER-HAIRED MAN
                         If I may, sir, Colonel Baltimore 
                         hasn't had classified access since 
                         1987.
                              (beat)
                         But thank you, Kent, for trying to 
                         fuck me in the ass.

               He directs his baleful gaze at the President. Lights a pipe.

                                     SILVER-HAIRED MAN
                         I'm afraid rooting out double agents 
                         may have to wait. The primary threat 
                         is the woman. Her specialty is 
                         counterassassination, a horseshit 
                         turn of phrase which implies the 
                         other fellow shot first, but in point 
                         of fact she's a takeout artist of 
                         the first order. Nearly disposed of 
                         our friend the Beard down in Cuba a 
                         few years back. Specializes in long 
                         rifles, accurate to a mile and a 
                         half. Presumed dead; now, after eight 
                         years, back in the field, agenda 
                         unknown. She knows enough to hurt 
                         us. I'm frightened. Understand?

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Yes, yes. I believe you. Just one 
                         question:
                              (beat)
                         *What in pluperfect hell is she doing 
                         in a Christmas parade*???

               INT. ROADSIDE GAS STATION - NIGHTTIME

               Henessey is on the phone to his ex-wife. Glowering.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Aw, cut me a break, Fran. I been out 
                         eight months, I'm back doing skip 
                         traces, now you got me stealing 
                         fuckin' bicycles?

                                     EX-WIFE (O.S.)
                         I don't want you around Todd, hear 
                         me? Shrink told me what those men 
                         did to you in prison. This is a 
                         Christian household, my son's not 
                         gonna develop any... tendencies. 
                         Understand?

               For a moment her ignorance is so stunning he's speechless. 
               Then he slams down the phone. Cracks it. Returns to the pumps, 
               where SAMANTHA leans against his car, still dazed. Looks up 
               at him, says:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         I still can't believe it. You're 
                         saying my hands didn't even shake...?

               Henessey doesn't look at her. Puts the nozzle back in the 
               pump. Crosses to the driver side without a word.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         What's the matter with you?

                                     HENESSEY
                         You. You're the matter. Look, you 
                         wanna keep going, good luck. I'm 
                         driving back to Ohio. You're free to 
                         come with me.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         What... what are you telling me?

               He gets into the car. Starts the engine. Samantha reacts, 
               distraught. Leans in, kills the ignition. Pulls him out of 
               the car.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Goddammit, lady, I'm taking you 
                         *home*.

               She slaps him. HARD. He falls back, stunned.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         I'll spell it out for you, ready? I 
                         have no future, *I can't go home*. 
                         Until I know what's happening, I'm 
                         in *prison*, you know how that 
                         feels...?

                                     HENESSEY
                         Yeah, matter of fact. Four years 
                         inside. Marion, Illinois, real 
                         shithole. Get in the car.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         I'm sorry.
                              (clears her throat)
                         Um... what did you...?

                                     HENESSEY
                         Seven years ago, Atlanta PD. Me and 
                         my partner, we handled a lot of 
                         impounded shit. Fucker hated me, 
                         boy. One weekend, when he was 
                         conveniently gone...? Some bearer 
                         bonds disappeared from his office. 
                         And lo and behold, when the police 
                         responded to an anonymous tip, you'll 
                         never guess what just happened to be 
                         sitting in my closet.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         The bonds. Your partner put them 
                         there?

                                     HENESSEY
                              (laughs)
                         Hell no, I did, I stole the fucking 
                         things.

               He serious. Samantha frowns, a little thrown -- Then she 
               snorts, loses it. They both lean against his Chrysler.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Now every dollar I hand my kid, he 
                         asks his mother did I steal it.

               He smiles ruefully. Spits. A pause, then:

                                     HENESSEY
                         No more killing.

               Samantha's voice is cool and level:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         No more killing.

               She blows her nose.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         It was a helluva shot, wasn't it..."

                                                              DISSOLVES TO:

               ESTABLISHING - SALT & PEPPER LOUNGE - MORNING

               A gunmetal grey sky looms overhead. The aforementioned LOUNGE 
               is a faded old roadhouse, gravel parking lot strewn with mud-
               covered trucks. The kind that get a man laid in these parts. 
               HENESSEY'S PLYMOUTH pulls into the lot, rolls to a halt. 
               He'll never get any.

               INT. SALT & PEPPER LOUNGE - DAY

               Honky-tonk. SAMANTHA and HENESSEY enter, blinking in the 
               dimness. Around them, drunk mid-day cowboys. Stringy-haired 
               girls in their ample laps. SAMANTHA consults her watch:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Quarter til. Any time now.

               They sit at the counter. Henessey flags the bartender. Signals 
               for a beer. Lights a cigarette, blows smoke:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Nice crowd.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         You're just jealous of their 
                         girlfriends.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Who wouldn't be? Corner booth, there's 
                         a beaut. While you're doing her doggie-
                         style you can pop the zits on her 
                         back.

               Samantha shoots him a look. ON A TV above the bar, a British-
               sounding CNN announcer is saying:

                                     CNN COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
                         Violence in Northern Ireland continues 
                         today, despite a plea by British 
                         prime minister John Major --

               Samantha sits up straight. Draws a sharp breath. He shoots 
               her a questioning look --

                                     SAMANTHA
                         I just... got a flash of something, 
                         I...
                              (blinks)
                         I hurt my father.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Whoa. You remember your father?

                                     SAMANTHA
                         No... that's what's strange.
                              (shakes her head)
                         If I saw him on the street, I... I 
                         wouldn't... oh.

               She rubs her eyes. Her voice breaks. She's utterly miserable. 
               Henessey leans in, says softly:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Ms. Caine, last week at a party I 
                         ran into a girl I knew from college 
                         and we chatted for a few minutes. 
                         And it wasn't til I was driving home 
                         on the freeway that I remembered 
                         that I'd screwed her in the back of 
                         a car once.
                              (beat)
                         Everyone forgets.

               He pats her arm. Smiles reassuringly. A pause. She stares.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         That's it? That's your helpful story? 
                         Jesus Christ!

                                     HENESSEY
                         No, see, all's I'm saying is you're 
                         not alone.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Oh, shut up.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Fine. I gotta use the head.

               He stands, heads off. Samantha nervously lights a cigarette. 
               The bartender suddenly puts a BEER in front of her. She 
               reaches for her purse. He waves it away, points beside her. 
               She turns...

               The assassin called TIMOTHY sits down two stools away.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         For you. Another in a long line of 
                         bad investments.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Excuse me?

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Just saw the ring on your finger.

               He reveals a surprisingly WINNING smile, says:

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Do I know you from somewhere...?

               Grimaces:

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Whoa. Back up. Total pickup line, 
                         let's forget I said that.

               Still staring in her eyes. Noting absolutely NO RECOGNITION 
               on her features. She gives him a cursory smile.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Thanks for the drink. But no. I don't 
                         know you.

               Timothy nods slowly.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         No, you don't, do you...? I'd know 
                         if you did. I can tell if someone's 
                         lying.
                              (smiles)
                         Sorry to bother you.

               He takes his own drink and crosses to a back booth. Sits, a 
               very puzzled look on his face. Adjusts his coat collar, 
               whispers into a concealed transmitter:

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Okay, people, I got what I needed. 
                         Wait until she comes out. Then do 
                         them both.
                              (beat)
                         Walk soft, we got local law.

               He sits back as TWO SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES suddenly enter, doffing 
               their stetsons. Cross to the bar. HENESSEY, coming out of 
               the bathroom. Sees the deputies. Grabs SAMANTHA by the elbow. 
               Tosses down a fin, steers her toward the door.

                                     SAMANTHA
                              (sotto)
                         What are you doing?

                                     HENESSEY
                         Pork. On your nine.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         So?

                                     HENESSEY
                         So you shot a guy in the head 
                         yesterday. We wait outside.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         It's freezing.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Too bad. People shouldn't shoot other 
                         people in the head. Just themselves. 
                         During that show with the little 
                         girl who's a robot.

               EXT. SALT & PEPPER LOUNGE - SAME TIME

               They emerge into the chill air. Breath pluming from their 
               mouths. Samantha surveys the parking lot. Grabs Henessey, 
               points --

               A LATE-MODEL CAR pulls into the gravel lot. Stops.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Bingo. That's an old guy's car.

                                     HENESSEY
                         How do you know?

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Because there's an old guy in it. 
                         Come on.

               They cross toward the car. She frowns, points to his coat.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Gun bulge.

                                     HENESSEY
                         You think I'm gonna shove it down my 
                         pants? Shoot my damn dick off.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         So now you're a sharpshooter?

                                     HENESSEY
                         Ho, ho.

               As they approach the other car, the engine stops. The door 
               opens and a middle aged man emerges -- IT AIN'T NATHAN. He 
               pauses, lighting a cigarette.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Mr. Windeman...?

               She strides right up, Henessey in tow. Flashes a dazzling 
               smile -- *Slow motion*. The guy DROPS HIS LIGHTER, darts a 
               hand inside his coat with practiced ease... Pulls out a 
               SILENCED PISTOL.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Oh, SHIT!

               *Slow motion*. Samantha tackles Henessey. Hurls them both to 
               the ground... During their fall, STUFF HAPPENS:

               She clutches his sportcoat -- Grips his .38 special THROUGH 
               THE FABRIC and squeezes... A sharp report, BAM-! Another, 
               BAM-! The jacket, shredded. HITMAN just caught two in the 
               chest. He goes over backwards, gun spitting --

               Sam and Henessey hit the ground. *Back to regular speed*. 
               Henessey rolls over, stunned. Samantha's staring at her hand, 
               wondering how in the hell it just did that.

                                     HENESSEY
                         *Jesus wept*...!

               They scamper to their feet. Running hellbent for leather 
               toward the Plymouth... They never make it.

               ANOTHER HITMAN steps calmly from the trees. Stands at the 
               shoulder of the highway, full view of the parking lot... 
               Adopts a two-fisted stance. Draws a bead, locks on target --

               Leaves his feet.

               Takes to the air as a BLACK LE SABRE swerves off the highway 
               with no advance warning and DEMOLISHES the bastard, wham--!

               The car roars across the lot, NATHAN WINDEMAN at the wheel.

               INT. BARROOM - SAME TIME

               The snapped-in-two hitman announces Nathan's arrival by FLYING 
               THROUGH THE WINDOW in an explosion of glass. Caroms off a 
               table and bounces head over heels. Hits, dead.

               TIMOTHY swears. Leaps up and bolts for the door, right behind 
               the SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES, as

               EXT. BUILDING - SAME TIME

               The black Le Sabre SLEWS to a stop, showering gravel -- NATHAN 
               shouts at Sam and Henessey:

                                     NATHAN
                         Get in! Both of you, NOW!

               They pile into the backseat. Nathan floors it. PEELS OUT, 
               bouncing  onto the highway -- and meanwhile here comes 
               TIMOTHY. On the run. Barks into his transmitter:

                                     TIMOTHY
                         East, they're going east. *Head them 
                         off*.

               He begins to run: we have never seen anyone run this fast.

               INT. NATHAN'S CAR - DRIVING

               NATHAN kicks in the afterburners. Squinting, can't see... 
               WIPERS, squeaking to and fro. Erasing the hitman's blood.

               Henessey is trembling; Samantha comatose. Nathan steals a 
               look in the rear view mirror. Gets his first good view of 
               Samantha. Reacts, stunned:

                                     NATHAN
                         Charly. Jesus Christ, I don't believe 
                         what I'm seeing, you're so *fat*.

               This is not what she expected to hear.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         I'm... um, I mean... what?

                                     NATHAN
                         What in God's hell have you been 
                         *eating*, you look positively bovine! 
                         Hang on.

               50 yards down the highway. Beside a parked car, a guy with 
               an ELEPHANT GUN.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Oh, God, no more--!

               The big rifle BUCKS concussively. The car window SPLINTERS...! 
               Does not break.

                                     NATHAN
                         Bulletproof. Put it in myself.

               Almost as an afterthought, he swerves slightly. CRUNCHES the 
               gunman against the parked car. Shatters him. His SCREAMING 
               VISAGE goes by an inch from Samantha, he coughs blood onto 
               her window...

               EXT. FROZEN WOODSCAPE - SAME TIME

               Timothy, on the move. RUNS, breakneck through the woods. 
               Jumps fallen logs. Ducking, swerving. In and out through the 
               trees, as

               INT. NATHAN'S CAR - DRIVING

               Scenery whips past. In the backseat, Henessey is trembling; 
               Samantha comatose. Nathan snaps his fingers sharply:

                                     NATHAN
                         Charlene, darling --

                                     SAMANTHA
                         My name is Caine. Samantha Caine.

                                     NATHAN
                              (exasperated)
                         Yes, yes, you said that on the phone. 
                         *Must* I point out to you that the 
                         letters in the name SAM CAINE, when 
                         rearranged, spell out AMNESIAC? Your 
                         mind was missing a name, so it simple 
                         invented one that was an anagram of 
                         your current condition.

               Samantha reacts, floored.

                                     NATHAN
                         Dammit, Charly. The schoolteacher, 
                         that was your cover! Your memory was 
                         gone, you got confused and you BOUGHT 
                         YOUR OWN COVER. This ridiculous Ohio 
                         housewife business, it's a fantasy, 
                         you *wrote* the bloody thing!

                                     SAMANTHA
                         It's not a fantasy, *I'm in the 
                         fucking PTA*.

                                     NATHAN
                         Then quit. You're an assassin for 
                         the United States government.
                              (beat)
                         I ought to know, I trained you.

               Henessey is so shocked he's LAUGHING:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Beautiful. Fuckin' beautiful.

               EXT. SHEER EMBANKMENT - OVERLOOKING HIGHWAY - SAME TIME

               A forty foot embankment, damn near vertical. Plunging to the 
               road below. Topped by a chain-link FENCE.

               Timothy hits the fence at a dead run. Up and over. Pitches 
               head over heels down the embankment, BOUNCING. Hits bottom 
               in a shower of dirt, rolls, comes up... .357 AMP in a two-
               fisted grip, and *there's Nathan's car*. Blows by, doing 90.

               Timothy swivels calmly, BLASTS AN ENTIRE CLIP at the 
               retreating car. Shot after shot, like a machine --

               INT. NATHAN'S CAR - SAME TIME

               Sam SCREAMS as the side windows COLLAPSE INWARD. Nathan rides 
               the wheel, swerving.

                                     HENESSEY
                         *What happened to bulletproof*?

                                     NATHAN
                         *The side windows were next, I swear*.

               BACK WITH TIMOTHY

               Watching them go. Oh, well. He tried, right...? Did his best, 
               tomorrow's another day --

               Without missing a beat, Timothy walks out in the middle of 
               the road. ANOTHER CAR, coming. Sports car. He snaps in a 
               fresh clip. Raises his fist and PUMPS ONE through the fast-
               approaching windshield. Kills the driver.

               The car throws a skid. Slewing SIDEWAYS at him. Onrushing 
               juggernaut, immense...!

               He vaults the hood without breaking stride. Catches the drive-
               side doorhandle, jerks -- then he's in, and out comes the 
               corpse and the car *never stops moving*.

               Completes an out-of-control 360, showering muddy water... 
               and then he's stomping the gas. Utterly relentless. Leaving 
               behind a wet and very surprised-looking corpse.

               INT. STOLEN CAR

               Timothy GUNS IT, eyes locked dead ahead on the Le Sabre -- 
               Hears a SCREECH. Whips his eyes to the rearview mirror: POLICE 
               CRUISER. Fishtailing onto the road behind him. Falls in 
               behind, SIREN wailing. One of the deputies from the bar.

               INT. NATHAN'S CAR - DRIVING - SAME TIME

               Nathan fishes a gun from his coat. Hands it to Samantha.

                                     NATHAN
                         Here, you might as well have one 
                         too.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         My God. How many do you carry?

                                     NATHAN
                         Three. One shoulder, one hip, and 
                         one right next to Mr. Wally --
                              (pats his groin)
                         Where most patdowns never reveal it, 
                         as an agent is often reluctant to 
                         feel up another man's groin.

               Henessey looks out the back windshield, says:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Got a tail.

               Nathan looks, SWEARS. The chase car's gaining on them.

                                     NATHAN
                         Lucky bastard found the only cool 
                         car in the fucking midwest.

               He accelerates into a curve. Rockets past a connecting road, 
               as, without warning -- ANOTHER COP CAR skids out of the side 
               road, after him. The other deputy...

               TIMOTHY, boxed. Going too fast, swerves...! PLOWS into the 
               deputy headlong. BROADSIDES him. Glass flies. The cop car's 
               TIRES blow out as it's SPUN 180 degrees... Timothy's car 
               careens into a GULLEY --

               BAM-! Hits a dead stop. Hood shears off, goes flying. Back 
               end sticking up, tires spinning... The horn blares 
               continuously.

               UP ABOVE: The other cop arrives, brakes to a halt -- Door 
               opens and out he comes. Helps Deputy #2 clamber from his 
               crippled black-and-white.

               Together they leap down into the gulley, guns drawn. Cringing 
               as the long HOOOOOOOONNNNNK continues unabated. Approaching 
               the crashed car. Walking up, guns at their sides... TWO SHOTS. 
               They jitter and twitch. Topple over dead, slide to the bottom 
               of the gulley.

               INSIDE THE CAR, we see that a very annoyed Timothy is also 
               very conscious. Splayed against the driver's side door. 
               Holding one hand down on the horn, HOOOOOOOONNK... He releases 
               it. Horn stops. On the radio Conway Twitty is singing. He 
               puts a shot through the radio. Silences it.

               Climbs from the car and stares off down the road. Of Nathan 
               and his companions, there is neither whisper nor breath...

               EXT. ROADSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON

               Nathan has pulled over in a grove of pine trees. The car is 
               covered with branches. He watches through a gap as two police 
               cars go by on the distant highway.

                                     NATHAN
                         Your father was in the British SIS, 
                         assigned to the Irish situation. 
                         After he was murdered in 1971, his 
                         friend Perkins recruited you for 
                         Chapter, a black bag operation working 
                         out of the U.S. State Department.

               Charly is overloaded. Trying to keep up, not wanting to:

                                     NATHAN
                         Fall, 1987: Presidential orders come 
                         down. You're to flush out a terrorist 
                         by the name of Daedalus. You never 
                         complete the mission, electing instead 
                         to die, of all things, despite clear 
                         orders to the contrary. And dead you 
                         remain until, without preamble, you 
                         re-emerge, eight years later and 
                         fifteen pounds heavier.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Would you lay off the weight?

                                     NATHAN
                         I think we can safely assume Daedalus 
                         is aware of your resurrection and is 
                         attempting to reverse it. *Damn*, I 
                         can't drive around in this thing.
                              (beat)
                         Any idea where we can go to stash 
                         this car?

               IN SAMANTHA'S LAP

               Her fingers unconsciously fiddle with something. Damp, 
               crumpled. The ENVELOPE. One address left.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         This address...? I... I recognize it 
                         now. I think it belongs to a friend.

               Henessey stares at her. As Nathan reaches for the envelope, 
               his coat falls open and Samantha GASPS; his left side is 
               soaked with blood.

                                     NATHAN
                         Perhaps you'd best drive.

               EXT. HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY - DAY

               The house is actually an old converted MILL. Beyond it, frozen 
               landscape stretches to the lakeshore. In the BARNYARD, a 
               scruffy looking COWBOY TYPE is splitting logs on a tree stump. 
               Drops the axe. Scoops up an armload of firewood. Comes around 
               the corner --

               Drops the logs, startled. AN UNLIKELY TRIO approaches. NATHAN, 
               sweating. Pasty. Levels a revolver. Samantha says:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Don't be afraid, we don't want to 
                         hurt you.
                              (beat)
                         I just want to know who you are.

               Seeing her, his eyes go wide -- He locks her in a whooping 
               BEAR HUG, shouts:

                                     MAN
                         CHARLY, BABY!!

               Picks her up, SPINS HER around, laughing... Henessey and 
               Nathan stare. Befuddled.

               TIME CUT - MINUTES LATER

               The strange man (let's call him LUKE) stands awkwardly in 
               the dooryard. Shifting from foot to foot. NATHAN watches him 
               dispassionately from the tree stump. Gun on his knee.

                                     LUKE
                              (sighs)
                         Look, is this America's Funniest 
                         Practical Videos or something?

               The DOOR bangs open and Samantha comes out of the house. 
               Carrying bandages. Alcohol. Crosses to the tree stump, kneels 
               before Nathan. His voice is a harsh rasp:

                                     NATHAN
                         Let me do it.

               He bats her away, administers his own first aid. LUKE pipes 
               up, exasperated:

                                     LUKE
                         I can't believe you don't remember 
                         dating me. Charly, please, you pursued 
                         me for months.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Yeah, well. I caught you and forgot 
                         you. Sorry.

                                     LUKE
                         It's December, you'll remember. 
                         Right...?

               He chuckles. Looks at her face. Stops chuckling, takes a 
               sudden interest in the ground. Sam crosses to HENESSEY, 
               standing nearby. Takes him aside, whispers:

                                     SAMANTHA
                              (sotto)
                         This is ridiculous. What do we do 
                         with this guy?

                                     HENESSEY
                         Don't ask me, I just work here. Did 
                         you bump pelvises with him or not?

                                     SAMANTHA
                         It's possible.

                                     HENESSEY
                         And you kid, Cathead --

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Caitlin.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Yeah, whatever. Um, could he be 
                         the...?

                                     SAMANTHA
                         I don't know.
                              (beat)
                         It's coming back, though. All these... 
                         little details about him.

               She studies Luke. Frowning. Concentrating.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         I know he's got a pin in his leg, 
                         car accident. I know he cuts his own 
                         hair... thinks Rush Limbaugh's an 
                         ass. I know he sits down when he 
                         pees. I know --

                                     HENESSEY
                         Enough. You're giving me a stiffy.

               Just then NATHAN is hit with a dreadful-sounding cough. It 
               wracks him. Doubles him up. LUKE blurts out:

                                     LUKE
                         Goddammit, he's *dying*. Let me call 
                         the poor bastard an ambulance!

               Nathan grits his teeth:

                                     NATHAN
                         *No ambulance*. The car I ordered 
                         will be here soon.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Mr. Windeman, please let him help 
                         you. I know this man, I... I'm pretty 
                         sure I slept with him.

               Nathan presses a bandage to his side.

                                     NATHAN
                         I'm about to faint... And if you 
                         call an ambulance, I will fucking 
                         kill you.

               He pitches forward into Henessey's arms.

               EXT. SHADED PORCH - MID-AFTERNOON

               Beside the lakeshore LUKE AND SAMANTHA walk side by side. 
               RACK FOCUS to the porch: NATHAN is laid out on a chaise 
               lounge. Henessey beside him, applying cold compresses. The 
               older man stirs, coming awake... Tries to sit up, Henessey 
               nudges him flat again.

                                     NATHAN
                         Where's Charly...?

                                     HENESSEY
                         Relax. She's with Luke. That's his 
                         name, Luke.

                                     NATHAN
                         Goddammit, I told you --

                                     HENESSEY
                         Yeah, yeah, we weren't real big on 
                         what you told us. I had him call you 
                         an ambulance, so shoot me. Should be 
                         here within fifteen minutes.

               Nathan groans. Henessey presses a cloth to the man's head.

                                     HENESSEY
                         The guy's story checks out. Sam knows 
                         things about him. Stuff only a lover 
                         would know.

                                     NATHAN
                         Sod that... just watch them.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Don't worry about it. Chick signs my 
                         checks, I'm gonna watch her get aced? 
                         Lie back down.

               Nathan swallows. Grimaces. Lies back down.

                                     NATHAN
                         Checks. You're not fooling anyone, 
                         dear boy.
                              (bemused)
                         You'd wash her feet and drink the 
                         water... wouldn't you?

                                     HENESSEY
                         Cut me a break, nimrod. She's married 
                         with a kid.

               Busted. Nathan coughs. Speaks, eyes faraway:

                                     NATHAN
                         My star pupil...
                              (smiles thinly)
                         That man in Pennsylvania yesterday... 
                         The one at the diner, that was hers, 
                         wasn't it...?

                                     HENESSEY
                         How'd you know?

                                     NATHAN
                              (nods)
                         I saw the news report, they found a 
                         shell casing a thousand yards away, 
                         helluva shot.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Tell me about Daedalus, what's his 
                         story?

                                     NATHAN
                         Arms broker, man without a face. 
                         Veteran of Baader-Meinhoff and the 
                         Red Brigades. He's rumored to be 
                         based in the U.S. Doesn't travel 
                         much, they say. Too afraid of metal 
                         detectors, the poor sod's got a foot-
                         long piece of steel in his leg.

               At which point, Henessey stops. Frowns.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Come again?

                                     NATHAN
                         A pin, Mr. Henessey. A surgical pin.

               He scuffs his shoe in the porch dust. Eyes narrowed:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Where the hell...? I know I just 
                         heard that somewhere, something about 
                         a...

               His eyes widen:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Oh, fuck.

               Points to the lake:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Nathan, that son of a bitch has one 
                         in *his* leg.

               Nathan freezes, thoughts racing... swears violently:

                                     NATHAN
                         You blithering idiot, the son of a 
                         bitch wasn't her lover, he was her 
                         target, he's Daedalus!

                                     HENESSEY
                         Oh, Jesus...! That's how she knew 
                         all that shit, not from *dating* him -- 
                         she *studied* the fucker to take him 
                         out!

               He takes off for the lake at a dead run. Behind him, the 
               bloodied Nathan DRAGS himself to his feet and lurches off 
               the porch, stumbling. Weaving. Refusing to go down.

               AT THE LAKESIDE -- Luke walks behind Samantha. Talking softly 
               in her ear, smiling... She hears something. A RATCHETING 
               noise, drawing closer, hmmm...? Looks up. Wishes she hadn't -- 
               A BELL RANGER HELICOPTER is descending over the lake. Inside, 
               TIMOTHY shoulders a bolt action rifle, coolly professional.

               FIRES, kicks up dirt at Henessey's feet. Stops the fucker 
               cold. On the shore, LUKE smiles at Samantha, says:

                                     LUKE
                         Sure don't look like an ambulance, 
                         does it?

               SLUGS HER IN THE FACE. Drops her to the ice like a broken 
               doll.

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

               Black indeed. Deep. Empty. Out of the darkness, we hear a 
               NEWS COMMENTATOR. Voice scratchy. Indistinct. Far away or 
               long ago...

               A TELEVISION IMAGE fills the screen. Black and white. Grainy. 
               The legend: BELFAST, NORTHERN IRELAND, over footage of a 
               sidewalk bombing. We're back in time, the year 1971. A crisp-
               looking BRIGADIER is speaking to the off-camera reporter:

                                     BRIGADIER
                         ...the bombing has been linked to 
                         the Ulster Volunteer Force, which, 
                         as you know, is the counterpart of 
                         the provisional IRA and the most 
                         violent of the Protestant Paramilitary 
                         groups.

               An ANNOUNCER's face replaces him:

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         Despite threats of reprisals, 
                         Brigadier Baltimore repeats that he 
                         will seek to cut UVF supply lines, 
                         especially from Tripoli, Lybia. U.S. 
                         President Nixon concurs that...

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               A battered TV, volume turned low. Snoozing in a chair, a 
               rumpled older man -- It's the BRIGADIER, the one we just saw 
               speaking on TV. A CALENDAR on the table identifies the date 
               as June 23, 1971.

               IN THE NEXT ROOM

               Girlish decor. Pinups of rock stars. A YOUNG GIRL is awake, 
               dressed and currently stuffing two pillows under a blanket. 
               She inspects her handiwork. Human-looking lump. Turns, 
               satisfied.

               One last look at the WOODEN JESUS on the wall -- Creeps from 
               the room. Past the sleeping Brigadier. To the front door. 
               She checks over her shoulder, nervous. Taps out five digits. 
               Shuts off the alarm. Unlocks the door and slips out.

               EXT. STREET - BELFAST - NIGHT

               The boy's name is GREGORY. Sixteen, with a quick, easy grin. 
               Huddled beneath a tree with him, the girl is gelatin.

                                     GREGORY
                         You've never made it with a boy, 
                         then?

                                     GIRL
                         There's nothing odd about it. I'm 
                         only sixteen.

                                     GREGORY
                         Rubbish.

                                     GIRL
                         What?

                                     GREGORY
                         You're fourteen and not a day more. 
                         Here now, I'm right, you're blushing.

                                     GIRL
                         Look, what if I'm ignorant? It's my 
                         father, we never stay in one place, 
                         I never meet bloody anyone.

                                     GREGORY
                         Saw him on the telly. Think he'd 
                         kill me? I'm a nasty one, I am.

               He slides a hand under her sweater. She stiffens, terrified 
               and exhilarated, as he gently strokes her nipple with a thumb.

                                     GREGORY
                         You know what, I'll bet you've never 
                         even kissed a boy... now, have you?
                              (beat)
                         Aye, but you want to...

               He leans in. She leans forward. A jerky, tentative duckling 
               on the road to swan-dom. Their lips touch.

               Across the road, THE WINDOWS BLOW OUT in her father's flat. 
               She spins, scream caught in her throat -- as ARMED MEN rush 
               from the house. Through the door, the one she left unlocked. 
               Stutter of SMALL ARMS FIRE. She whirls on Gregory, realizes 
               only then that the guy is LAUGHING.

                                     GREGORY
                         Thanks for shutting off the alarm, 
                         you bloody Papist bitch.

               He slaps her full across the face.

                                     GREGORY
                         Tell the press the Ulster Force claims 
                         full credit.

               He spins and flees.

               INT. BRIGADIER'S FLAT - MOMENTS LATER

               Girl, moving. Walls racing past, shot to PIECES, run run run 
               into her bedroom and LURCHES to a stop, screaming:

                                     GIRL
                         *DA*!

               Propped against the wall. By the bed. He's still alive. 
               Incredibly. The man has DRAGGED himself in here. He refused 
               to die, simply couldn't, you see... Not until he reached his 
               daughter.

               ANGLE ON BED

               Two pillows, jammed beneath a blanket. The Brigadier just 
               stares at them. His face slack. White and gastly. Shifts his 
               gaze to his daughter. Tears running from his dulled eyes.

                                     BRIGADIER
                         How much...

               He raises the pistol to his head.

                                     BRIGADIER
                         ...did they pay you...?

               He fires. On a young girl's dissolve into insanity we FADE 
               OUT... Sound, echoing away. Blackness, total.

               FADE IN:

               INT. BASEMENT OF OLD MILL - NIGHT

               Waking is slow.

               Samantha opens her eyes. Blinks. Hazy, out of focus. Tries 
               to rub her eyes, can't. Hands. Something's wrong, what the 
               hell'd she do with her hands...? Ah. They're stretched over 
               her head. BOUND WITH CORD. Suddenly she's very awake.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               The basement of the old converted mill. A drafty, windswept 
               place full of old, broken timbers. A river runs through it. 
               A stream, at any rate. The waters are still and frozen now. 
               Above the stream -- A GREAT WOODEN WHEEL. Smaller corollary 
               of the wheel outside. Mounted on the same axis.

               SAMANTHA is tied to that wheel. Lashed to its SIDE, affixed 
               to it like a goddess to a Greek sailing ship. Now the bad 
               news, the ice has been chopped away so the wheel can TURN... 
               And it will plunge Samantha UNDER THE FREEZING WATER. Beneath 
               the ice. Bound hand and foot. Strapped to the wheel, wearing 
               only a nightgown, she is utterly helpless.

               THE MAN KNOWN AS DAEDALUS (AKA Luke) stands before her, giving 
               instructions to the ubiquitous TIMOTHY. He looks up at 
               Samantha. Seeing her eyelids flutter, he tosses her a cherry 
               wave. Gone is the gee-whiz country boy schtick; in its place, 
               a frightening arrogance. He tosses her his cheeriest wave:

                                     DAEDALUS
                         Well, good afternoon. If it isn't 
                         the forgetful spy. How you feeling?

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Not-so fresh.

               Samantha struggles against her bonds. No dice. Subsides. 
               Takes a look around at her predicament. TIMOTHY stands at 
               the edge of the ice. Watching her intently. Smiles thinly:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         You... you're... the man from the 
                         bar...?

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Look at her. She's not faking it, 
                         she doesn't know me from Adam.

               Daedalus shakes his head, frowning:

                                     DAEDALUS
                         It's not that I don't trust my 
                         compatriot, Colonel Baltimore. In 
                         fact, I had every confidence that 
                         your amnesia was genuine -- until 
                         you showed up *here*. You follow?
                              (beat)
                         Meanwhile, I just got around to 
                         reading the papers, there's the small 
                         matter of an incident upstate. Long 
                         range rifle shot, blew a man out of 
                         his socks.
                              (coldly)
                         You can see where I'm coming from. 
                         I'm trying to pull of the biggest 
                         job of my career. I have to know. 
                         How much you really remember... and 
                         who you've told.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         I didn't tell a soul, I swear.

                                     DAEDALUS
                         We'll soon know.

               He crosses toward a large RED BUTTON. Set into a wooden beam. 
               Samantha thrashes at the bindings. Looks down at the water 
               where it intercepts the mammoth wheel. Fighting panic:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Is... is this a torture thing...?

                                     DAEDALUS
                         Torture, yes. The torturing of 
                         beautiful women, albeit politically 
                         incorrect, is an addiction with me.
                              (beat)
                         A woman never looks quite so beautiful 
                         as when her face is distended in 
                         pain. Witness the beauty of 
                         childbirth.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Please, I'm getting all misty. Look, 
                         untie me, I'll make any face you 
                         want.

                                     DAEDALUS
                         Let's not, and say we did. Do you 
                         smoke?

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Smoke...? Um, no. Not... not really.

                                     DAEDALUS
                         Good. You'll last longer. Now hush 
                         yourself, and take a deep breath. 
                         We're gonna do the torture thing.

               He hits the button. An electric WHINE -- THE BIG WHEEL TURNS. 
               Feet first into the water. Struggling. Arms stretched above 
               her head. She plunges below the surface. A new dimension in 
               PAIN. Frozen, mind-numbing.

               She WRITHES against the wheel. It's like a crushing VICE is 
               ripping her limb from limb. She opens her eyes, briefly. 
               Discovers she's not alone -- A mere foot from her face, THE 
               BLOATED CORPSE of the drowned NATHAN. Staring away and away. 
               Blue with cyanosis.

               Meanwhile, back ON THE SURFACE: Daedalus turns to his right-
               hand man, who says:

                                     TIMOTHY
                         We're running on schedule, I just 
                         secured the tanker. We're borrowing 
                         it from Carbide in South Carolina. 
                         Cargo listed as fire retardant.

                                     DAEDALUS
                              (nods)
                         Juice up the bird, we head out soon 
                         as I'm done here.

               He turns. Hits the red button again. THE WHEEL reverses 
               itself. Creaks and moans, turning --

               SAMANTHA BREAKS THE SURFACE. Gasping for air. Wheezing. 
               Choking. The FREEZING WIND plasters the nightgown to her.

                                     DAEDALUS
                         Take all the air you can, that's 
                         right. If you need to vomit, do it 
                         now.

               Samantha, face twisted. Coughs. Wheezes. TIMOTHY looks her 
               in the eye... shakes his head:

                                     TIMOTHY
                         You don't remember *at all*...? The 
                         greatest night of your life, shit, 
                         drown this ungrateful wench.

               He exits. Daedalus, alone with his captive. On her features, 
               unbridled HATRED. He chuckles:

                                     DAEDALUS
                         Talk to me Colonel. Is my identity 
                         safe...? The truth, and I'll shoot 
                         you in the head. Nice and quick. 
                         Otherwise, you're in for a long night. 
                         *Who did you talk to*?

                                     SAMANTHA
                         ...Nobody... fuck you...

               He shakes his head, makes a "tsk tsk" gesture. Smiles grimly 
               as he turns his attention to the red switch.

                                     DAEDALUS
                         Hate to see you like this, Charly. I 
                         heard you were a helluva spy once.

               Without warning, her head snaps upward -- Eyes cold. Voice, 
               not her own:

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Watch your back. I'm not done yet.

                                     DAEDALUS
                         That's a very funny joke. You're an 
                         entertaining woman. Good night.

               He hits the button. She plunges beneath the surface. Daedalus 
               walks over to one corner. Sits down. Takes out a pipe. Lights 
               it. Picks up a book. Reads. And reads.

               UNDERWATER -- Sam THRASHES and jerks, to and fro. Dead Nathan, 
               mocking her. There, under the water, the memories come... In 
               a flood. Stark and vivid.

               MEMORY FLASH - THE YEAR

               THE TRUNK OF A CAR opens, revealing a patch of night sky. 
               Mostly obscured by two familiar individuals --

               There's ONE-EYED JACK, remember him? Few years younger. One 
               eyeball heavier. The other man is TIMOTHY. He looks in the 
               trunk. Nods.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Okay, I'll signal Daedalus. Your 
                         money will be waiting, and Jack...? 
                         Do yourself a favor, do her and dump 
                         her, I'm serious. Don't get cute, 
                         try to play doctor first. I made 
                         that mistake.

               The lid SLAMS SHUT.

               BACK UNDER THE WATER

               The world of rushing MADNESS, memories unspooling now, faster 
               and faster --

               MEMORY FLASH: A CLIFF overlooking the ocean. Darkness. 
               Sheeting rain. Our heroine (for it is unquestionably SAMANTHA) 
               is lying unconscious atop a rocky bluff. Drenched.

               ONE-EYED JACK produces a SYRINGE from a leather case. Rolls 
               up her sleeve. Starts to administer the injection. Stops. He 
               can't resist... Can't help LOOSENING the buttons on her shirt.

               Her eyes snap open. And before it even registers, she's 
               grabbed the hypodermic and plunged it deep INTO HIS EYE --

               Then she's up and running. Along the cliff, toward the car... 
               Jack, HOWLING in pain, stumbling... Draws his gun and shoots 
               her. In the head.

               She pitches backward. Tumbles from the cliff...! Rushes 
               headlong toward the waters below, getting smaller --

               INT. BASEMENT OF OLD MILL - THE PRESENT

               Here. Now. She breaks the surface. Gasping for breath. 
               SHRIEKS, a sound ripped from her by the PAIN, the COLD --

               By her ruptured sanity. She hangs there. Drenched. Half 
               frozen.

               DAEDALUS can't help it. A chill dances up his spine, 
               watching... She is not afraid. She is not whimpering. She is 
               looking directly AT HIM. With a sick smile.

                                     CHARLY
                         Daedalus... Make you a deal... Let 
                         me go now...? I'll leave you the use 
                         of your legs... Bargain, trust me...

               Daedalus struggles to recover his poise.

                                     DAEDALUS
                         How did you find me? Who knows about 
                         this place, WHO HAVE YOU TOLD?

               Charly's eyes bore into his:

                                     CHARLY
                         I let you touch me, cowboy... I think 
                         I need a bath.

               Daedalus stabs the red button. THE BIG WHEEL TURNS... Into 
               the water goes Charly. Going down for the third time.

               UNDER THE WATER - HELL - SAME

               Here we are again, in the world of silence and blinding PAIN. 
               Despair and madness but now there's something else -- Now 
               there's RAGE.

               It takes losing most of the FLESH from her right wrist... 
               But she frees the hand. WRENCHES it loose. The water turns 
               soupy red around it. GROPES, blindly. Fingers NUMB, so fucking 
               cold -- Breath, running out. No air. NO TIME.

               She darts her right hand forward. Toward the obscenely bobbing 
               CORPSE of Nathan. Does something grotesque, jams her hand 
               DOWN THE CORPSE'S PANTS --

               Hideaway gun, it's right where he said, right beside Mr. 
               Wally. PSP-25. Semi-auto, steel jackets. She waits. Rage 
               inside her. Death in her hands.

               MEANWHILE, BACK ON THE SURFACE

               The wheel CREAKS. Groans. The terrorist in the western boots 
               watches her emerge, face first -- She comes up firing.

               The first slug takes him in the knee. Blows it to scraps. He 
               collapses, howling. She shifts aim. THE RED BUTTON. No 
               hesitation. BLAM-! Hits it DEAD ON. Stops the wheel. 
               Incredible.

               Doesn't blink. Unties her captive hand. BLOWS TO SPLINTERS 
               the wood surrounding her feet. Leaps to solid ground, as

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Daedalus looks up from his prone position. In agony. A vision 
               from Hell approaches: A fiendish blue-skinned woman in a 
               sodden nightgown. Blood leaking from one wrist. She has risen, 
               REBORN, from the icy waters.

                                     DAEDALUS
                         Samantha... Please...!

                                     CHARLY
                         Who's Samantha?

               She shoots him in the other knee. He HOWLS. Gun, empty. She 
               tosses it aside. In a nearby crate: ASSAULT RIFLES. Snatches 
               up a Kalashnikov and clip. Kneels and says:

                                     CHARLY
                         You see in the movies, badguy says, 
                         "Talk to me and I'll let you live." 
                         We're gonna run a variation, it goes 
                         like this: Talk to me...? I'll let 
                         you die.

               She fires again.

                                     CHARLY
                         Where's Henessey...?

               INT. ROOT CELLAR - WITH HENESSEY

               The detective lies naked, bound hand and foot. Beaten. 
               FREEZING. A single ray of LIGHT through a tiny crack.

               He hears a SPLINTERING noise, as if a door's been ripped 
               from its hinges. Pause -- A FUSILLADE of gunfire. Shouts, 
               cries. A heavy weight SLAMS to the floorboards above him. 
               Through a crack comes a tiny stream of BLOOD, dribbling onto 
               him, as --

               EXT. OLD MILL - SAME TIME

               TIMOTHY bolts from the house, clutching a bleeding hand. 
               Running hellbent for leather. Reaches a parked car. Leaps in 
               and kicks over the engine as, behind him --

               MORE MEN come piling out of the house, shouting. Running for 
               their cars -- never make it. CUT DOWN IN THEIR TRACKS. Wracked 
               by gunfire, bodies twitching...

               And as Timothy PEELS OUT, spraying mud, we pull UP, UP, AND 
               AWAY... Into the sky, moving ever higher, gunfire fading... 
               Until now we're WAY UP, we can see Timothy's car... the OLD 
               MILL, ever so tiny below us...

               It blows to pieces. Sends flaming boards flying STRAIGHT UP 
               AT US.

               INT. VICTORIAN BUILDING - CHAPTER HQ - NIGHTTIME

               The door bursts open as PERKINS stalks in, shedding his coat. 
               His aide -- let's call him HARRY -- looks up nervously.

                                     PERKINS
                         This can't happen, Harry. The 
                         President's already up at night, 
                         prowling his sock drawer for double 
                         agents, and now we've got a fucking 
                         rogue on our hands.

                                     HARRY
                         Sir, there's someone in the conference 
                         room to see you.

                                     PERKINS
                         Oh, for the love of Christ, who can 
                         be so fucking important?

               He throws open a door off the passage: THERE'S TIMOTHY. 
               Perched on the edge of a conference table, tamping a pack of 
               smokes. Perkins reacts, stunned.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         It's me, your poor black cousin. The 
                         one you can't be seen with.

                                     PERKINS
                         *You*...! Are you crazy, coming here??

                                     TIMOTHY
                              (Lights a cigarette)
                         My boss is dead.

                                     PERKINS
                         What...?

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Your rogue bitch just took him out. 
                         Probably went shopping in his weapons 
                         storage too.

               He blows smoke. Trains his eyes on the older man. Piercing.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         We're still on, Perkins. I've got 
                         the tanker, the chemist, all ready 
                         to go... but you gotta contain her, 
                         man. We gotta step on her hard and 
                         fast.

               An agent on the SWITCHBOARD calls out:

                                     SWITCHBOARD
                         You have a call on line three, sir.

                                     PERKINS
                         Who is it?

                                     SWITCHBOARD
                         Charly Baltimore, sir.

               Perkins stops dead. Lunges for the phone, nearly drops it:

                                     PERKINS
                         Perkins.

               INTERCUT - OUR HEROINE AT PAY PHONE

               We only see her mouth. Set in hard, grim lines. She says:

                                     CHARLY
                         It's cold, I want to come in.

                                     PERKINS
                         Charly...? Oh, my God, what the hell 
                         are you *doing*? Listen to me, I'm 
                         going to direct you to a safe house, 
                         get you on a plane --

                                     CHARLY
                         Can the bullshit, I'm not telling 
                         you where I am. I'll come in for a 
                         full debriefing, but we do it my 
                         way.

                                     PERKINS
                         Charly, you're being paranoid. It's 
                         not like it used to be, you're eight 
                         years out of date.

                                     CHARLY
                         Do tell.

                                     PERKINS
                         Congress won't authorize a dime, 
                         Charly. Chapter's on the way out, 
                         we've been reduced to a records-
                         keeping agency, we *don't have enough 
                         money to kill you*, understand...?

                                     CHARLY
                         Fuck you, Perkins. If you want me 
                         dead, you'll pass a hat in the typing 
                         pool to buy bullets. We do things my 
                         way.

                                     PERKINS
                         Your way, I see. And if I say go to 
                         hell?

                                     CHARLY
                         From where I stand, it ain't much of 
                         a commute. You'll hear from me.

               She clicks off. Perkins darts a look at the techie -- guy 
               shakes his head, no go on the trace. Perkins swears.

                                     PERKINS
                         She mustn't threaten our success. 
                         Contain her, whatever it takes. But 
                         be *careful*. If it gets out you're 
                         working for me... we'll both be 
                         grabbing our ankles on the White 
                         House lawn.

               ESTABLISHING SHOT - ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY - NIGHT

               There. Thank you, New Jersey, that'll be all. You can go 
               now. Um, please.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE - ATLANTIC CITY - NIGHT

               Waking is slow for Mitch Henessey. He swallows dryly. Eyes 
               creak open, struggle to focus... Hears WATER running. A 
               shower. Squints at his watch. He's not wearing a watch, he 
               knew that... In BED, naked. Chest swathed in bandages, what 
               the hell...? He pokes them. Jerks his head, hissing in pain.

               EXT. LIVING ROOM OF SUITE - WITH HENESSEY - NIGHT

               Henessey lights a smoke at the bar. Flicks the match in a 
               trashcan. Starts to go, stops... Reaches into the can. Plucks 
               out a tiny scrap: PHOTOGRAPH, ripped in two.

               A photo of Hal and Caitlin.

               He pockets it, disturbed. Crosses to the bathroom door. The 
               shower has stopped. Raises a tentative hand, starts to 
               knock... It OPENS. There, in a thin silk robe, is a WOMAN, 
               swabbing at her hair.

               She breezes out of the bathroom all chipper, like nothing's 
               unusual. Notices Henessey cursorily. Raises a finger: "one 
               sec." Lowers her head and shakes it like a terrier, spraying 
               him.

               He cannot stop staring. It's Samantha, it *has* to be...

               Now she's BLONDE, though. Hair clipped short. Bobbed. Blood-
               red fingernails. Red cotton shift, legs for days.

               Then, she *smiles* at him -- and it's not her, not Samantha.

               Amnesia's over, folks, because we're clearly looking at a 
               changed woman: This one's name is CHARLY BALTIMORE, and she 
               hasn't seen the light of day in eight years.

                                     CHARLY
                         Hey, Mitch. Glad you're awake. Uh-
                         oh, you're seeping.

               She grabs a washcloth. Frowns, says:

                                     CHARLY
                         Here, look at this.

               With that, she opens her robe and exposes her breasts. 
               Henessey perks up considerably -- then SCREAMS as she RIPS 
               the gauze from his chest. She clinchs the robe again.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Ah, that hurt like shit!!

                                     CHARLY
                         That's why I distracted you first.
                              (dabs at his wounds)
                         Same principle as breaking in virgins.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Same as -- virgins, *what*...?

                                     CHARLY
                         Saw it in a Harold Robbins book. Guy 
                         bites her on the ear as he goes in. 
                         Distracts from the pain. You ever 
                         try that?

                                     HENESSEY
                         No, I slug 'em in the jaw and yell 
                         "pop goes the weasel," what the fuck 
                         are you talking about? Who are you??

                                     CHARLY
                         Name's Charly. The spy. Nice to 
                         meet'cha. Drink?

               INT. CASINO BAR - EVENING

               Henessey watches, fascinated. All the little mannerisms, the 
               differences. Shaking out a match, running a hand through her 
               hair... And never missing a thing, eyes constantly roving, 
               scanning. Guard never down. She plucks a drink from a nearby 
               table, steals it outright.

                                     CHARLY
                         See? Sit next to the dance floor, 
                         every drink's free. People finish 
                         dancing, they think the waiter lifted 
                         'em.

               Henessey grimaces. Clears his throat, says:

                                     HENESSEY
                         I'm confused. Gimme a minute.

                                     CHARLY
                         Take two, they're small.

               She knocks back her drink. No hesitation. Henessey shifts 
               uncomfortably, lights a smoke.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Okay. Let's say I buy it. You're 
                         actually a trained killer, Jesus, I 
                         can't even say it with a straight 
                         face.
                              (frowns)
                         So then... Samantha, she...

                                     CHARLY
                         Never really existed. Like Nathan 
                         said, she was a total fabrication, I 
                         made her up.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Fabrication. And now she's just... 
                         gone? Forever and ever?

                                     CHARLY
                         Thank God. Look at my inordinately 
                         large ass, look what she did to me.

               Henessey squirms, this one's gonna take some time to digest.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Pretty convincing act.

                                     CHARLY
                         Guess so.

                                     HENESSEY
                         I mean, her personality, it had to 
                         come from *somewhere* --

                                     CHARLY
                         Change the subject. Better yet, steal 
                         me another drink.

               Henessey sighs. Next to him a couple get up to dance. He 
               reaches over and lifts their beers.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Drink up. What's next?

                                     CHARLY
                         I called Chapter. I'm trying to bring 
                         us in from the field alive...

                                     HENESSEY
                         Chapter. Can you trust them?

                                     CHARLY
                         Not sure. Until I know, you might 
                         wanna stay away from curbs.

               He looks at her, confused:

                                     CHARLY
                         They like to push people in front of 
                         buses.

               Didn't need to know that. A DANCING SANTA goes by:

                                     SANTA CLAUS
                              (bad Caribbean accent)
                         Hey, lady, Santa want to dance the 
                         lambada wit'choo. *Come this way, 
                         everybody*!

               He shimmies away. Charly grins at Henessey:

                                     CHARLY
                         If I could come that way I wouldn't 
                         need to dance the lambada. Follow 
                         me, I need you to do something.

               EXT. DANCE CLUB - PAY PHONE - NIGHTTIME

               Henessey hunches forward, speaks rapidly into the phone:

                                     HENESSEY
                         ...The lady's whacked, Trin, she's 
                         lost it and I want fucking out, now 
                         *call the Feds*. She's moving us 
                         tonight, I'll sneak out to this phone, 
                         call you back at midnight with the 
                         details.

               He hangs up quickly. Turns -- reveal CHARLY, lounging a foot 
               away, watching him.

                                     HENESSEY
                         All right, Charly. What did that 
                         accomplish?

                                     CHARLY
                         I'm testing our boy Perkins. I figure 
                         he's gotta be tapping your office. 
                         Got a light...?

                                     HENESSEY
                              (pause, then:)
                         Oh, no. He just traced that call?

               She swipes matches from his pocket. Nods.

                                     CHARLY
                         Come midnight, you hang by the phone. 
                         Nobody shows, we think about trusting 
                         him. He tries to kidnap and torture 
                         you, well, there it is.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Whoa, time out.

                                     CHARLY
                         Oh, don't be such a baby.
                              (lights her cigarette)
                         Ten o'clock, we got two hours to 
                         kill. I'm a woman, feed me.

               EXT. ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK - NIGHTTIME

               CARNIVAL RIDES, dead for the winter. Henessey and Charly 
               stroll beneath them. He smokes. She eats Chinese.

                                     CHARLY
                         Ugh. God I'm full, I'm gonna have a 
                         food baby.

               He takes a good long look at her, still can't fathom it.

                                     HENESSEY
                         "Charly." fucking unbelievable.
                              (beat)
                         Shame about the fat ass. I bet you 
                         were really attractive once.

                                     CHARLY
                         Oh, I was. Check this out. One time? 
                         A guy said he'd fuck me.

                                     HENESSEY
                         No.

                                     CHARLY
                         Swear to God.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Did he make good?

                                     CHARLY
                         Absolutely. Oh, and afterwards? Oh 
                         my God, afterwards I said the most 
                         funny thing, you know what I said...?
                              (beat)
                         I said, "Go back to your room. Dad..."

               She laughs through a swig of beer. MEMORY FLASH: Charly's 
               bedroom as DAD puts the gun to his head and fires, CRACK...

                                     CHARLY
                         It's why he thought I had him killed.

               Henessey huddles, watching her closely.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Your father was murdered.

               She nods, gazes out over the icy waters. Speaks, her voice 
               faraway and gone:

                                     CHARLY
                         When Da died, I went to his funeral. 
                         12 years old, today I wouldn't. And 
                         I overheard a woman, she was 
                         praying... She was thanking God -- 
                         sounded so happy -- thanking Him it 
                         hadn't been *her* father who was 
                         killed. See... she didn't really 
                         care that God had let someone die... 
                         just so long as it missed *her*.
                              (beat)
                         ...and she bought her cross at the 
                         same store as mine, see, that's what 
                         we do, we all pray to the same cross 
                         on a hundred different walls, and 
                         sit back and wait to see who gets 
                         hit and who gets missed.

               Anger flares in her eye. Like a stirring of mud at the bottom 
               of a deep, deep, pond.

                                     CHARLY
                         Fuck the waiting. Fuck being afraid. 
                         I determine who gets hit, and how 
                         hard. And I thank no one. It's 
                         pathetic to thank someone who spares 
                         you -- when they're just taking 
                         someone else.
                              (beat)
                         Walk me upstairs?

               INT. HOTEL SUITE - BEDROOM - NIGHTTIME

               They enter the suite. She drops her purse, sways toward him. 
               Presses him against the wall, framed there in the doorway.

                                     CHARLY
                         This is my first date in eight years, 
                         Mitch. Is this a fun date...?

               Quite suddenly, Charly leans over and kisses him on the lips. 
               He reacts, startled. Stares at her.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Okay, what's going on?

                                     CHARLY
                         True love, shut the fuck up.

                                     HENESSEY
                         You kidding me? I'm an ex-con, lady. 
                         I wear a shiny suit, my tie's crooked, 
                         and the last time I got blown candy 
                         bars cost a nickel. Plus I'm ugly, 
                         so what's up?

                                     CHARLY
                         Chemistry. Be quiet.

               She nibbles his ear. Pulls back, smiling -- and Henessey's 
               holding the picture of HAL and CAITLIN. The one he found 
               torn in two. He looks her full in the face:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Chemistry my ass. Know what I think? 
                         I think this is why you'd fuck me.
                              (beat)
                         To kill a schoolteacher. Bury any 
                         trace of her.

               He pushes her away.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Sorry, I liked the schoolteacher. 
                         When she comes back, give me a call.

               Charly jerks backward. Angry. Henessey heads for the bathroom.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Oh, and call your fuckin' kid, will 
                         ya'? It's two days to Christmas, and 
                         she's under the mistaken impression 
                         that Mommy gives a shit.

               Charly snatches up her purse, eyes burning:

                                     CHARLY
                         I didn't ask for the kid, Mitch. 
                         Samantha had the kid, not me, NOBODY 
                         ASKED ME.

               She storms out. CUT TO:

               EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHTTIME

               Charly stalks the city streets. A quartet sings, "God Rest 
               Ye Merry," ostensibly about joy, oddly the most depressing 
               tune ever written. On a crowded street, she is alone. Total 
               misfit. Searches her own haggard features in a shop window. 
               Swallows hard, whispers:

                                     CHARLY
                         Easy, baby. She ain't coming back, 
                         no way. Bitch is dead.

               She bustles down a sidestreet, hands jammed in her pockets. 
               That's when a tall BEARDED MAN crosses the street and falls 
               in alongside.

                                     BEARDED MAN
                         Good evening.

                                     CHARLY
                         Fuck off.

                                     BEARDED MAN
                         I see me a good-looking lady, all 
                         upset, I wonder if she doesn't need 
                         some male company.

                                     CHARLY
                         Forget it. I'm saving myself 'til I 
                         get raped.

               His hand edges out of his windbreaker with a snubnosed .38.

                                     BEARDED MAN
                         Step into the alley, honey. I ain't 
                         asking, I'm telling.

               Charly stops walking. Regards him the way you or I might 
               look at a telephone cord. Groans:

                                     CHARLY
                         Oh, don't tell me. You're early, 
                         Goddammit, you're supposed to be at 
                         the pay phone. Go away and come back 
                         at midnight. I'm not ready yet. Got 
                         a light?

               The guy stares, mouth working.

                                     BEARDED MAN
                         Lady, I have a gun!

               Which is precisely when a much larger Smith and Wesson COCKS 
               next to his ear:

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         This ain't no ham on rye, pal.

               HENESSEY holds the gun rock steady in his big fist. Charly 
               spins on him, eyes flashing:

                                     CHARLY
                         What the hell are you doing here?

                                     HENESSEY
                         Saving your life. Woulda got here 
                         sooner but I was thinking up the 
                         sandwich line.

                                     CHARLY
                         You think I couldn't take him? 
                         *Idiot*, you probably scared the 
                         other guy away --

                                     HENESSEY
                         What other guy -- ?

                                     CHARLY
                         Headhunters, nimrod, they go in pairs, 
                         were you always this stupid or did 
                         you take lessons?

                                     HENESSEY
                         I TOOK LESSONS.

               The hitman watches, bewildered. Considers waving to get their 
               attention. Finally he can't stand it. Blurts out:

                                     BEARDED MAN
                         Hey!

               Charly snaps her head toward him:

                                     CHARLY
                         *What*?

                                     BEARDED MAN
                         I still got this fucking gun!

               She smiles sweetly.

                                     CHARLY
                         No, you don't.

               Takes it off him. Just like that. He stares dumbly at his 
               empty hand. Half of his trigger finger is missing.

                                     BEARDED MAN
                         SHIIIIT!!

               Charly flips the gun into the air. Launches a SPIN KICK. 
               Shatters his jaw. Catapults him backwards.

               Completes her spin, catlike -- Catches the .38 on its way 
               down. DOESN'T STOP THERE. Arm out, gun cocked -- FIRES. 
               Straight at Henessey, what...? He dives aside --

               BEHIND HIM, a second HITMAN. Blown to tatters. The KNIFE 
               meant for Henessey arcs through the air...

               Imbeds itself in the ground an inch from the prone detective. 
               He stares at it with shocked eyes. The killer hits, dead. 
               Twitches. CHARLY. Lowers her arm slowly. Gun barrel smoking.

                                     CHARLY
                         Fuck you. Just fuck all of you.

               EXT. ATLANTIC CITY STREET - NIGHTTIME

               A BRONCO ROARS UP out of a parking garage. Swerves and plunges 
               into the maze of streets that inspired the world's most 
               popular board game.

               INT. BRONCO - SAME

               Charly drives, possessed. Henessey drinks. Hands shaking.

                                     CHARLY
                         Dammit. I knew I couldn't trust that 
                         prick.

               She throws a shrieking skid. Henessey clutches for the 
               dashboard, swearing.

                                     CHARLY
                         Easy, Spike. I got myself out of 
                         Beirut once, I think I can get us 
                         out of New Jersey.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Don't be so sure, others have tried. 
                         The entire population, in fact.
                              (beat)
                         Look, about me...? I mean, what's 
                         up, you're this hot survival chick, 
                         I'm getting the feeling you don't 
                         need me anymore.

               Charly reaches over. Yanks the doorhandle.

                                     CHARLY
                         Good point.

               She kicks him out of the moving car.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - SAME TIME

               He bounces off the highway. Rolls. Over and over, shudders 
               to a stop. Pause... The wind blows. He groans. Looks up, 
               spits gravel. Stands. Dusts himself off. Watches the Bronco 
               go far away.

               TIME CUT - EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               As Henessey trudges wearily down the highway we HEAR:

                                     HENESSEY (V.O.)
                         Dear Mom: I was tortured, now I'm in 
                         Atlantic City. The girl of my dreams 
                         just threw me out of a speeding car. 
                         Now more people will come an shoot 
                         me in the head. On the plus side, I 
                         won two bucks at video poker.

               A SCREECH of tires, he turns, startled -- here comes the 
               Bronco. Skids onto the highway and races back toward him. 
               Pulls up alongside. CHARLY throws open the door, says:

                                     CHARLY
                         Get in.

               He does. Without a word. Closes the door, they drive off. He 
               lights a cigarette like nothing happened. Shakes out the 
               match, speaks without looking at her:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Found a use for me.

                                     CHARLY
                         Yep.
                              (beat)
                         I gotta vanish, Mitch. I need money, 
                         a whole bunch.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Why didn't you say so? Gimme a second 
                         while I pull it out of my ass.

               She turns to him, a gleam in her eye. Speaks softly:

                                     CHARLY
                         The key, Mitch. The one I keep around 
                         my neck.

                                     HENESSEY
                         What about it?

                                     CHARLY
                         What if I told you it's the key to 
                         Box 406 at Pittsburgh International 
                         Airport?

                                     HENESSEY
                         How would you know? Someone filed 
                         off the numbers.

                                     CHARLY
                         Not someone. Me. I filed them off.
                              (beat)
                         There's a briefcase in Box 406, Mitch.

                                     HENESSEY
                         What's in it?

                                     CHARLY
                         $200,000.

               Henessey does a spit-take, sprays whiskey.

                                     CHARLY
                         Payment for my last assignment. I 
                         need you to retrieve it for me.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Why me?

                                     CHARLY
                         Don't be stupid, they might have the 
                         place covered. I don't want to get 
                         shot to pieces.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Shoulda known.
                              (sighs)
                         Gimme the key.

                                     CHARLY
                         I'd love to. I left it with Caitlin 
                         back in Ohio.

               EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

               The BRONCO races on into the night...

               INT. BRONCO - SAME TIME

               Late, very late now. Henessey, driving. Beside him, Charly 
               reclines, lost in reverie. Features bathed in passing 
               roadlights. Henessey grinds out a butt:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Humor me: you're a paid assassin, 
                         then you fall off a cliff. Sink under 
                         the ocean, and when you come out 
                         you're a fucking schoolmarm, wanna 
                         tell me what happened?

                                     CHARLY
                         I fell into a school of fish, they 
                         elected me principal. Shut the fuck 
                         up.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Mmmm. Personally...? I'm thinking 
                         maybe Samantha Caine wasn't an act. 
                         Maybe you forgot to hate yourself 
                         for eight years, ever think of 
                         that...?

                                     CHARLY
                         Shut. The. Fuck. Up. Hmmm... Nope, 
                         seems clear enough to me. Hate myself, 
                         Christ almighty. What are you, my 
                         shrink?

                                     HENESSEY
                         No, just some loser thought he could 
                         maybe understand, fuck it. I been 
                         there, you know. I'd kill for fucking 
                         amnesia. I'm with my boy and all I 
                         can think is I got reamed in the ass 
                         by three guys. Merry Christmas, son, 
                         here's a ball glove, did you know 
                         Daddy screamed when they carved the 
                         name in his back...? Mary, by the 
                         way. I pushed for Cindy, but hell. 
                         God, I'm tired.
                              (beat)
                         I never did one thing right, you 
                         know it, not one fucking thing. Not 
                         even accidental, that takes skill.

               He looks over. She's asleep, hasn't heard a word. Face slack, 
               lips slightly parted. The toughness banished from her 
               features. In its place, a lingering sadness. CUT TO:

               EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAWN BREAKING

               The Bronco glides along. Charly in the passenger seat, eyes 
               roving like a hawk's. THE CAINE HOUSE is peaceful and quiet. 
               Christmas lights, still burning dimly.

                                     CHARLY
                         Drive past, don't slow down.
                              (points)
                         Park under those trees, honk if 
                         there's trouble.

                                     HENESSEY
                              (bad Rochester)
                         Yas, massah, I be slowin' de caw 
                         down fo' you.

               She stuffs a .45 automatic in her waistband. Cradles an MP-5 
               beneath her coat. Rolls out of the still-moving truck. Makes 
               her way through back yards. Silent as a cat. She went to 
               cookouts here. Bridge parties. Now she prowls, a grim 
               assassin.

               Leaps a fence, drops behind a woodpile -- Comes face to face 
               with RAYMOND, a fifth grade student we saw earlier. Secreted 
               behind the woodpile, SMOKING. His eyes pop as he spies good 
               ol' Ms. Caine, sporting blonde hair and an assault weapon. 
               Charly doesn't miss a beat:

                                     CHARLY
                         Good morning, Raymond.

                                     RAYMOND
                         Um... morning, Ms. Caine.

                                     CHARLY
                         What did we learn about the dangers 
                         of smoking...? Give it here.

               A wet stain appears at his crotch. He hands her the cigarette 
               with nerveless fingers. Charly accepts it. Takes a long, 
               satisfying drag. Passes it back.

                                     CHARLY
                         Thanks. Tell anyone you saw me I'll 
                         blow your fucking head off.

               Moves off through the bushes. Out of sight.

               EXT. CAINE BACK YARD - MOMENTS LATER

               Charly kicks aside a pair of abandoned ice skates. Crouches, 
               face pressed to the glass door. Looking in. The house is 
               silent and empty. Nobody home. The Christmas tree winks off 
               and on. The tree she helped decorate. She opens the door and 
               slips inside. CUT TO:

               INT. GOVERNMENT ISSUE SEDAN - DRIVING - SAME TIME

               Three GOVERNMENT AGENTS. Faces drawn, haggard. Pit-stained 
               shirts, day old sandwiches. Carrying photographs of Charly 
               and Henessey. Agent #1 sighs, examining her figure.

                                     AGENT #1
                         Man, I'd eat a mile of her shit just 
                         to follow it back to the ass it came 
                         from.

                                     AGENT #2
                         Christ, I'm trying to have breakfast.

               A RADIO MIC on the dash squawks, a voice says:

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Unit 2 to Red Dog, give us one more 
                         pass, let's make sure the house is 
                         secure.

               EXT. CAITLIN'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

               Charly enters. All business. Begins to systematically rifle 
               the drawers. Her daughter's precious things. Sweeps everything 
               onto the floor. Utter disregard, it's a bit startling.

               Crosses to the bed, throws back the covers -- MR. PERKINS 
               (the stuffed bear) has the chain around his neck.

               We hear it, then. Ghosting on the still air, barely audible, 
               the sound of SINGING... Children's voices waft across the 
               frozen pond from St. Paul's Episcopal CHURCH. Charly frowns. 
               Crosses to the window, lifts the sash.

               Pause. Charly chews her lip. Unlimbers the MP-5. Hefts the 
               wicked-looking thing. Not to fire it... but to use the SCOPE. 
               Adjusts focus. Practiced movements. Deft. Sure. Sights down 
               the weapon. Scans though the gunsights...

               POV CHARLY: Hal's CHRISTMAS PAGEANT. There's Hal. Cast in 
               spectral GREEN. Laughing and serving breakfast. On the church 
               lawn, a NATIVITY scene. Teenage girls as the wise men. Choir 
               of children, singing... CAITLIN among them.

               Charly is sweating. She lowers the scope. Squeezes her eyes 
               shut. Something in her, threatening to WRENCH LOOSE...

               EXT. FRONT OF CAINE HOUSE - SAME TIME

               Henessey, slouched behind the wheel. Starts to light a 
               cigarette. Stops, the match halfway to his face. Eyes riveted 
               on the rearview mirror as a GOVERNMENT SEDAN turns the corner 
               behind him...

               BACK WITH CHARLY - INSIDE

               Watching her family, far away. Fighting emotion. That's when 
               she hears A HORN HONKING. Her head whips around, toward the 
               front of the house. The honk is followed by three GUNSHOTS 
               in rapid succession.

               She's up and moving. All else forgotten.

               EXT. FRONT OF CAINE HOUSE - SAME TIME

               Henessey PEELS OUT, tires smoking. Careens forward, government 
               SEDAN close behind --

               The upstairs window EXPLODES outward. Charly, hurtles through. 
               Freefalls to the porch roof. Glass, showering down. Hits, 
               rolls. Surfaces in a combat crouch, FIRES.

               Government sedan, KILLS THE PASSENGER. Collapses him over 
               the doorframe. Gun clatters to the street, car speeds off --

               INT. GOVERNMENT SEDAN - DRIVING

               The driver looks over, incredulous.

                                     DRIVER
                         He's dead. Goddammit, how did that 
                         happen??

                                     BACKSEAT
                         *Go bulletproof, now*!

               The driver hits a button and up go the windows. All, that 
               is, except the passenger side window -- Because the dead 
               guy's bald HEAD blocks it. Becomes WEDGED there. Bald pate 
               exposed to the world.

               BACK WITH CHARLY - FRONT OF HOUSE

               Charly watches the two vehicles rocketing away down the 
               street. Out of range. Lowers the smoking .45. SWEARS. Takes 
               off around the house at a dead run.

               INT. ST. PAUL'S - SAME TIME

               Switch scenery: the Christmas Pageant, CAITLIN and fellow 
               angels traipse into the church vestibule... Caitlin looks up 
               just in time to see TIMOTHY apply the chloroform.

               Two seconds, she's out like a light. Next case. Up and moving, 
               child tucked neatly under his arm. A NEARBY MOTHER OF THREE 
               has seen it happen. Opens her mouth to scream -- He palms a 
               KNIFE. Puts it to her youngest son's kidney:

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Wanna be a statistic, lady? You're 
                         about to have 2.4 children.

               Freezes her. Petrified.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         I know where you live. Close your 
                         mouth, you look like a fish. Merry 
                         Christmas.

               He exits into the vestibule. Quick. Professional.

               MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE RANCH:

               High speed chase, in progress. The driver dogs Henessey, 
               jockeys for position. Barks into a radio mic:

                                     DRIVER
                         Target two, acquired! Red Dog in 
                         pursuit, backup requested.
                              (over his shoulder)
                         You got him?

                                     BACKSEAT
                         I got him.

               The backseat agent hefts an AK-47 assault rifle.

               WITH HENESSEY - DRIVING

               Henessey checks the rear view mirror -- just in time to see 
               a circular portion of glass POP from the chase car's window. 
               Out comes a gun muzzle.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Jesus wept.

               The guy opens up on full auto. Rakes the Bronco, STRAFES it. 
               Henessey swerves madly -- no go. Death run. He's not coming 
               home, not this time.

               EXT. FROZEN POND - SAME TIME

               CHARLY BALTIMORE hurtles forward, SPEED SKATING across the 
               frozen pond toward the chase vehicles. Long, coltish legs, 
               to die for.

                                     CHARLY
                         This is gross, this is gonna be so 
                         Goddamn gross...

               She goes SIDESLIPPING at superhuman speed. Tacks alongside 
               the government sedan. Targets the bald guy's head. Raises 
               the .45 and FIRES. Not to be graphic, but the car's driver 
               receives the bulk of the mess. SPRAYED.

               Across the eyes. He loses control, SKIDS OUT. Catapults off 
               the road, onto the ice. Slides right toward Charly, *still 
               doing fifty*...

               She doesn't miss a beat. LAUNCHES herself, twisting in 
               midair... Up OVER THE HOOD of the sedan, it blows by 
               underneath her as

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               The incredible part. In slow motion, she does a DOUBLE AXEL 
               PIRHOUETTE. Above the hood. Mid-spin, she blows THREE SHOTS 
               through the windshield. Kills everyone. Keeps going. The car 
               spins twice around. PLOWS to a halt -- Charly hits a picture 
               perfect landing.

               On the shore, HENESSEY watches, thunderstruck. Charly skates 
               by the icebound sedan. Flashes a grin at the dying driver:

                                     DRIVER
                         Shit... it really... *is* you...

                                     CHARLY
                         Phil...? Phil Krauss? I don't believe 
                         it, they moved you from cyphers. 
                         Long time, man, I figured you were 
                         dead by now.

               She delivers a blow to the neck. Kills him. CUT TO:

               EXT. HIGHWAY - DRIVING - DAYTIME

               Henessey and Charly, driving a new vehicle: late model 
               Cadillac. Charly driver. Henessey rifles the glove 
               compartment.

                                     CHARLY
                         So, Mitch. Still think I'm warm and 
                         fuzzy?

                                     HENESSEY
                         Sure. It's not your fault the gun 
                         accidentally went off in mid-air as 
                         you tripped and flew over the car.

                                     CHARLY
                         Exactly. What's in the glove box?

                                     HENESSEY
                         Phone bill, Christmas card... Five 
                         buck, swell. You didn't have to kill 
                         him, you know.

                                     CHARLY
                         Back off, man. Do I tell you how to 
                         snap photos of extramarital blowjobs? 
                         No.

               There is a short, CHIRPING sound. Seemingly from nowhere. 
               They exchange puzzled looks, what the hell...? Charly abruptly 
               realizes it's coming from her purse. She reaches in, scoops 
               up the CELLULAR PHONE, the one she told Caitlin to call. 
               Thumbs the button. Says cautiously:

                                     CHARLY
                         Hello?

               A voice, then... Clipped tones, TIMOTHY'S voice:

                                     TIMOTHY (O.S.)
                         It's me, I got your kid. Give your 
                         location, we gotta lose the cellular.

               Charly. Hand gripped tight on the phone. Pause, then:

                                     CHARLY
                         State Road 80, 15 minutes west of 
                         Harrison.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Okay, here's how we do it. Drive to 
                         Harrison, find their main bus stop. 
                         Pay phone, fifteen minutes. Better 
                         drive fast, after five rings I hang 
                         up.

               Click.

                                     HENESSEY
                         What the hell was that?

                                     CHARLY
                         He's got the kid. Doesn't want to 
                         talk on the airwaves, he's routing 
                         me to a land line. A pay phone.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Which phone? Where?

               The detective's mind, racing... suddenly it hits him:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Shit. Service centers...! They list 
                         'em on the back of phone bills, right?

                                     CHARLY
                         Excuse me?

                                     HENESSEY
                         Shut up and find me a gun. HK, MP-5.

               As he rips open the bill we CUT TO:

               A neutral background, as Charly's HEAD enters frame, we're 
               very tight on her FACE... Tense, thin-lipped. A PHONE RINGS, 
               deafening. Click -- Charly speaks tersely:

                                     CHARLY
                         Verify you have her.

                                     TIMOTHY (O.S.)
                         I got your cellular number off a 
                         cast on her right wrist. Right below 
                         Mommy loves you... Picture of a panda. 
                         Dog, panda, it's got funky ears.

               CLOSE ON CHARLY: Dead still. Made of glass.

                                     TIMOTHY (O.S.)
                         I want money, Charly. I know you've 
                         got numbered accounts, we all do. 
                         I'll let you know where and when. 
                         Fuck with me...? I'll blind the kid 
                         and shoot out her knees.

                                     CHARLY
                         You're dead, motherfucker. We don't 
                         involve families. It's not the way 
                         it's done, *we don't take families*.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         I'll be in touch.

               He hangs up. Dead silence. HOLD on Charly's face... until 
               slowly, ever so slowly, the camera pulls back to REVEAL:

               The .45 automatic -- Pointed at the head of an AT&T operator. 
               THE PHONE COMPANY, they've taken it over. Employees CRINGE 
               on the floor. Henessey, MP-5 slung on his shoulder, leveled. 
               Charly points to the switchboard:

                                     CHARLY
                         Give me an ANI trace. Do it.

               EXT. PINE-COVERED MOUNTIANS - UPSTATE NEW YORK - MORNING

               Set back from the mountain road, a lonely MOTEL. A neon sign: 
               *Deer Lick Motel*, No vacancies. The sign sits atop a rusty 
               pole. Blinks forlornly.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

               TIMOTHY hangs up and turns to MR. PERKINS, seated across the 
               room:

                                     TIMOTHY
                         It's done, she hooked. All I gotta 
                         do is set the ransom meet.

                                     PERKINS
                         She mustn't suspect a trap.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         No way. She thinks I'm acting alone, 
                         remember? Say the word, I'll hand 
                         her to you on a plate.

               Perkins crosses to the bed. Rubs tired eyes. Gazes down at 
               Caitlin. Asleep, a syringe on the nightstand beside her. 
               Next to a brown paper bag.

                                     PERKINS
                         God. We're monsters, aren't we...?
                              (pause, then:)
                         Forget Charly. Talk to me about 
                         tonight.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         The tanker's on its way from 
                         Charleston, ETA 1:00 a.m. One 
                         terrorist on ice, waiting to play 
                         patsy.
                              (points)
                         What's in the sack?

               Perkins follows his gaze: the brown paper bag. Smiles thinly.

                                     PERKINS
                         That...? Something to prove that I'm 
                         not a complete ogre.

               He reaches into the paper bag and brings out a BABY DOLL. 
               Sweet, innocent. Frilly with lace. A bright red bow.

                                     PERKINS
                         See? The young one will have a doll 
                         to play with on Christmas. Very 
                         popular item. It... well, it pees. 
                         You put water in it and... oh, fuck 
                         you.

               INT. ROADSIDE RESTAURANT - NEW YORK STATE - TWILIGHT

               Charly and Henessey, eating at HARDEE'S. Seated across from 
               each other at an orange plastic table, scarfing Christmas 
               burgers. Outside, a billboard reads: WELCOME TO SANTA CLAUS! 
               *Where it's Christmas all year long*!

                                     HENESSEY
                         Almost dark now.

                                     CHARLY
                         Another ten minutes. You want my 
                         Crazy Meal action figure?

                                     HENESSEY
                         Pass. Listen, you sure we're doing 
                         the right thing? We've got money, we 
                         could negotiate...

                                     CHARLY
                         *I'll get the damn kid*, okay? God, 
                         I hope he doesn't shoot her up. Kid's 
                         dead weight if she's sedated.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Not so emotional, I'm getting 
                         embarrassed with these outbursts 
                         here.

                                     CHARLY
                         Oh, balls. Want me to cry on cue? I 
                         can. This is an extraction, nimrod, 
                         and she's the target, that's how to 
                         play it, the only way to beat this 
                         guy.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Yeah? How come you know so much about 
                         this fucking guy?

                                     CHARLY
                         Don't go there, Mitch, you don't 
                         want to know.

                                     HENESSEY
                         I'm here. Suppose you tell me.

                                     CHARLY
                         Fine, you asked. I bumped pelvises 
                         with this guy. In Paris, back in 
                         1987.

               She knows she's shocking him, rubs it in:

                                     CHARLY
                         I'd been assigned to kill his boss, 
                         remember...? Needed him out of the 
                         way. So I let him seduce me. Had a 
                         steel needle under the pillow, figured 
                         to stick him *en flagrante*, that 
                         means while we were screwing. But he 
                         was too slick. Bashed me in the head, 
                         finished, then threw me in the trunk 
                         of a car. Still think I'm a girl 
                         scout, Mitch...?

               The look in her eyes is feral.

                                     CHARLY
                         It's almost dark. Let's get it done.

               EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHTTIME

               Full dark now, the fun begins... A TANKER TRUCK rumbles up 
               the mountain road. Pulls up before the Deer Lick Motel. MEN 
               IN SUITS wield flashlights, motioning the truck forward into 
               a cavernous GARAGE. Inside, men in BLUE JUMPSUITS operate 
               cranes, maneuver a FILL TANK into place above the truck.

               EXT. SURROUNDING MOUNTAINSIDE - SAME TIME

               In the distance, as the tanker enters the garage -- CHARLY 
               BALTIMORE drops into frame. Lands and rolls, cat-quick. Comes 
               up behind a scrawny pine. Scans through a pair of Zeiss 
               Nightvision binoculars.

               Welcome to the extraction. No more fun and games, tonight 
               it's a survival-zero operation. HENESSEY appears at her elbow. 
               Lugging the ordnance bag. He sees Charly lower the binoculars, 
               head in hands.

                                     HENESSEY
                         What's the matter?

                                     CHARLY
                         They're here.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Who?

                                     CHARLY
                         Fucking Chapter, that's who. Timothy 
                         acting alone, Caitlin had a chance. 
                         Now...? She's dead meat.

               INT. BUNKER - SAME TIME

               As the tanker snorts to a halt, TIMOTHY pulls up, driving a 
               bright red Jaguar. Gets out as a blue-suit trots up:

                                     BLUE-SUIT
                         1800 hours. We're still trying to 
                         clean the tanker --

                                     TIMOTHY
                              (scowls annoyance)
                         Fuck the cleaning, just drain it and 
                         reload. Chop-chop, I'm going bunjee 
                         jumping after this.

               EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - SAME TIME

               Charly and Henessey. Kneeling. He speaks tersely:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Let me go in.

                                     CHARLY
                         Negative. You stomp around like a 
                         forties drunk and you're a lousy 
                         shot.

                                     HENESSEY
                         I get by.

                                     CHARLY
                         You couldn't hit a lake if you were 
                         standing on the bottom, now shut the 
                         fuck up.

               Charly studies the encampment. Armed men. Impossible odds. 
               Draws a long ragged breath and flops on the ground. Props 
               her back against a tree. Staring. Lights a cigarette:

                                     CHARLY
                         I saw a little girl.

                                     HENESSEY
                              (frowns)
                         Come again?

                                     CHARLY
                         That's what happened under the water. 
                         That night, eight years ago.

               She looks up at the sky. Face troubled.

                                     CHARLY
                         At the end... there she was, this 
                         pretty little girl at the bottom of 
                         the ocean, smiling at me. Three years 
                         old, didn't know Daddies hid in 
                         closets, not yet. Stared up at me in 
                         the strangest way... saying how'd it 
                         come to this, we were so pretty and 
                         perfect, now look at us, sinking 
                         with our head all open... Said when 
                         she grew up she was gonna teach 
                         school. She couldn't wait.

               She heaves a sigh. Threads a silencer on a baretta.

                                     CHARLY
                         Guards are on 27-1 megahertz, meet 
                         me at 26-9, you need to talk. As 
                         soon as you spot me with the kid, 
                         start blowing the charges.

               Henessey nods. Pause -- she does something unexpected. Leans 
               over and kisses him hard on the lips. He reacts, startled. 
               She pulls back, the oddest look on her face.

                                     CHARLY
                         They're gonna blow my head off, you 
                         know.
                              (softly:)
                         This is the last time I'll ever be 
                         pretty.

               She kisses him again. Softly. Tenderly. Pulls back, turns 
               without a word.

                                     CHARLY
                         Time now. What I do next, they tell 
                         me it... looks like a machine or 
                         something. You don't like it, don't 
                         look.

               She moves off toward the trees. Henessey shifts from foot to 
               foot, awkwardly. Opens his mouth --

                                     CHARLY
                         Don't say it.

                                     HENESSEY
                         I was gonna say enjoy life, eat out 
                         more often.

                                     CHARLY
                         Gotta go.
                              (beat)
                         If she's alive, she's coming out of 
                         there, Mitch. If she's not... they'll 
                         know we stopped by.

               She's gone, like a wraith. CUT TO:

               SERIES OF SHOTS: Charly, on the prowl. In and out of the 
               trees... BURYING C-4 CHARGES. In bushes. In snowdrifts. She 
               crawls to woods' edge, peers out -- The motel stands solemn 
               and bedraggled. Draws a sharp breath -- !

               There's a LIT CANDLE in the window of 17. CUT TO:

               EXT. MOTEL GROUNDS - SAME TIME

               A gray-suited SENTRY. Poised on a wooded slope. He puts a 
               walkie-talkie to his lips and says:

                                     SENTRY
                         All clear.

               CHARLY, out of nowhere. Lightning fast. Hand, clamped on 
               mouth. In goes the knife. Deep. He burbles blood. Drops. 
               Before he hits, Charly's already switched from knife to gun 
               and moved on.

               EXT. UNIT 17 - SAME TIME

               Charly appears from the shadows. Ghosts up to the window of 
               #17 and peers in. Scans. Misses nothing. Crosses to the door, 
               taps lightly. Watches the PEEPHOLE, a tiny pinprick of light. 
               Abruptly darkened by a human eye --

               She presses the silenced Beretta to the hole and fires. Sputs 
               of splinters. From behind the door, a muffled thud. She goes 
               to work on the lock.

               BACK WITH HENESSEY - MINUTES HAVE PASSED

               Henessey lies prone, binoculars trained on the motel.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Christ, lady, what are you doing in 
                         there, playing fucking mah-jongg? 
                         *Move*.

               Behind him, a tiny, sharp click--! TIMOTHY has a Skorpion 
               machine pistol aimed at his head.

               The killer speaks into a radio unit, a single word --

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Bogey.

               POP-! go the Kleig lights. BRILLIANCE, blinding -- CATCHES 
               CHARLY coming out of 17. Pins her dead to rights. Unconscious 
               DAUGHTER cradled in her arms. Tiny DOLL cradled in the kid's. 
               Charly runs, as the ground around her erupts like a 
               SHELLBURST.

               TIMOTHY, MEANWHILE, shouting into his walkie-talkie, saying:

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Take her alive, Perkins wants her!

               Henessey watches, helpless and PANICKED, as Charly tumbles 
               BACKWARD. Crashes through a CELLAR ACCESS, it splinters 
               beneath her...! Plunges into blackness.

               INT. CELLAR - PITCH BLACK

               She hits, cushions the kid. Grunt of PAIN... THE DARKNESS 
               EXPLODES into kaleidoscopic FLASHES OF GUNFIRE, Charly strafe 
               it all. Blows through the clip, hits the lights:

               She's killed household items. BRICK WALLS, blasted. Rusty 
               tools, faded signs -- THREE TEN-GALLON GAS CANS which she's 
               managed to PERFORATE, good one, Charly... The gas comes 
               bubbling out on burps and splatters, drenching the floor.

               Charly casts about for an escape route. Set into the brick 
               wall, a huge steel DOOR. She flings it open -- MEAT LOCKER. 
               Nothing there, no help. Eyes darting. Possessed.

               A GRAVELY VOICE wafts down from above, then. Deadly serious:

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         I smell gasoline, you have a little 
                         accident...? I got plenty of matches 
                         up here. Bad way for a kid to go. 
                         Thirty seconds, think it over.

               CHARLY stands in place, mind racing... Caitlin's DOLL. Regards 
               her dully. Plastic smile like it knows a secret. CUT TO:

               INT. MOTEL - 2ND FLOOR - NIGHTTIME

               A MATCH FLARES as it descends into the bowl of a pipe... MR. 
               PERKINS puffs mightily. Turns and favors CHARLY and HENESSEY 
               with a thoughtful gaze, they're handcuffed to radiator... 
               TIMOTHY straddles a nearby chair. Smiles and says:

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Good to have you back again, Chuck.

                                     PERKINS
                         You know, Colonel, you ought really 
                         to have stayed dead. You don't know 
                         the rules of the game anymore.

                                     CHARLY
                         No shit. Eight years ago, you send 
                         me to kill Daedalus and this clown. 
                         Now you're working *with* him.

               He crosses to the fireplace, flips the match inside.

                                     PERKINS
                         Budget cuts, remember? Congress 
                         blinded us in Eastern Europe, Central 
                         America. Across the board, an 
                         intelligence blackout. We had to 
                         recruit any eyes and ears we could 
                         find, even if it meant going to former 
                         targets.

               Pause. Suddenly Charly's eyes go wide. She whispers:

                                     CHARLY
                         Budget cuts... oh, God. Is *that* 
                         what this is about...? The foot 
                         soldiers, the tanker truck... Fuck 
                         me, you're running a fundraiser!!

               Comprehension, dawning. She looks up in disbelief.

                                     CHARLY
                         You'll get all the money you want at 
                         the next budget hearing, won't you...? 
                         All you need is a major terrorist 
                         incident.

                                     PERKINS
                         Interesting theory.

                                     CHARLY
                         Theory, my ass. I think some 
                         terrorists were planning a strike. 
                         Bought supplies from Daedalus, that's 
                         how you knew they were coming...
                              (eyes widening)
                         No way. Don't tell me you're gonna 
                         sit there and let them go through 
                         with it, *just to get a budget 
                         increase*.

               Perkins shrugs philosophically.

                                     PERKINS
                         It's not without precedent. 1993, 
                         remember the World Trade Center 
                         bombing...? The CIA had advance 
                         knowledge, don't think they didn't. 
                         Worse, the diplomat who issued the 
                         terrorist's visa was CIA, they 
                         *facilitated* the bombing. Purely to 
                         justify a budget increase. Of course, 
                         they'd no way of knowing the 
                         terrorists would botch the job.

                                     CHARLY
                         That's not gonna happen this time...?

                                     PERKINS
                         No. This time, the terrorist event 
                         will come off precisely as planned. 
                         This time the terrorists can't muck 
                         it up... because we've killed them 
                         and taken over.

               Charly and Henessey react, startled...

               EXT. MOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHTTIME

               On the move. Our two heroes, shepherded across the compound. 
               Timothy's casualness is belied by the presence of two 
               dyspeptic GUARDS, each keeping a safe distance.

               A POCK-FACED AGENT approaches briskly, RIFLE across his 
               shoulder. Holds out his hand:

                                     POCK
                         Found these buried around the 
                         perimeter.

               Timothy studies it: C-4 CHARGE with remote detonation unit.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Make sure you get all of them.

               The agent rushes off. Timothy looks at Charly reproachfully:

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Chuck, you give me the fuck of my 
                         life then try to stick me, come back 
                         from the dead, whack my boss... No 
                         sense lyin', I'm miffed.

               Moves like lightning. WHACK-! Kidney shot. Charly stumbles, 
               vision going black. Fights for balance. Henessey starts to 
               react but a GUN MUZZLE stops him. Charly straightens. Grits 
               her teeth, says:

                                     CHARLY
                         So what's the plan? What's going out 
                         in the tanker?

               Timothy and the guards exchange looks. Cracking up, they 
               can't believe it -- Charly's not laughing. Looks at Timothy 
               with hooded, lifeless eyes:

                                     CHARLY
                         What's the plan? I'm gonna die, I 
                         wanna know.

               Timothy lights a cigarette. Studies Charly.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         You wanna know the plan?

               He casually points to the neighboring valley, where Christmas 
               lights twinkle.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Santa Claus -- small town U.S.A. 
                         personified. We drive the chemical 
                         tanker in tonight, park it. Add a 
                         catalyst, chain reaction, it goes 
                         hot. We evacuate. The mix heats 
                         overnight, goes critical at 312 
                         degrees Celsius. 8:00 Christmas 
                         morning... Main Street looks like a 
                         meteor strike.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Are you fucking insane? You're talking 
                         about 10,000 people!!

                                     CHARLY
                         Easy, Mitch.
                              (to Timothy)
                         How you gonna blame it on terrorists?

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Those roads are treacherous this 
                         time of year. When we dump a car to 
                         the bottom of a ravine, with the 
                         corpse of Imn Al Rahman in it... get 
                         the picture?

               Pause. Charly summons herself. Her voice a dull rasp:

                                     CHARLY
                         Listen to me, Timothy. Please. Let 
                         my kid go.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Why? For old times' sake...?

               She shakes her head:

                                     CHARLY
                         Goddamn you, *look at her eyes*...

                                     TIMOTHY
                         And why exactly should I do that...?

                                     CHARLY
                              (spits blood)
                         Because they're yours, motherfucker.

               She stares Timothy full in the face.

                                     CHARLY
                         That night in Paris, I got pregnant. 
                         The little girl's your daughter.

               Dead silence. A pause... Then Timothy brays LAUGHTER.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Priceless. Can't believe it...

               Hooting out loud. Tears, streaming... He manages to bring 
               himself under control. Stops, gestures to the CELLAR ACCESS, 
               the dark awaits...

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Kid's down there. What it is, Charly, 
                         they're gonna find you both frozen 
                         to death in the woods. Suicide pact.

               Charly fights to contain herself.

                                     CHARLY
                         She's no risk, Timothy, *let her 
                         go*.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         The freezer's downstairs, Charly. 
                         Let's get it done.

               Charly and Henessey are separated at gunpoint. A look passes 
               between them. Henessey swallows hard.

                                     HENESSEY
                         I'll wait for you to rescue me.

                                     CHARLY
                         Be just a minute.

               Charly goes through the opening.

               INT. CELLAR - SAME TIME

               The same CELLAR she occupied earlier. Timothy behind her, he 
               wrinkles his nose in distaste.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Shit, this place is loaded with fumes, 
                         nobody light a fucking match. You 
                         check her for flammables?

                                     GUN GUARD
                              (shrugs)
                         Checked her for colon cancer.

               Caitlin is sitting in a chair.

               Bundled in flannel, clutching her baby doll, the one Perkins 
               bought for her. She looks up at Charly dully. Sucking her 
               thumb.

                                     CAITLIN
                         Mommy...

               Charly composes herself.

                                     CHARLY
                         Shhhhh. Mommy's here, it's okay. 
                         Safe and snug... what comes next, 
                         huh...? What's the next part?

                                     CAITLIN
                         ...bug in a rug... man with white 
                         hair... says the same thing you say...

               Charly licks her lips. Easy, Charly, keep cool, she mustn't 
               die afraid...

                                     CHARLY
                         We're going to take a nap together, 
                         Cate. You can have your dolly, and 
                         Mommy will be next to you, how's 
                         that? It'll be like bears in winter. 
                         When they get cold, see, they fall 
                         deep, deep asleep...

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Bears, yeah, yeah. Enough.

               He points to the STEEL DOOR of the meat freezer. The guard 
               opens it onto a gleaming silver CHAMBER. Timothy calmly 
               adjusts the thermostat. Sub zero. The guard reaches for 
               Caitlin's doll... Charly snatches it back. Face etched in 
               disgust.

                                     CHARLY
                         You're murdering us both, cocksucker, 
                         let the kid have her fucking dolly.

               He subsides, unable to meet her gaze. At which point, Timothy 
               tosses her the WOODEN BOX.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Chuck, I'm not a total creep. I'll 
                         make you a deal, okay? There's a 
                         knife in that box. Now, you and the 
                         kid, you're going to freeze, *but* -- 
                         if you kill the kid *by your own 
                         hand*...? I won't kill your husband. 
                         Serious. We're gonna open that door 
                         and you'll both be frozen solid, but 
                         I wanna know that you've cut your 
                         own child's throat.

               You don't want to ever be on the receiving end of the LOOK 
               she gives him... Steps into the freezer, holding Caitlin. As 
               the door starts to swing shut, she says:

                                     CHARLY
                         It ain't over, motherfucker. You're 
                         gonna die screaming and I'm gonna 
                         watch. Am I telling the truth...?

               She flashes him her most DAZZLING smile -- The whole room 
               lights up. She can do that. As the door erases her from view, 
               a chill dances up Timothy's spine... because there was nothing 
               resembling doubt on her face.

               INT. CELLAR MEAT LOCKER - SAME TIME

               CHARLY crosses with Caitlin to the far corner.

                                     CAITLIN
                         Mom, it's cold in here-!

                                     CHARLY
                         Shhh. Just for a little bit. Polar 
                         bear, remember?

               Moves. Quick. Methodical. Breaks open the BOX: Sure enough, 
               a hunting knife. Without missing a beat, she crosses to the 
               STEEL DOOR. Kneels and begins DIGGING at the bottom edge. 
               CARVING into the brick, what the hell...?

               INT. UPSTAIRS INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME TIME

               Henessey, by the window. Tied to a chair. Timothy paces before 
               him, carrying three razor-keen SCALPELS. Pegs one into the 
               wall with deadly accuracy.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Tell me where Charly keeps her money. 
                         She must have mentioned it.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Get fucked, you dumb bastard. Charly 
                         called Washington, by morning this 
                         whole place'll be crawling with Feds.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         We'll be gone by then, Mitch.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying, 
                         there's a couple Feds, they couldn't 
                         sleep, said they might come early. 
                         Fuck you, someone'll screw up. Just 
                         watch.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Already did, Mitch, someone already 
                         did. Perkins got stuck with a double 
                         agent, someone trusted, highly placed.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Who?

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Me.
                              (chuckles)
                         Chinks are paying me to bring down 
                         Chapter.

               Henessey reacts, startled. Timothy chuckles:

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Truck goes, hundreds dead -- rescue 
                         teams within minutes, guess what 
                         they find...?

                                     HENESSEY
                         The patsy.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Uh-uh. They find Chapter, caught 
                         with their pants down. See, Mitch, I 
                         dumped in a much faster chemical 
                         catalyst...
                              (beat)
                         The tanker's gonna blow *tonight*. 
                         In the center of town, thirty-five 
                         minutes from now.

               INT. CELLAR MEAT LOCKER - SAME TIME

               CHARLY, sweating at sub zero. Brushes hair from her eyes. 
               Blinks. Still jabbing with the knife, *why the hell is she 
               digging*? Gonna crawl under the damn door? She's gone loopy. 
               Lying flat, she appraises her work --

               A TINY NOTCH. Poked through to the other side. The actual 
               penetration to daylight: millimeters. Then, she does two 
               seemingly nonsensical things: Crosses to Caitlin -- gently 
               takes the doll from her, then:

                                     CHARLY
                         Open.

               Reaches in her mouth. Takes out her RETAINER.

               Must be the temperature. Crosses to the door again. Kneels 
               down. Calmly, with infinite care, takes the retainer...

               Inverts it, now it's *trough*-shaped. Holds it flush against 
               the tiny NOTCH she carved. BABY DOLL, now. Holds it directly 
               above the retainer. Depresses the KNOB in its back:

               It pees gasoline. Gas, trickling down the retainer, through 
               the brick -- into the other ROOM.

               Not much. Enough. She stands. DRAWS A TRAIL with the doll. 
               Crosses, dribbling, over to Caitlin. Hands the doll back to 
               her. What next..?

               She grabs the hunting knife, that's what. RAISES IT HIGH -- 
               One terrifying moment, is she gonna put it in the kid...? 
               Hardly. Brings it down on the floor. Slams it down.

                                     CHARLY
                         Gimme a spark... show me, show me...

               Tries again. And again. STRIKING, over and over. Floor RINGS 
               with the effort --

                                     CHARLY
                         Come on, come on... do it...!

               But in the end, it's just not gonna happen. *Won't work*. 
               Lets go a GROAN of despair:

                                     CHARLY
                         All this, just one fucking match, 
                         *Goddamit*...!

               She collapses forward. Cradles her head in frustration. 
               There's a tiny tap in her shoulder.

                                     CAITLIN
                         Mommy...?

               Charly looks up, face haggard and depleted... Caitlin's eyes, 
               alive again. No longer dulled. Kid reaches inside her CAST 
               and brings out a pack of matches.

                                     CAITLIN
                         Don't cry. I keep these here.
                              (beat)
                         For lighting your candle.

               Charly stares, dumbstruck, at the tiny gift.

               The bitterness, the self-hatred, all of it. Under innocent 
               eyes on Christmas Eve DETONATES, blown sky-high, and she 
               sweeps up her daughter and cradles her, tears streaming...

                                     CHARLY
                         I love you, Caitlin, oh God, do you 
                         know how much I love you...?

               Caitlin pulls back, looks flush in her mother's face.

                                     CAITLIN
                         Am I gonna die...?

               From a dark and cold place, Caitlin has led her home. Charly's 
               eyes, like steel. A harsh whisper:

                                     CHARLY
                         No, baby, you're not gonna die. They 
                         are.

               She strikes a match.

               INT. SECOND STORY INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME TIME

               Henessey, straining against his bonds. Sweating.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Charly's stash. What's the number of 
                         the locker, Mitch...?

                                     HENESSEY
                         Fuck you.

               TIMOTHY across the room, a good forty feet.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Left nut, five bucks I make it.

               Smiling, he raises a scalpel. Eyes dead like a rat's.

               INT. CELLAR MEAT LOCKER - SAME TIME

               The flame hovers above the gasoline trail.

                                     CHARLY
                         When I tell you, scream as loud as 
                         you can, or else your ears'll get 
                         hurt.

               A tiny nod. Charly calmly touches fire to the fuel. Cradles 
               Caitlin to her chest, gently strokes her hair...

                                     CHARLY
                         Hey, should we buy a dog...?

               The flame races across the room. Hits the steel door. And 
               zip! Vanishes through the NOTCH. A pause...

               THE BASEMENT BLOWS SKY-HIGH.

               Wooden walls, obliterated. Boards sheared. Atomized. THE 
               MEAT LOCKER DOOR blows inward like a cannon shot. Holds to 
               its hinges, buckled like JIFFY POP.

               INT. UPSTAIRS INTERROGATION ROOM

               TIMOTHY'S THROW is off target, sticks in Henessey's chair. 
               Between his legs. Inches. Then the assassin LEAVES HIS FEET, 
               look of comic surprise -- as the walls behind him disintegrate 
               in FLAME. Henessey cries out, blinded as

               EXT. MOTEL BUILDING

               He's blown backward OUT THE WINDOW. Chair and all, lofting 
               across the middle distance... blasts through the MOTEL SIGN. 
               Blows it to SPLINTERS. Tumbles, and over end... lands, WHAM. 
               Atop the garage's CORRUGATED ROOF. Chair flies to sticks.

               A BLUE SUIT spins, startled. Gun comes up -- Henessey doesn't 
               miss a beat. Reaches between his legs. Plucks the KNIFE from 
               the wood and slings it...! Guy takes it in the head, drops. 
               Some days you get lucky.

               He looks up in disbelief. FIREBALL, raging to Heaven.

                                     HENESSEY
                         You foxy bitch.

               EXT. BLAST SITE - SAME TIME

               TIMOTHY staggers from the smoke. Nicked and bloodied -- ALIVE. 
               Rushes into the cavernous GARAGE, where blue-suits scuttle 
               like ants. Points to the tanker, face crazed:

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Move it out of here, now!

               EXT. MOTEL GROUNDS - TRAVELING WITH CHARLY - SAME TIME

               Caitlin in tow, SMOKE everywhere. Running flat out across 
               the compound. Eyes ticking back and forth, missing nothing... 
               Sees a gun on the ground, scoops it up: promptly DROPS IT, 
               the fucking thing's red hot.

               That's when the POCK-FACED KILLER lurches out of the smoke, 
               blade arcing for her throat.

                                     CHARLY
                         *Run, Catey*.

               She goes under the blade. SLAMS him. Down they go, hit the 
               dirt -- CAITLIN beats feet, vanishes into the smoke.

               Charly, fighting for her life. Manages to KICK FREE. He rears 
               up. Poised to hurl the KNIFE. Charly, dives, rolls -- scoops 
               up the gun and SCREAMS as her flesh sizzles and it spurts 
               three times and blows him down.

               Doesn't stop. Rips the AUTOMATIC RIFLE from his shoulder. 
               Rummages in his coat -- Cube of C-4. Even better. Casts about, 
               searching the smoke... No sign of her daughter.

               EXT. WOODS - NIGHTTIME

               CAITLIN darts in and out of the trees. Frightened. In the 
               background, men rush back and forth. The MOTEL burns merrily. 
               Then, above the shouts, A RUMBLING noise, she darts a look -- 
               as THE TANKER comes trundling out of the garage.

               POV CAITLIN: Attached to the rear of the truck bed, a bright 
               yellow UTILITY BOX, roughly three by three. As the driver 
               idles, waiting for the road to clear -- Caitlin BREAKS COVER. 
               Runs and climbs inside the box, and meanwhile

               BACK WITH CHARLY - SAME TIME

               Her mother. Crouched behind Timothy's RED JAGUAR. Scans 
               through the rifle's Starlight Scope. Sweating. Intense. We 
               see the landscape, cast in ghostly GREEN.

                                     CHARLY
                         Where'd you go, baby... show Mommy...

               *There*. Bingo. Charly watches through the scope as a TINY 
               GREEN CAITLIN climbs into the box and shuts the lid. 
               Unfortunately, a nearby blue-suit has WITNESSED this. He 
               looks around, stabbing a finger at the box:

                                     NOSY BLUE-SUIT
                         Hey. Hey, you see that? A little kid --

               A bullet slams him backward in a cut-string sprawl.

               WITH CHARLY

               She lowers the rifle. Nods grimly:

                                     CHARLY
                         Smart girl, honey. Stay still. Don't 
                         make a sound. Snug as a bug in a 
                         rug...

               MEANWHILE, ELSEWHERE ON THE GROUNDS

               HENESSEY, on the move. Crouched low. Choking on woodsmoke, 
               eyes streaming. Up ahead, a splayed CORPSE -- He hunkers 
               over the poor schmuck, guy's good for a radio. Snatches up 
               the portable unit. Fumbles with the dial, searching for 26.9 
               megahertz...

               EXT. CLIFFSIDE - HIGH ABOVE MOTEL - SAME TIME

               CHARLY slews to a stop in the red Jag. Leaps out. Darts along 
               the cliff, throws herself flat. Peering down at the grounds, 
               sniper rifle positioned -- Babysitting the tanker.

               HEARS HENESSEY... Calling to her on the radio.

                                     HENESSEY (V.O.)
                         Charly, you there? Hello, Charly.

               Grabs the unit from her belt:

                                     CHARLY
                         Mitch! I don't believe it. Listen, 
                         if you say, "Are we having fun yet" 
                         I'll rip your nuts off. Where are 
                         you?

                                     HENESSEY
                         Behind the big garage. Is Caitlin 
                         with you?

                                     CHARLY
                         No, but she's safe for the moment, 
                         she stowed away on the tanker truck.

               Henessey draws a sharp breath. Swallows, says:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Charly, Timothy rigged the tanker to 
                         go off early. We got fifteen minutes. 
                         No more.

               On her reaction we CUT TO:

               EXT. MOUNTAIN ROADSIDE - WITH TANKER AND EN TOURAGE

               Beside the tanker, A PANEL TRUCK sits, engine idling. Phony 
               logo on its side -- *Little Debbie* snack cakes. A RAMP is 
               lowered, and a CAR begins backing up into the truckbed, facing 
               outwards.

               INSIDE THE TRUCKBED, harried blue-suits hurriedly unwrap the 
               frost-covered corpse of IMN AL RAHMAN -- and place him behind 
               the wheel.

               MEANWHILE, AT THE BACK OF THE TANKER

               A blue-suit puts a PADLOCK on the utility box as he passes. 
               SNAPS IT SHUT.

               BACK WITH HENESSEY - SAME TIME

               He hears two flat CRACK-!s on the still air.

                                     HENESSEY
                         Hello...! Charly...?

               Even over the receiver, her desperation's apparent:

                                     CHARLY
                         Tires won't pop, Mitch. Bastard just 
                         locked her in, she's stuck in there 
                         and they're leaving, *Goddammit*!

               Henessey rubs his eyes. Takes several deeps breaths, mind 
               turning it over. He looks up. Tired. Haunted.

                                     HENESSEY
                         All right, I'll go in and get her, 
                         you watch my back.

                                     CHARLY
                         No chance. I make it twelve, Mitch, 
                         automatic weapons.

                                     HENESSEY
                         So kill 'em for me, bitch, Christ, 
                         what are you good for?

               He stuffs a fresh clip in the gun. Wipes away sweat.

                                     HENESSEY
                              (to himself)
                         C'mon, buddy. Do one thing right, 
                         just this once... please...

               Closes his eyes. Gathers himself. Long pause...

                                     HENESSEY
                         Piece of cake.

               He leaps from the roof and makes a death run.

               Gun in one hand, radio in the other. Swerving and dodging 
               like a broken-field runner, CHARLY in his ear screaming:

                                     CHARLY (V.O.)
                         *Your nine, on your nine*!

               He spins, BLASTS AWAY, dead guy, pitching forward -- SMOKE, 
               billowing, making him COUGH...

                                     CHARLY (V.O.)
                         *30 degrees left, Mitch. Left*.
                              (beat)
                         *Your other left*.

               Stumbling, catching himself. Barreling forward.

                                     CHARLY (V.O.)
                         *Nix, nix, I can't see in there, 
                         don't do it, break right...*!

               He breaks right.

                                     CHARLY (V.O.)
                         *Fuck me, I was wrong, get outta 
                         threre*!

               He staggers out of the smoke: TWO MEN, MP-5 machine guns. 
               Trained on his chest. He struggles to aim, oh, shit -- Two 
               distant CRACKS. The bad men go away, catapulted backwards. 
               Henessey shouts into the radio:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Gracias.

                                     CHARLY (V.O.)
                         *De nada*.

               UP ABOVE, ON THE HILL

               CHARLY fires shot after shot. Every time she squeezes the 
               trigger, someone dies. No such thing as wounded, we're talking 
               St. Peter looks up from a magazine and says holy shit, it's 
               the lunch rush at Kate Mantilini's.

               BACK DOWN BELOW

               The smoke clears and Mitch sees the tanker. Right there, 
               thirty yards away. Yellow UTILITY BOX. No one in the way.

                                     CHARLY (V.O.)
                         *End run, Mitch, go wide*!

               He breaks for the truck.

                                     CHARLY (V.O.)
                         *No, Goddamn you, they got you 
                         flanked...*!

               Everybody fires a gun.

               MITCH GETS HIT

               Takes one high in the chest, SPINS him...!

               UP ON THE HILL

               CHARLY SPRAYS on full auto, DICES TO TATTERS the combat zone, 
               extinguishing the gunmen, too little too late because

               MITCH IS IN DEEP

               BAM--! bullet takes out his right arm, fuck *you*, buddy, 
               doesn't miss a beat, simply tosses the gun over to the other 
               hand and KEEPS SHOOTING, blows that fucker down and now he's 
               staggering into the trees, and collapses, and HITS... And 
               lies very still and bleeds. As ECHOES of gunfire die slowly, 
               we HEAR:

                                     HENESSEY (V.O.)
                         Dear Ma: I'm looking at the ants, 
                         they're pretty great. Some really 
                         funny ants here, Ma. All these funny 
                         ants, think I'll stay and watch 'em 
                         awhile...

               UP ON THE HILL

               Aftermath... Charly's out of ammo. Flings aside the rifle, 
               snarling in a helpless rage -- Something else, then. SOUND, 
               nearby. Building in pitch, reaching a crescendo --

               A SCREAMING CHOPPER RISES BEHIND HER.

               Crests the cliff and hovers like the SWORD OF DAMOCLES.

               INT. CHOPPER - SAME TIME

               MARKSMAN, riding shotgun. Scans the cliff below: Thick 
               evergreens. Charly, somewhere among them. He sights down his 
               rifle, takes careful aim -- BLOWS OUT TIRES on the Jaguar. 
               Cripples it. The chopper BANKS, heading away.

               BACK WITH CHARLY - SAME TIME

               In big trouble. MANY HEADLIGHTS, bouncing uphill toward her. 
               Cut off, they've cut her off -- The other direction ain't 
               much better: A 200 FOOT DROP. Straight down. Evergreen trees, 
               far below. Power lines. Highway.

               She hears the PHONE RINGING, then... inside the Jag. Crosses 
               slowly. Reaches in, lifts the receiver. It's TIMOTHY.

                                     TIMOTHY (V.O.)
                         I tried to give you a pretty death, 
                         baby. Did my best. Now you're fucked, 
                         now it's ground beef time.

                                     CHARLY
                         The truck. How long til it blows?

                                     TIMOTHY
                              (incredulous)
                         Sweet Loretta, you're another animal 
                         entirely. Let's see, 312 degrees... 
                         Make it ten minutes, give or take.

                                     CHARLY
                         Then I better hurry.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Oh, spare me. You made a big noise 
                         and bought five more minutes on the 
                         planet. Give up. Die. I'll spit in 
                         what's left of your face.

               He clicks off. Charly drops the receiver. Turns, looks behind: 
               They're coming for her.

               Woods filled with headlights. Backlit FIGURES. Ducking in 
               and out of the trees, getting closer... The wind blows. Bitter 
               cold out here in the dark night of the soul. Nothing left. 
               No hope. No reason.

               Caitlin, dead.

               The rage explodes in the form of a kick which SHATTERS the 
               lock on the trunk. *Dammit*, she needs a fucking miracle.

               At that moment, the trunk lid slowly rises, CREAKING... 
               Revealing all of Timothy's BUNJEE JUMPING EQUIPMENT.

               EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - SAME TIME

               The TANKER is rolling. Out onto the road, snorting and 
               belching. Preceded by the Little Debbie PANEL TRUCK.

               INT. UTILITY BOX - ON TANKER - SAME TIME

               Poor little Caitlin huddles in the dark. All alone. ROARING 
               in her ears. Sort of like being underwater.

               EXT. TANKER TRUCK - CLOSE ON UNDERBELLY

               A silver device attached to the skin of the tank.

               WITH TIMOTHY - CROSSING THE SMOKE-FILLED GROUNDS

               He consults a tiny, liquid crystal display on his watch. Red 
               numerals. *178 degrees*.

               EXT. CLIFF'S EDGE - WITH CHARLY

               She won't quit. Busy now, deftly sticking the wad of C-4 
               EXPLOSIVE to the bottom of the Jaguar. Straightens. Turns 
               around --

               Stands dead calm as they all come out of the TREES, guns 
               drawn... Raises her hands, see, boys...? No bang-bang.

               Like backlit monsters, they approach, hulking. Matter of 
               yards, now... She flashes a naughty little smile --

               Goes backward off the cliff and rockets earthward.

               200 feet of open air, THE BUNJEE Cord pays out, fast...! 
               Whipsaws out the door of the Jaguar, hooked by carabiner to 
               the STEERING COLUMN and meanwhile

               THE CHAPTER AGENTS

               Rush forward, incredulous. Peer OVER THE EDGE: Below them, a 
               swan diver, BLACKNESS all around. She drops like a stone. 
               Vanishes into the fog, beautiful as a poem.

               INSIDE THE JAGUAR: The cord goes taut -- Now it starts to 
               stretch outward. DECELERATION kicking in, Charly can FEEL 
               it, still whistling through space...

               Hits a dead stop.

               This is it. Cord, stretched as far as it goes.

               She's still sixty feet above the highway.

               No hesitation whatsoever. She thumbs the DETONATOR in her 
               right fist --

               Blows the car.

               UP ABOVE - CLIFF'S EDGE

               The Jaguar goes up with a solid CRUMP--! Blown off the edge 
               of the cliff. Along with a half dozen screaming AGENTS.

               BACK WITH CHARLY - FALLING

               Lifeline cut. 60 feet above the road, no problem. She does 
               thirty feet in freefall. Raises her left hand --

               Slaps a carabiner on a passing POWER LINE. Hurtles downward 
               until suddenly, KA-CHUK--! She LURCHES to a stop.

               Doesn't miss a beat: Grips a rope and GLIDES the last thirty 
               feet, touches down lightly. Unhooks herself, turns as AN 
               ONCOMING CAR throws a fishtail SKID, just misses her. Driver 
               SWEARS.

               She raises her gun. Fires without blinking.

               Puts a hole in the passenger side windshield and the DRIVER 
               ain't sticking around, he's out the door and gone as

               CHARLY THE EXTERMINATOR

               Crosses to the car, face a stone mask. Behind her the FLAMING 
               JAGUAR SMASHES to the ground, raining fragments -- Followed 
               by BURNING CORPSES, smacking the pavement one after another. 
               She doesn't even look. Gets behind the wheel. Leaves most of 
               her tires on the road behind her.

               EXT. MAIN STREET - TOWN OF SANTA CLAUS - CHRISTMAS EVE

               Milling crowds. Music and laughter. SANTA heads up a TEEMING 
               PARADE down Main Street, atop a horse-drawn sleigh... Replay 
               of the film's opening, as

               EXT. STREET - SAME TIME

               The gleaming TANKER roars down a sidestreet. Riding point: 
               the innocuous PANEL TRUCK.

               The temperature gauge continues to RISE: *203 degrees*.

               EXT. MAIN STREET - EDGE OF TOWN - SAME TIME

               Charly runs a roadblock, doing fifty -- Someone put a PARADE 
               in front of her. Hits the BRAKES...! Fishtales into a mailbox. 
               Sends it flying through a plate glass window. Out of the 
               car, gun held low, and meanwhile --

               INT. CAR - DRIVING

               TIMOTHY barks orders into a mic:

                                     TIMOTHY
                         All units converge. Divert local 
                         law, this is a government matter. 
                         Brook no interference, I want the 
                         Baltimore woman eliminated. *Where's 
                         the fucking chopper*?

               Racing toward the edge of town and meanwhile

               ON THE PARADE ROUTE

               SANTA CLAUS himself perches atop his sleigh, feeling like a 
               rock star and wishing his groupies were legal... when suddenly 
               he's got company.

                                     CHARLY
                         I'm the Missus. Drive.

               The rogue colonel FIRES A SHOT in the air -- THE HORSES bolt. 
               Plunging off the parade route amid SCREAMS as

               INT. PLUSH LIMO - SAME TIME

               MR. PERKINS hunkers forward, face slack, as a tinny VOICE 
               issues from his headset mic:

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         ...yes, she's with Santa Claus, 
                         correct, er, excuse me, the individual 
                         *playing* Santa, er... they're 
                         pursuing the tanker truck, sir.

               Perkins stares straight ahead, speechless.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - HEADING OUT OF TOWN

               SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE TANKER. Horses at full gallop, hooves 
               in pounding frenzy. Charly tries to JUMP from one to the 
               other -- no go, the tanker pulls away, widening the distance, 
               and meanwhile

               TWO GOVERNMENT SEDANS

               Come whipping out of ALLEYS, fall in behind them. CRACK--! 
               Gunshots, shattering the stillness.

               EXT. TRUCK CHASSIS - SAME TIME

               A RICOCHET whines off a hydraulic cable. Spurt of fluid as 
               the BRAKES start to go, and meanwhile

               BACK ON THE SLEIGH

               CHARLY throws herself flat next to Santa.

                                     CHARLY
                         Sorry, man. Government agents, high 
                         level conspiracy.

                                     SANTA
                         Fuckin' government.

               The SEDANS jockey for position, try to pull ABREAST -- Charly 
               swerves the sleigh back and forth, won't let them through. 
               She hands the reigns to Santa.

                                     CHARLY
                         Veer left.

                                     SANTA
                         Away from the truck?

                                     CHARLY
                         Do it. In five seconds I'm gonna own 
                         that fucking truck.

               Santa complies. PEELS OFF to the left -- Opens a TWELVE FOOT 
               chasm between sleigh and tanker. Sure enough, one of the 
               government cars spurts forward to fill the gap, comes ABREAST 
               of them. It's what she wanted.

               *FIVE SECONDS*:

               Charly Baltimore LEAPS from the sleigh, lands atop the 
               government car. Skips lightly across it, casually BLOWS TWO 
               SHOTS through the ROOF. Down through the metal. Drilling 
               into their heads. Driver and passenger, killed instantly --

               As Charly hops nimbly from her 50 mile-an-hour STEPPING STONE. 
               Over to the tanker. Dump-stuffs a new clip, as

               THE CORPSE CAR

               Fades from the race, driverless. Whipping out of control. 
               FISHTAILS away behind them -- Takes out the SECOND CHASE 
               CAR, spray of metal.

               Three seconds, and Charly's taken out two pursuers.

               INT. CAB OF TANKER TRUCK - SAME TIME

               The door files open and the DRIVER sees CHARLY. Bloody. 
               Demonic. Wisely leaps out, BOUNCES from view -- Charly snags 
               his hat as he goes by, plops it on her head. SWINGS UP into 
               the drivers' seat, double-clutches -- pours on the steam.

               Five seconds. She owns the tanker.

               BLASTS forward into the lead PANEL TRUCK. Slams the truck 
               from behind, BULLDOZES it -- Sends it THUNDERING into a park 
               bench. Glass sprays.

               She owns the road. On the seat beside her: an MP-5 machine 
               gun. She's set. Throws a NINETY DEGREE turn onto a sidestreet. 
               Donates most of her tires to New York.

               INT. SPEEDING TANKER TRUCK - SANTA CLAUS - NIGHT

               Charly's on fire. Senses heightened. Eyes tick back and forth 
               like a machine. Heading downhill, out of town...

                                     CHARLY
                         Hang on, Catey.

               She hits the brakes. A flash of SPARKS..! A ripping WHINE, 
               dies away -- The brake pedal is all play. Nothing. She's in 
               a runaway truck.

                                     CHARLY
                         *No, not fair, not fucking fair...*!

               Barreling onward. A lunging behemoth.

                                     CHARLY
                         Can't stop, Catey, can't...

               CHAIN-LINK FENCE, at road's end. Beyond it, a quarter-mile 
               plunge. Downhill over rocky terrain --

               To St. PETER'S SEMINARY. Looming stone structure. Closed 
               now. Vast empty PARKING LOT.

               Tears on her cheeks. Lights a cigarette. Takes a long drag, 
               exhales:

                                     CHARLY
                         Suck my dick, every one of you 
                         bastards...

               Blows through the chain-link fence.

               SHUDDERS AND LEAPS DOWNHILL. Mud blows skyward. Trees, blasted 
               to splinters.

               CAITLIN

               Buffeted inside the UTILITY BOX. Cries out as

               IN THE CAB

               Charly fights to contain the beast. "Fuck you," slyly retorts 
               the beast. She BOUNCES and caroms off the sides like a mad 
               pinball --

               THE TRUCK SMASHES DOWN

               And all the windows BLOW OUT concussively and the front tires 
               go with a volcano CRACK-! as the beast goes canting to one 
               side, ponderous, MASSIVE...

               It keels over on its side. Still doing fifty.

               TRAVERSES THE PARKING LOT.

               Slows itself by TAKING OUT LIGHT POLES, shears them off like 
               saplings.

               Whacks the side of the chapel. IMPACT. Keeps going...

               Charly is EJECTED from the cab. Pinwheels through space like 
               a broken doll, bursts through a STAINED GLASS WINDOW.

               INT. CHAPEL

               The glass ruptures as she catapults through. Hits on her 
               stomach, bounces. Slides to a stop, rolls over --

               FLINGS herself aside just in time, as a towering ST. PETER 
               SMASHES to earth an inch from her head, showers marble...!

               Concussion dies away. Silence. Echoes.

               EXT. SEMINARY GROUNDS - SAME TIME

               The tanker slides, DETONATING planters one by one... Comes 
               to rest in a central COURTYARD. Lies there, a hissing 
               dinosaur.

               TIMOTHY'S TEMPERATURE GAUGE is still affixed to the truck's 
               underbelly: *280 degrees*.

               INT. CHAPEL - WITH CHARLY

               Charly, semi-conscious. Rolls onto her back, gasping. Stares 
               at the gathered saints. Swallows hard. Sucking it up, 
               preparing. Rolls to one knee, plants her foot...

               She's got to make that truck.

               On her feet now. Stumbling forward. One arm hugging her guts. 
               Cross-eyed, so hard to focus... left foot, right foot, get 
               it done, bitch, yes it's *supposed* to hurt that much, flings 
               open the door and she's so brave that for a second we think 
               she might make it.

               Timothy kicks her in the head.

               Charly flies back. Hits and SLIDES. Fetches up against a 
               bannister, WHAM--! Timothy calmly shuts the door behind him. 
               Consults his tiny gauge -- *297 degrees*.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Call it four minutes to detonation. 
                         I got a chopper on the way, lots of 
                         time.

               He sheds his coat. Stows his gun. Removes a SWITCHBLADE. 
               Drapes the coat on the bannister. Flicks open the knife.

                                     CHARLY
                         Oh, honey. Only four inches...?

                                     TIMOTHY
                         You'll feel me.

               He approaches, almost casually. Charly staggers erect. Adopts 
               a killing stance. Instinct. She can barely stand.

               INT. PERKINS' LIMOUSINE - SAME TIME

               PERKINS hears a garbled, pained voice over his headset:

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Point team leader, reporting... 
                         She's... incapacitated the truck... 
                         I'm damaged, sir, I believe I'm 
                         dying... Instructions...?

                                     PERKINS
                         Continue dying. Out.

               He leans back. Stares sightlessly. Loosens his tie, hits the 
               intercom and says:

                                     PERKINS
                         Anthony, get me the President...

               He takes out a bottle of Scotch. CUT TO:

               INT. CHAPEL - SAME TIME

               Charly and Timothy. They circle, two pros.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         You've lost a step, Chuck. Muscles 
                         never recovered from C-section, I'll 
                         bet. Am I right?

               Never watching the eyes, the eyes are liars, they watch the 
               HANDS... The gathered saints look on, neutral.

                                     CHARLY
                         Please, man... She's only... eight... 
                         she's a beautiful little girl...

               His concentration never falters as he says:

                                     TIMOTHY
                         She's a worthless bitch. I know it 
                         'cause she came out of me.

               He LUNGES with the knife, she spins away -- He gets hold of 
               one arm and FLINGS her, up and over...! She SAILS through 
               space. Twists in mid-air. Lands like a cat. Almost. Staggers 
               forward. They circle...

                                     TIMOTHY
                         It's called shock, Charly... Your 
                         body wants to go into shock...

                                     CHARLY
                         Fuck you, your breathing's lousy...

               Charly LAUNCHES herself. Avoids a stab at her throat, eats 
               that for breakfast, spins, slams the knuckles of her right 
               hand into Timothy's ribs. Busts one. He snarls, TRAPS her 
               wrist: CRACK! Wrist, broken. She HISSES in pain, falls back 
               GASPING.

               Circling again. Charly cannot walk a straight line.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Look at you. You're out of your 
                         motherfucking league, dearie.

               CLOSE ON CHARLY

               She looks up at him from sunken eyes shot through with red, 
               and in those eyes we glimpse it; the DEMON, laughing... as 
               Charly whispers:

                                     CHARLY
                         ...You want a piece...? Take my 
                         shoulder.

               He lunges with the knife...! She ducks, trips on purpose and 
               HANDS HIM HER SHOULDER, all that's missing is the plate --

               And WHAM. In goes the knife, cuts deep and Charly looks him 
               in the eye and GRINS because sure enough, there's the 
               bastard's KNEE, wide open...

               Boot-strikes, BAM--! Shears the knee, and Timothy HOWLS in 
               agony. Stumbles backward into the bannister --

               Grabs his coat. Brings out the gun, it GOES OFF--!

               Charly dives for cover. Rips the knife from her own shoulder 
               and flings it.

               Takes him in the shoulder. Topples him back. BANNISTER. Up 
               and over, flailing...! Drops from sight.

               Charly falls back. Pause. Sucking air. Sits down hard. Legs 
               splayed. Looks down at herself, oh, God...

               There's a hole in her chest.

               EXT. SEMINARY - NIGHTTIME

               The doors burst open and here she comes. Trauma, severe. 
               Shock, blood loss -- She makes for the tanker. For her kid. 
               Hitches. Staggers. Going on sheer guts.

               THE HELICOPTER ROARS OVERHEAD

               The PILOT brandishes his radio mic:

                                     PILOT
                         Got her. Heading for the tanker, 
                         thirty yards out. She's all over the 
                         place, something's wrong with her.

               WITH CHARLY

               Left foot, right foot, she's not running, she's falling in a 
               straight line -- Reaches the tanker. Staggers against the 
               inverted chassis. UTILITY BOX. Above her.

                                     CHARLY
                         *Cover your ears*.

               She raises her gun. Fires. BAM-! Lock springs to pieces. 
               CAITLIN tumbles to the pavement, dazed and confused. Casts 
               about --

                                     CAITLIN
                         MOMMY...!

               She springs to her feet. Comes running and flings both arms 
               around her mother. HUGS HER -- That one puts Charly out for 
               a few seconds. PAIN, excruciating. Comes to her senses, 
               swaying like a clothesline in a high wind...

                                     CHARLY
                         Run... get out...

                                     CAITLIN
                         Don't go away again, Please...!

               Charly grabs Caitlin's head. Turns it. Facing the TEMPERATURE 
               GAUGE. Red numerals: *301 degrees*.

                                     CHARLY
                         The truck's a bomb... gonna blow up, 
                         RUN... I'm right behind you, go...

               Caitlin hovers, torn. Charly summons a gutteral CROAK:

                                     CHARLY
                         ...*Go and don't look back*...

               In the end, Caitlin relents. RUNS, toward the surrounding 
               woods... Charly watches her go. Nods, satisfied -- Collapses. 
               Hits the tarmac and splays in a heap. Breath wheezing in and 
               out. Already the pavement is staining red.

               WITH CAITLIN

               As, within ten seconds of the command, she promptly DISOBEYS 
               her mother, looks back -- Stops dead.

               There's a corpse underneath the truck.

               It isn't moving. It isn't breathing. It isn't laughing or 
               crying...

               Or hurting, not anymore.

                                     CAITLIN
                         *Mommy, no...*!

               Bomb forgotten. Danger forgotten. Her tiny arms pumping, 
               feet slapping pavement -- She returns to her mother. Grabs 
               one knife-bloodied shoulder, oblivious of the wound. Jerks 
               back and forth. Frenzied.

                                     CAITLIN
                         It's okay. I'm sorry I left, please 
                         wake up, come on please...

               CHARLY. Cheek against the pavement. One lifeless eye STARES. 
               Bloodshot and sightless.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Government vehicles, pulling up now. At the edge of the 
               parking lot. 100 yards away, give or take. Numerous SEDANS. 
               The Little Debbie panel truck. AGENTS crouch behind cars. 
               Weapons trained on the wounded behemoth.

               EXT. SEMINARY - SAME TIME

               The side door BURSTS OUTWARD and a limping figure emerges, 
               frantically signaling for the chopper: TIMOTHY'S got murder 
               in his eye. THE CHOPPER banks, coming in low as he hauls 
               himself aboard.

                                     PILOT
                         Sir, your shoulder --

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Fuck the shoulder, knee's worse. 
                         Just bring me around and hold her 
                         steady. I'm not leaving until I know 
                         the bitch is dead.

               He grabs an automatic rifle.

               BACK WITH CAITLIN - UNDERNEATH THE TANKER

               She adheres to Charly's motionless form. Looking small and 
               terrified. Whispers in her mother's ear. Soft and low:

                                     CAITLIN
                         Mommy, get up now. You just stop it, 
                         Mommy, you stop being a little baby. 
                         Stop it, you're not dead, I know 
                         you're not dead so you get up now.

               Face contorted, she strikes out. Flails. HITS Charly.

                                     CAITLIN
                         *Don't you die*, you get up now, 
                         Goddammit...! Life is pain, you just 
                         get used to it, and stand up *right 
                         this minute*, Mommy. Life is pain, 
                         do it, you bitch. *Do it*.

               Tears coursing in rivulets. Little fists clenched. Then -- 
               It might be a trick of the wind. Tiny aspiration, not enough 
               breath to fog a mirror...

                                     CHARLY
                         ...mommy... here...

               A solitary tear appears in the wide-open staring eye. One 
               fingernail, then. Scratches feebly. Toes, shifting. Seeking 
               purchase. A HAND, planting itself... TEETH BARED, a rictus 
               of pain... Rising up...

               *Standing*. Full height now, flexing one deadly arm. She 
               hugs her daughter and says:

                                     CHARLY
                         ...You're grounded...

               Overhead, the HOWLING of rotor blades. Charly gasps for 
               breath. Cracks open the GUN... no bullets. Swell. Scans the 
               pavement... There. THE MP-5 machine gun lies twenty feet 
               from her. Twenty miles, same difference. Across the pavement, 
               even farther away: Timothy's car.

               *305 degrees*. Charly swallows hard:

                                     CHARLY
                         I'm gonna get the gun, you run for 
                         that car. We go on three, okay? One... 
                         Two... *Three*.

               They break cover. Into the open. A WITHERING FIRE ERUPTS. 
               Right at their feet...! Geysers of asphalt, shot skyward --

               TIMOTHY sprays the blacktop from above. Ruthless. Charly 
               goes insane. Lurches, crazed, to the cab of the truck. Thumbs 
               the mike and says:

                                     CHARLY
                         Somebody get that motherfucker off 
                         me! I got a kid here, I got my eight 
                         year-old daughter, *Jesus Christ*...! 
                         It's Christmas Eve, who are you 
                         *people*, fucking pull him off! Do 
                         you hear me...?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EYES SNAP OPEN IN DARKNESS. We don't know whose they are. We 
               don't know where we are.

               BACK WITH CHARLY - SAME TIME

               The temperature gauge: *308 degrees*. She clutches Caitlin. 
               Shouting into the mic:

                                     CHARLY
                         Distract him, for God's sake give me 
                         ten seconds, please, I'm begging 
                         somebody, anybody, *she's my 
                         daughter*...!

               EXT. EDGE OF PARKING LOT

               A sour-looking CHAPTER AGENT stands before a row of cars and 
               the Little Debbie panel truck. Expressionless beaurocrat. 
               Lifts the mic to his lips and says:

                                     CHAPTER BEAUROCRAT
                         Negative, ma'am, we understand your 
                         request, but we've decided to go 
                         ahead and let this play out...

               Behind him, the back of the panel truck EXPLODES. A car 
               CATAPULTS outward into space -- SMASHES DOWN atop two sedans. 
               Blows out their windshields. Flings itself to the pavement 
               and RICOCHETS forward, zero to sixty.

               MITCH HENESSEY

               At the wheel. Making a suicide run. Face a FRIGHT MASK of 
               deadly purpose. We have no idea why someone who looks like 
               him is alive.

               INT. HELICOPTER - SAME TIME

               *Distraction*, just enough: The pilot banks toward the CAR.

                                     TIMOTHY
                         Where are *you* going??

               Timothy grabs the stick -- THAT'S WHEN CHARLY BREAKS COVER. 
               Does a MAD STAGGER across the blacktop. Goes for the GUN.

               TIMOTHY CHANGES DIRECTION. Chopper again, SCREAMING in low 
               and fast --

               CHARLY dives, rolls -- Comes up with the MACHINE GUN and 
               falls flat on her back, points it skyward:

                                     CHARLY
                         Suck on it.

               She fires. Blows the chopper's TAIL ROTOR. The craft pitches 
               to the side -- Dumps Timothy out the door. Flailing.

               Head over heels, he FALLS -- Lands atop the TANKER, right on 
               the silver tank and *burns*. Actually SIZZLES at 310 degrees 
               Celsius, steam pouring off him like a vampire in daylight, 
               SHRIEKING--!

                                     CHARLY
                         Die screaming, motherfucker.

               She watches as he slips from sight... off the tanker. SIRENS 
               now, approaching. Wind, biting cold. Ground black and bloody 
               in the moonlight...

               HERE COMES HENESSEY, powers across the lot, pedal to the 
               metal. Followed at a distance of fifty yards by half a dozen 
               squawling GOVERNMENT VEHICLES, flashers turning.

               Henessey stomps the brake. SLEWS to a stop, tires cooking...! 
               KICKS open the passenger door as Charly collapses into the 
               car, CAITLIN in her arms. The kid says:

                                     CAITLIN
                         Hurry! The truck is a bomb!

                                     HENESSEY
                         Yeah, yeah. What else, we got a 
                         fucking lightning rod on the roof...? 
                         No, Caitlin, *don't check*.

               He PEELS OUT.

                                     CHARLY
                         Hey... you're bleeding...

                                     HENESSEY
                         I think that's yours...

                                     CHARLY
                         Right, sorry...

               He inadvertently smacks a light pole. SPARKS fly.

                                     CAITLIN
                         *You're a bad driver! Who said you 
                         could drive*?

               EXT. PARKING LOT - BESIDE THE TANKER - SAME TIME

               They have to drag Timothy inside the car. The engine ROARS 
               as it leaps forward, trailing the other FIVE -- Scarred and 
               hideous, he stares after Charly, screaming:

                                     TIMOTHY
                         *Somebody do her, somebody kill that 
                         fucking whore, kill her*!

               That's when the helicopter crashes. The pilot does everything 
               but flap his arms -- Forget it. IT KEELS OVER. Rotor touches 
               pavement -- Blows to pieces. They ALL go. Snapped off. Blown 
               like rockets in every direction.

               TIMOTHY LOOKS UP as a rotor blade whistles right through the 
               windshield of his car. Shears off his HEAD. Blows out the 
               BACK in a shower of glass and hurtles onward, SPINNING out 
               of control...

               Strikes the tanker. Boom.

               Imagine God in Monte Carlo. Tossing dice the length of a 
               craps table. Now, imagine the dice are BURNING CARS.

               EXT. EDGE OF PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

               Henessey flies out of the parking lot and INTO the WOODS as 
               the firestorm RAGES TO HEAVEN behind him. Cars, heading his 
               way -- AIRBORNE. Fights the wheel, swerving through the woods 
               as all around him, FLAMING CARS crash down. BOUNCING into 
               and out of the trees, peekaboo...

               Some go flying past OVERHEAD. Striking in front like meteors, 
               GOUGING the earth. Caitlin screams:

                                     CAITLIN
                         Don't hit the cars!

               Henessey favors her with a foul look. CHARLY looks up and 
               sees ANGELS flying overhead, trailing concrete...

               Then they're OUT OF THE WOODS. Car slingshots onto the highway 
               and races forward, SAFE. Behind it, the sky is aglow, SNOWING 
               fiery traces... Bits of earth, trees, pavement.

               OVERHEAD VIEW: As they roar out of town, we see burning woods 
               and a CRATER approximately 150 yards in diameter -- St. 
               Peter's Seminary no longer exists... CUT TO:

               EXT. ROADSIDE - OUTSIDE OF TOWN - NIGHTTIME

               Henessey coasts to the side of the road and stops. He lays 
               his head on the steering wheel, sucking air. Looks at Charly:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Sorry, can't drive... Are you okay...?

                                     CHARLY
                              (grimaces)
                         ...Are you... stupid...?

                                     HENESSEY
                         ...funny thing...? You aren't going 
                         to die... I am...

               Charly offers him that soft, sad little smile.

                                     CHARLY
                         I know.

               Henessey starts to fade... breathing labored... Reaches up... 
               strokes Caitlin's hair. Smiles at her:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Hey, gorgeous... know something... 
                         you got your mother's eyes... don't 
                         let... nobody tell you different...

               Slumps back in the seat. Gazing at Charly. A single tear 
               runs from one bloodshot eye. He whispers:

                                     HENESSEY
                         Scared... to be nobody... without a 
                         ripple... please... remember me...
                              (beat)
                         ...Love you...

               Dies.

               Charly leans on the dash. Cries for awhile. For herself... 
               for Henessey... for this Godawful planet, and everything 
               else. DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. FARMHOUSE - SAME TIME

               A MOTHER SITS in the glow of a Winnie the Pooh nightlight. 
               Next to her sleeping daughter's bed -- back to the very 
               beginning of the film, it's been a long kiss goodnight.

               An elderly FARMER pokes his head in. She doesn't look up.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Um, Ma'am...? Ambulance is here. 
                         They'll be right in.

               The shadowy figure nods... Remains seated. Stays awhile in 
               the dark. Keeping vigil. Snow slithers against the glass.

                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. PALATIAL GEORGETOWN ESTATE - EARLY MORNING

               MR. PERKINS emerges from a guest cottage, flanked by his 
               aide Harry.

                                     AIDE
                         ...They'll push for dismantlement of 
                         our apparatus in Chile, but we've 
                         got a degree of plausible 
                         deniability...

               Harry's FOOT comes down on a circular slab of STONE -- and a 
               voice from the grave says:

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Stay very still.

               Stops him in his tracks, stops him dead --

               As CHARLY BALTIMORE steps from the nearby trees. Stands, 
               twenty yards downrange. Beretta leveled at both of them.

               Two months, you barely notice the limp. She stands there in 
               sleeveless top and short skirt and looks like a million. 
               Thumbs a metal box, click-! A red ARMING LIGHT blinks on.

                                     CHARLY
                         Good morning, I'm Charly. The slab 
                         you're standing on is actually a 
                         land mine. Keep your foot on the 
                         pressure plate, nothing happens. 
                         Step off the stone, we'll all be 
                         wearing you.

               PERKINS steps forward. The gun shifts. Targets him.

                                     PERKINS
                         Charly, I know we've treated you 
                         poorly, please, it was just business --

               She reaches in a pocket. Tosses him a cellular phone -- He 
               catches it as though it were a live snake.

                                     CHARLY
                         My terms are these. Call State and 
                         order full disclosure on your personal 
                         correspondence. Then disband Chapter, 
                         effective immediately. In exchange...? 
                         I won't shoot you, and I won't make 
                         you stand on that mine. I won't touch 
                         you. I won't touch you. I promise.

                                     PERKINS
                         You... you promise.

               He swallows hard. Looks to his aide... back to her... DIALS.

               Charly takes a deep breath. Scans the flowers, face placid. 
               It's really quite lovely today. Maybe she'll start a garden.

               Perkins clicks off. Look at Charly:

                                     PERKINS
                         It's done. Now, you promise... you 
                         won't shoot me... won't make me get 
                         on the mine...?

                                     CHARLY
                         I promise.

               She smiles. Shifts her aim and shoots the other guy.

               Perkins' eyes WIDEN in sudden realization. He LUNGES forward, 
               grabs the aide, holding him up... desperately propping his 
               dead weight atop the land mine...

                                     PERKINS
                         Goddamn you, I can't hold him... You 
                         bitch... YOU FUCKING BITCH...!

               EXT. GEORGETOWN AVENUE - DAYTIME

               Henessey's CHRYSLER CONVERTIBLE has been restored to a cherry 
               red. It purrs along the boulevard, Charly at the wheel. Hair 
               blowing. She talks on the cellular phone:

                                     CHARLY
                         Yes, Mr. President, you have my 
                         assurance that Perkins' latest 
                         operation has been rendered beyond 
                         salvage.

               Behind her a GOUT OF EARTH blows skyward. Showers the road a 
               ways back.

                                     CHARLY
                         He's not in the greatest shape either.

               INTERCUT - PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

               He speaks from the oval office, face grave:

                                     PRESIDENT
                         I owe you an astounding debt of 
                         thanks, Colonel. Would it be 
                         impertinent to ask if you'd consider 
                         working for State again? The moneys 
                         involved would be substantial.

                                     CHARLY
                         Out of the question. I've got a stack 
                         of papers to grade. Listen, before I 
                         go, I need a small favor...

               EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - AKRON, OHIO - DAY

               Henessey's EX-WIFE stands in the open doorway, flanked by 
               her son TODD. Two uniformed COPS speak solemnly:

                                     UNIFORM COP #1
                         ...As I say, we can only apologize 
                         for the system, Ma'am, but it's 
                         confirmed that your husband is 
                         innocent of the crime for which he 
                         was imprisoned. This is a photograph 
                         of the actual criminal...

               He shows her a mug shot of TIMOTHY.

                         A petty thief, now deceased. I'll 
                         respect your wishes should you choose 
                         to file charges against the State

               In the eyes of a young boy, Henessey finds redemption.

               EXT. HOUSE - EDGE OF WHEATFIELD - TWILIGHT

               Sun, passing into mystery. Wheatfield, rippling. Caitlin is 
               in the yard, chasing a big floppy-eared Labrador.

               On the porch, a CRICKET chirps. HAL comes out, sits beside 
               his wife CHARLY as she finishes eating. Says softly:

                                     HAL
                         Just talked to Dr. Sullivan, she's 
                         gonna need the full braces. Even 
                         with your teaching, insurance won't 
                         cover it... I don't know what to do.

               Pause. Charly says nothing. The dog parades up to Caitlin 
               with a stick in its jaws. A farm truck goes by, a faraway 
               speck.

               Charly absent-mindedly rolls a steak knife in her fingers. 
               Eyes far away.

               It never occurs to her what she's done until the chirping 
               stops.

               Ten feet away, the knife quivers.

               FADE OUT. ROLL END CREDITS.

                                         THE END

          EXT. EDGE OF CORN FIELDS - DAY

          A pocket watch. Open. Ticking. Swinging from a chain.
          Held by a young man named JOE in a clearing beside a Kansas
          corn field. Sky pregnant with rain.
          Waiting. He checks the watch, removes his earbud headphones,
          stands.
          Without much ceremony a BLOODIED MAN in a suit appears from
          thin air, kneeling before the young man. Hands and feet
          tied. Burlap sack over his head. Muffled screams, gagged.
          With no hesitation Joe raises a squat gun and blows the man
          apart with a single cough of a shot.

                         LATER
          Joe loads the corpse into the flatbed of his truck.
          Cuts open the back of the body's jacket, revealing FOUR bars
          of gold taped to the dead man's back. Joe takes them.

          EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY

          Massive, in the middle of nowhere. Black smoke.

          JOE (V.O.)
          Time travel has not yet been
          invented. But twenty five years
          from now it will be. Once the
          technology exists, it will be
          relatively cheap and available to
          the public at large. And so. It
          will be instantly outlawed, used
          only in secret by the largest
          criminal organizations. And then
          only for a very specific purpose.
          Joe drives up and parks his truck, removes the wrapped corpse
          from the flatbed.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          It's nearly impossible to dispose
          of a body in the future. I'm told.
          Tagging techniques, whatnot. So
          when these future criminal
          organizations in the future need
          someone gone, they use specialized
          assassins in our present, called
          loopers.

          INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY

          Cavernous and empty. Joe carries the body to an iron hatch,
          opens it, and dumps him in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

          JOE (V.O.)
          And so. Thirty years from now. My
          employers in the future nab the
          target, they zap him back to me,
          their looper. And I do the
          necessaries. So the target has
          vanished from the future, and I've
          just disposed of a body that
          technically does not exist. Clean.
          The body slides down a long chute. Vanishes in a little
          flare of angry red fire.

          EXT. DINER - DAY

          A sidecar roadside diner in the middle of nowhere. Joe's
          truck in front.

          INT. DINER

          Nearly empty, Joe at a booth listening to headphones. A
          waitress sets down coffee.
          Her bright red name tag: BEATRIX.

                         BEATRIX
          Bon jour, Joe.

                         JOE
          Bon jour, Beatrix.

                         BEATRIX
          How's the French?

                         JOE
          Slow. How's the coffee?

                         BEATRIX
          Burnt.
          Cream in the coffee. White clouds boil deep down.

          EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - DAY

          Joe's truck zooms from the flat fields towards a mid sized
          city on the horizon.

          INT. PAWN SHOP - DAY

          Grungy, heavily fortified. Joe enters and puts his gun in a
          basket labeled âLOOPERS - BLUNDERBUSSESâ
          Slips down a narrow passage, which ends at a steel wall with
          a protruding duct taped camera and microphone.

                         JOE
          Two, Jedd.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.
          Joe fishes the two gold bars from his jacket.
          A small narrow slot slides open in the wall, and gnarled old
          hands take the gold bars. It slides shut again.
          In the background the front door to the pawn shop dings open.
          The slot slides open and Jedd's hands push a wad of cash.
          Joe pockets it, and backs around Dale, another Looper.

                         DALE
          Hey Joe. Be at the Belle tonight?

                         JOE
          Yup.
          Dale hands four gold bars through the slot as Joe retrieves
          his gun and exits.

                         DALE
          Four, Jedd.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

          High ceilings, big clean windows overlooking a sooty city.
          Joe finishes smoothing out an oriental rug and scoots a
          coffee table in place over it.
          Puts a bebop LP on a turntable.

                         LATER
          On the bed, shooting at the ceiling with his fingers.

                         JOE
          Bon jour, mademoiselle. Bang!

          INT. CAR GARAGE - EVENING

          Suit-and-tie Joe pulls a tarp off a cherried-out 1992 Mazda
          Miata. Lingers over it. His baby.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - EARLY EVENING

          Joe drives through the sooty city streets. A muted beep, and
          he fishes a matchbook sized screen from his pocket.

                         JOE
          Yeah Seth? Yeah. Ok.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

          EXT. STREET CORNER - EARLY EVENING

          A young looper named SETH on the side of the road, kneeling
          beside a motorcycle without wheels called a SLAT BIKE. He
          kicks it in frustration.
          A VAGRANT approaches and SETH pulls a gun, identical to
          Joe's.

                         SETH
          Walk around! Around, I'm not
          kidding. Wide around, ya shit.
          The vagrant crosses the street. Joe pulls up.

                         JOE
          Seth.

                         SETH
          Hi Joe.

                         JOE
          That's new.
          Seth kicks the bike.

                         SETH
          Thanks. Goddamn thing. You going
          to the Belle?

          EXT. DRIVING THROUGH THE CITY STREETS

          Seth and Joe.

                         JOE
          Slat Bikes are all junk. Stick
          with rubber on the road.

                         SETH
          Yeah but Gat Men pull up in them,
          they get respect.

                         JOE
          They get respect cause they run the
          town. How much did that thing set
          you back? How much?
          Seth holds a quarter idly in his palm.

                         SETH
          I was gonna pull up in it.
          Tonight. Heads or tails, call it
          in the air.
          The coin lifts, floats several inches in the air, quivering.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         JOE
          Congratulations. You're pulling up
          with me instead.
          Joe notices the floating quarter.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          And don't, if we're going in, don't
          do that.

                         SETH
          Chicks dig TKs.

                         JOE
          It's tacky, don't do it.
          Seth catches the quarter, sullen.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          When the TK mutation started
          appearing in the general populace
          it was on every magazine - âNext
          Step in Evolution, what's next.â
          Everyone got tested. But turns out
          this was it, and now it's just a
          bunch of assholes thinking they're
          blowing your mind by floating
          quarters.

          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT

          A shitty but bright nightclub in the heart of the city.
          Flashy people shiver behind a velvet rope, huge black cars,
          big rollers in odd suits swept in by the bouncers.
          All trying very hard to be big time.

          JOE (V.O.)
          Big heads. Small potatoes.
          Drives past, revving the engine.

          EXT. PARKING LOT

          Down the street. Joe tosses the keys to an attendant.

          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE SIDE ENTRANCE

          A dingy stage door in back of the building. Joe and Seth
          ring a buzzer, smile for a camera, and the door opens.

          INT. COAT CHECK

          A long dark hallway leads to a tiny antechamber with a coat
          check room used for guns. BIG CRAIG leans out of it, and
          stops the two.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         BIG CRAIG
          No loopers in the club on
          Wednesdays, Joe. Gat men only.
          Seth backs towards the door, Joe stops him.

                         JOE
          We'll stick backstage, just meeting
          up. In and out.

                         BIG CRAIG
          Packing your blunderbusses?

                         JOE
          Hardly. Right Seth?

                         SETH
          Hardly. I'm with Joe.
          Big Craig pats them down, waves them in.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          A claustrophobic maze of twisty halls and passages.
          DANGEROUS MEN and half naked SHOW GIRLS weave through.
          Joe expertly navigates the turns, going someplace. Seth
          struggles to keep up.

                         SETH
          So are we - hey -
          Joe has vanished. Seth stops meekly, butted by passing men.

          INT. BORDELLO ENTRANCE

          An ornate parlor, LACY WOMEN entertaining men. A velvet
          curtained doorway leads to back rooms.
          Joe lingers by the entrance, watching one girl in particular,
          SUZIE. Bold dark eye makeup. A BIG MAN leads her off
          through the curtains. Joe's eyes drop. Pained.
          A fat MADAME doesn't look up from her ledger.

                         MADAME
          No loopers on Wednesday, Joe. Gat
          Men only.

                         JOE
          So I've read.
          He ducks out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          Joe plods. Dale, the Looper from the pawn shop, passes fast.
          Curious, Joe follows. They pass Seth, who tails after them.

                         SETH
          Hey, Joe. We leaving? Cuz, what-
          Joe?
          And Seth loses them again, butted back by passing men.

          INT. STEEP STAIRS

          A starkly lit steep stairwell leads down. Five or six young
          loopers gather at the top. Joe and Dale join them.

                         JOE
          What?

                         DALE
          Zach. In there right now, with
          Abe.
          Dale makes a quarter float above his palm. Joe rolls his
          eyes.

                         JOE
          For what?

                         DALE
          He closed his loop.
          This lands heavily on Joe.

                         JOE
          No shit?
          The door at the bottom of the stairs opens, and ZACH, another
          looper, steps out. An OLDER MAN'S HAND pats his shoulder
          then retracts into the door.
          The loopers watch him in awe.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          There's a reason we're called
          loopers.

          EXT. ABANDONED LOT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Zach stands waiting, checking his wristwatch, gun in hand.
          Obviously performing a similar ritual to Joe's.

          JOE (V.O.)
          Time travel in the future is so
          illegal, that when we sign up for
          this job we agree to a very
          specific proviso.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.
          Zach raises his gun.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          If our employers in the future get
          busted up by the law, their first
          priority is going to be erasing any
          trace of their relationship with us
          ever existing.
          A flash of light, and a HOG TIED MAN with a sack over his
          head kneels in front of Zach.
          Zach fires, and the man's chest explodes.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          So. If they're busted, and if
          we're still alive 30 years from
          now, they'll find our older self
          and zap him back to us, like any
          other job.
          Zach rips open the back of the corpse's jacket, revealing
          several dozen gold bars taped to his back.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          This is called closing your loop.
          Zach freezes. Looks at the shape of the corpse's face
          through the sack.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And you get paid out a mythic
          amount of money, and you get a
          handshake and get released from
          your contract. Enjoy the next 30
          years.

          INT. STEEP STAIRS

          Zach reaches the top of the stairs, a grin on his face.

          JOE (V.O.)
          This job doesn't tend to attract
          the most forward thinking people.

                         ZACH
          So are we celebrating?
          At the bottom of the stairs, a skinny young thug in ratty
          jeans. This is KID BLUE.

                         KID BLUE
          No loopers on fucking Wednesdays!
          The loopers collectively flip him off.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         ZACH
          Suck one, kid!

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB - NIGHT

          Lurid and very loud mixture of a dance club and cabaret. One
          by one the LOOPERS emerge from side exits, sneaking in.
          Paupers at the feast.

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Joe and several other Loopers pass around an EYE DROPPER.
          Pupils slacken. The drug spins him into a slurred revelry.

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB

          Joe staggers out on the dance floor. Miles high.

          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT

          Joe and the loopers are kicked out by burly GAT MEN, followed
          by Kid Blue, pointing and yelling at them. The loopers laugh
          their asses off.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

          Joe's Miata screams through the abandoned city streets,
          racing with several other loopers in trucks and sports cars.

          IN THE CAR
          Jammed with Seth and Loopers, Joe at the wheel. Still so
          high. Suddenly one of the Loopers SHOUTS -- Joe slams the

                         BRAKES

          EXT. VAGRANT VILLAGE - NIGHT

          Screaming to a halt just shy of a malnourished BEGGAR KID.
          Caught in the headlights. Behind him, a miserable vagrant
          village in a field.

          IN THE CAR
          Joe stares at the kid, frozen. A moment. Then spins the
          wheel, peels out. The Loopers hoot and shout. Joe's Miata
          screams along the dirt road bordering the vagrant village,
          whizzing past open fires and dirty huddled families.
          JOE'S FACE - serene and focused. Going somewhere.

          EXT. SETH'S APARTMENT - DAWN

          Joe drops Seth off at his building with its bright red
          garage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         JOE
          Sell that goddamn slat bike back.
          That's a lot of stupid money.

                         SETH
          I got stupid money.
          Seth holds his hand under fuzzy dice hanging from Joe's
          mirror, and they spin.

                         JOE
          Alright.
          Seth stumbles toward his door, checks his pants.

                         SETH
          I think I did something. You know
          what? TKs are special. Fuck you.

                         JOE
          Hey Seth.
          Seth slumps against the car.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Alright, Zach. What's his payout,
          30? 40? If that? That's not
          going to last you 30 years. And it
          won't get you overseas.

                         SETH
          Overseas...

                         JOE
          So in five, ten years you're back
          to riding the rails, or worse
          you're like Kid Blue, working as a
          gat man, wagging your dick at
          loopers and roughing up shop clerks
          for payoff money.

                         SETH
          Fuckin Kid Blue.

                         JOE
          Save a little something. Alright?
          Cause that'll be yours, and then
          you've got yours and that's all
          that matters, your life is your
          own.

                         SETH
          I gots mine you gots yours. I wish
          I was smart like you. Saint Joe.
          Seth pats Joe's cheek, and waddles off towards his apartment.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

          An alarm wakes Joe, red-eyed.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT ENTRYWAY - MORNING

          In his bathrobe, Joe checks his apartment mailbox. A slip of
          folded paper inside, with â14:30â handwritten on it.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT

          Dressed now, Joe double-checks his french book for a phrase
          and heads out.

          EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - DAY

          Joe's truck zooms away from the city, into corn fields.

          EXT. CORN FIELD

          Joe's pocket watch at 2:29, ticking away.
          A hog-tied MAN with a sack on his head appears before Joe.
          Shoots the man in the chest, without hesitation.

          INT. DINER - DAY

          Joe sits at a booth, the waitress Beatrix brings his coffee.

                         BEATRIX
          Bon jour Joe.

                         JOE
          Ravi de te voir, Beatrix.

                         BEATRIX
          Ooh la la.

          INT. PAWN SHOP BACK ROOM - DAY

          JEDD, 70s and knarled, sits in a tiny closet of a work room.
          Following a BUZZ, Joe appears on a fuzzy monitor, standing in
          the hall.

          JOE (OVER SPEAKER)
          Two, Jedd.
          Jedd opens a slot and takes two gold bars from Joe, then
          hands him out a small stack of cash.
          Marks in a notebook Joe's name, the date and the number â2'.
          All the other transactions have the number â4'.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT

          Joe smooths out the oriental rug.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB - NIGHT

          Joe drinks with Dale, watches a group of Loopers celebrating
          at another table.

                         DALE
          What's that, fourth loop closed
          this month?
          Dale casually makes a fork float above his palm, lifting his
          eyebrows at passing ladies.

                         JOE
          Fourth.
          On the stage, flinging her legs with a line of can-can
          dancers, is Suzie. The girl Joe watched in the bordello. As
          her dance ends Joe stands and goes backstage.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          Suzie weaves towards her dressing room. Joe catches her.

                         SUZIE
          Hey.

                         JOE
          You working a shift tonight?

                         SUZIE
          Yeah.

                         (REALIZES)
          Yeah, but one of the gat men bought
          me out already. For the night.

                         JOE
          Oh.

                         SUZIE
          Sweetie. I gotta work.
          She leaves him watching her go.
          He turns - sees Kid Blue leaning in the shadows. He's seen
          this whole exchange. The Kid smirks.

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB

          Joe bursts back into the club with a vengeance.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - LATER

          Joe staggers in. Not doing so hot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

          INT. JOE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Looks at himself in the mirror. Eyes red as candy. He pops
          open a hidden drawer next to his medicine cabinet, pulls out
          an eye dropper and puts one in each.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

          A harsh POUNDING.
          Joe, flopped on the bed, stirs. Then wakes with a jump,
          shaky on his feet.
          Goes to the door. A screen shows nobody in the hall outside.
          Still punch-drunk, Joe listens. POUND POUND POUND. The
          window. Joe slides it open. Seth tumbles in off the fire
          escape.

                         JOE
          Jesus, Seth.

                         SETH
          They're gonna be here any minute,
          are they here?

                         JOE
          No, they're not here. Who?

                         SETH
          Christ. Joe. Christ.
          Joe's eyes focus a bit, he tunes in to the situation. Turns
          the apartment lights off.

                         SETH (CONT'D)
          (re: the lights)
          What are you doing? Right. Smart.

                         JOE
          Seth, sit down here.
          CRASH! Seth knocks something over in the dark. Joe opens
          the fridge, pale light. Seth sits at the kitchen table.

                         SETH
          Late to my own funeral. Mom always
          said...

                         JOE
          Tell me now.

                         SETH
          Christ, Joe. Late to my own
          goddamn funeral. Can you help me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         JOE
          Seth, what did you do?

                         SETH
          You can protect me a little, right?
          Just so they don't... jeez. Oh
          jeez. This is like a nightmare.
          This is a nightmare.

          JOE (V.O.)
          I knew then what he did so I don't
          know why I asked.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          What did you do?
          Seth lifts his eyes to Joe.

                         SETH
          He was singing.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          FLASH: a hog-tied man with a sack over his head appears.
          Singing.
          Seth, with his gun raised, hesitates.

          SETH (V.O.)
          Through the gag and mask, but I
          could hear the tune. Deep
          memories, my mom in a dark room,
          singing. Back warm and safe, when
          I coulda still been good. And once
          I knew it was him... Joe I
          couldn't. I couldn't. I had to
          see.
          Seth pulls the sack off the man's head.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT


                         SETH
          Joe I can't even tell you. Looking
          in his eyes. I had to let him
          talk, then. I don't even remember
          the words, but I remember believing
          every one of them, or not even
          believing, but submitting. I've
          never felt that small before. I've
          never felt that happy. He told me.
          I remember, there's a new holy
          terror boss-man in the future, and
          he's closing all the loops. The
          Rainmaker, they call him. He told
          me.

                         SETH (CONT'D)
          Then he wanted a cigarette and I
          untied him, and he gives me this
          look. And he just starts running.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Seth standing with his gun in his limp arm, receding behind
          us as we run away.

          SETH (V.O.)
          And I had my blunderbuss so I know
          he's got about fifteen strides till
          he's out of my range. And they
          come and go, and I just watch him
          till he's gone.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT

          Seth breaks down crying.

          JOE (V.O.)
          This is called letting your loop
          run. It's not a good thing.

                         SETH
          What do I do? You're the only
          friend I got Joe you gotta help me

                         JOE
          You fucking idiot coming here.
          Seth, sucker punched.

          JOE (CONT'D)
          You can't be here, I'll give you a
          little money but you gotta

          Joe? A little - where am I gonna -

          You hop a freight train, you beat
          it the hell out
          POUND POUND POUND. On the door this time. Seth makes a sound
          like he's going to die, Joe closes the fridge, hisses

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Shut up. Don't move.
          Goes to the door. Two GAT MEN and Kid Blue stand outside.

                         KID BLUE
          Open up Joe!
          (to the gat man)
          Watch the window.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.
          Joe spins from the door. Considers briefly.

                         JOE
          I can't do anything for you Seth.
          Seth crumples to his knees, grasping Joe's hand.

                         SETH
          No! You gotta hide me! Joe, hide
          me, please Christ please Joe please
          hide me tell em something to buy
          time and I'll leave please-

          POUND POUND POUND.

                         JOE
          Hold on!
          Watching Seth, Joe's face breaks in a moment of decision. He
          flips the lights on, and briskly pulls back his oriental rug.
          A FLOOR SAFE with a touch pad. He enters a code, opens it.
          Wide and deeper than you'd expect, lined with gold bars. Big
          enough for a man. Seth scrambles in.
          Joe takes one last look at Seth's frightened, grateful face,
          framed by the gold bars, then closes the safe and smooths the
          oriental rug.
          POUND POUND POUND- Joe opens the door.
          Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the
          apartment with over-eager purpose.
          One gat man stays outside, the other casually sits at Joe's
          kitchen table. Kid Blue gets in Joe's face.

                         KID BLUE
          That took awhile.

                         JOE
          You think it's easy looking this
          good?

                         KID BLUE
          Tye's going to watch your apartment
          while we go have a talk with Abe.
          Joe grabs a jacket.

                         JOE
          There's coffee in the tin.

                         TYE

          Kid Blue leads Joe down the stairs and into the door at their
          base.

          INT. WAITING ROOM

          Dingy with a few benches. In one wall three steep stairs
          lead to a high door. Kid Blue knocks. Muffled voice from

                         WITHIN:

          ABE (O.S.)
          Two minutes.

                         LATER
          Joe and Kid Blue on benches, facing each other. The Kid
          stares daggers and spins his gun. Joe tries his best not to
          engage.

                         KID BLUE
          You know why they call that pea
          shooter a blunderbuss? Cuz it's
          impossible to hit anything farther
          than 15 feet, and impossible to
          miss anything closer. A gun for
          fuck up turkeys. Not like a gat.
          A gat has range. Accuracy.
          His gun spinning gets fancier. His gun meaner looking than
          Joe's blunderbuss, long and slim and chrome.

                         JOE
          Alright, cut it out Kid. You're
          gonna blow your foot off again.
          The Kid almost snaps back, but then grins.

                         KID BLUE
          You're right, it'd be real easy for
          it to accidentally go off.
          He clicks the safety off. Joe shifts uncomfortably.

                         JOE
          C'mon.

                         KID BLUE
          Don't disrespect a gat man, Looper.
          Joe stifles a chuckle.
          In a flash, the Kid stands and pistol-whips him across the
          face. Joe falls back. The Kid raises his gun at Joe.
          Frozen in that tableau a moment, the Kid savors his victory.
          Lowers his gun.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

          ABE (O.S.)
          What the hell is going on out there-
          The high door swings open fast, SMACKING Kid Blue hard on the
          side of the head. His gun goes off, firing into the wall.
          Out of nowhere three gat men burst into the room, guns drawn.
          ABE, a sallow man in his 50s, appears in the high doorway.

                         KID BLUE
          S'alright, s'alright.
          Humiliated, the Kid tries to stand, but falls over again.
          After a moment everyone realizes what's happened, and the
          tension breaks.

                         ABE
          Alright. Joe.
          Joe climbs into the doorway. Kid Blue stands shakily.

                         ABE (CONT'D)
          You didn't shoot your other foot
          off, didja kid?
          The door closes, and the gat men laugh at the Kid.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Cluttered, with a big desk. Joe sits, Abe hands him a
          handkerchief for the ugly gash on his cheek.

                         ABE
          My great grandfather always told my
          grandfather, men's like spiders.
          It's the little ones you gotta be
          careful of.

                         JOE
          Dunno I agree with that.

                         ABE
          Oh yeah? Well. What the fuck did
          my great grandfather know.

          JOE (V.O.)
          This man is from the future. He
          was sent back here by the mob, a
          one way ticket, to run the Loopers.
          That's low effort even for Abe, so
          to pass the time he recruited some
          real muscle, the Gat Men. Now he
          runs the city. Any other city,
          that'd be impressive.
          Abe settles in his chair. Regards Joe.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

                         ABE
          How can you kids stand those
          chokers? This, the cravats.

                         JOE
          Ties.

                         ABE
          Ridiculous. You're aware we don't
          have a dress code.

                         JOE

                         (SHRUGS)
          Fashion.

                         ABE
          You know, you don't know, the
          movies you're dressing like were
          copying other movies. Goddamn 20th
          century affectations, do something
          new. Put a glowing thing around
          your neck or use... rubberized..
          (waves at Joe's suit)
          Be new.

                         JOE
          Okay.
          A beat of silence.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Well it was nice chatting with you
          Abe.

                         ABE
          I do like you, Joe. But we're sure
          enough Seth paid you a visit we're
          gonna hafta do something about
          this.

                         JOE
          Seth?

                         ABE
          You're expecting we're gonna break
          your fingers with a hammer or
          something awful, and I'm going to
          diffuse that tension right now,
          that isn't going to happen. What's
          going to happen is, I'm going to
          talk for a little, not even that
          long, then you're gonna give up
          your friend.

                         JOE
          My friend Seth? I'm confused.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         ABE
          Well then I'll talk a little. You
          know you were the youngest looper I
          ever hired? You looked goddamn
          ridiculous they said, the
          blunderbuss up to here on you. But
          I remember they brought you in, I
          forget what it was for,

                         JOE
          Watch shop.

                         ABE
          That's yeah, you had rolled one of
          our fronts, a watch shop. And they
          had you, your arms pinned, this
          kid. Like an animal. But you
          looked at me, your hair stuck to
          half your face so just this one eye
          looking at me. And I thought
          what's this kid lived through, what
          he had taken away from him. What's
          he lost. And I could see, like
          seeing it happen clear as seeing
          it, the bad path in front of you,
          the bad version of your life. Like
          a vision I saw it happen, you
          turning bad. So I cleaned you up
          and put a gun in your hand. I gave
          you something that was yours.

                         JOE
          You know I'm grateful, Abe.
          Genuine. But Abe shakes his hands, not where he's going.

                         ABE
          I gave you something that was
          yours. And I remember that kid,
          and I think when you ask yourself
          you ask who would I sacrifice for
          what's mine, I think Seth is deep
          and cozy inside that circle.
          Pause. Both their eyes go to a hammer sitting on the desk.

                         ABE (CONT'D)
          That hammer's there for something
          else later, that's not, it's a bad
          coincidence.

                         JOE
          Okay.

                         ABE
          Show you how much I know you, I'm
          not even gonna break you, just set
          you back a ways.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         ABE (CONT'D)
          We know you've been stashing half
          your bars. Which is smart. You
          give up Seth, or you give us half
          your stash. For Seth.
          Joe holds Abe's gaze for a moment, then his eyes drop and
          it's over.

                         JOE
          Will you kill him?

                         ABE
          No. Would be too cataclysmic a
          change to the future. What we'll
          do is dangerous in that regard, but
          not as dangerous as killing him,
          and not by twice as having him run
          free.

                         (BEAT)
          Joe I let him run more than a few
          days, the boys in the future get
          nervous, then bing! my replacement
          shows up. With a gun. So we'll do
          what we have to do.
          Silence.

                         JOE
          Floor safe, beneath the rug. 6742.
          One of the gat men quietly exits.

                         ABE
          It's the little ones that get you.

          INT. WAITING ROOM

          Abe leads Joe out, past gat men and Kid Blue, smirking again.

                         ABE
          Why don't you kill an hour, Joe.
          On the house.
          After Joe exits, Abe and Kid exchange looks.

          ABE (CONT'D)
          Call the doc.

          INT. BORDELLO ENTRANCE

          Joe slumps in. Several girls, none of them Suzie.

                         MADAME
          Suzie's just getting off. Doubt
          she's up for it.
          He pushes through the velvet curtained door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

          INT. BLACK HALLWAY

          A large gat man pushes past Joe.
          At the end of the hall, Suzie leans in a doorway smoking a
          cigarette. Not sexy, just tired. She sees Joe, and is about
          to say no. But she sees Joe's eyes, and doesn't.
          Exhaling a plume of smoke, she withdraws into her doorway.
          Joe follows. Through her smoke.

          INT. SUZIE'S BEDROOM - LATER

          Suzie naked at the mirror. She goes to Joe, lying on the
          bed, distant.

                         JOE
          I can't remember my mother's face.
          I remember her touching my hair.
          Like this.
          He takes Suzie's hand strokes it over his hair. She smiles
          briefly, tired, then takes her hand away and puts drops in
          his eyes.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Do you want to go overseas?

                         SUZIE
          Do I want to go overseas? With
          you? Now?

                         JOE
          Soon, maybe.

                         SUZIE
          Baby that's sweet. You're a sweet
          boy. You gotta be careful, it's
          easy to think you know someone once
          you been like this. What's in here
          is services rendered.

                         JOE
          Is that how it aughta be?

                         SUZIE
          What, in nature?

                         (BEAT)
          You know I get this a lot.
          Especially young guys. I must have
          wife eyes or something.
          His face clouds.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Joe gets home. Empty, quiet. Everything in place. He goes
          to the rug, pulls it aside. Opens the safe.
          All the gold, and nothing else. One bar juts from the side,
          knocked out of place.
          He pushes it back, and when he lifts his fingers they have a
          bright smear of fresh red blood.

          EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

          A hunched figure sprints through an abandoned lot towards a
          train yard.
          It is a 55 YEAR OLD SETH. He limps up to a razor-wire fence
          bordering the train yard.
          Surveys the sharp wire, rips the lining from his jacket and
          wraps first his left hand then his right.
          But stops.
          On the palm of his right hand, a WEATHERED SCAR. Clearly
          carved in the shape of an arrow, pointing down to his wrist.
          Old Seth squints at it, confused. He pulls back his sleeve,
          revealing his clean bare forearm.
          Then his face changes.
          Because his arm is no longer bare. Suddenly, out of nowhere,
          more intricate scarring has appeared down its length.
          The scars spell out clearly: âBE AT 75 WIRE STREET IN 15

                         MINUTESÂ
          Old Seth's breath returns, jagged. He pulls his sleeve up
          and hoists himself up the fence, climbing fast.
          He reaches the top, gets a good grasp on the wire to hoist
          himself over... and stops again.
          His right hand is missing a finger. The ring finger is just
          gone, its stump worn with age.
          Old Seth stares. And now his middle finger is gone as well.
          A freight train whistle moans. The cars, open and inviting,
          leading out of town. Behind him, the city.
          Terror and indecision seizes his chest, so much so that it
          takes a moment for him to realize the sound of his breathing
          has changed to a ragged whistle.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.
          He lifts his hand, now with just two fingers, to his face...
          and the smooth scarred hole where his nose used to be.

          EXT. CITY STREETS

          The train yard far in the distance. Old Seth RUNNING back
          into town.
          He looks down at his right hand, fingerless now but for his
          thumb.
          He speeds up, desperate. Cuts through an alley. And has no
          right hand, just a stump.

                         OLD SETH
          No no no no no!
          A bell-like DING. Old Seth spins, sees a WEDDING BAND lying
          on the sidewalk.
          He picks it up with the four remaining fingers on his left
          hand, stuffs it in his pocket, sobbing.
          Bursts out of the alleyway, limping now, straight into the
          street and into the headlights of an oncoming car.
          The car screeches to a halt, and its harsh white light shows
          Old Seth's missing right ear, and deep scars down his face.

          IN THE CAR
          Old Seth throws open the drivers side door and throws out the
          DRIVER. Jams on the gas.
          Speeding through the streets, hands slipping on the wheel.
          His pant leg crumples. Empty boot tangling with the pedals.

          EXT. WIRE STREET

          The car hits a pole.
          Out climbs what's left of Old Seth, his face mangled, missing
          a foot, one arm gone to the elbow.
          Street sign - WIRE STREET. The numbers, 45.
          He runs. Howling, missing his tongue. Arm totally gone.
          Then falls as his leg goes to the knees. And he's crawling,
          an animal form, bellowing wordlessly.
          Makes it to an iron street-side door. 75. And with his one
          arm, slams it.
          Slumps against it, heaving. After a long moment it swings
          open.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.
          With no hesitation, a BLAST from the darkened doorway, and
          Old Seth's head mists open. He slumps to the pavement.
          Kid Blue steps from the doorway, drags the body inside.
          Deep in the dark doorway we glimpse a DOCTOR in a surgical
          frock smeared with bright red blood. The door SLAMS.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

          Joe wakes with a start.

          EXT. CORN FIELD

          Joe's pocket watch at 2:29, ticking away. He takes his
          stance. Earbud headphones, the drone of French lessons.
          A hog-tied MAN with a sack on his head appears kneeling
          before Joe. Joe raises his gun without hesitation and shoots
          the man in the chest.
          Walks to the body, flips it. The man's hands, tied and
          purplish. Joe hesitates. Puts his hand next to them.
          Similar.
          He flips the man onto his back, stares long and hard at the
          shape of the man's face under the cloth sack.
          Tears it off. An older Asian man's face, frozen in terror.
          Joe smirks, the spell broken. His face hardens.

          INT. PLANT - DAY

          Joe watches the Asian man's body slide down the hatch and
          vanish in a puff of distant fire.

                         BEGIN MONTAGE:
          1. Joe in the club, drinking, watching more loopers
          celebrate.
          2. Joe in the field, he shoots a hog-tied man.
          3. Joe in his floor safe, setting more gold bars.
          4. Joe in the field, BANG.
          5. Joe in the club, watching Suzie with her red hair.
          6. Joe in the field, BANG.
          7. In the plant, a body sliding into the fire.
          8. Joe in the field, BANG. BANG. BANG. His face more
          determined with each shot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY

          Our montage comes to an end suddenly and all is silent.
          Joe in the corn field, in his stance, ready to draw.
          But nothing happens. Silence. Joe checks his watch,
          confused.
          2:30 and change. Waits. Watching the blank space where the
          man is supposed to appear.
          Hand on his gun. Breathing shallow. Something is wrong.
          2:32. An eternity. Then, there he is.
          But different. Not kneeling. On his side, so he flops over
          and has to straighten himself. The man's hands are UNTIED.
          Holy shit.
          Joe raises his gun, scared. Time slows. Finger tightens on
          the trigger.
          Then he sees: the man has NO SACK ON HIS HEAD. And the face
          that stares back at Joe is his own.
          57 YEAR OLD JOE. His eyes fixed on Joe.
          And for just one split second, Joe's face slackens, and his
          finger eases on the trigger.
          It's all the hesitation Old Joe needs. He throws his body
          into a spin.
          Joe snaps out of it, and PULLS THE TRIGGER.
          The shot catches Old Joe square in the back, and the impact
          blows him forward. But instead of blood beneath his torn
          jacket's back, we see the layered gold bars spill out. They
          caught the blast.
          In what seems like one fluid motion Old Joe's fingers grab
          one of the bars, he spins again, throwing handfuls of dirt
          and the bar back towards Joe.
          Joe flinches, again just for a moment, and when his eyes
          focus again and his arm steadies the gun it's too late.
          Old Joe is on top of him, with a heavy blow knocking the gun
          aside, and with an even heavier one swinging down on Joe's
          head, a fist and then

          THE CORN FIELD, HOURS LATER
          Joe wakes. Blood caked on his face. Headphones beside him,
          still squawking French lessons. Sits up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         JOE
          Oh god.
          Gold bars scattered in the dirt. But no Old Joe. And no
          truck. Joe staggers to his feet, shaky. Head thick. But
          realizing.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Late to my own funeral.

          EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON

          Joe runs, shaky, towards town. Fishes his phone-device from
          his pocket, chucks it.

          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

          Across the street, Joe huddles behind a car, breathing hard.
          Looks up at his lit window. Debating.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT HALLWAY

          Joe walks silently towards his apartment door.
          It is ajar. He hesitates. Knows he shouldn't.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT

          Holding his breath, Joe edges in. It's ravaged, torn to
          pieces. The floor safe is open, about half the gold bars
          missing. But the apartment seems empty.
          Exhaling, Joe works quickly. Knocks a tile aside, pulls a
          wad of cash from the wall. A heavy jacket from the closet.
          Eyes dart around the room - what else? But too late --
          footsteps in the hallway. Joe ducks into the bathroom just
          as Kid Blue and a TALL GAT MAN enter the apartment.

          INT. JOE'S BATHROOM

          Joe crouches. Outside, Kid Blue piles the man's arms full of
          gold bars.

          KID BLUE (O.S.)
          That's twenty four there. I'm
          keeping count.

          TALL GAT MAN (O.S.)
          Uh huh.

          KID BLUE (O.S.)
          Two more trips should do it.
          Joe gently lifts himself off his haunches.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT

          The Tall Gat Man exits, Kid Blue stays crouched over the
          floor safe hefting out bars, his back to the bathroom. In
          the distance, a GUNSHOT. Kid Blue's head perks up.
          CREAK! From the bathroom. Quick as lightning, the Kid draws
          his gat and spins - but Joe is already upon him, full sprint.
          SLAM! Joe tackles the Kid backwards. But while Joe uses his
          momentum to leap over the OPEN FLOOR SAFE, the Kid tumbles
          back into it, vanishing inside with a painful thud.
          Joe scrambles to a stop, lifts the heavy safe trap door and
          SLAMS it down - just as the Kid's hand grasps the open edge.
          With a sickening CRACK, the trap door closes on the Kid's
          fingers.
          A bellowing howl, his fingers withdraw, and the safe door
          clicks shut. The ELECTRIC BOX rigged to the code pad to
          crack it clatters off, and whirrrr, CLICK. Locked. Joe,
          panting, goes on hands and knees to the safe door and shouts
          clear and earnest:

                         JOE
          Kid listen Kid. I'm sorry. Tell
          Abe I'm going to fix this. Tell
          him keep my bars safe cause I swear
          to god I'm going to fix this, I'm
          going to find my loop and I'm gonna
          kill him. Tell Abe-
          CRACK CRACK! The wood paneled floor above the safe door
          splinters upwards with gunshots, and a chunk of Joe's right
          ear explodes.
          More blood than you'd think spills down his neck, Joe falls
          back. Three more shots - CRACK CRACK CRACK! And now
          footsteps running down the hall.
          Joe on his feet, slipping in his own blood, sprints across
          the apartment. The TALL GAT MAN appears in the doorway,
          shooting blindly at Joe, chunks of wall and plaster exploding
          as Joe doesn't stop but JUMPS OUT THE WINDOW.

          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT WINDOW - NIGHT

          5 floors up, Joe leaps out, hits the fire escape, bullets
          shattering the window. Blind with blood, ears ringing, Joe
          barrels down the fire escape. A confused blur of iron steps,
          slipping and scrambling down, but now the tall gat man is out
          the window and shooting down at him.
          Somehow Joe slips and rolls, grabs at thin air, falling -
          three stories at least, falling.
          When he hits the ground the world goes away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         OLD JOE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY

          We abruptly CUT ON to a very familiar scene.
          Young Joe stands alone in the corn field, in his stance,
          ready to draw. But nothing happens. Silence. Joe checks
          his watch, confused. 2:30 and change.
          This is exactly the scene where Old Joe appears, being
          replayed before our eyes. But when Old Joe does APPEAR, it's
          different: his hands are tied, his head covered with a sack.
          And something very different happens:
          Joe raises his gun and without hesitation PULLS THE TRIGGER.
          Old Joe's chest explodes. He falls dead.
          Joe approaches the body, and slows. Sensing something. He
          pulls off the sack. The face of his older self. Old Joe.
          He flips him over. Gold bars CLINK beneath a bloody jacket.
          Joe has closed his loop.

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB - NIGHT

          The other LOOPERS buy Joe drinks and cheer him, celebrating.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

          His belongings in boxes. Joe unloads the GOLD BARS from the
          trap door.

          EXT. CARGO SHIP DECK - DAY

          Out at sea. Joe, bundled against the cold, leans on a
          railing, eagerly watching the horizon.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY

          Joe smoking in window of an empty apartment, half unpacked.

          EXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY

          Joe walking the city streets, breathing deep. Alive.

          INT. PARIS BODEGA - NIGHT

          Joe picks up a bottle of beer.
          Several FRENCH GANGSTERS in suits shake down the OWNER of the
          shop for money from the register. One holds a gun in the
          owner's face.
          Joe ignores them, walks out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

          INT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT

          Loud and dark. Joe shotguns eye drops right out in the open,
          dances like a madman.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY

          Joe's apartment, unpacked and lived in. Joe smokes.
          In a NOOK behind a wall panel - stacks of CASH.

          EXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY

          Cloudy and cold. Joe wanders alone. Buffeted by strangers.

          EXT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT

          Music pumping, Joe deadened at a table, in another world.
          Beside him a YOUNG PUNK makes a glass float using his TK
          power, then shatters the glass. Red liquid goes everywhere.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY

          Joe takes money from the stacks in the nook, which have grown
          drastically low.
          LATER - sets a hypo down in the ashtray.

          INT. PARIS BODEGA - DAY

          A GUN in the face of the shop's OWNER. Held by Joe. Several
          years older now, in his mid thirties.
          Dressed in a suit, surrounded by fellow GANGSTERS. Now part
          of their gang.

          EXT. PARIS STREETS - NIGHT

          A shoot-out between rival gangs. Joe's guns blaze.
          A remorseless killer. Blasting away, cold and skillful.
          Smashing up shops that won't pay protection. He's muscle.

          INT. PARIS GANG HEADQUARTERS

          A dingy dark hallway. Distant thumping bass indicates it's
          maybe behind a club.
          The hall is lined with French Gangster, all similarly
          dressed. Reminiscent of the Gat Men. It takes us a moment
          to recognize Joe among them.
          In his EARLY 40s now. His face a hard weathered mask. A
          soldier. (Note - it is here we transition from the actor
          playing Young Joe to the one playing Old Joe.)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

          EXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY

          Snow on the ground.

          INT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT

          Old Joe high as a kite, in an all out brawl. Punched to the
          ground. Laughing his ass off.
          A bar fight blossoms in slow motion all around.
          Old Joe looks up, sees the woman who will be his WIFE for the
          first time. Long red hair (reminiscent of but NOT Suzie.) In
          a green dress. She flees the fighting, towards the exit.

          âSORTIE.â
          Transfixed and high, Old Joe follows her. Puts his hand on
          her shoulder. She turns, looks him over. Flips him off.
          Leaves. Old Joe watches her go. In love.

          INT. PARIS CAFE - DAY

          Old Joe hits on his future Wife, she tells him to fuck off.

          INT. PARIS BEDROOM - DAY

          Old Joe in bed with his future Wife. They kiss.

          EXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY

          Old Joe shoots up a storefront with his gang.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY

          Old Joe's future wife yells at him, holding his gun holsters
          accusingly. She throws them across the room.
          LATER - He holds her in bed, both of them troubled.

          INT. CAR - DAY

          Old Joe driving. Deep in thought. His future Wife beside
          him, her hand on his. He hits the brakes.

          EXT. FRENCH BEACH / HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

          The car screeches to a halt on a beach side road. Old Joe
          gets out, runs across the beach to the water, pulling his gun
          out of its holster. He fires it out to sea till its empty,
          then throws the gun into the ocean.
          He runs back to his Wife, standing on the beach. They kiss.
          They fall to the sand, and kiss.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

          EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

          A cottage in the country.

          INT. FRENCH COTTAGE BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Old Joe sweats and shudders out his drug addiction. His Wife
          tends to him.

          EXT. FRENCH COTTAGE - SUNSET - YEARS LATER

          Old Joe in his mid 50s, his Wife lying on a hammock with him,
          reading. Hands lazily entwined. A good life.

          INT. FRENCH COTTAGE KITCHEN - MORNING - A WEEK LATER

          The Wife cuts vegetables. Headlines (in French) scroll
          across a small floating screen, against images of
          destruction. âGangland Terror Spreads, Who is The Rainmakerâ
          She turns it off.

          INT. FRENCH BEDROOM - MORNING

          Lazy, dust motes hanging in the sunlight through the windows.
          Old Joe in bed, in his late 50s.
          His Wife walks through, says something inconsequential, puts
          her hand on his foot. Draws it away, fingers sliding off
          gently. And is gone.
          We stay with Old Joe. His deep breath. The sun warming the
          sheets. Running water from the kitchen.
          His eyes focus on his hand. Written in faded ink on the palm
          is a number we do not recognize: 07153902935.
          A long moment.
          With all the violence in the world, the cottage's green front
          door is KICKED OPEN.
          Joe runs out of the bedroom half dressed, and GANGSTERS grab
          him, taking him down with a rifle butt to the head.
          His Wife is dragged from the kitchen screaming.

          EXT. COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

          Dark cars parked out front. We watch the quiet facade for a
          moment too long, violence that we don't want to think about
          happening inside.
          Then the door BURSTS open and Gangsters drag Joe out, sobbing
          thrashing and bleeding from his head.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

          INT. BASEMENT - DAY

          Concrete, nondescript. The Gangsters carry Joe in, now hog
          tied. Put a sack over his head.
          Lead him towards a machine, an iron monstrosity with a hatch.
          One of the men taps his watch - hurry. Another man pulls a
          large lever, and the machine hums, warming up.
          Joe's face, covered with the sack. Breathing. Remembering:
          flashes of his WIFE, screaming.
          Then Joe LUNGES and somehow his hands are loose, he PUNCHES
          one man, tears off the sack, PUNCHES another man, a flurry
          and then it's over. He stands among a pile of broken men.
          Slowly takes stock. Looks at the exit. Looks at the faded
          number on his blood-smeared hand.
          A million things in his mind. But just one choice. The
          machine hums angrily. Ready.

          INT. TIME MACHINE - CONTINUOUS

          Like an iron coffin. Old Joe climbs inside. Braces himself.
          Closes the hatch behind him.
          Flash and crack and he is sent.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY

          And appears in front of his younger self.
          The scene now plays out as it did the first time. Joe
          hesitates, Old Joe gets the upper hand, knocks him out.
          Old Joe looks around, gets his bearings. Stares at his
          younger self a moment. Then goes to the truck.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK

          Old Joe drives the truck into the city.

          INT. BODEGA - NIGHT

          Cramped. Old Joe walks in quickly, gets aspirin, wrapped
          sandwiches, bandages, big bottles of water. Removes his torn
          jacket, dumps it.
          At the register, the CLERK bags everything up. Old Joe pulls
          the blunderbuss on the clerk.

                         OLD JOE
          And your jacket.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

          EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

          Wearing the clerk's jacket, Old Joe takes four aspirin.
          Holds his head a minute, rocking gently.

          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          On the street outside the building. Old Joe approaches,
          watching the window high above. Weighing his options.
          He scans the street. Spots an ARMORED VAN in the alleyway.
          Movement from behind it - Kid Blue and the Tall Gat Man
          loading their bars in the back.

                         OLD JOE
          Shit.
          Old Joe turns to go, but STOPS when his eye catches movement
          between parked cars.
          It's Joe. Young Joe, hid between the cars, looking up at the
          apartment building weighing his options.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)

                         (SOTTO)
          Don't do it. Idiot. Don't do it.
          After a moment Joe dashes across the street and into the
          building. Old Joe stays still a moment, watching him go.
          Ducks into shadows as Kid Blue and the Tall Gat Man step from
          the alleyway, wiping their hands.

                         KID BLUE
          Two more trips.
          They enter the building.
          Old Joe takes a breath, then casually walks down the
          sidewalk, past the alleyway, scoping the Armored Van. A GAT
          MAN DRIVER in the driver's seat.

          INT. ARMORED VAN

          The Gat Man Driver watches Old Joe disappear from view.
          Suspicious, he uncovers a GAT on the seat beside him.
          When he looks back up Old Joe stands in his headlights,
          blunderbuss raised. BANG! The windshield shatters, the Gat
          Man Driver is torn apart.
          Old Joe runs up, flings open the door, digs through the
          bloody mess frantically, finding the GAT.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT

          Old Joe dashes out onto the street as gunfire cracks from the
          high apartment window. Sharp eyes will notice that Old Joe's
          right ear is now clipped off, an old wound.
          He dashes towards the apartment door, gun in hand, but stops
          when the window five stories above shatters with gunfire.
          Old Joe backs up, and sees Joe scrambling down the fire
          escape as the TALL GAT MAN fires down at him.
          Old Joe takes expert aim with the gat, and fires three shots
          upwards. The Tall Gat Man's gunfire stops.
          Joe slips on the fire escape, falls two stories and lands on
          the hood of a parked car.
          Old Joe goes to him, checks his pulse.
          Behind them the TALL GAT MAN hits the sidewalk with a SPLAT.
          Old Joe goes to the tall gat man's remains, picks another gat
          out of them, and goes back to Joe's inert body on the car
          hood.

                         OLD JOE
          Stupid little shit.
          He lifts him in his arms.

          EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

          Joe wakes slowly, pained. Lying alone in an abandoned lot on
          the outskirts of town.
          Slowly he takes stock of himself. Nothing broken. A tight
          bandage on his ear.
          A mournful train whistle, and he turns. Through a chain link
          fence, the train yard. He was put here for a reason.
          A man and a young boy in rags hop onto an empty cargo car,
          heading out of town. Joe watches the boy, his eyes angry.
          Stands shakily. And walks away from the train yard.
          Something like a HELICOPTER sweeps overhead, a spotlight
          zigzagging the area. Joe ducks into shadows, heading towards
          the city.

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE BACKSTAGE

          A swarm of activity, Gat Men rushing in and out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         ABE (PRE-LAP)
          He ain't dumb like the last, we
          gotta get lucky now. Cover the
          roads out of town. Sweep the
          streets, pull in his social circle,
          pound the pavement.

          INT. ABE'S DEN

          Map spread on a table. Gat men gathered around Abe.

                         GAT MAN 3
          He'll hop a train. Fast and
          untraceable.

                         ABE
          Maybe. Sweep the train yard.
          Every second that passes is bad,
          go.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Kid Blue slumps in a chair, holding a rag to a wound on his
          head. Eyes wet from crying. Abe storms in.

                         ABE
          Stupid little shit.

                         KID BLUE
          I can't hear you
          Abe leans in next to his ear and shouts

                         ABE
          Well that's what happens when you
          fire a gat in a steel box you
          stupid little shit.

                         KID BLUE
          I can fix this. I can find him.

                         ABE
          Go home and let the grown ups work.
          Kid Blue.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

          More helicopters sweep the streets, searchlights blazing.
          Cars with Gat Men circle slowly, shining spotlights
          themselves.
          Joe leaps from the shadows, ducks behind a dumpster. Barely
          avoiding the light. He won't last long out here.

                         JOE
          Where would I go if I were me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.
          He sprints into an alleyway, but Gat Men are coming down the
          other side with flashlights.
          Goes back the way he came, turns a corner.

          EXT. SETH'S APARTMENT

          Joe finds himself in front of a familiar BRIGHT RED GARAGE.
          Seth's apartment. Three stories up, Seth's darkened window.
          He looks up at it, hesitant but desperate.

          INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT

          A window shatters inward, punched through by a wrapped fist.
          A big reading hall, empty and dark. The broken window opens,
          Old Joe slides in. Weaves his way past the reading tables,
          finds what he's looking for at a desk.
          A suspended sheet of thin plastic turns out to be a computer.
          Checking his hand, he inputs the number. Navigates menus and
          windows, information flashing, searching.

          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT

          Gat Men in cars and helicopters patrol the streets.
          Kid Blue sits on the curb, smoking a cigarette. Seething at
          his bandaged hand. Deep in thought. His eyes lift. An
          idea.

          EXT. SETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The familiar red garage. And three stories up, Seth's lit
          window.
          Kid Blue pulls a small caliber gun from a holster concealed
          on his boot, enters the building.

          INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT

          Old Joe finishes printing several large documents that look
          like maps. He folds them up, pockets them.
          Dashes to the window, starts to heft himself up - And stops.
          On his hand, a smooth aged scar. Of an arrow. Pointing to
          his wrist.
          Old Joe's breath catches. He pulls down his sleeve,
          revealing âBâ then âEâ
          Then âA then âTâ... He bares his arm, reading the entire
          message.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

          INT. SETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The peephole screen on the inside of Seth's apartment door.
          Kid Blue manipulating a device, a shower of sparks blows the
          screen out momentarily, and the door swings open.
          Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the
          apartment with over-eager purpose.
          Empty. He deflates. Thinks.
          Goes to the peephole screen, touches it and a menu comes up.
          A little manipulating, and the image is rewinding.
          An empty hall, scanning back half an hour. Then: young Joe.
          Kid Blue stops scanning, hits âPLAY'. Joe feels around the
          door jam, retrieves a key, and enters the apartment.
          Kid Blue exhales. Well Joe was here.
          Taps the screen again, it goes back to a live feed, and he's
          about to step away when his eye catches something.
          He pushes a square on the screen, and the view changes. To a
          live feed from a camera in the ceiling of the apartment.
          Excited, Kid rewinds this half an hour.
          On the screen: Joe enters the apartment. Rifles around a
          little, then sits at the table. Head in his hands. Staring
          into space.
          Then goes to a kitchen drawer, opens it, gets something.
          Goes to the front door, takes something off the wall, briskly
          exits.
          Kid Blue stops the screen.
          He goes and sits where Joe sat. Stares where Joe stared.
          The kitchen counter. A blender, sink. Can labeled âCOFFEE.â
          Kid goes to the kitchen drawer Joe opened, pulls it open.
          It's full of knives.
          Kid goes finally to the door, looks at the wall. A small
          rack for keys, several hanging and one empty hook.
          Kid Blue stares into space, trying to put these pieces
          together. Lights a cigarette.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAWN - ESTABLISHING

          The sun rises over a flat endless field of corn stalks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

          EXT. CORN FIELD

          We push forward through the green stalks at a brisk pace.
          They part before us, endless, hypnotic.

          INT. BEDROOM - MORNING - FLASHBACK

          The same from the previous flashback.
          Old Joe in bed, half asleep. A woman's arm under his neck.
          It slips away, and he kisses its wrist. Comfort, warmth.
          The woman, leaving. Her hand touches and slides off his
          foot, moving away.

          EXT. DINER - EARLY MORNING

          Old Joe emerges from the corn fields bordering the sidecar
          roadside diner. Fumbles in his jacket, dry-swallows four
          aspirin. Regains his footing. Walks around the diner
          cautiously.
          Parked in back behind a dumpster, SETH'S SLAT BIKE.

          INT. DINER

          Joe sits at a booth. Old Joe enters, steps up slowly, sits.
          A moment of silence.
          Along with his ear, Joe's hand and arm are now wrapped in
          bloodied bandages. Joe's eyes go to Old Joe's arm. Old Joe
          pulls his sleeve back and shows him the scar spelling

          âBEATRIX.â
          Beatrix the waitress steps up breezily.

                         BEATRIX
          Coffee?

                         OLD JOE
          Please. Black. And water.

                         BEATRIX
          Anything else?

                         OLD JOE

                         (TO JOE)
          Are we eating?

                         JOE
          I ordered something.

                         OLD JOE
          Steak and eggs, rare and scrambled.

                         BEATRIX
          Two steak & eggs coming up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          She goes. Another pause.

                         OLD JOE
          We're not going to talk about time
          travel.

                         JOE
          ...ok.

                         OLD JOE
          Must hurt.
          His arm.

                         JOE
          Yeah. Didn't know if you'd

                         REMEMBER HER

                         OLD JOE
          I put it together. Clever.

                         (BEAT)
          Do I get the scar when you're cut,
          or when the knife is on its way
          down and it's inevitable that
          you're going to be cut?

                         JOE
          I'm not cutting myself again to-

                         OLD JOE
          I'm not asking you to.

                         JOE
          It's an interesting question, I've
          just lost a lot of blood today.

                         OLD JOE
          You know there's another girl here
          on weekends.

                         JOE

                         (REALIZES)
          Sue.

                         OLD JOE
          Well. Have fun explaining who
          âBeatrix' is for the next thirty
          years.
          Beatrix sets Old Joe's black coffee next to Joe's white.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          How's the French coming?

                         JOE
          Good.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         OLD JOE
          (fast in French,

                         SUBTITLED)
          I know you have a gun between your
          legs.
          Joe's face registers obvious incomprehension.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          No? Well you'll get there
          eventually. Obviously.

                         JOE
          I don't care what you're here for,
          whatever you think you're going to
          get from me. More time or whatever
          you want. I can't let you walk
          away from this diner alive.
          Because the next 30 years of my

                         LIFE-

          OLD JOE JOE
          I'm sorry to cut off - sorry -are mine they're not yours
          to cut off this spiel you've they're not yours anymore you
          been practicing all night, can say anything you want but
          but I need you to need you to you're not walking outta here
          listen. Listen. alive

                         OLD JOE
          You know what the voice of god
          sounds like? See now good you're
          confused now but you're listening.
          I hope the voice of god sounds like
          an old man speaking French. Old
          men speaking French sound like
          primeval trees in a strong wind,
          just irrefutable. Wise, strong,
          gentle, all these things in
          harmony, complimentary. At once.
          Old men speaking French. Young men
          speaking French sound, without
          exception, like weenies. Fact.
          You ever hear a Frenchman under 40
          try to sound threatening? It's
          hilarious. English is a tight t-
          shirt, flatters the young. Rat a
          tat tat. French is a double
          breasted suit. Young man can put
          it on, but it always feels like
          he's putting something on. Some
          things, you just need the years.
          It's my favorite language.

                         JOE
          I've got a life ahead of me that's
          mine and I'm not giving it up for
          you or anybody

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         OLD JOE
          Well you know what you have to do
          then why don't you take your little
          gun out from between your knees and
          do it. One in the head, two in the
          heart. Boy. It's all âanybodyâ
          and âneverâ and then you show up
          here and think you can talk me into
          dying. Well bullshit we both know
          you're not going to kill me.
          Christ you ordered eggs.
          Old Joe downs two aspirin. Takes a breath.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          I know why you couldn't pull that
          trigger. When you're tasked to do
          the unthinkable, your mind, it'll
          do anything it can to stop you.
          Only way is you gotta know why
          you're doing it, in your bones, so
          you can say it out loud to someone
          without apologizing. Or you gotta
          cut yourself off, go numb. But
          that'll kill you, down the line.

                         (BEAT)
          It's hard to make eye contact with
          you. It's too strange.

                         JOE
          Your face looks backwards.

                         OLD JOE
          Yeah, that helps actually. That
          little twist of unfamiliar.

                         (BEAT)
          You're not winning some pissing
          contest by looking me in the eye,
          you didn't know what I looked like
          until yesterday, it makes sense
          that it's easier for you.

                         JOE
          I wasn't trying to. Do you know
          what's going to happen? Have you
          already done all this, right now,
          as me?

                         OLD JOE
          No not - exactly - I don't want to
          talk about time travel shit,
          because we'll start talking about
          it and then we'll be here all day
          making diagrams with straws. It
          doesn't matter.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         JOE
          When I hurt myself now, it changes
          your body. Do my actions change
          your memories?

                         OLD JOE
          It doesn't matter because I don't
          know how it works. Nobody knows
          how it works. Time travel was an
          accident, thirty years from now the
          smartest men in the world know
          exactly one thing about it that you
          don't: they know to be scared to
          death of it.

                         (BEAT)
          My memory is cloudy, there's a
          cloud. It's a, it starts clear
          then gets cloudy as it goes back..
          Goddammit hand me those.
          Straws. Joe passes him two.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          And the salt. No, the pepper. The
          pepper.
          Old Joe sets two straws about a foot apart, parallel, and
          pours pepper between them, thus:

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          Ok, the span between the straws is
          a timeline of the next 30 years.

                         THIS
          (the left straw)
          is the present moment, right now.

                         AND THIS
          (the right straw)
          is the moment thirty years from now
          when I was sent back. The machine
          is tuned to a fixed time, you know
          that, 30 some years, it's not
          adjustable.

                         JOE
          What's the pepper?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         OLD JOE
          The pepper is a sort of fog. See
          my memories start clear here,
          (at the right straw)
          but as they go back they get
          cloudier, until they're totally
          obscured. It's like a fog.
          Because my memories aren't really
          memories, they're one possible
          eventuality now, and they grow
          clearer or cloudier as they become
          more or less likely. But then they
          get to the present moment
          (the left straw)
          And they're instantly clear again.
          Like a wall of fog moving forward
          with the present moment. I can
          remember what you do after you do
          it.
          He pushes the left straw slowly towards the right, and it
          pushes the pepper with it.

                         JOE
          So you can

                         OLD JOE
          And it hurts.

                         JOE
          So when we're apart you can
          remember what I do. After I do it.

                         OLD JOE
          Uh huh. But
          Beatrix brings their food, two identical plates. Old Joe
          awkwardly clears away the pepper and straws.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          This is a precise description of a
          fuzzy mechanism. Time travel fucks
          everything, my brain and body try
          to catch up. It's messy. That's
          why it's dangerous. And it hurts.
          All I know I know two things for
          sure. I know what's happening in my
          head. And I know that you're still
          going to meet her.

                         JOE
          Who?
          Old Joe takes a worn double of Joe's POCKET WATCH from his
          pocket, clicks it open. We don't see inside it, but he
          stares at it intently.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

          JOE (CONT'D)
          This is a woman, what? I'm going to
          fall in love with?

                         OLD JOE
          She's gonna save your life.
          Old Joe makes eye contact with Joe, for maybe the first time,
          and holds it. Unexpectedly naked on his face is the deepest
          sort of grief. Deep and unrelenting. Joe can't look at it,
          he breaks off his gaze.
          The grief is too much for Old Joe to swallow back down, so he
          turns it into anger.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          For a long time at the beginning
          she thought we'd have a baby. She
          would have been a good mother. She
          wanted that so much. And now I'm
          saying sorry to a picture.

                         JOE
          She's. How is she, you said save
          my life.

                         OLD JOE
          Your life. Let's look. At your
          life. You're a killer and a
          junkie. And a fucking child
          mentality, âMy life,â âwhat's
          mine.â Save your life, you're
          asking how? The question is why.
          Why would someone waste themselves
          on you, give up the good life they
          had, sacrifice a good life to love
          you.

                         JOE
          My life is my own, I don't need it

                         SAVED

                         OLD JOE
          Shut your fucking child mouth.
          She's going to clean you up and
          you're going to take her love like
          a sponge and you're both going to
          pretend that she's saved you,
          you're so self absorbed and stupid.

                         (BEAT)
          Yesterday. Thirty years from now
          is yesterday. And I can remember
          it, it's going to happen. Let me
          tell you what's going to happen to
          this woman who saved your worthless
          life.
          A GREEN DOOR - Kicked in with all the violence in the world.

          INT. FRENCH COTTAGE - MORNING (FLASHBACK)

          His Wife spins, as Gangsters burst into the entryway.
          Old Joe in bed. It plays out again. He leaps to his feet,
          is tackled by the Gangsters. They drag Old Joe from the
          bedroom. Though the hall, Joe sees the woman struggling
          against two Gangsters, her dress torn and bloody. One
          approaches her with the knife.
          Old Joe screams, struggles, but cannot stop them from doing
          what they do to her.

          INT. DINER

          Joe is not sure where to put his eyes.

                         OLD JOE
          Have you heard of the Rainmaker?

                         JOE
          Seth said, that night. A new boss
          in the future, he said.

                         OLD JOE
          The Rainmaker came out of nowhere
          and in the span of six months took
          total control of the five major
          syndicates.

                         JOE
          That would take an army.

                         OLD JOE
          But he didn't have an army. Legend
          is he did it alone. Alone alone.
          Don't know I believe the legend but
          he didn't have an army.

                         JOE
          How did he do it?

                         OLD JOE
          That's the question. And no one
          knows. Not only that, there's no
          pictures of him. It's insane.
          There's stories he has a synthetic
          jaw. Things like that. But word
          spread quick about him through the
          ex-looper grapevine, even before
          his mass executions and vagrant
          purges and reign of terror, because
          the first thing he did was start
          closing loops. All of them.
          Exterminating the whole program.
          Cleaning house.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.
          Old Joe pulls the folded papers he printed at the library out
          of his jacket, puts them on the table.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          Do you know what this is? This
          number. This number.
          On the back of his papers he scrawls the number: 07153902935.
          As he writes it, a phone starts ringing, bringing us into:

          INT. OFFICE - DAY - FLASHBACK

          An 8th story office, under siege. Gangsters down in the
          street fire up at the windows with guns. Helicopters pass
          by. The office door is blocked shut with a filing cabinet.
          On the phone - the looper DALE, but in his mid 50s. Battered
          and terrified. Holding a piece of paper, reading off it, on
          the phone with Old Joe.
          The wall with the door in it EXPLODES inward.

          INT. FRENCH LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - FLASHBACK

          The line goes dead. Old Joe hangs up. Looks at his hand,
          with the number. Standing in his cottage, before he was sent
          back. Through the window, his wife working in the garden.
          Old Joe closes his hand.

          OLD JOE (V.O.)
          This is a piece of identifying
          information on the Rainmaker. I
          can use it to find him, now, and
          stop him from killing my wife.

          INT. DINER

          Old Joe showing the number to Joe.

                         JOE
          None of this concerns me. We're
          done we're gonna walk outside now.

                         OLD JOE
          This is going to happen

                         JOE
          It happened to you, it doesn't have
          to happen to me.
          (points: the pocket watch)
          You got her picture in there? Show
          it to me. Show me her picture.
          And when I see her for the first
          time I'll walk away, and she won't
          be with me.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          I guarantee the instant I look at
          her picture that fog in your brain
          will swallow up the memories of her
          and she'll be gone.

                         OLD JOE
          Gone.

                         JOE
          She'll be safe. And then we can
          all do what we have to do.
          A beat. Old Joe holding the pocket watch, gazing at it.
          Then he snaps it closed in his fist, drawing it back.

                         OLD JOE
          No you don't understand. We don't
          have to give her up. I'm going to
          tell you why I'm here now.
          He puts his hand on the folded papers.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          I'm gonna save her.
          A quick beat. Joe goes for his gun. But Old Joe is fast, he
          jams his foot into Joe's crotch, crushing the hidden gun into
          him. Joe cries out, Old Joe grabs his hair and plants his
          face into the table.
          When Joe's hands go to his face Old Joe grabs them and pulls.
          Foot in his crotch, pulling his arms tight over the table.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          The Rainmaker is alive right now.
          Living here, somewhere in this
          county. And I can find him with
          this. I need you to lay low, stay
          out of my way and not get caught.
          I know how to fix this, I won't
          stop till I finish it. I'm going
          to find him and kill him.
          Joe's face loosens, his eyes on their coffee cups.

                         JOE
          It's been awhile since we've gotten
          a warm-up.
          Old Joe realizes, looks around. The diner is eerily quiet.
          Beatrix and the staff have all quietly left. Fled.
          Old Joe swings out of the booth, still holding Joe by the
          hair, dragging him like a doll. Joe's blunderbuss clatters
          to the ground. Old Joe drags him to the window. They look
          out. Nothing in the parking lot. Too quiet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         OLD JOE
          It's been thirty years for me, so
          it's hard to remember. When you
          stole Seth's bike you stripped out
          the security tracker. Right?
          Joe's fearful face says âno.' Old Joe draws his gat.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          Make it to the field, you can lose
          them in the field. Go east and hop

                         A TRAIN
          Joe punches Old Joe square in the jaw, and he goes down. His
          papers and gun fall. The diner door EXPLODES.

                         JOE
          I've got him! He's here!
          A GAT MAN barrels in, his gat blazing. Joe scrambles but Old
          Joe gets the gat.
          With an expert shot Old Joe puts the Gat Man down, but there
          are two more behind him. Pinned behind a booth, Old Joe
          returns fire, glass breaking and chaos.
          Joe grabs at the papers, Old Joe grabs them first and yanks.
          Leaving Joe with a torn-off top sheet.
          Joe scrambles away, down the length of the diner behind the
          booths, back to their table, as the Gat Men and Old Joe have
          their fire fight. Joe's blunderbuss on the ground beneath
          the table. He scoops it up. Turns, and fires at Old Joe.

                         OLD JOE
          Shit.
          Joe's blunderbuss hacks another shot, and the window behind
          Old Joe explodes. Old Joe makes his break, sprints for the
          broken window, jumps...

          EXT. BACK OF DINER - MORNING

          ...and hits the dusty parking lot running. Towards the corn.

          EXT. FRONT OF DINER

          Kid Blue squats on his haunches with four more Gat Men, their
          guns trained on the diner door. Three Gat Men burst out,
          followed by Joe.

          DINER GAT MAN
          The back, he's running!

                         JOE
          Around back!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.
          They all run around back, where Old Joe is halfway to the
          corn but not there yet.
          The seven Gat Men and Kid Blue and Joe fire their guns after
          him while running but they're too far away (and they're
          running) so nothing hits. Joe blasts at the old man blindly,
          sprinting with all his might, eyes streaming tears in the
          dust.
          When Old Joe hits the wall of corn he seems to vanish. Four
          of the Gat Men follow him in, while the remaining pursuers
          slow to a stop, doubled over, panting. Defeated.
          It takes a few seconds for Kid Blue to realize that Joe is
          there with them. It takes another second for Joe to realize
          that the dynamic has changed. He turns and runs back towards
          the diner, Kid Blue and the Gat men in pursuit. One of the
          Gat Men fires.

                         KID BLUE
          Alive! No, alive!
          Joe makes it to the Slat Bike, jumps on, hits the ignition.

          CLICK.

                         JOE
          No fuck no fucking piece of shit
          CLICK CLICK. The Kid and the Gats closing in, and just the
          moment that Kid Blue lays his hands on the back of the bike
          the engine turns over with a ROAR.
          The back of the bike kicks up, heat and air blasts from the
          open slats beneath, blowing Kid Blue back on his ass. The
          bike HOVERS a few feet off the ground.
          Joe roars off into the corn. The Kid is on his feet running
          back to the Gat Men.

                         KID BLUE
          The tracker! Get the tracker!

          EXT. CORN FIELD

          Joe riding at full speed through the thick corn stalks. He
          BAILS, snapping through corn stalks and rolling to a painful
          stop. The bike ZOOMS onward through the stalks, quickly out
          of sight.
          Pained, Joe lies still, breathing hard. Pulls Old Joe's torn
          paper from his pocket. On one side, the number Old Joe
          scribbled: 1027363259 He flips it over. It's a map.
          Mostly of empty farm land, bisected by a bold highway and
          scattered farm houses.
          One of them is CIRCLED IN BLACK.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         SARA

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

          EXT. FIELD - DAWN

          A bare field of churned chocolatey earth. Near its edge juts
          the dead stump of an old tree.
          A YOUNG WOMAN in work clothes named SARA chops away at the
          trunk with a large axe. Over and over, splintering it apart.
          Endless plains of corn surround the field. In the near
          distance, a two story farm house with an adjacent barn.
          Sara focused on her work as the sun rises.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - EARLY MORNING

          Sara fiddles with a garbage can sized DEVICE, and with a
          crackle of mechanic thrusters it floats up and over the corn
          fields, spraying something chemical.

          INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

          Sara makes coffee.

          EXT. FARM HOUSE PORCH - EARLY MORNING

          She sits on a rocking chair, and mimes smoking an invisible
          cigarette.
          Our first good look at her face. Clear and beautiful, but it
          has been here for awhile.
          The morning light changes from steel blue to pale white.
          Rocking gently, fake smoking and drinking coffee. Not going
          anywhere.

          INT. FARM HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING

          Blinds drawn, dark. A FIGURE lies in bed. Sara steps in,
          puts her hand on the sleeping figure's foot.

                         SARA
          C'mon baby. Time to get up.

          INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING

          Cooking eggs. The front door bangs. She looks up.

          INT. FARM HOUSE FOYER

          The screen door bangs in the wind. Sara inspects it. The
          latch is broken. She sighs.
          Then freezes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.
          Through the screen door, some fifty yards across the front
          lawn, the dark figure of a MAN stands at the edge of the corn
          fields. Watching her.
          She watches right back for a long moment.
          Then grabs a shotgun mounted above the door and with no
          hesitation at all plows outside.
          The dark figure vanishes into the corn fields.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN

          Sara storms down the porch and stalks across the lawn,
          shotgun extended. Not fucking around.
          Does not slow her pace until she is ten yards from the corn
          fields, where she plants herself and shouts:

                         SARA
          Listen up fucker. I have shot and
          buried three vagrants in the past
          year. If you want to know the
          Christ's honest truth I'm starting
          to get a taste for it. So I don't
          care what hobo sob story you've
          got, I get a dozen a week and it
          cuts no cash with me. It's me and
          my husband here, we're broke and
          angry at our lot in this world and
          heavily armed. So take some corn
          and move on, but if you show your
          face again I will cut you the fuck
          in half.
          Silence. Just the wind in the corn. A long beat. Then Sara
          turns, walks briskly back.
          Moments later Joe's face pokes through the corn stalks. He
          takes in the farm. The barn behind it. The fallow field.

                         LATER
          Joe sits in the same spot, a few feet in the corn but with a
          clear sight line at the house.
          His gun on his knee.
          JOE'S FACE - Pale, sweating. Something's wrong. He winces.
          Pinches his eyes. Headache.
          The sun pounds down. He looks at the piece of map.

                         JOE
          C'mon. C'mere. C'mon. C'mon.
          C'mon.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

          EXT. CITY - ESTABLISHING - DAY

          Helicopters sweep by.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Abe stands fuming, flanked by two Gat Men. Kid Blue sits
          like a kid in detention.

                         ABE
          Well. You found him. And you
          russeled up a posse and went to git
          âem. Like a good little cowboy
          from one of your movie movies.
          Without telling me.

                         KID BLUE
          I can do it again.

                         ABE
          You can fuck up again? Really.
          You know what happens to me if I
          don't get that old bastard? I got
          too much riding, Kid, I can't
          afford a fuck-up playing cowboy.
          Put your gat on the table.
          Fighting tears now, Kid puts his gun on the desk. But he
          doesn't take his hand off it.

                         KID BLUE
          I wanted you to say I did good,
          that's all I wanted. This is all I
          have.
          Abe puts his hand on the gat. Kids' finger still on the
          trigger. A tense moment. Abe pulls the gun away, across the
          table.

          KID BLUE (CONT'D)
          Please just give me one more
          chance, I'll bring him here alive
          and hold him and you can put a
          bullet in his brain yourself-
          Abe grabs the hammer. SLAMS it on Kid's bad hand, crushing
          it. Kid howls, the Gat Men grab him.

          INT. STEEP STAIRS

          Kid is literally dragged up the stairs by a Gat Man.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          The Gat Man shoves Kid Blue through the twisty maze of
          backstage, past girls and Loopers and men.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.
          The Kid blubbers and bleeds. Humiliated. But he pulls
          himself halfway together. Make a show:

                         KID BLUE
          I'm gonna make this good again. I
          will. I'm gonna be back.

          EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

          Raining. The Gat Man pushes the Kid out the back entrance
          door, into the alley. The Kid instinctively turns towards
          the street.
          But the Gat Man steers him back, deeper into the alley. The
          Kid realizes what this means. Everything changes.

                         KID BLUE
          Oh no. Oh no no no no
          He fights in vain to break from the Gat Man's grip. Weeps,
          begs, clasps at whatever he can grab.
          The Gat Man turns a corner -- towards the alley's dead end.

          KID BLUE (CONT'D)
          No! No! No no no no!
          Shrieking. Annoyed, the Gat Man throws the Kid hard to the
          concrete. The Gat Man pulls his gun, raises it without
          ceremony.
          BANG. The Gat Man's face explodes. Staggers, his gun FIRES
          into the wall. He drops like a doll.
          Kid Blue lies in the rain, hyperventilating. His pant leg
          hiked up, showing his boot with its holster.
          In his mangled left hand, the small caliber PISTOL he keeps
          stashed. His pinkie on the trigger.

          KID BLUE (CONT'D)
          Oh.
          Cradling his crushed hand, dazed, he scampers off like a
          soaked rat.

          EXT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT

          Silent and still. Sara comes out onto the front porch. She
          gathers up a few things, turns out the porch light.
          Notices a floodlight still lit on the BARN across the yard.
          She turns the porch light back on.
          The dark corn fields, silent and vaguely threatening. She
          steps back in the house, emerging again with the shotgun.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

          EXT. FRONT LAWN - NIGHT

          Sara stalks towards the barn, shotgun in hand. Shadows loom
          across the yard. All is silent.

          EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

          She reaches the barn. A hard pool of light from a mounted
          floodlight falls off to inky darkness.
          Hits a metal switch near the barn door and the light snaps
          off. In its absence the darkness swarms.
          She briskly walks back towards the house, but slows. Stops.
          Turns. In the darkness by the barn, crunch crunch. Crunch.
          And maybe a shape. Deep in the swarming dark.

                         SARA
          Hey. Who's there.
          Sara levels the shotgun at the darkness, and steps back.
          Quiet but definite - crunch crunch. And now, definitely a
          shape. A man. coming towards her.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Stop right there. Stop!

          EXT. CORN FIELD - CONTINUOUS

          Joe slumped over unconscious where we left him, in the corn.
          Sara's shout wakes him with a start. Sweating, pasty.
          Disoriented. Something is wrong with him.
          In a flash of panic he parts the corn stalks, sees Sarah
          backing away from the barn. The dark hulking figure of a man
          pursues her slowly but steadily.

                         JOE

                         SHIT
          His hand goes to his holster but his gun has fallen out, he
          scrambles in the dirt for it.

          EXT. FRONT LAWN

          Sara backing up still, shotgun leveled. The man, still in
          darkness, comes towards her.

                         SARA
          You stop right there, you stop!
          She fires her gun in the air. The man pauses, but then
          continues towards her. She trips on a root, FALLS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

          INT. 2ND STORY BEDROOM - NIGHT

          From a CHILD'S POV - We run across a darkened bedroom to the
          WINDOW. A child's hand smacks the glass, and framed through
          the pane, through the unseen child's eyes, this is what we

                         SEE:
          Sara on the ground, fumbling the gun. In trouble. The DARK
          MAN, advancing towards her menacingly.
          At the last moment, from the corn fields, JOE runs into the
          light and steps directly between them, shouts, his gun raised
          at the Dark Man.
          And the Dark Man STOPS.

          EXT. FRONT LAWN - CONTINUOUS

          Joe's gun leveled, face set. But the porch light on the
          man's face: it is not Old Joe.
          It is a man in his 30s, filthy, with down's syndrome. A
          greasy sign around his neck: âPLEASE HELP MUWTE FOOD $ GOD

                         BLESS YOUÂ
          Joe lowers his gun, face melting.

                         SARA
          Jee sus.
          (to the MUTE VAGRANT)
          Hey, hey. I'm going to get you

                         SOME FOOD-
          But the man scampers off, leaving his sign.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          ...great.

          EXT. SECOND STORY BEDROOM WINDOW

          The child, in darkness, watching. He recedes into the
          bedroom, his hand slipping off the glass.

          EXT. FRONT LAWN

          Sara stands, picks up the sign, calls after the MUTE.

                         SARA
          Hey you forgot your greasy goddamn
          hobo sign oh for godssakes.
          (turns to Joe)
          Alright, what are you?
          Joe turns away from her quickly, but doubles over, crumpling
          to a heap on the grass. Sara checks his face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Hey. Look at - hey. The fuck-
          ehh.
          Joe PUKES. She steps away. Takes a moment. Breathes.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

          She drags Joe up onto the porch, under the light.

                         SARA
          Hey. Up here, at the light. Hey.
          Sara SLAPS HIM. Hard. His eyes snap open. He sees her face.
          She feels his head. Checks his eyes. Cherry red and veined,
          swollen under the lids.

                         JOE

                         (TOTALLY GONE)
          My head... splitting apart... time
          eventualities, he said-

                         SARA
          How long since you dropped?

                         JOE

                         DROPPED
          Sara mimes an eye dropper.

                         SARA
          Dropped, or what the kids call it.

                         JOE
          A day.

                         SARA
          One day. Wow.
          She leans back on her haunches, looks at him, deep in
          thought. Deciding what to do. Joe lies prone, shaking,
          sweating.

                         JOE
          Thirsty. I can't feel my legs

                         SARA
          You're withdrawing from a synthetic
          barbiturate. It's a quick punch
          but it's this bad a day in, without
          care you might not make it through
          the night.
          Sara looks at his shoes. Beneath the caked mud, fine
          leather. Her eyes linger on his gun. They turn cold.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.
          She stands quickly without a word, vanishing into the house.
          Joe lies still, breath shallow. Turns his head, hazy.

                         JOE
          Thirsty. Thirsty.
          Soft footsteps approach. Small bare feet padding towards him
          through the front door. A young boy steps out onto the
          porch, 6 years old, named CID.
          Cid looks Joe over. His eyes linger on Joe's gun. Then he
          kneels, his small hands feeling Joe's sweaty face. Pushes a
          straw to Joe's lips. Joe's hands clasp around a plastic cup
          with a cartoon tiger, and he drinks.

          SARA (O.S.)

                         (SHARP)
          Cid. C'mere monkey.
          Cid goes back into the house, leaving his cup with Joe.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS

          Sara tries to pick Cid up but he dodges, walks up the stairs.

                         CID
          Who's that man?

                         SARA
          Just a vagrant babe.

          INT. FARMHOUSE UPPER HALL

          Sara leads him down the hall and into his bedroom.

                         CID
          No he's not.

                         SARA
          Oh yeah?

                         CID
          His shoes are too shiny.

                         SARA
          Well aren't you a smart monkey.

          INT. CID'S BEDROOM

          He gets in bed.

                         CID
          Is he sick?

                         SARA
          Yup.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         CID
          Will he get better?

                         SARA
          Yup.

                         CID
          Promise?

                         SARA
          Go to sleep. Okay. Night baby
          boy.
          Kisses him.

                         CID
          Night Sara.
          Lingers over him in the pale light. Then goes.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          A darkened highway, the lights of the farm house distant. A
          small STAKE BED TRUCK rumbles up, stops on the soft shoulder.
          Sara at the wheel. Sits a second. Then climbs out.
          Roughly pulls Joe out of the flatbed. He lands in the dirt.
          Sara avoids looking at him, closes up the flatbed.
          Joe weakly grabs her ankle. She pries his hand off, and
          discovers CID'S CUP in the dirt beside him. Takes it
          angrily, strides back to the truck.

          INT. STAKE BED TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

          Sara gets in, drops Cid's cup on the seat beside her. Looks
          in her rear view mirror. Leaving a man to die. Looks down
          at Cid's cup. For a long moment.

                         SARA
          Ssssshhit.

          INT. BARN - NIGHT

          Sara lights a gas lamp. Threads a hose from a tank of water
          around the cot. Joe on a metal cot, covered with blankets.

                         SARA
          Water. Drink it, all night, more
          than you think you want.
          Moves a metal bucket next to the bed. Adjusts the blankets.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Aim for the bucket. And don't chew
          your tongue off. In the morning
          we're gonna talk.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          The last thing she does is handcuff his wrist to the cot and
          take his gun. On her way out she puts it on a bench beside
          the door, and turns out the floodlight.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING

          Dawn breaks. Exhausted Gat Men dutifully patrol the streets
          with flashlights, stopping every passerby.
          On the outskirts of the city. Vagrant fires burn distant
          orange. A large drainage pipe drips into a brackish creek.

          INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL

          Underground. We move through it.

          INT. RUNOFF ROOM

          Cavernous space beneath a high street grating, damp and cold.
          Old Joe sits on the ground, methodically cleaning and loading
          his gun. He finishes. Places the gun on top of his folded,
          torn maps. Closes his eyes. Sees:

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT (OLD JOE MEMORY)

          A bank of fog clears, revealing Sara's face looking down at
          us. She slaps us hard.

                         SARA
          Hey.

          INT. RUNOFF ROOM

          Old Joe touches his temple. Head aching. Remembering.

                         OLD JOE
          The first time I saw her face.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT (OLD JOE MEMORY)

          Sara's face. SLAP!

                         SARA
          Hey.

          INT. RUNOFF ROOM


                         OLD JOE
          No. No no.
          His POCKET WATCH sits open in front of him. He picks it up.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT (OLD JOE MEMORY)

          Sara's face. SLAP!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

          INT. RUNOFF ROOM

          Old Joe holds his pocket watch tight like a talisman.
          Fingers dug deep in his head.

                         OLD JOE
          No. The first time I saw her face.

          INT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT

          A fist comes straight at us. SMACK!
          We reel back, revealing: the Paris club, crowded and rowdy.
          A piece of Old Joe's life that we've seen before.
          Joe (mid 40s) lies on the ground, lip bloodied, laughing
          hysterically at a YOUNG PUNK who has just hit him. A bar
          fight blossoms in slow motion all around.
          Joe looks up, sees the woman who will be his Wife for the
          first time. In her green dress. Whisps of fog drift into
          frame.

          INT. RUNOFF ROOM

          Inside Old Joe's pocket watch, a picture. Of his WIFE.
          The sun breaks in through the grate above. Old Joe closes
          the pocket watch, holds in tight. Then he stands and picks
          up the gun and goes.

                         CUT TO:
          A child stands in a massive doorway with blinding white light
          beaming through.
          JOE'S FACE - wrecked, but his eyes flutter. Blink.

          INT. BARN - MORNING

          Joe lies on the cot. Blinks. The barn doors, the morning
          sun rising through. If the child was there, he's gone now.

          INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING

          Cid draws at the kitchen table. Sara enters.

                         SARA
          Morning monkey.

                         CID
          The man's up.
          Sara stiffens, looks out the window.

                         CID (CONT'D)
          Is he staying here now?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         SARA
          No.

          A WALL OF LEAVES
          Fingers part the green, and Old Joe peers through the dense
          foliage.

          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING

          Old Joe hides in the trees across the street from a suburban
          track home.
          A young boy in a bright jacket runs out the front door and
          off down the street.
          Old Joe checks the folded map in his trembling hands. On it,
          this house is circled in black, exactly like Sara's farm.
          Stuffing the map in his pocket, he pushes out through the
          trees.

          EXT. BARN - MORNING

          Sara approaches the barn, her shotgun in hand.
          Joe sits on the ground just outside the open barn door, the
          metal cot behind him still handcuffed to his wrist.
          Methodically cleaning and loading his gun.

                         SARA
          Toss it.
          Joe freezes. Then, half annoyed

                         JOE
          I just finished cleaning - alright.
          Tosses it into the dirt. Sara lowers the shotgun slightly.

                         SARA
          How do you feel?

                         JOE
          I'm at thirty percent.

                         SARA
          Take it slow and by the end of the
          week you'll be at fifty. Good.
          She tosses him a key, he unlocks his handcuff.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          I took you in so you wouldn't die,
          and now you're not going to die.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          So take the morning to rest, then
          you need to get off my farm.

                         JOE
          I can't do that.

                         SARA
          I'm sorry?

                         JOE
          I need to stay here for a little
          while longer.

                         SARA
          I am not cool with that.

                         JOE
          Well I'm sorry.

                         SARA
          Well I'm sorry too, you just lost
          your take the morning to rest
          privileges, get off my farm.

                         JOE
          No.
          Sara raises the shotgun.

                         SARA
          Get off my farm.

                         JOE
          No. You couldn't scare a retarded
          hobo with that thing. Literally.

                         SARA
          This is a Remington 870, one blast
          could cut you the fuck in half.

                         JOE
          And that's, that's telling. You're
          holding a gun. I say I'm not
          afraid, so you describe the gun to
          me. But it's not the gun I'm not
          afraid of.

                         (BEAT)
          What are you gonna shoot in the
          air? Blow a hole in your barn? To
          scare me? Go ahead. But you
          couldn't let me die, you won't kill
          me.

                         SARA
          So now I saved your life that makes
          me weak?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         JOE
          Look I'm not a threat to you or
          your boy. I need to be on your
          property but I'd prefer to not have
          any contact with you at all, I'll
          stay in the fields. There's just
          one thing you need to do for me,
          and you won't have to deal with me
          again.
          He takes the map from his pocket, unfolds it. Tosses it over
          to her.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Just, verify for me that's your
          house on the map. So I know I'm in
          the right place.

                         SARA
          What is this?

                         JOE
          A map.

                         SARA
          That's my house. Why is it marked?

                         JOE
          Doesn't matter. Ok. I'll be out
          of the barn in an hour, if you can
          spare it I'll take the water jug
          with me. Does that well have
          water? I'll fill it from there.
          Sara turns the map over. Sees the NUMBER that Old Joe wrote
          on the back. 07153902935.
          And everything changes.

                         SARA
          What is this.
          She shows him the number. She is not asking what the number
          is - she knows. Joe is suddenly not so relaxed.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          What is this.

                         JOE
          Does that mean something to you?
          For the first time in their conversation, Joe looks in her
          eyes. Sara stares daggers, searching. Very different than
          she was ten seconds ago.
          Joe scoots back

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         JOE (CONT'D)

                         HEY-
          And without hesitating Sara hefts the shotgun and SHOOTS HIM.
          BLAST! Rips his shirt open bloody, blows him back screaming.

          EXT. PARK

          Old Joe STOPS in his tracks, children running around him.
          His hand goes to his temple.

          EXT. BARN - DAY (OLD JOE MEMORY)

          Fog clears from Sara blasting us with her shotgun.

          EXT. PARK

          Old Joe's hand runs from his temple to his neck. Feels a new
          but old scar, just a little divot behind his ear.

          INT. BARN

          Sara drags Joe in by the foot. She heaves the barn door
          closed. In the lamp lit dark Joe rolls and groans in the
          dirt.

                         SARA
          Who are you?
          She shoves the shotgun barrel in his face, a rush of fury

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          You're right I'm not a killer but I
          am fine with how a blast of rock
          salt to your face won't kill you.
          Who are you and what are you here
          for? Who are you?
          Joe breathes hard, bleeding in the dirt with a shotgun in his
          nose. But he forces calm. A beat. Then he starts talking.

                         JOE
          Time travel hasn't been invented
          yet. But in thirty years it will
          be.

          EXT. PARK - DAY

          A suburban park. On its far end, a birthday party.
          The YOUNG BOY in the bright jacket we saw run out of the
          house earlier sits alone under a tree.
          Old Joe approaches him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         OLD JOE
          Hi. Daniel, right? I'm Chad's
          father. Aren't you going to come
          over? We're doing cake.

                         DANIEL
          It's ice cream cake and I can't eat
          ice cream. Cause of the milk.

                         OLD JOE
          Well you should join the party even
          if you don't have cake. You have a
          birthday coming up?

                         DANIEL
          In July. We were gonna go to the
          lake but I don't think we are now.

                         OLD JOE
          I'm sorry.
          Old Joe leaves, walks across the grass. Having trouble
          breathing.

          INT. BARN

          Sara sits. Joe weakly talks, the end of a long explanation.

                         JOE
          I can't go back to the city and
          find him cause Abe, the boss, all
          his men are going to search the
          streets 24/7 till they turn up me
          or... him. All I have is this map.
          And that he's coming here.
          Sara stands. Paces away. Deep in thought.

                         SARA
          A Looper.

                         JOE
          Yeah. Did you know about Loopers,
          what we do

                         SARA
          I've heard stories. So he's coming
          here to murder me and my son
          because he thinks we might be this
          Rainmaker. And once he kills the
          Rainmaker, what happens?

                         JOE
          I think... he thinks, the instant
          the rainmaker dies, he'll never
          have been sent back, so he'll just
          vanish, and be back with his wife.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET

          The same track home Old Joe studied from the trees earlier.
          Daniel trots towards it, coming home from the birthday party.

          INT. BARN


                         SARA
          Who is he? The guy you let run?
          Just some random guy from the
          future?

                         JOE
          Yeah. Someone. You know what
          these numbers mean.

          EXT. SUBURBAN HOME BACK YARD - DAY

          Well tended by someone who loves growing things. Laurels,
          ivy on trellises, flowers and trees.
          Daniel comes through the side gate. Lifts the back door
          matt, revealing a dusty key.

          INT. BARN

          Sara takes a pen from a workbench. Shows Joe the numbers:

                         07153902935
          She draws lines with the pen, thus:

                         07/15/39[02935]

                         SARA
          This is my son Cid's birthday. And
          this is the hospital he was born
          in.
          Joe's face, taking this in.

          EXT. SUBURBAN HOME BACK YARD

          Old Joe. Sitting in a corner of the yard. Face set hard.
          Daniel stands, key in hand. Drops the matt. Slow motion.
          Turns. Sees Old Joe, standing now.
          Stillness between them. OLD JOE'S FACE. Struggling to be
          stone, and then it is.
          He draws his gun in one fluid motion and FIRES.
          We don't hear the shot. We just hear the garden, the wind
          through the plants.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          And we just see Old Joe's face. Struggling now to remain
          stone.
          Numb he puts his gun away and exits.

          EXT. PARK

          Old Joe walks across the park. Map in his hand. Children
          play in the distance. Children's voices all around.
          Old Joe spins, his breath up into his head.
          The map falls to the ground. The park around him, green and
          full of children.
          He keels over onto his knees and cries. Grabs the grass,
          holds it in his fingers, thick and green.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

          The Wife stands at the edge of a bed. 35 and Full of life.
          Old Joe on the bed. Mid 40s.
          She unsnaps her GREEN DRESS and it falls, leaving her naked
          in the sunlight.

                         LATER
          On the bed. Old Joe and the Wife. Faces close. Drifting
          into sleep. From a neighboring apartment, a BABY CRIES.
          Loud and insistent.
          Old Joe opens his eyes, joking-annoyed at the crying baby.
          âGod you have to be kidding me.â
          Then he sees her face. Her smiling eyes, listening to the
          neighbor's baby cry. Like she's listening to music. She
          touches his hand.

          EXT. PARK

          Old Joe. Staring at the grass. On the map beside him:
          three circled houses around the city. And the torn corner.

          INT. BARN

          Sara holds the torn piece of map in her hands. Their house
          circled.

                         SARA
          Would he do this?

                         JOE
          Think about what doing this would
          fix. What he thinks it would fix.
          Sara caught that, and she did not like it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          He'll kill the other kids on that
          map and then come here last. Put
          off facing me.

                         SARA
          If he comes here, can you stop him?
          She turns the paper over in her hands.

          SARA (CONT'D)
          Given this, if I erred on the side
          of caution and believed all of
          this, I'm asking. If I trusted
          you. Will you stop him before he
          gets to my son?

                         JOE
          I've lost my life. I kill this
          man, I get it back. You can trust
          me.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - LATER

          They sit on the steps, Joe stripped to the waist. Sara picks
          salt chunks from his chest with tweezers and antiseptic.
          Joe surveys the surrounding land, cleaning his gun.

                         JOE
          We're surrounded by the corn, that
          leaves us blind. He can get within
          fifty yards of the house without a
          hawk spotting him.

                         (BEAT)
          What makes sense is, we burn the
          fields, level them.
          Sara realizes he's seriously asking.

                         SARA
          No you cannot burn down my corn
          fields.

                         JOE
          What kind of equipment's in the
          barn?

                         SARA
          Farm equipment.

                         JOE
          Nothing that shoots.

                         SARA
          No farm equipment that shoots. No.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.
          Joe finishes assembling his gun. Sara's eyes flick to it.

          SARA (CONT'D)
          You use what you need, set up
          anywhere. But one thing, I don't
          want you talking to Cid. I watch
          my son, you watch the corn. That's
          the deal.

                         JOE
          Good by me.
          He hisses as she applies antiseptic to a gash in his arm.

                         SARA
          Hold still. Easy for things to get
          infected on a farm, start falling
          off.

                         (SOTTO)
          Pussy.
          Caught off guard, Joe almost smiles. Then grimaces.

                         JOE
          If I'm out here and you're in the
          house we're gonna need some way to
          communicate.

                         SARA
          There's a dinner bell down by the
          barn, ring that if someone's
          coming, I'll hear it.

                         JOE
          Dinner bell. We need walkies, or
          buzzers.

                         SARA
          Dunno what we've got but I'll look.
          She spots Cid at the screen door, watching them.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Cid.
          She goes to take him inside.

                         JOE
          Got any ammo for that shotgun?
          That isn't a seasoning?

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS

          Sara leads Cid back into the house.

                         SARA
          How's the maths coming?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         CID
          I wanna help the man.

                         SARA
          Help him what?

                         CID
          I could help him with my toys.

                         SARA
          Baby. Listen. I need you to stay
          away from that man. Okay? Let him-

                         HEY
          Cid squirms out of her grasp, bats her away with a light but
          angry slap. She grabs his arm harder.

          SARA (CONT'D)
          Let him do his thing, but you stay
          with me.

                         CID
          Is he not good?

                         SARA
          Well we're gonna see what he is.
          But you stick with me. Yeah?

          INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL - EVENING

          Old Joe's little hide-out. He violently washes his hands in
          a trench of water.
          Slumps back, eyes blood red. Streaks of tears down his face.
          Reddish light fading to blue through the grating high above.
          Runs fingers across his forehead, spreading cooling water.
          His eyes close. His breathing shallows.
          In one hand he holds his pocket watch. He places the other
          on the gat. The map beneath it.
          Daniel's map location CROSSED OUT. Two others remaining.
          And the missing corner, edge torn.
          CLOSE ON Old Joe's face. Slipping to sleep.
          Then from nowhere a CHILD'S HAND enters frame and rests on
          his forehead. Old Joe's eyes gasp open with terror

          EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

          but it's Joe who wakes up with a start. Slumped against the
          steps, gun in hand.
          Cid's hand on his forehead. Cid steps back quickly, puts his
          finger to his lips. Shhh.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - NIGHT

          Cid leads Joe inside, beckoning him to follow.

          INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN

          Dark. Cid leads Joe to the kitchen table. Laid out on it:
          an arrangement of toys.
          With the deliberateness of a man at work Cid clicks on a
          flashlight and sets it on the table.
          Works on several toys, cracking open cases, pulling out
          wires. Hands moving fast. Joe sits, watching Cid.

                         CID
          Hand me that Phillips.
          Joe hands him the screwdriver. Cid keeps working.

                         CID (CONT'D)
          Tell me if you hear her coming.

                         JOE
          What are we doing here?

                         CID
          Commundication.
          He pushes a button on a small plastic box in his hands, and
          an identical one next to Joe lights up.
          The way Joe looks at Cid changes slightly.

                         CID (CONT'D)
          But I need to make it stronger.

                         JOE
          How do you do that?

                         CID
          Bigger battery.
          Joe idly fingers a toy.

                         JOE
          Smart.

                         CID
          Do you kill people?
          Joe half laughs. Cid keeps working, his face in shadows.

                         AFTER AWHILE:

                         JOE
          Let's say I kill people.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         CID
          With your gun?

                         JOE
          Uh huh.
          Cid looks at him in the dark. Not scared at all. Then he
          goes back to fitting the backing on a toy.
          A long beat, Joe thinking.
          Broken by a PIERCING NOISE.
          They both jump - the toy truck Joe has idly played with is
          shrieking, sirens blaring.
          Joe fumbles with it, Cid reaches over and switches it off,
          they both freeze.
          And look up at the ceiling.
          Silence in the house.
          With a look of reproach beyond his years, Cid takes the truck
          from Joe and finishes up his work.

          JOE (CONT'D)
          How long have you and your mom been
          on the farm?

                         CID
          She's not my mom. My mom got
          killed when I was a baby. Someone
          bad, bad men killed her.
          Cid sets the two finished BUZZERS on the table.

                         JOE
          I'm sorry.

                         CID
          Sara doesn't think I remember cause
          I was a baby. But I remember my
          mom. I couldn't stop her getting
          killed. I don't remember it all
          but I remember. I was a baby. I
          couldn't do anything. I couldn't
          stop it. Cause I was a baby.
          Cid is crying. Joe has never been more at a loss.

                         JOE
          I'm sorry
          Takes the buzzers. Stands, fumbling. Retreating.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

          JOE (CONT'D)
          You should talk to your mom about
          this.

                         CID
          She's not my mom. She's a liar.
          With one last look back at Cid in the dark, Joe exits.

          SMASH CUT TO:

          EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS STREET - NIGHT

          Old Joe. Running hard. Sirens, flashlights behind him.
          Being chased.
          Zig zags through an alleyway, a pursuing car smashing up
          behind him.
          Bursts out onto the street, nearly hit by another car.
          Shouts all around, a few shots. Surrounding. He runs.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          A Gat Man briefing Abe, who hasn't gotten much sleep lately.

                         GAT MAN 1

          Every fucking car, every gat, every
          cop - get âem down there! Flood
          that fucker! Take him down!

          EXT. CITY STREETS - SEEN FROM HIGH IN THE AIR

          Cars, motorcycles, cop prowlers, all roar to life and blaze
          through the city streets in one direction.

          INT/EXT. HALF BUILT HIGHRISE

          Kid Blue, squatting in the 10th story of a half finished
          highrise, looks down on the activity in the streets.
          Spread on the floor are maps with notes. He's been searching
          for Old Joe.
          And now his eyes are alight. He bolts for the stairs.

          EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS STREETS - NIGHT

          A small park on one block. With a playground. Swings, and a
          merry-go-round. Gat men sweep the park.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          After they pass, Old Joe's face pops up under the merry-go-
          round. He crouches in a shallow space beneath it.
          He sees: Across from the park, a cheap APARTMENT BUILDING.
          He checks his map - the 2nd circled address. Kid number two.
          He waits.

          EXT. FIELD - EARLY MORNING

          Sara chops the dead tree trunk in the field, greatly
          diminished but still formidable. Joe approaches.

                         JOE
          Can't you pull that out with a
          plow?

                         SARA
          Uh huh.
          She keeps chopping.

                         JOE
          I found a, in the barn I found some
          parts, and I made a, thing.
          Joe pushes one of Cid's BUZZERS into her hands, which we now
          see is a colorful plastic frog toy with a light bulb nose.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          If you see anything, just push
          that, and,
          Joe pushes the button on his buzzer, and Sara's lights up and
          vibrates. She regards the toy, then stares hard and cold at
          Joe.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          It's important.

                         SARA
          When?

                         JOE
          Last night. He woke me up. Don't
          tell him I told you though, he...
          Sara rolls her eyes, turns away. Starts chopping again. Joe
          doesn't leave.

                         SARA
          What?

                         JOE
          You said you were his mom.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         SARA
          Uh huh.

                         JOE
          He told me you're not.
          This hits Sara hard. She resumes chopping to cover it.

                         SARA
          He said that?

                         JOE
          If he's not your son who is he?

                         SARA

                         (SHARP)
          He's my son.

                         (BEAT)
          I had Cid when I was twenty two.
          But I didn't want to give up my
          life. In the city.
          The word âcityâ has weight for her. Implies volumes.

          SARA (CONT'D)
          So I dropped Cid with my mom, here.
          And my sister. And they saw how I
          was living and they took him. My
          sister raised him here, she loved
          him. He called her mom.

                         JOE
          How'd she get killed?
          When Sara's eyes hit him they're daggers.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Cid told me. You have to talk to
          him about it.
          Icy silence from Sara, and an odd stare.

                         SARA
          I told you one thing, I told you to
          stay away from my son.

                         JOE
          He asked about my gun. You think
          this is going to go away if you
          don't talk to him about it but it's
          just gonna grow

                         SARA
          Stay out of it. Stay the fuck away
          from my son.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.
          She goes back to chopping. Joe lingers, then leaves. She
          hacks away.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - EARLY MORNING

          Sara sits with coffee, looking out at the fields. Deep in
          thought.
          She takes a drag from her pretend cigarette.

          EXT. CHEAP APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING

          A motel style building. Gat Men in cars pass occasionally
          with spotlights and radios, but the activity has calmed.
          Old Joe slips around a corner. Staying hid. Checks the
          address on the map. 12 Talbott Dr, #205.
          Makes a break for stairs leading to the 2nd level. But just
          at that moment a car pulls into the building's lot.
          Old Joe ducks under the stairs. Holding his breath.
          The car parks. Door slams. Footsteps. A WOMAN. Slumping
          exhausted, up the stairs.
          And through the slatted steps Old Joe sees her face flash by.
          It is Suzie, the girl from Abe's brothel. Old Joe's face,
          pure disbelief. He recognizes her instantly. It can't be.
          He gingerly steps half a foot out. Looking up he can see the
          apartment doors above. Suzie walks down the landing.
          Towards apartment 205.
          Jesus it can't be.
          Then she passes it. Keeps walking. Old Joe's eyes,
          relieved.
          She stops at the next door over, knocks. It opens, vaguely
          indistinct conversation between her and the girl that
          answers.

                         SUZIE
          Sorry, I know I promised five, you
          know how it gets.

                         GIRL NEIGHBOR
          Don't worry sugar. She was no
          problem. Gat men searched through
          here, lookin for god knows...
          Suzie disappears into the apartment. Re-emerges, holding a
          sleeping 6 year old girl. She whispers goodbye to the
          neighbor and walks back to APARTMENT 205. She enters.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.
          Old Joe, frozen. Gun in his hand. Face numbly: âYou have to
          be shitting me.â
          He climbs the stairs. On the 2nd story landing. To 205.
          Breath held, back against the wall. Peeks in the window.
          On the couch, Suzie holding her daughter. Head in her lap.
          Stroking her hair. Suzie's back is to us, and with her long
          red hair down, she is eerily reminiscent of Old Joe's wife.
          Old Joe watches them for a long time.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT PORCH - DAY

          Joe sits, watching the corn. It rustles in the wind. Hand
          on his blunderbuss. Beside it, his frog buzzer.
          The tension is constant. And it's a long, long day.

          INT. FARMHOUSE HALLWAY - LATER

          Sara vacuums while Cid plays with toy trucks.

          INT. FARMHOUSE LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER

          In the basement, bare concrete. Sara empties the dryer.

          INT. CID'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

          Sara sits on the floor with Cid, putting numbered tiles on a
          plastic multiplication table.

                         SARA
          Where does 56 go? Good. 21.

                         CID
          How long can you not sleep?

                         SARA
          I don't know, awhile. That's a
          good question. Where's it go.
          Good, there. 32.

                          CID
           We should help Joe watch.

                          SARA
          Joe?

                          CID
          Cause he can't stay awake all the
          time.

                         SARA
          He isn't our business.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         CID
          He's keeping us safe

                         SARA
          Baby. Let's do this now. You have
          32 there, I know you know this one.

                         CID
          I want to help him.
          Sara is distracted by a distant bell-like DINGING.

                         SARA
          Cid. 32.
          She goes to the window, looks out, nervous.
          But it's just a loose LAUNDRY LINE down in the yard, whipping
          in the wind against its metal pole. In the distance, Joe
          paces the yard.
          Relieved, Sara returns to Cid. He sets the tile, petulant.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          No. Eight times three is what?

                         CID
          Thirty two.

                         SARA
          Eight times three is what?

                         CID
          Thirty two.

                         SARA
          I want you to count three eights.

                         CID
          Eight. Sixteen. Thirty two.

                         SARA
          Are you telling me you want alone
          time?

                         CID
          No.

                         SARA
          Okay. Why don't you put that where
          it belongs?
          Deliberately, Cid lifts the tile and sets it straight back
          down on the same spot.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Alone time.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.
          Then like a knife in a fist fight:

                         CID
          He's protecting us cause you can't
          do it.

                         SARA
          Ok. I told you to stay away from

                         HIM

                         CID
          I never did anything

                         SARA
          Do you think I'm stupid?

                         CID
          So?

                         SARA
          I told you already
          Cid is building into a temper tantrum fast.

                         CID
          So?

                         SARA
          You do what I tell you

                         CID
          You can't tell me what to do you're
          not my mom.
          (a deadly beat)
          You're not my mom! You're a liar
          and you're gonna get killed and you
          won't stop lying!
          Cid lunges at her, Sara slaps him back.
          Not hard, but Cid scoots back, eyes furious.

                         SARA

                         CID BABY

                         CID
          You're a liar! Liar! I hate you
          because you're lying! I hate you!
          Liar! You're lying to me!
          Sara scoots back.

                         SARA

                         CID

                         CID
          You're lying!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.
          Cid stands, balls his fists, SCREAMING at her. Sara pushes
          back away from him.
          Maybe a cloud passed over the sun. The room darkens.
          And we see it now, in her eyes: Sara is afraid. She bolts
          out of the room.

          EXT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

          Sara walks fast down the hall

          INT. SARA'S BEDROOM

          Not slowing, through her bedroom

          INT. SARA'S CLOSET

          Into her walk-in closet, to a huge steel safe tucked in back.
          She opens the safe with trembling hands. And climbs inside.

          INT. SAFE

          Closes the heavy door. Turns on a small LED light.
          And waits. Cid's screams distant but not lessening.

          EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

          Cid's screams from the house, clear as day.
          Joe paces in front of the barn. Turns his head back towards
          the house, not sure what to think.
          The screams stop. Joe turns uneasily back to the swaying
          corn.

          INT. CID'S BEDROOM

          The math game scattered, numbered tiles everywhere. Cid lies
          face down on the bed, cried out.
          Sara enters quietly. Sits on the bed beside him. Strokes
          his hair. He folds into her, and they're holding each other
          tight.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

          A Gat Man named CANADY strolls out of a donut shop, coffee in
          hand, and gets in his car.

          INT. CANADY'S CAR

          Canady starts the car up, starts driving.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.
          Somehow not seeing Kid Blue crouched clear as day in the
          passenger side foot-well.

                         KID BLUE
          Hey Can. Can.
          Canady sees him, jumps and yelps.
          The sedan swerves, scrapes to a stop against a parked car.
          Coffee everywhere.

                         CANADY
          Jesus, fuckin Kid Blue what the

                         FUCK

                         KID BLUE
          Pull into that alley.

                         CANADY
          You get the fuck outta

                         KID BLUE
          You don't wanna be seen with me
          Canady, pull in the alley.
          Canady glares at him, but pulls the car into a narrow alley,
          parks it.

                         CANADY
          The fuck are you still doing in
          town, Abe wants you dead man

                         KID BLUE
          All Abe wants right now is the
          looper. Unless he got him last
          night?

                         CANADY
          Jssshhh. No we didn't get him.
          Spotted and lost him. West End,
          near Whore's Alley.

                         KID BLUE
          Whore's Alley?

                         CANADY
          That area, Mott & Talbott, little
          working girl colony.

                         KID BLUE
          (has a thought)
          Whore's Alley..

                         CANADY
          You shoulda left town man.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         KID BLUE
          I'm gonna bring him in, get right
          with Abe.

                         CANADY
          Yeah, maybe you bring him the
          looper, but short of that Abe don't
          get right with priced men.

                         KID BLUE
          I got a price?

                         CANADY
          Big one.
          Canady locks the car doors.
          And in that one moment, Kid Blue pulls Canady's gun from his
          holster. Holds it on him. A tense moment.

                         CANADY (CONT'D)
          Course I'd never turn a friend for

                         A PRICE

          EXT. ALLEYWAY

          BANG and the drivers side window explodes outward bloody.
          A moment, then Kid Blue stumbles out, holding his ears in
          pain. Off down the alley and out of sight.

          INT. CID'S BEDROOM

          Sara lies with Cid, both asleep.
          Distant but sharp, a bell ringing. It's unmistakable this
          time. The DINNER BELL. Sara's eyelids flutter. She hears.
          Stiffens.
          The bell stops suddenly. She stands, careful not to wake
          Cid.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS

          Sara rushes quietly down the stairs.
          Through a doorway, she sees the Frog Buzzer sitting on the
          living room coffee table. Lit up and buzzing.
          She goes to the front door, throws it open. And is face to
          face with a tall Gat Man named JESSE. She freezes.

                         JESSE
          Evenin ma'am.

                         SARA
          Evenin. How can I help you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.
          Joe is nowhere in sight.

                         JESSE
          You can start by accepting my
          apologies re the hour, I hope I
          didn't catch you in supper.

                         SARA
          No, that's fine.

                         JESSE
          Yours was the last house on my list
          today, been walking between empty
          farms all day in the hot sun.
          Thought I'd tick this off my list,
          not have to come back tomorrow.

                         SARA
          What's this about?
          Back in the house somewhere, a screen door bangs.

                         JESSE
          You alone here, ma'am?

                         SARA
          My husband should be back from the
          city, any time now.

                         JESSE
          Happy to hear. Could I trouble you
          for some water?

                         SARA
          Course. I'll get some, you can
          take the glass with you.

                         JESSE
          Actually ma'am, my business
          tonight, this ticking off the list
          business, it's gonna require me
          coming in. If that's alright.
          Jesse shifts his weight, and Sara notices his heavy boot is
          now a few inches over the door jam.

                         SARA
          Will you tell me what this is
          about?

                         JESSE
          I will, yes. Can I come in?
          Hanging above the door, just over Sara's head: the shotgun.
          Possibilities whirling through her mind.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         JESSE (CONT'D)
          Ma'am?
          Silent decision, and she steps aside to let him enter.

          INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

          Joe slips in through the screen door, gun in hand. Freezes
          in the kitchen, listening.

          JESSE (O.S.)
          I'm a deputized police officer,
          we're looking for an escaped
          criminal, just doing a sweep. Seen
          anyone through here the past two
          days, vagrants?

          SARA (O.S.)
          No, vagrants are always passing but
          nobody near the house.
          Footsteps, as they walk deeper in the house. Joe can't tell
          if they're coming through the living room or hall. He
          hesitates.

          JESSE (O.S.)
          This man, here.

          SARA (O.S.)
          He's young. No.
          Then at the last moment Joe slips out the hallway door, as
          they enter from the living room.
          Sara leads Jesse in, holding a photograph of Joe. She pours
          him some water. Jesse hands her a second photograph.

                         JESSE
          We're looking for his father too,
          similar look and build but late
          50s. May or may not be travelling
          together.
          This one is a print-out from a security camera in the Bodega,
          of Old Joe holding a gun on the checkout clerk.
          Sara's eyes linger on Old Joe's photo, side by side with
          Joe's. Mind spinning. Maybe making the connection, we're
          not sure.

                         SARA
          No.
          She tries to hand the photos back but Jesse doesn't take
          them. He notices the toys on the table.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         JESSE
          Keep em. Kids with your husband?

                         SARA
          Yeah. Just one.

                         JESSE
          How old?

                         SARA
          Eight.
          Jesse pokes his head into the hallway, just missing Joe
          slipping through the hall and into the living room.
          He lifts his glass, drinks.

                         JESSE
          Thank you.

                         SARA
          I'll show you round the grounds,
          then the house, then you can be on
          your way.
          Sara holds the screen door open for him.

                         JESSE
          We'll start with the house.
          Jesse strolls into the living room, and we follow him.

          INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM

          He sits on a couch, taps on a small folding phone. Sara
          follows him.

                         JESSE
          Eight, you said? Boy? And your
          husband. Just gotta, check in.
          With the home office. This goddamn
          thing.

                         SARA
          This man dangerous?

                         JESSE
          Tween you me and a lamppost? No.
          Sweet kid. But he's wanted. My
          boss has half the city's looking
          for him. Half the city and me.
          So. And if you find him, there's a
          helluva price. Think on that if he
          comes by, acting sweet.
          Behind the couch, Joe crouches unseen. He looks up and sees
          Cid in the foyer, standing halfway down the stairs.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          If Jesse turned his head he would see Cid clear as day.
          Joe motions for Cid to get out. Cid points to Jesse, makes a
          GUN with his hand. Asking Joe.
          Joe shakes his head, sharply motions: get out! Cid silently
          creeps down the stairs.
          He is in full sight of the living room, but Jesse doesn't
          look up from his phone.
          Cid vanishes down the hall. Jesse looks up, stands.

                         JESSE (CONT'D)
          Alright, show me upstairs.
          The screen door in the kitchen creaks and bangs. Jesse looks
          sharply at Sara.

                         SARA
          Drafts, in the house.
          Jesse is already moving fast to the kitchen. The instant
          Jesse exits, Cid appears again in the hallway.
          Opens a small door under the stairway and beckons Joe.

          JESSE (O.S.)
          This door doesn't latch?

          SARA (O.S.)
          It used to, it's busted.
          Joe hesitates, then silently dashes over and in.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER

          Cid follows him in, down steep concrete stairs. Pulls the
          door closed behind them. It CREAKS. Jesse steps out into
          the hallway, gun drawn. Sara behind him.

                         JESSE
          Drafty house.

                         SARA
          Farm house.
          Jesse walks to the thin wooden door. Opens it. Closes it.
          CREAK. He looks at Sara.

                         JESSE
          What's down there?

                         SARA
          Laundry room. Door must've blown
          open.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          Jesse opens the door, then looks at Sara gravely.

                         JESSE
          Two things. First, I have a family
          of my own back in the city, and I
          want to see them again. Second if
          anything happens to me, and I don't
          report back to my boss people in
          fifteen minutes, they're gonna know
          I disappeared searching this house,
          and inside of another fifteen
          you'll have an army of more me's
          kicking down your door. Ok?

                         SARA
          It's a laundry room.
          Jesse motions - her first.

          INT. FARMHOUSE LAUNDRY ROOM

          Bare concrete basement, starkly lit by a hanging bulb. The
          only things in the basement are a small washer and dryer, and
          a large canvas hamper the size of a fridge.
          No windows. Nowhere else to go. Jesse levels his gun at the
          hamper.

                         JESSE
          You want to call out whoever's
          hiding in that hamper?

                         SARA
          If someone was hiding in the house,
          that's what I'd do. But nobody is
          in the house. Open it up.

                         JESSE
          No I think I'm gonna put a shot
          through it just to be safe.
          He raises his gat. Sara stiffens slightly.

                         JESSE (CONT'D)
          You wanna call him out?
          Sara stays silent. A long beat.
          Then Sara strides over, pulls the hamper open. Empty.
          She throws open the washer and dryer. She takes the bucket
          and shakes it upsidown, dumping out the water, shows him it's
          empty.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         SARA
          Now if you promise not to wag your
          gun at my shoe rack I'll show you
          upstairs then show you the fuck
          out.
          She storms up the stairs. A little cowed, Jesse holsters his
          gun and follows her.
          The water from the bucket flows in a small stream across the
          room, and into a drain hole under the hamper.

          INT. TUNNEL

          Dark and earthy. Cid leads Joe with his flashlight.

          EXT. BARN - LATE AFTERNOON

          Just outside the barn, a trap door covered with earth opens
          two inches. Joe and Cid prop it open, and peer out at the
          house.

          INT. CRAWL SPACE - CONTINUOUS

          A deep large hole capped with a wooden trap door. Joe
          squats, Cid stands.

                         CID
          My granddad built it, but he didn't
          tell anyone of us why. Nanna said
          cuz he was nuts.

                         JOE
          Thank you granddad.

                         CID
          That wasn't the man.

                         JOE
          No. I know him, that's what's
          funny. His name's Jesse. I like
          him. He'll go away when he doesn't
          find me, he won't hurt her.
          They watch in silence for awhile. In the distance, Jesse
          leaves the house alone and scopes the grounds before walking
          back towards the highway.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          My mom gave me up. I was younger
          than you. We were vagrants, and
          she was alone, for a long time I
          thought she was stupid for getting
          on the drug she was on, it was bad
          stuff, it probably ended up killing
          her.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          But now I see, she was so alone.
          And it was what she had. She sold
          me. To a panhandle gang.
          QUICKLY, SILENTLY WE SEE - FOUR YEAR OLD JOE dragged into
          darkness by rough men, screaming. Then we're back to the
          scene.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          But I got away. And I ran and I
          ended on a train, sitting in the
          dark in an empty freight, going to
          the city, and I saw myself over and
          over killing those men who bought
          me and who got my mom on what she
          was on. Finding them and tearing
          them apart. Saving my mom.

                         CID
          But you didn't.

                         JOE
          A man in the city found me, put a
          gun in my hand, and gave me some
          things. I didn't have my mom
          anymore. I had my work, my money.
          My plans. For my life. That's
          what I'd kill for. Not something I
          don't have, and can't ever get
          back.

                         (BEAT)
          There's just men figuring out what
          they'd do to keep what's theirs,
          what they got. That's the only
          kind of man there is.

                         CID
          I'm not gonna let Sara get killed.
          Joe looks at him. Wants to put his hand on his shoulder but
          doesn't.

                         JOE
          I think we're clear.
          He opens the trap door, climbs out.

          EXT. BARN

          Joe reaches down to help Cid out. Looking down at Cid in a
          hole with a trap door. Like Seth.
          He grabs Cid's hand and lifts him out.
          Sara comes out, sees Cid and her face breaks with relief.
          Cid runs to her, and in the distance they embrace.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.
          Sara and Joe share a look. Joe quickly turns his eyes back
          to the corn fields.

          INT. SECURITY MONITOR ROOM - EVENING

          A tiny, dark concrete room. Kid Blue watches a screen, his
          hand on a toggle wheel. A security cam view of Suzie's
          apartment building upper landing. Playback of last night.
          It scans quickly forward.
          The APARTMENT SUPER leans against the wall behind him,
          counting money.

                         KID BLUE
          All working girls, yeah?

                         SUPER
          Uh huh. This whole block. You
          wanna check those too, I can
          arrange.

                         KID BLUE
          I do.
          On the screen, Suzie comes home. Picks up her daughter from
          next door. Goes into 205. Kid Blue keeps scanning. And an
          instant later, Old Joe climbs the stairs. Kid Blue slows the
          playback.

          KID BLUE (CONT'D)
          âLo Joe.
          Old Joe goes up to the window, his back to the wall. Watches
          Suzie through the window for a long while. Kid watches him
          intently.
          Then very suddenly, without going inside, Old Joe leaves.
          Down the stairs, shoving his gun in his jacket.

                         SUPER
          I'm an arranger, stranger. Huhuha.
          But you don't see what you wanna
          see, no refunds.
          Old Joe vanishes down the street in a swarm of pixels.

          EXT. CHEAP APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

          Kid Blue emerges from a passage, into the parking lot. Looks
          up at Suzie's apartment door. Then down the street. A few
          drops of rain fall.

          EXT. FRENCH CAR - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Driving on a highway along the beach. A few drops of rain on
          the windshield. Old Joe (late 40s) and his Wife in intense
          conversation, her hand on his.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

          OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)
          But I will.

          WIFE (IN FRENCH)
          You want to, I know that. But you
          won't.

          OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)
          I'd do anything for you.

          WIFE (IN FRENCH)
          You'd do. You'd kill for me, you'd
          take life for me. But I don't want
          that. You kill for what you love,
          but someone loves the person you
          kill, and it starts again. I don't
          want that. I can't love a killer.
          What would you give up for me?
          That's yours?

          OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)
          Anything.
          She smiles but does not believe him. Old Joe sees this. A
          moment, in thought.

          EXT. BEACH / HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

          The car screeches to a stop, and Old Joe runs to the sea.
          THROWS his gun in the ocean. Above the waters, the sun
          breaks the clouds. Rain falls.
          He runs back to her. Falls on her. Kissing her. He holds
          her face like the most precious thing in the world.

                         OLD JOE
          Anything.

          INT. CHURCH - EVENING

          Rain beats against stained glass. Old Joe kneeling in a pew.
          Fists clenched as if in prayer. He stands, stumbles out.

          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE SIDE ENTRANCE - EVENING

          Oddly quiet. Old Joe walks down the sidewalk towards the
          side entrance to the theater. Face uncovered. In plain
          sight. Not caring. Stops 30 feet shy of the entrance, at a
          street garbage can.
          He draws his gun and leans over to drop it into the can. He
          lets it dangle from his fingers above the trash can.
          His pocket watch, hanging open from its chain. The picture
          of his Wife inside. Spinning. His gun slowly slipping from
          his grasp.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.
          With each spin of the watch, the photo of his Wife appears
          cloudier. Blurred. Indistinct.
          Gun on the tips of his fingers, about to fall. Then the
          photo is nearly gone.

          OLD JOE'S EYES.

          INT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Old Joe staggering to his feet from a fight.
          We've seen this before, it's the IDENTICAL SCENE to the
          previous flashback.
          But when he sees his Wife for the first time, whisps of FOG
          grow, blotting out the scene. Deep in the fog are other
          backgrounds - a street, a house - and unfamiliar faces.
          Other eventualities, clouding this one as it becomes less
          likely Old Joe will meet his wife and have this memory.
          Erasing it.

          OLD JOE'S EYES.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Old Joe in bed with his wife. Baby crying outside. Her
          face. Then, whisps of FOG thickens, obscuring them.

          OLD JOE'S EYES.

          EXT. FRENCH BEACH - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          The thrown gun splashes in the sea, and Old Joe turns back to
          the beach. But where his Wife was in the previous memory,
          now there is the FOG.
          A wall of it, massive, reaching to the sky. Old Joe dwarfed
          against it. Caught between the roiling waves and this wall of
          nothingness falling towards him.

          OLD JOE'S EYES.
          The gun on his fingertips. About to fall. A moment of
          decision.

          INT. SARA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Sara lies in bed. Eyes wide open. Still and quiet in the
          dark. Her hand moves over her bare leg. Slides across the
          sheets. Finds the Frog Buzzer lying next to her.
          A moment of hesitation. Then she pushes it.
          Silence. Her eyes go to the window. A long beat. Then
          sound: a door opening in the house below.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.
          Quick footsteps approaching. Her eyes follow them. The door
          flies open. Joe, gun in hand, buzzer in the other. His eyes
          adjust to the dark.

                         JOE
          What?
          Closes the door, kisses him. The adrenaline in his head
          doesn't know where to go.

                         SARA
          Don't wake Cid.
          She pulls him to the bed, lifting his shirt off. The rain
          starts to fall against the windows.

                         LATER
          Lying beside each other. Joe still stunned.
          Sara smokes a real cigarette, taking a deep joyful drag. She
          sets the lighter on her palm. It floats about a foot in the
          air, spinning, then drops.

                         JOE
          That's pretty good.

                         SARA
          In the city, young guys would hit
          on me by floating fucking quarters,
          I wouldn't tell âem I was TK but
          I'd keep their quarters down. One
          guy busted a blood vessel in his
          eye trying to get it up.

                         (BEAT)
          He's you. Your loop. You lied to
          me.
          She doesn't seem angry but deeply curious. Joe sits up.

          SARA (CONT'D)
          But you protected Cid. And I know
          you're not lying that you're gonna
          kill this guy, your own self. Even
          though he's protecting your future.

                         JOE
          He's protecting his future. Not
          mine.
          A beat.

                         SARA
          When I came back, after my sister
          died. Cid was sitting on the
          porch, I remember seeing him for
          the first time, in two years.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Saw him on the porch. I drove up
          crying and I had been at a party in
          the city when I got the call, I was
          wearing this ridiculous party
          dress. All my ridiculous shit. I
          don't know if he remembered me, but
          he looked at me. I abandoned him.
          I abandoned my baby.

                         (BEAT)
          Maybe I can't be a mother to him,
          is that something I can't get back.
          When he looked at me then, on the
          porch, he was mine again, he was my
          son. I seen so many men in the
          city, who I look in their eyes and
          they're lost. Whether he loves me
          back or not I'm gonna love my son I
          said. And he's never gonna get
          lost.
          Joe sitting up still, Sara lying beside him, maybe crying.
          He touches her hair.

          INT. APARTMENT 205 - EARLY MORNING

          A DOOR FRAME - kicked open with all the violence in the
          world. Old Joe sweeps into the small apartment, gun drawn.
          Suzie cooking in a robe, opens her mouth to scream.

                         OLD JOE
          Don't. Don't wake up your
          daughter.
          Old Joe trains the gun on her. She goes silent.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          Sit down.
          At the kitchen table. Quivering, she does. He keeps the gun
          on her.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          Do you know me?

                         SUZIE
          No. I don't know you. Who are
          you?

                         OLD JOE
          I need to tell you why I'm doing
          this. I gotta say it out loud to
          someone so I know.

                         SUZIE
          Why you're doing what?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

          INT. SARA'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

          Joe sleeping alone in the bed. Sara's voice, distant.

          SARA (O.S.)
          Joe. Joe.
          He wakes. She is calling him from downstairs.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER

          Joe comes down the stairs half dressed.
          Jesse holds Sara at gunpoint in the living room. Staring at
          Joe with a cool lack of malice.

                         JESSE
          Lo' Joe.

                         JOE
          Jesse.

          INT. APARTMENT 205


                         OLD JOE
          I threw my gun away once. To get
          her love. And I was going to do it
          again, now. Because I know she'd
          want me to. I was going to do it.
          And I saw then, I saw her
          vanishing, like how life probably
          goes when you die. That's what she
          was asking me to give up this time.

                         SUZIE
          ...who are you?

                         OLD JOE
          And if I picked up the gun. If I
          made this sacrifice. Life, my
          life. Absolution. Given back to
          me. My love. Given back, just
          like we were, and she wouldn't know
          what I did to get it back.

          INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM

          Joe steps into the living room, stands facing them.

                         JOE
          I'm unarmed Jesse, you can let her
          go. Sara, Jesse here's the best
          shot with a gat I've ever seen,
          when he lets you go you sit on the
          couch and don't do anything stupid.
          Jesse lets Sara go and trains the gat on Joe.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          He's coming here Jess. My Looper,
          is gonna come here.

                         JESSE
          I gotta take you in man.

                         JOE
          I got eighty large in pure gold, I
          take my looper back in and get
          right with Abe, whatever he gives
          me back I'll split it with you.

                         JESSE
          Was that your plan?

                         JOE
          Ok. It's yours, all of it

                         JESSE
          Are you delusional?

          INT. APARTMENT 205


                         OLD JOE
          Everything set right. Everything
          fixed. Through this sacrifice.

                         SUZIE
          What are you gonna do?
          Old Joe stands, walks towards the back hall. Suzie screams

                         SUZIE (CONT'D)
          No!
          And runs at him but he shoves her back hard.

          INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM


                         JESSE
          I know you got no options you take
          the one you got but Joe, you aint
          gettin right with no one. Looper
          or no, you're beyond saving. As
          long as Abe's got one Gat Man
          standing, he'll be hunting you till
          his dying day.
          Joe's face falling.

          INT. APARTMENT 205

          Old Joe, gun ready, down the darkened hallway towards the
          door at the end with a rainbow on it. He puts his hand on
          the knob.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

          INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM


                         JESSE
          We're going now. We're gonna go to
          my truck, you're gonna
          CREAK. Cid on the stairs, sleepy eyed. Jesse, purely on
          instinct, spins and draws on Cid.
          Cid's POV - Jesse's gun, snapping like a snake, barrel
          leveled at him. Cid makes a strange shouting noise, falls
          back.
          Everything slows down.

          INT. APARTMENT 205

          Old Joe pushes the door open. Blackness within.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM

          The room darkens. As if the sun passed behind a cloud.
          Jesse realizes it's a kid. Lowers his gun. But Cid is mid-
          scream, falling back, his foot misses the step and he tumbles
          down the stairs.
          Confused, terrified, falling. Joe runs into the foyer, to
          catch Cid. Sara runs behind him.
          The room is very dark now. Knick-knacks around the room
          rattle, then LIFT INTO THE AIR. All of them. Floating.
          Spinning. Sara's LIGHTER, on the coffee table: it RISES
          into the air.

          INT. APARTMENT 205

          Old Joe readies his gun, staring into the blackness. But his
          eyes lower. He touches his temple. Remembering.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM (OLD JOE'S MEMORIES)

          Fog clears - Joe is almost to Cid, who is still tumbling,
          nearly at the bottom of the stairs.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM (NORMAL)

          But just before he reaches him, Sara shoves Joe from behind.
          Shoving him TOWARDS THE FRONT DOOR. He's confused but her
          face is set.
          Cid hits the hardwood floor of the foyer, face contorted with
          rage now, hand raised to Jesse, palm outstretched.
          Screaming. His scream louder than it should be.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          Bigger things in the living room RISE OFF THE GROUND.
          Chairs. The couch. And Jesse. He rises five feet in the
          air, terrified.
          Sara pulls Joe through the front door, and he looks back and
          sees Jesse suspended in the air and Cid on the ground
          screaming like an animal, and just as they cross the
          threshold, Jesse explodes in a bright red fan of blood.

          INT. APARTMENT 205

          Old Joe's face. Remembering.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER (OLD JOE MEMORY)

          Frozen in a tableau - Cid screaming, raw power. Jesse
          EXPLODING. A bright red fan.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH

          Joe and Sara fall out and down the stairs.
          The front door and windows EXPLODE in a burst of splinters
          and glass.

          INT. APARTMENT 205

          Old Joe's eyes lift. Realizing.

                         OLD JOE
          The Rainmaker.
          A bare bulb hanging from the ceiling turns on.
          A six year old girl's room. But the only person in it is Kid
          Blue. He shoots Old Joe with a blue tazer.
          Old Joe hits the ground, mouth foaming, paralyzed. Knowing
          the answer now, knowing the who and the how but helpless and
          defeated.
          Kid Blue kicks him in the face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CID

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          A Gat Man circles a spot on the map in red ink, Sara's farm.

                         GAT MAN 1
          He's there. Lost his signal five
          minutes ago, right after he sent
          word he had him. Joe.
          Abe slumps in a chair, taking oxygen from a tank.

                         ABE
          Call everyone, every Gat Man in the
          city, call âem here. Gather em all
          up here first. No mistakes this
          time. We're gonna take an army to
          that farm, all at once, and sweep
          it like hellfire. Now.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING

          From a high vantage point. Cars, bikes, Gat Men on foot, all
          heading towards the club. An army, all meeting at the Belle
          Aurore. Massing to attack.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN - MORNING

          Moments after the blast. Joe and Sara lie in the dirt.
          Jesse's TRUCK parked nearby.
          Joe stirs first. Stands shakily. The front door jam is
          splintered. Windows broken. He goes inside. Sara gets up,
          staggers in after him.

                         SARA
          Cid! Cid!

          JOE (O.S.)
          Cid!

          EXT. BACK OF FARMHOUSE

          Joe bursts out of the screen door, holding his Blunderbuss
          and wiping off Jesse's gat.
          Bloody Cid-sized footprints lead out the screen door and
          streak across the lawn, into the corn.
          Sara comes out after Joe, sees him heading for the corn.

                         SARA
          What are you doing with those guns?
          What are you going to do?
          She lunges for him, wild. Wrenches his arm and he spins,
          throwing her to the ground.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         JOE
          How did your sister die?
          Sara holds his gaze. Then everything breaks inside her and
          she collapses in sobs. Heaving.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          That happened to her. Cid.

                         (BEAT)
          Jesus. Jesus he killed her
          This breaks Sara out of her sobs

                         SARA
          No! No he was climbing a
          bookshelf, it fell back on him. He
          has no control, he gets scared, it
          explodes.

                         JOE
          What is it a TK mutation?

                         SARA
          Joe someday he'll learn to control
          it.

                         JOE
          Yeah I know he will. Imagine what
          he could do.

                         SARA
          If he did good with it! If he grew
          up good!

                         JOE
          He doesn't.
          Joe heads to the corn, Sara scampers after him but slips on
          the wet grass, and Joe hits the corn with a head start.

                         SARA
          You stay away from him! Cid! Cid!
          She runs into the corn.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - WITH SARA

          WITH SARA as she stumbles blindly through the tall stalks.

                         SARA
          Cid! Make a noise baby, call to
          me! Cid!
          WITH JOE through the corn, following traces of blood on the
          stalks.

          You stay away from Joe, you come to
          me! Cid!
          Tries cocking the GAT but it's broken. Tosses it, wields the
          Blunderbuss.

          INT. SMALL CROP CLEARING

          Joe emerges from the corn.
          Cid crouches at one end of the small clearing. He looks at
          Joe. Terrified. Half covered in blood. Hair matted over
          one eye.
          Joe looks back at him. Approaches him, gun not raised, but
          in hand. Cid, like a frightened animal. A long moment.
          And just like that, Joe puts his hand on Cid's head. Cid
          leans against his legs, crying.
          Sara bursts into the clearing, sees this. Runs to Cid and
          embraces him, wiping the blood from his face. Joe steps back.

                         JOE
          Right now two things have happened.
          My looper knows Cid's the kid he's
          looking for, and my gang knows I'm
          here. So in fifteen minutes one or
          both is coming down that highway.
          You pack up the Gat Man's truck,
          whatever you can fit in ten
          minutes, and you drive North away
          from the city.

                         SARA
          Where are you going?
          Joe takes the Frog Buzzer from his pocket, presses it.
          Sara's buzzes in her pocket.

                         JOE
          One buzz means come and get me.
          Two or nothing, don't.
          He vanishes into the stalks, towards the highway.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Crowded with Gat Men, all preparing.

                         GAT MAN 1
          We got everyone here. All our men.

                         ABE
          Arm âem up, let's go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          BUZZZZ. Abe turns, annoyed, and sees the security monitor.
          On the screen - Kid Blue rips the sack off and holds Old
          Joe's bloodied face up to the camera.

          KID BLUE (ON SPEAKER)
          I got him Abe. I got him.

                         ABE
          Well. Shhhhhit.

          INT. COAT CHECK

          The door buzzes open. Kid pushes Old Joe through the long
          entrance hallway, past a dozen Gat Men, who watch him with
          shocked amazement.
          Old Joe's hands bound back. Kid Blue glows. He comes to the
          tiny coat check room, and Big Craig stops him, then sees Old
          Joe.

                         BIG CRAIG
          Hoh. So both we got?

                         KID BLUE
          Just the Looper. I got him. Knew
          he went for whores, so I checked
          every building.

                         BIG CRAIG
          They found Joe too though, in a
          farm on the east side. That's why
          all the Gats are here, the whole
          crew's arming up to make a sweep.

                         KID BLUE
          Joe fuck Joe, save your bullets I
          got the Looper. Not such a fuck up
          huh? I'm taking him up to
          This happens very fast:
          Old Joe uses his legs to kick himself off the wall and back
          into Kid Blue, SLAMMING him against the opposite wall.
          Old Joe grabs (behind his back) Kid Blue's gun, and blasts
          one shot through the chains binding his wrists and into the
          Kid's midsection.
          He whips the gun from behind his back and shoots Big Craig in
          the face. Then blasts the Gat Men in the entrance hallway
          while he reaches into the coat check and pulls an automatic
          rifle.
          He blasts like hell into the hallway. A few shots return but
          mostly the men are trapped. Then it's over. All is smoky
          still for a moment.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.
          Old Joe stares at the exit door ajar, down the long hallway
          jammed with bodies. Then at the passage that leads deeper
          into the club.
          A Gat Man runs in, and Old Joe shoots him down.
          He steps into the coat check and loads his pockets with guns
          and grenades. Then launches himself into passageway towards
          the club.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          Old Joe weaves his way through the backstage area, chucking
          grenades in front of him, then unloading his automatic rifle
          into the smoky aftermath.
          And with a mixture of dumb luck and skill from years of being
          gangland muscle takes out Gat Man after Gat Man.
          The corridors are tight, twisty. Old Joe uses that.
          Throwing grenades. Blasting away. Purging. Killing
          everyone he lays eyes on. Wiping them out. All the bad guys.
          It's horrible. Men maimed, bleeding and crying, dying the way
          people actually die from gunshots. Old Joe forges on, deeper.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Empty. Old Joe kicks the door open. Takes it in, the
          office. Hammer on the desk. He reloads a gun. Eyes find
          the door to Abe's inner den.

          INT. ABE'S DEN

          Abe and two Gat Men, guns out, crouched behind the table.
          Watching the door. A display screen shows Old Joe on the
          other side.
          Abe, eyes dull. Shouts at the door

                         ABE
          Joe. Guess I put the gun in that
          kid's hand, huh Joe. Guess
          everything comes back around. Like
          your goddamn ties.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Old Joe. Breathing hard. Reloaded. Closes the gun.

          EXT. HIGHWAY

          Joe breaks out of the corn, panting. He steps out into the
          middle of the highway.
          Storm clouds on the horizon. He cleans and readies his
          Blunderbuss.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

          INT. COAT CHECK - LATER

          Kid Blue's eyes flutter open. He lifts himself painfully.
          Checks his chest. Most of the shot caught his shoulder, his
          chest is grazed.
          The Gat Men in the hall. Big Craig. All dead.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          Kid Blue wanders the smoky halls. Dead and dying men.

          INT. ABE'S DEN

          Abe, shot once in the head, twice in the chest. Kid Blue
          stands over them. Stunned. Tears well in his eyes.
          Then on the wall, he sees the map. The farm circled in red.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN - MORNING

          Clothes and boxes piled in the back of Jesse's truck. Sara
          loads one last bundle. Calls to Cid, in the front seat.

                         SARA
          Ok baby, we're going.

          EXT. HIGHWAY

          Joe waits. Then, a CLOUD OF DUST on the distant highway. He
          tenses. The cloud gets closer. It is a truck. An armored
          truck.
          Joe squints. It's the ARMORED TRUCK that Kid Blue loaded his
          gold bricks into. The front windshield blown in.
          The truck stops fifty feet away, and Old Joe steps out. He
          throws a gold bar, which lands in the dusty highway between
          them.

                         OLD JOE
          Bon jour. You take this truck, you
          take your money, and you go live
          your life. No one's coming after
          you. I fixed it.

                         JOE
          And you go kill the boy. That's
          how you fix it.

                         OLD JOE
          That's how. You got your life
          back, you better think right now
          about what that's worth to you.

                         JOE
          My life? Your life. Becoming you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.
          Joe raises his Blunderbuss and FIRES. Too far away, the shot
          scatters. The old man flinches, backs away.
          Joe walks forward towards Old Joe, stepping over the gold.

                         OLD JOE
          Stupid little shit! You let him
          live, he's gonna take away
          everything that's yours, everything
          that's mine! You seen what the
          boy's gonna become.

                         JOE
          I haven't seen that yet.
          Joe fires again, close enough now to draw blood off Old Joe's
          chest and knock him back.
          Out of nowhere a SLAT BIKE careens around the van, which has
          until now blocked our line of sight down the highway.
          Kid Blue.
          The bike clips Joe's leg, sending him spinning violently to
          the dusty pavement.
          The bike shoots off down the highway, a cloud of dust in its
          wake. It takes a hundred yards for the Kid to pull it to a
          stop and spin it around.
          Joe is hurt bad. He grapples for his blunderbuss.
          Kid Blue guns the engine, gat in hand. Levels it, steady as
          a rock.
          Joe shoots at the Kid, but he's out of range, the gun fires
          scattershot.
          Kid Blue fires, a bullet hits dangerously close to Joe.
          Panicked, Joe begins firing at the pavement around him, round
          after fiery round.
          Kicking up dust. Lots of dust. Raising a cloud.
          KID BLUE'S POV - zooming towards Joe, now obscured in a cloud
          of dust and smoke. He fires his gat into the cloud, tries to
          slow the bike but can't in time.
          In the dust cloud Joe hears the bike roaring down upon him.
          He covers up and when he feels the bike roaring past blindly
          FIRES his buss.
          A moment later the bike emerges from the dust cloud. Without
          a driver. It skids, crashes.
          When the dust clears away Joe lies still, arms over his head.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.
          Besides him, the broken remains of Kid Blue.
          Painfully, Joe raises himself. Then realizes:
          Old Joe is gone.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN

          Sara starts the truck up.

                         SARA
          Here we go. Give it a wave
          goodbye.

          EXT. DIRT ROAD

          They roll down the dirt road that leads to the highway.
          At the far end of it, at a distance but walking towards them,
          is the dark figure of Old Joe. Gun in hand.
          Sara hesitates a minute, then guns it. Straight for him.

                         CID

                         STOP

                         SARA
          Duck down baby

                         CID
          Stop please he can shoot us

                         SARA
          Just stay down
          Half the distance closed, but he's still far off. A shot
          cracks the front grill, another cracks the windshield.

                         CID
          Stop!
          The truck lurches horribly, and flips straight back in a
          graceful arc, landing upsidown.
          Sara and Cid, dazed, hanging by their seatbelts.

                         SARA
          Are you ok?

                         CID
          I'm sorry
          In the rear view mirror, Sara sees Old Joe getting closer.

                         SARA
          You're ok. C'mon baby we have to
          run now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.
          She unfastens them and they both climb out, and Old Joe stops
          suddenly, taking aim.
          Sara pulls Cid behind the flatbed for cover as two bullets
          glance off the overturned truck.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          We're going into the fields. I
          want you to run, I'll be right
          behind you, don't look back. Okay?
          Old Joe lowers his gun and runs towards them.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Go!
          They both sprint off the road.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          The wide bare field. Cid runs ahead towards the corn, Sara
          not far behind. The earth soft, their feet sink in, like a
          nightmare.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE

          Old Joe crosses the road and chases them onto the field,
          firing at them on the run.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          Bullets thunk in the earth. Sara stumbles, exhausted. Cid
          turns, about thirty feet ahead of her.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE

          Old Joe stops running and steadies his gun.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          A distant gunshot CRACK. A fan of crimson blood sprays from
          Cid's head. His neck twists and he crumples to the ground.

                         SARA

          NO!
          Sara is stopped in her tracks by an invisible force.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          No Cid no!
          The topsoil of the earth around them RISES in a fine dust.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE

          Old Joe reacts as the topsoil rises, an eerie moment.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          Sara struggles to reach Cid but is still about twenty feet
          behind him.
          Cid raises his head. The bullet grazed his jawline. Not
          severe but lots of blood.
          Cid's eyes locked hateful on Old Joe. Blood soaks his shirt.
          Far behind him, the barn splinters apart as if in a tornado.

                         SARA
          No!
          With a sudden jolt the field ripples out from Cid, like a
          stone thrown in a pond.
          Sara lifts into the air.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE

          Old Joe is hefted off the ground. His gun falls.

          EXT. CORN FIELDS - CONTINUOUS

          Joe struggling through the fields, limping, desperate.
          Something like a furious wind rushes through the stalks.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          Cid stands. Intense, eyes dark, in another place.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE

          Old Joe, suspended mid-air, realizes what's about to happen.
          He lifts his hand defensively and SCREAMS

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          Cid's face straining, about to scream.
          Cid's focus adjusts from Old Joe to Sara. She floats,
          reaching out to him. Frightened. Yelling something he can't
          hear but he can see her eyes.
          Cid's face breaks. He barely mouths the word

                         CID

                         MOM
          And everything FALLS. Sara, Old Joe, the earth. All comes
          crashing down.

          EXT. EDGE OF FIELD - CONTINUOUS

          The corn stalks shiver then are still.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.
          Joe breaks out of the stalks and onto the field. Gasping for
          breath. Gets his bearings. In the far distance across the
          field, Old Joe, Sara and Cid.
          Too far.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          Cid runs to Sara, who sits up slowly. They embrace.

                         SARA
          You did good, baby. You did so
          good. I love you.
          Behind them, Old Joe struggles to his feet. Sara kisses Cid.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Into the fields. Run now baby.
          Go.

                         CID

                         NO

                         SARA

                         GO NOW

                         CID
          No no mom no

                         SARA
          You go!
          She pushes him away and Cid runs. Then she turns. Standing
          her ground. Directly between Old Joe and Cid.
          Old Joe TRIPS in the mud, fumbles his gun. Sees Cid
          approaching the safety of the CORN STALKS. Blocked by Sara.

                         OLD JOE
          Move!

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE

          Still too far away, struggling as fast as he can, helpless as
          Old Joe closes in on Sara. He fires his buss at Old Joe, but
          is way out of range.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA

          Old Joe gets his gun, rises with it. Cid about to hit the
          stalks. Sara between them.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID

          Cid nears the corn fields, running. Seconds from safety.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          111.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA

          Old Joe. Gun raised. Pocket watch wrapped around it. His
          wife's picture in it. Clear as day.
          No time to move around Sara. Now or never.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE

          Joe running, useless gun in hand.

                         JOE
          No!

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA

          Sara, not going anywhere.

                         OLD JOE
          I'm sorry
          He pulls the trigger.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE

          Joe running. Time slows. Watching:

          EXT. FIELD - OLD JOE & SARA

          Everything is a little surreal. Dream-like. Slow.
          Old Joe shoots Sara.
          We hear no gunshot. Just the wind in the corn, and young
          Joe's breathing. She falls, giving him a clear shot at Cid.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE


                         JOE WATCHING:

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID

          Just as Old Joe gets him in his sights, Cid breaches the corn
          fields and is gone, vanishing in the stalks.
          Old Joe lowers his gun, stunned but still frantic. He
          stumbles towards the corn, still far off, his face breaking.
          Trips, falls in the mud. Corn field vast in front of him.
          Cid is gone. He lost him. He holds his pocket watch. Sobs.
          Lost.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE


                         JOE WATCHING:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

          EXT. CORN FIELDS

          On the horizon, a train.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE


                         JOE WATCHING:

          INT./EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN CAR

          Cid sits in a darkened car, holding a bloody rag to his jaw.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE

          Joe watching, seeing:

          INT./EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN CAR

          Cid's face. Bloody. Dirty. His eyes full of hate. The
          train rumbles towards the dark city.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE

          Joe watches. Sees, in his mind's eye, all of this.
          And through all of this we have only heard the wind. And Joe
          breathing.
          Time hanging, slowed nearly to a stop. A moment of decision.
          Joe turns his blunderbuss back on himself and FIRES.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA

          Revealing that all we saw was in Joe's head, and we are still
          in the moment where Old Joe is about to shoot Sara.
          But this time, just as he's pulling the trigger, a distant
          shot is heard.
          And Old Joe DISAPPEARS.
          Sara stands shell shocked just for a moment. Then she
          doesn't process any of it, she just turns and yells

                         SARA

          CID!

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID

          Cid stops just shy of the corn. Turns back to the field.
          There's his mom, Sara, unharmed and smiling. The bad man is
          gone. The field is empty.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.

          EXT. FIELD - SEEN FROM JOE'S POV

          We don't see Joe, but far across the field Cid runs to his
          mom, into her arms. Sara lifts him, holds him.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          She carries him. Walking fast back towards a far distant
          figure lying still on the edge of the field. Joe.
          Then a faint buzz. The flasher, in her pocket. She pulls it
          out. Two flashes.
          She slows. Stops. Looking at him, far away. Two flashes.

                         CID
          Where's Joe?

                         SARA
          He had to go away, baby.

                         CID
          He took the bad man with him?
          She kisses him.

          EXT. FIELD - FROM JOE'S POV

          In the distance, Sara turns away and carries Cid back towards
          the farmhouse.

          INT. CID'S BATHROOM

          Sara bathes Cid, dresses the wound on his jaw.

          INT. CID'S BEDROOM

          She tucks Cid in, holds him close. Kisses his forehead.

          EXT. FARM HOUSE PORCH - LATE AFTERNOON

          Sara emerges from the ruined front door, crosses the porch.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN

          Sara crosses the lawn, and walks across the field.

          EXT. EDGE OF CORN FIELDS

          Joe's body. Sara goes to him, slowly. She kneels beside him.
          His pocket watch in the dirt. Open. No photo inside.
          Ticking away. Around and around.
          She closes it.Touches his hair. The wind through the corn.
          After a long while, the sun breaks through the clouds.
